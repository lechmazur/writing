  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.1)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse is vividly rendered with cracked glass, fractured beams, and evolving humidity gradients that shape Mara's observations. The dust vial is placed deliberately in sunlight, and the widening cracks provide fresh air—concrete environmental details that constrain choices. The setting functions as a microcosm that charges the final image of Mara stepping back, feeling "the tiny pulse of change beneath her boots."

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.7)
    Canyon, kiln, frost patterns, and charcoal mine are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("glassy hush," "basalt floor," "black snow"). The frost patterns constrain Elya's path and the luminous shards charge the final image, satisfying the micro-setting test. However, the setting often serves as backdrop rather than active pressure; the canyon's "walls rose like glass towers" and similar descriptors lean decorative rather than choice-shaping in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.9)
    The winterglass conservatory is vivid and its humming panes, frost breath, and glass walls supply sensory texture throughout. The tuning fork case and the copper-filament device function as micro-setting objects that constrain Mara's ritual and charge the final image when the fork's tone resonates through glass. Spatial choreography is clean (bench, case, device hovering, glass walls), though the "rose veins" on glass and the visitors at the threshold remain postcard details rather than resources that alter Mara's choices in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.4)
    The submerged library supplies vivid sensory anchors (water pressure, phosphorescent ink, marble tablets, bioluminescent fish) and the lens cradle on a floating pedestal constrains Marlow's placement choices. Spatial choreography remains coherent across moves. However, the setting never forces a trade-off or alters tactics at closure; Marlow's final vanishing is atmospheric rather than setting-driven, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.1)
    The terra-cotta arbor and ridge anchor the setting early and recur at key beats (dawn gathering, midnight bell-ringing, elder meeting). However, spatial choreography is vague—volunteers "disappear into the darkness" and "emerge again" without clear paths, distances, or tactical constraints tied to terrain. The arbor and hollow function as symbolic markers rather than micro-settings that alter choice or supply resources under pressure. The sanctions period remains abstract (no border patrol sightings, no blocked roads, no concrete scarcity forcing a tradeoff). Sensory detail defaults to generic visuals ("amber light," "faint moonlight") without POV-specific filtering or pressure-driven selection.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.1)
    The viaduct, night jasmine, cracked tile, and camera obscura provide vivid anchors with selective sensory detail (violet mist, silver pollen, luminous tunnel). The lens and tear function as micro-setting objects that constrain Milo's method and charge the final image. However, spatial choreography remains abstract—how Milo moves from the far end to the balcony, where the tunnel entrance sits relative to the arches—and the environment does not visibly alter his tactics or impose cost.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.1)
    The living bridge, hyperbolic corridors, and halo fragment are vividly described with sensory specificity (luminescence, mist, scent of rain-kissed earth). Spatial choreography is coherent across the maze's construction. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop: no environmental detail constrains a choice or charges the final image—Mara moves through the space without obstacles, resource shortages, or forced adaptations. The "quaking reverie" remains atmospheric decoration rather than a pressure that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.7)
    The abandoned carnival is vividly rendered ("rusted cathedral," phosphorescent fungi), and the piano bench functions as a micro-setting puzzle that gates progression. Sensory detail is selective and apt, supporting the tone without overwhelming. The setting does constrain one major choice (decode the keys or fail), lifting it above postcard description, but thereafter the environment facilitates rather than complicates—Mara encounters no locked doors, rival scavengers, or environmental hazards that would test her choices further.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.1)
    The sunken orchard and ashen forge are described lyrically but never constrain a choice or enable a tactic. Spatial choreography is vague—where exactly is the forge, how does Mara move between aisles and roots, what distances matter? The setting functions as backdrop; removing it would not alter Mara's sequence of actions. The final image ("soft green of sunrise through the water") offers atmospheric detail but does not charge the ending with pressure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.1)
    Setting shifts—emerald station, grand hall, hidden tunnels, jade door, library—are named but not grounded in spatial choreography or sensory anchors filtered through POV. Moonbeams and flower arrangements function as magical props without physical constraints. The station does not pressure Lira's choices; she moves unimpeded, suggesting postcard description over lived-in micro-setting. No recurring object or environmental detail constrains a choice or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.1)
    The control room, furnace, and glass vessels are evoked with sensory specificity (meltwater pooling, sunrise sliver, kaleidoscope glow) and anchor the POV. The cracked bookmark and glass sphere constrain symbolic choices and charge the final image through reprise. Spatial choreography is clear (rod, tray, table, panels). However, the room functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental feature narrows a tactical option or complicates a beat under pressure, limiting score above mid-6s despite vivid description.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.1)
    The rusted library, cracked dome, and constellations provide vivid visual detail but function as backdrop rather than constraint. Spatial choreography (central aisle, third shelf, lever) is legible. The seashell and cast are handled, yet neither environment nor object meaningfully narrows Mara's options or charges the final image—she succeeds without spatial friction. Sensory hierarchy remains generic rather than POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ridge fort, storm, and gold-leaf booklet are vivid and sensory ("rain-kissed iron," "stone groaning"), establishing mood effectively. The booklet constrains one choice (lifting it to read symbols), satisfying the micro-setting test for modest credit. Spatial choreography is coherent within the single location, though the turret placement at the end feels decorative rather than tactical. Sensory details remain atmospheric without filtering through urgent POV priorities; description dominates over purposeful constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.4)
    The frozen courtyard at twilight is vividly rendered with concrete details (frost on chrome, pale shards of light, slick stone) and recurs as a constraint in the ending (sweeping ice, creeping cold). Sensory specificity is strong early but dilutes into abstraction during the violin experiment ("faint aurora of data"). The courtyard's chill returns at closure to ground the robot's continuing work, which qualifies as micro-setting participation in the final image and charges the resolution with spatial texture.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.1)
    The forecourt is vividly described with rain, puddles, and phosphorescent ink, and the lens device is handled across multiple beats. Spatial choreography is coherent (forecourt → fountain → theater backstage → forecourt). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it serves as a backdrop for Mara's mechanical progression. The final image—light on stones—charges atmosphere but does not shape the protagonist's decision or options, keeping the score in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.1)
    The garden maze supplies vivid images ("vines curling like whispered promises," "bark mottled like parchment") and the marbles function as tactile objects handled across beats. However, spatial choreography remains vague—alcoves, hedges, pathways, oak, and fountain appear without legible distances or navigation logic. The "blooming withering" motif recurs but does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; it ornaments rather than pressures. At this length, the setting needed to force at least one trade-off (access vs. risk, time vs. thoroughness) to lift the score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.1)
    The xenobiology station, turbines, aviary, and holographic lattice provide vivid sensory anchors and are woven into action. The lever and magnetic nexus supply tactile detail ("etched with ancient glyphs that pulsed") and the "icy warmth" paradox recurs as atmospheric texture. However, setting details remain largely ornamental—no environmental constraint pressures Lira's choices or alters tactics. The lever is accessed without obstacle, and the station's systems cooperate frictionlessly, preventing the environment from charging the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    The flooded opera house, leaking roof, water-etched staff lines, and lanterns are vividly rendered and spatially coherent. Water actively constrains the environment and produces the code images that drive the plot. The setting charges the final image (lanterns steady, river recedes, arches reflecting light). Sensory selection is atmospheric but leans heavily on visual; other senses are underused. Micro-setting (water on floor, antique program) functions as setting and enables the central discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mountain weather station supplies concrete sensory anchors (rusted panels, humming console, amber lights, old heater's hiss, antennae swaying) that recur and frame the scene. The illustration's ink bleeding on cold glass is a micro-setting detail that enables the discovery moment. The setting does not constrain a choice under pressure, but it charges the final image when Mirela steps onto the deck and the wind lifts the paper edges. Spatial choreography is clean (console, deck, mountain beyond), and the auroral sky returns at closure to weight the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.1)
    The tunnel is evoked through mood and metaphor but rarely constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. Spatial choreography (alcove, conveyor, tracks) remains vague; the beaded wheel's physical state and Mara's handling are never dramatized. The setting functions as backdrop rather than tactical pressure, and the final emergence into predawn light adds no cost or closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    Vivid, purposeful sensory detail throughout: "phosphorescent thread," "damp parchment and earth," "obsidian refuge…glinting like a moonlit eye." Setting elements (library, catacombs, river) constrain the keeper's path and the origami acts as micro-setting compass. The overgrown vines and narrowing fissure pressure the descent spatially. However, the obsidian refuge itself remains a static symbolic backdrop rather than an object that mechanically alters a choice at closure, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sage Ridge, the ancient oaks, and the eclipse twilight are vividly rendered with multi-sensory detail (dimming light, silver ring, humming roots). The locket and harp function as micro-setting objects, but neither constrains a choice; the locket rests near her pulse, the harp adapts to breathing, both ornamental rather than tactical. The final image of Liora on the ridge reuses the locale but does not charge it with new pressure or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.2)
    Orientation debt applied in Q2 caps this category at 7.0. The silo's vaulted chamber, glyphs, and tapestry fragment are vivid and purposeful, constraining the historian's descent and shaping his final placement of the fragment. Sensory detail (soot, dust, metallic taste, bronze lamplight) is consistent and filtered through the POV. However, spatial choreography in the library level remains vague—shelf layout, fire pit proximity, and stairwell access are not clearly mapped—preventing the micro-setting from fully driving a choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.4)
    The lighthouse setting supplies vivid anchors (lanterned stone, rattling glass, copper telegraph coils, spiral staircase, rusted chest) and the beam's sweep creates a recurring visual motif. However, spatial choreography wobbles: the protagonist moves between desk, steaming tray, lantern lenses, and basement telegraph without clear transitions, and the visitor's arrival and cracking of the cookie occur with no setup of his physical presence or path. The lighthouse constrains nothing—microdot work could occur anywhere—and the final image (gull clutching cookie scrap) feels ornamental rather than a micro-setting that alters tactics. Economy is adequate but the setting remains postcard backdrop rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.8)
    The cathedral, dimensional anchor, loop pedal, and indigo palette provide vivid sensory anchors (vaulted arches, muted reverence, indigo spill like ink). Spatial choreography remains coherent within the single location, and the loop pedal and palette function as micro-setting objects. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice or materially alter tactics—the priest's ritual proceeds without environmental friction. The setting decorates the mood but does not pressure the protagonist's stance at closure, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, and mirrored horizon are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (mist curling, frost-etched glass, ice singing chords), and the environment actively participates in the final beat when the lake becomes a "membrane of vibrating chords." The nautilus segment, ledge, and glass all constrain Lian's ritual actions, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean, and the setting is filtered through Lian's perceptual priorities (memory of childhood shoreline, gulls over glass sea). Economy is solid; no extraneous world-building clutters momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.1)
    The viaduct is described lyrically but never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome; it functions as postcard backdrop. Spatial choreography is minimal—he steps, he falls upward—without tactile engagement. The setting does not evolve causally with events or shape the final image beyond ambient glow.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cavern is vivid and sensory ("throat of stone," "thick, damp air," "petrified drum skin"), and the broken needle anchors tactile presence. The turntable and wax shells constrain Marin's method, shaping how she engages silence. However, spatial choreography is thin—Marin moves from entry to turntable without intervening geography—and the cavern's details recur mostly as atmosphere rather than complicating her choices. The body and tool (needle, palm on stone) do charge the final image, qualifying for the 9+ gate, but the setting itself remains a backdrop more than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    The courtyard, fountain, hidden shaft, and wrought-iron balcony are anchored early and the shaft becomes a key resource in the closure beat. Sensory detail is vivid but spreads across multiple senses without strict POV filter—storm recorder priorities do not distinctly shape what Elara notices. The environment constrains the final choice (no human courier can cross), lifting the score, but spatial choreography of the pigeon's origin and the tube's mechanics remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.8)
    The grotto is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (terra-cotta, amber veins, mineral glaze, electric scent) and the rope's physical handling across multiple beats supplies tactile grounding. However, the setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics—the poet moves freely through forks and tunnels without spatial friction. The environment functions as backdrop rather than pressure, preventing entry to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.8)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse and shipwrecks anchor the opening with vivid, purpose-driven detail (glass walls flickering, timbers resonating, waterlogged floorboards). Sensory selection is strong in early beats (ash, copper glow, damp earth vibrations). However, spatial choreography weakens in the bonfire sequence: the bowl moves from "fire's edge" to unspecified positions without tracking, and the violinist's physical relationship to the orchard vines at closure lacks clear staging. The micro-setting (bowl, strings, vines) appears but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it decorates rather than pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.1)
    The amber grotto is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (walls "humming with a low, resonant static that seemed to taste of old rain," "vortex of colors"). The setting provides a resource—the stone's static charge—that Mara uses in her method, thus constraining her approach. The final image reprises the grotto's whisper of static, charging the ending slightly. However, the grotto does not force a difficult choice or complicate her harvest; it remains a cooperative backdrop rather than a pressure that alters tactics under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.1)
    The library, pier, and lighthouse are anchored early and sensory detail is present (brine, old paper, starlight). However, the setting functions as postcard backdrop rather than constraint—no environmental factor pressures Mara's choices or alters tactics. The locket photo is a recurring object but it sits passively; no spatial or tool-based element charges the final image. Micro-setting allowance does not apply because the object does not constrain a choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.1)
    The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are described vividly but function as backdrop rather than constraining choice. Spatial choreography is vague—villagers move "through the orchard" without clear positions or distances. The glyph on the stone pillar materializes without prior setup, and the phosphorescent moss appears once without causal role. The arbor's glass bark catches light and casts shadows, but these details remain ornamental; no environmental feature alters tactics or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.4)
    The rooftop canal system and lattice towers anchor locale early and supply vivid particulars (mirrored ribbons, star-like cascade). Spatial choreography is clean across skiff, arch, and cavern descent, and the pendant's glow/spiral provides micro-setting constraint at two beats (arch, cavern). However, the environment never pressures a choice: Mira encounters no locked gate, rival, or resource scarcity—only spectacle. The giant's nap remains metaphor without tactile consequence, and "veins of pure possibility" substitutes elevated register for grounded detail.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dripping stalactites, mosaic stepping stone, and woven-vine bridge supply vivid anchors that persist across beats and constrain the conjurer's ritual positioning. Sensory detail—"silver shadows," "amber fog," "soft chime"—is selective and atmosphere-driven, though it rarely filters through urgent perception or professional bias. The stone's cracks and the glass eyes' alignment create tactile staging for the central action, and the bridge sway provides a brief embodied moment midway. However, spatial choreography between orchard center, forest edge, and bridge remains impressionistic rather than clearly mapped, weakening navigation across the longer sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.1)
    The library's aisles, pipe chases, basement room, and copper conduits provide spatial anchors and guide Maren's path. "Sapphire hush" and flickering neon recur, though more as motif than constraint. The tape-reel spindle functions as micro-setting that enables the circuit closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement in principle, but the choice to place the coil is undramatic—no risk, access problem, or competing option—so the setting does not force a costly decision at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mossy trellis, droplets as prisms, copper coil, and mycelium filament supply vivid micro-setting that anchors action. The trellis and rain recur across beats and charge the final greenhouse image. Spatial choreography is clear: trellis → coil placement → leaf observation → greenhouse construction. The nursery environment enables Marlowe's method (release control via conduit) and the storm/rain cycle functions as a temporal pressure that shapes his window of observation, lifting the setting above postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal island, cracked basalt, mist-collection gutters, and algae-slick stones provide vivid, purposeful detail that constrains Mara's movement and grounds the post-war scarcity. The rain trail and shallow pool guide action rather than simply decorating. The brooch on the stone altar becomes a spatial anchor for the convergence beat. Sensory detail is selective and reflects urgency, particularly the "glint that pulsed like a heartbeat" and the water column that "illuminated the night like a lantern."

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.1)
    The crystal cave is vividly rendered with quartz, opal, and "overlapping shadows" that move like tides, and the musical resonance modulates across beats. However, setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Lira simply steps forward and the cave responds without friction. Spatial choreography (pedestal, arches, floor) is legible but static. The cave functions as backdrop rather than crucible; micro-setting test not met for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.7)
    The ivory harbor after rain, wooden piers, stone arches, and brass valve are vivid and selectively deployed. Sensory detail (glistened like shattered glass, salt-stained wool, distant clink of rigging) is purposeful and filtered through the archivist's perceptual priorities. The valve as micro-setting object recurs across beats and absorbs the gathered fragments, but it does not constrain a choice at closure—it merely accompanies the archivist on the sloop. Spatial choreography is coherent; the environment supports atmosphere without pressuring final options.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "starlit vault in mist" and "phantom ticket punch" are vivid and recur across beats, charging the final image when the punch is placed beside the ledger. Spatial choreography is coherent (street → doorway → staircase → cavern), and the constellations mirror her map, constraining the unlock mechanic. However, the vault's amber light and crystalline pedestal remain postcard description without altering tactics, and the "cracks in pavement" guide her without friction or resource cost. Sensory detail favors the visual; other senses appear formulaically ("cold mist," "iron door") without POV bias.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.1)
    The tower's "lattice of old wood and brass," "crystal panes," and "stone desk" ground the space. The magic square tile and the alcove carved weeks earlier anchor micro-setting. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image in a way that would lift the score above mid-band; the tower is vividly described but remains backdrop. The whales' migration supplies atmosphere but does not pressure Lira's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prismatic escondite and magnetic fields supply vivid, voice-consistent detail throughout. The amulet fragment constrains the immortal's choice to follow it, and the spatial reconfiguration shapes the journey. However, setting functions more as atmosphere than as a resource that directly alters tactics at closure; the final "serene vista" is outcome rather than constraint. Micro-setting (the fragment against throat, magnetic seam) charges mid-beats but not the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.4)
    The funeral home prep room is vividly anchored with sensory detail (lilies, stale incense, polished oak, mahogany table) and the ink pot is handled across multiple beats, charging the space with ritual pressure. The mourners' grief becomes a palpable medium—"dense fog," "tremor…in the soles of her feet"—that the protagonist must navigate, meeting the micro-setting standard. However, the room's physical layout and Mara's spatial position remain static; the environment colors the scene but does not constrain her choices or alter her tactics in a way that reshapes the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    The bonsai labyrinth and fluorescent lamp offer vivid, specific imagery and the setting anchors the reflective mood effectively. However, spatial choreography remains vague (stone paths, corridors, a hut, silver birch mentioned but never choreographed into clear proximity or constraint). The environment never constrains a choice or meaningfully alters tactics; it serves as backdrop for description rather than pressure. This caps the score below the 9+ gate despite strong atmospheric texture.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.1)
    The port containers, cracked vents, and rusted forklift anchor spatial detail early. Sensory selection leans heavily visual (glow, shadows, murals) with one tactile beat ("cold filament"). The label functions as a micro-object that filters perception, but beyond this filtering the environment does not constrain a single on-page choice—containers sway, tides turn, yet the narrator moves freely without spatial or material friction altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.1)
    The abandoned observatory, cliff, and cello are vividly described and recur across the piece. However, the setting does not constrain choice—Selene walks in, finds objects in convenient sequence, and leaves. The painted seashell and cello function as magic props rather than spatial or material constraints. Micro-setting credit: the seashell placed on cracked wood and the ledger behind the telescope do charge two moments, preventing a lower score.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.1)
    The raft city's perpetual carnival supplies vivid sensory anchors (flickering lights, creaking hulls, river mist, graffiti walls) filtered through a collective rather than Mira's occupational or emotional lens. Spatial choreography is loose—illustrators "spray coded silhouettes" and stalls "shift" without showing Mira navigating distances, handling tools, or choosing which artisan quarter alley to prioritize. The foundation chip's glass case at river's edge and the phoenix mural charge the ending image, lifting the score, but the carnival itself remains a postcard backdrop rather than a constraint that narrows Mira's tactical options during the reorganization beats.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.7)
    The moonlit basalt summit, tripod, insulated kit, and lens are rendered with concrete detail. The chemical vapor and darkening film strip provide micro-setting specificity that charges one beat (the shutter click). However, environment does not constrain a choice or complicate tactics; the inspector's actions proceed without friction from terrain, light, or tool limits. The dawn light paints atmosphere but remains postcard rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.2)
    The depot's mist, oil lamps, and steel girders are vividly rendered and filtered through Mara's auditory and tactile focus. The water basin and refracted light serve the repair method concretely. Spatial choreography (workbench, basin, rail tracks outside) remains clear. The setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image beyond providing atmosphere; it functions as backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and glass-with-condensation are vividly rendered and purposefully deployed. The transmitter's antenna alignment and the falcon's flight path constrain Mara's tactical choices, and the ice crack in the final beat charges the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and tied to action (lamplight, iron taste, ice crunch), though the broader geography of subterranean streams remains abstract. The micro-setting (glass, lamp, transmitter) functions as environment that shapes the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.8)
    The archway, plaza, and cobblestones anchor setting cleanly and recur with some purposeful color (gold light, silver lattice). The tuner's fork touches dust, but no environmental constraint visibly alters a choice or tactic; setting mostly supplies backdrop rather than friction. The final well and market stalls appear late without prior setup, functioning as thematic ornaments. Sensory specifics (pine, iron, rippling water) are vivid yet do not press against the protagonist's goals, keeping the piece in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.1)
    The underwater temple provides vivid anchors—kelp, basalt columns, stained glass, bioluminescent fish—and the vial's placement in the column triggers the hush. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the vial "slips from her hands" onto the altar yet later "glowed faintly in her satchel" without explanation. The temple's physicality does constrain one choice (placing the vial in the hollow), reaching the lower end of the essential band, but subsequent handling becomes inconsistent.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.1)
    Vivid atmospheric phrases ("copperlight repose," "jagged reef") anchor mood, but spatial choreography is unclear—how the boy moves from cell to chamber to reef lacks coherent blocking. The lattice and chest function as plot tokens rather than objects that constrain choice. The reef's "hidden fissures" appear only in exposition without shaping an on-page action or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.1)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse and winter-cracked fields are vivid in metaphor but never constrain a choice or supply a resource. Spatial choreography is unclear—she "drifts," "ghosts," "glides" without legible position or movement. The carved bead and vines are described but never handled in tactile, lived-in ways. Sensory detail leans heavily visual and abstract, lacking the body-anchored specificity that would ground the frame.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    The labyrinth and canyon setting are introduced with vivid imagery ("red canyon walls," "stone arch," "orchid solace") and the overlapping sleepwalking paths create a striking spatial conceit. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; corridors and tide pools are decorative backdrops rather than active pressure. The storybook plate glows and reflects but remains a passive object. Spatial choreography is coherent, and sensory detail (orchids, stone, luminous veins) is purposeful, lifting the score into the mid-5s despite the lack of environmental constraint on the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly realized: roots snake between bones, bioluminescence pulses, skeletal arches tower, moonlight filters through canopy. Sensory detail is selective and consistent, filtered through Mara's reverent attention. The sundial base settling onto the altar and roots recoiling like reverent hands demonstrates environment shaping micro-action. The setting charges the final image (dawn rays, bright bands) and constrains Mara's path through the labyrinth. Spatial choreography remains clear across the excavation.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.1)
    The golden arcade, ebony clipboard, and chalk-painted pavement are vividly described and recur across beats, but they remain decorative—no environmental constraint alters Mara's choices or tactics. The drone's "recycled arcade circuitry" and rooftop mailbox appear too late to shape action. Sensory detail is present (neon flicker, warm envelope, amber light) but filtered through a generic catalog voice rather than Mara's particular attention under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cobalt observatory, autumn air, and brass domes are vividly described and establish atmosphere. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the loom, telescope, and candle are mentioned but do not constrain her choices or supply resources that alter outcome. The courier's departure and the observatory's sigh are scenic rather than tactical. Sensory detail is present but does not pressure the protagonist's decisions at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.1)
    The mangrove labyrinth is vividly rendered with concrete imagery (roots as verses, humidity-slick glass, moonlit lagoon) and sensory detail distributed across the journey. However, setting remains decorative—the labyrinth shifts conveniently but never constrains a choice; the glass pane and water's edge serve as staging rather than resources that alter tactics. The shard's warmth and glow are mentioned repeatedly but do not pressure the protagonist's options at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.1)
    The mist-clad atrium and brain-coral vial are vividly rendered and recur across beats. The plaster cast appears late and remains a static prop; the translator never handles or manipulates the notes in action. Spatial choreography is minimal (translator on bench, child absent or asleep). The coral vial is lifted and placed beside the cast, but this gesture does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it remains symbolic decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ruined orchard and fog are vivid and sustained, but they do not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("trembling like chandeliers," "cool mist kiss her cheeks"), yet the environment remains a backdrop rather than an agent that shapes the protagonist's moves. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the setting evolves from dark to luminous, but this change is decorative rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.8)
    The sound wave garden is vividly rendered with sensory specificity—"harmonic currents," "microscopic bells," "marble arches"—and the hobo nickel and pedestal anchor spatial choreography. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Lena interacts with it passively, waiting for responses rather than navigating obstacles. The garden's pulse syncing with her heartbeat is evocative but ornamental, not causal. The environment remains a backdrop for abstract phenomena rather than a lived-in space that forces decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.1)
    The greenhouse setting supplies vivid sensory texture (beetles, moths, metallic echo, moss, marigolds) and the gourd seed functions as a recurring focal object. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or force a tactical shift; spatial choreography remains vague (where Lysander stands relative to the vents, seedlings, Dr. Mirabel's entry point), and no detail alters the outcome. The "community gardens that dotted the city" are mentioned but never grounded in concrete proximity or access that pressures the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.1)
    The shell is vividly rendered ("cavernous chambers," "echoing corridors," "reef-shadow joy") and the reef sings back, but the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics. The galaxy postcard and half-sung lullabies float as ornamental images without spatial consequence. Sensory detail is густ and purposeful within individual beats, yet the setting remains postcard description rather than a crucible that pressures the poet's process.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.8)
    The opal library, glass orchids, and cracked bamboo chime are vividly rendered and recur throughout. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—the caretaker moves freely, lighting candles and arranging chimes without spatial friction. The traveler's arrival does not test access, proximity, or resource scarcity. Sensory detail is rich but remains decorative rather than pressure-bearing, preventing entry into the 7+ band despite strong atmospheric specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.1)
    The archive's stone walls, vellum pages, and glass ink well are described with sensory care, and the setting's acoustic properties (vibrations, echoes) thread through the action. However, the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome; it remains a vivid backdrop rather than a tactical actor. The "micro-setting" test (body, tool, recurring object charges final image) is not met.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.9)
    The amphitheater is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (basalt floor, trembling stone, ash settling) and the volcanic setting charges atmosphere throughout. However, the environment does not constrain Mira's choices or alter her tactics—she completes her task without spatial or resource friction. The final image (water glinting "like a sapphire thread") is atmospheric but ornamental; the setting does not shape the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.6)
    The attic skylight and dust motes anchor the setting early and recur, but spatial choreography remains generic—yellowed maps, old paper, cracked glass—without tactile constraint. The meteorite chip's "faint glow" and the pigeons' leg attachments are described but do not alter Lila's options or tactics in any beat. The setting provides atmosphere but does not pressure choice or charge the final image with a micro-setting detail.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.1)
    The drifting prism terrace, glass corridor, and corn maze are vivid in isolation but lack spatial coherence: how the terrace relates to the field, how the corridor enters "the earth," and how the child returns to the maze remain unclear. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric (amber stalks, teal glow, corn husk scent) but does not constrain choice or alter tactics. The wooden chairs and copper plate appear as set dressing without affecting the child's path. Micro-setting exception applies (body, tool, recurring object) but none of these charge the final image or force a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.1)
    The underwater city supplies atmospheric detail—bioluminescent algae, glass panels, coral pedestal, ancient instruments—that creates mood but does not constrain Aria's choices or alter her tactics. The feather and console interaction in the chamber offers one moment where setting enables an action (placing the feather ignites holograms), lifting the score into functional range. The facility itself remains postcard: described but never pressuring decisions or limiting resources in a way that matters to the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.1)
    The geode cave is vividly rendered with "kaleidoscopic shadows," "cracked pillars of crystal," and "vaulted chamber" tiled with crater glass; sensory details are selective and contribute to atmosphere. The mosaic floor "pulsed in rhythm with her own heartbeat," briefly charging a beat, and the fissure at center provides a spatial anchor for the climax. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Maren moves freely through arches and chambers without friction. The cave functions as a backdrop rather than an active pressure on the protagonist's decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tidal arcade setting is vivid and layered—neon ribbons, starlight pools, sea-salt air—and filtered through the performer's aesthetic lens. The shallow pool and reflected starlight constrain one choice (ink-drop divination) and charge the middle act. Spatial choreography is coherent (chalkboard, glass jar, brass case, satchel). However, the environment remains atmospheric rather than pressing tactics at closure; the tide "dictates the next step" poetically but does not limit options or exact a price in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.1)
    The twilight garden supplies vivid sensory anchors—moonlight "like spilled ink," salt-scented shadows, the deepest pool—and the moonstone speck is handled twice (palm, then forearm). However, setting remains scenic rather than constraining: the garden does not limit Lira's options or shape her tactics; any tranquil, moonlit space would serve. Spatial choreography is clean (pool → palm → forearm), but the environment functions as backdrop rather than pressure or resource.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.1)
    Pearl Bay, the prism atrium, mist, and the pond are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (noctilucent glow, fractured light, prismatic shards). The stone and glass constrain Mira's ritual and charge the final image with recurring motifs. Spatial choreography is clear. However, setting does not force a choice or alter tactics; it remains backdrop for contemplation rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.1)
    The moonlit ridge, ash valley, and town square are named and anchored early with vivid sensory detail ("pine needles like distant applause," "ground still smoldering"). However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters Maren's tactics; she walks unimpeded, sets the box on a stone altar without friction, and arrives at the village without spatial or atmospheric pressure shaping the outcome. The porcelain box functions more as a symbolic prop than a tool with mechanical consequence, and the celestial timeframe remains decorative rather than a live clock. The setting provides backdrop and mood but does not participate in escalation or charge the closure image beyond metaphorical dressing.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.1)
    The tide-polished grotto is vividly rendered (sea-foam, stone columns, reflected light kaleidoscope) and furnishes the investigation frame, but the environment never constrains a tactical choice or alters Arin's approach. Spatial choreography remains clear; sensory detail is present but inert. The grotto charges the final festival image thematically yet does not shape the closure moment with material pressure, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ivy-veiled passage, stone hearth, and film negative supply tactile anchors early and recur with purpose. Sensory selection—firelight on emulsion, cold stone, low hum—filters through Lira's role and charges the ending image of "stone whisper." The film negative functions as micro-setting, constraining her method and enabling the dream hum at closure. Scale and detail remain proportionate; no orientation debt applied.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.1)
    Setting details are atmospheric but never constrain a choice or shift tactics. The "echoing terrace," "prism parapet," and "mirrors" function as static backdrops without spatial choreography or physical consequence. Sensory selection reads as decorative catalog rather than filtered through urgency or goal-directed action. No tool, body state, or environmental pressure charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.1)
    The terrace, firelight, marble, and celestial choreography are vivid but operate primarily as atmosphere rather than constraint. The ebony clipboard returns at closure and contrasts visually with the altar, achieving minimal charge. Sensory detail is selective (jasmine, cricket chorus, amber glow) but doesn't alter Lira's tactics or choices—she could negotiate anywhere with similar effect. Spatial choreography is coherent; the setting supports tone but doesn't reach the 9+ gate of constraining a pivotal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.8)
    The salt flat is vividly rendered with specific detail (cracks "like veins of forgotten rivers," brine pool as amplifier), and the environment enables the egg's release. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off—it provides a stage rather than shaping tactics under pressure. The description occasionally drifts toward catalog ("iridescent with the faded colors") without filtering through immediate urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    The silver courtyard and prism under starlight are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail ("air tasted of ice and ink," "snow muffling her footfalls"). The prism constrains the courtesan's action—she must untangle threads to unlock it—and charges the closure image with the cascade of light. However, the courtyard itself functions more as backdrop than as micro-setting that alters tactics; the snow and marble do not pressure choices beyond atmospheric presence.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dome setting is described with atmospheric detail ("rusted cathedral," parabolic dishes "turned inward"), and the campfire stick is handled across multiple beats. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as a symbolic backdrop for Selene's reflections. Spatial choreography is clear but static—she arranges dishes, places the stick, lifts it, lets the fire die—without the setting supplying resources or pressure that affects outcome. The micro-setting (body, tool) is present but ornamental, never driving a decision or charging the final image with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.1)
    Vivid sensory language (bioluminescent moss, amber light, rosy hush) establishes atmosphere, but the grotto itself never constrains a choice or alters tactics. The "clouds below" and "verdant" setting remain postcard description; spatial choreography is vague (Lira kneels, ties knots, but proximity and access are never tested). The moth wing and reeds function as props without physical resistance. Micro-setting potential is present but untapped.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.1)
    The icebound sanctum, aurora, and ceremonial rope are vividly rendered and appear throughout. The rope constrains Mara's method (reconfiguring braids) and charges the final image (luminous tapestry). Micro-setting (copper cylinder, punched card) shapes one key turn. However, spatial choreography is abstract—Mara's movements float without grounding—and the setting functions more as symbolic backdrop than tactical constraint in most beats.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.1)
    The vine-draped bunker and rewilded forest are vivid and sustained through tactile detail (moss, ivy, fading glyphs, phosphorescent spores). The wafer seal's glow and the storm's progression provide atmospheric pressure. However, the setting remains largely decorative—the bunker's layout and the forest's spatial logic do not constrain her actions or narrow options. The spores and vortex appear to serve her intent without resistance, so the environment never forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.8)
    The palace setting supplies atmosphere ("dust‑laden archives," "stone corridors," "wind‑chimed arches") but does not constrain a key choice—Nabu moves freely from balconies to archives to altar without spatial friction. The magic square tile is handled twice (discovery, placement) and its surface detail (numbers, etching) recurs, meeting micro-setting criteria. However, the tile's physical properties do not alter tactics; it functions as a symbol rather than a constraint. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("dusky," "violet glow") but does not narrow options at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "soundless sanctuary" and "obsidian stone" are mentioned but never constrain a choice or alter tactics. Spatial choreography is vague—Mara "slips" the box into the circle without clear positioning. The setting absorbs echoes but this attribute does not pressure the monks' decisions. The micro-setting (music box) does charge the final wanderer beat slightly, lifting the score above ornamental, but the sanctuary itself remains postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.2)
    The orchard fog and twilight frost are vivid and recur purposefully, and the sextant and mirror function as micro-setting objects. The fog "thinning to silver ribbons" and the final "glass-mountain hush" provide sensory specificity. The environment does not, however, constrain a choice or meaningfully limit Arlen's ritual—he performs each step successfully. Spatial choreography is clean (stump, horizon, trees) and the idiom ("glass-mountain tone of silence") is consistent, but the setting remains a backdrop rather than a pressure that shapes tactics or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.1)
    The orchard-in-rafters image is vivid and purposeful, filtering light and supplying the "deciduous vows" motif that frames renewal. Spatial choreography is clear (aisles, pine bench, canopy), and sensory detail is selective (gold light, cracked stained glass, fallen leaves). The setting does not constrain a choice or pressure the mending; it remains postcard backdrop rather than tactical element, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.4)
    The astral orchard and bathroom settings are vivid and purposefully contrasted (luminous trees vs. cramped echoing tiles). The pistachio shell cameo returns with reweighted meaning at closure, functioning as a charged object. Spatial choreography within each vignette is clear, though transitions between orchard and library bathroom are abrupt and lack concrete connective tissue. The micro-setting (bathroom tiles rearranging into a mosaic) directly enables a philosophical breakthrough, satisfying the constraint-as-choice test for mid-band scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.1)
    The labyrinthine bookstore and ivy-locked chamber are vividly sketched but remain postcard backdrops; no environmental feature constrains a choice or alters Selene's tactics. The botanical diary functions as a key rather than a lived-in tool. Spatial choreography is intact, and phosphorescent fungi charge atmosphere, but the mountain itself never pressures the protagonist or shapes the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.1)
    The carnival ship, fog, cracked mirrors, and carousel horses provide vivid sensory anchors, but they function as backdrop rather than constraint. The emerald swatch card opens a portal and the ship "shivered," yet neither environment nor object materially narrows a choice or alters tactics. The garden of forgotten names appears only in the final third without prior spatial grounding. Micro-setting (the body, the card as tool) charges the final image but does not shape the protagonist's moves earlier. Within 5.0–6.9 band for one-beat participation.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    The clock tower mechanism room supplies vivid anchors (amber lamps, brass cogs, pendulum, iron balcony, spiral stair, vault) and the setting participates in the action—Mara descends, places the seal, reweaves the rope. However, spatial choreography blurs: the door "between the pendulum's swing and the iron balcony" never clarifies its physical relation to the vault below, and the final dissolution leaves the tower's state ambiguous (mechanisms stilled yet "never missed a beat" in later evenings). The rope's copper strands and the seal's twin-spiral engage tactile detail, but the setting does not visibly constrain a choice or alter tactics; it stages actions without imposing friction.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.1)
    The harmonic caves are anchored early with "low, reverberating tones" and "deepest chamber," and sensory detail (sapphire light tunnel, basalt pedestal, crack patterns in ice) is vivid and selective. The ice fissures directly enable the mapkeeper's discovery—he traces them to find the hidden panel—meeting the 9+ gate of constraint on choice. However, spatial choreography after retrieval is vague (the "center of the cavern" and "main fissure" lack concrete position), and the caves themselves do not evolve or resist; they remain a passive theater for the mapkeeper's work.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glass humming pavilion and broken prism are vividly described and recur across beats, but they function as backdrop rather than constraint. The star-path alignment is asserted, not shown shaping a tactical choice. Spatial choreography (pedestal, alcove, balcony) remains clear, and the sensory texture (glass singing, hush vibrating) is consistent, lifting the score above purely ornamental setting.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.1)
    The observatory, crystal, obelisk, and solid fog are visually evocative but remain set-dressing—props are never handled, distances are unclear, and spatial choreography is absent (the archivist "moves to" the obelisk without dramatizing the action). The "solid fog" image is striking but does not constrain or enable a choice; it dissolves without consequence. Sensory detail is largely visual and abstract ("pale marble," "bruised violet"), rarely anchored to the POV's professional priorities or urgency. The setting never pressures a decision or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.1)
    Vivid sensory texture—ivy, rose, amber light, oily kerosene scent, jasmine—is woven throughout, and the blooming fortress recurs in the final image. However, the setting remains postcard description; no environmental feature constrains a choice or alters a tactic. The micro-setting allowance (body, tool, object) is not met because the rag knot and mosaic are invoked rather than used to pressure decisions. Spatial choreography is vague (corridors, alcove, gates appear without clear layout).

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.1)
    The grotto's sensory detail is vivid and sustained—moonlight on water, basalt slab, cool breeze, stone walls pulsing—and the jade cicada's glow provides a recurring visual anchor. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains picturesque backdrop. The two clan leaders materialize without spatial choreography, and the chronicler's position relative to them is unclear.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.0)
    The trellis and inverted-gravity setting are vivid and constrain the single-hour window, shaping Lio's climb and doll-placement. Sensory details ("clouds brushed his cheeks like cool silk," "vines humming") are selective and POV-filtered. The recurring porcelain doll charges the final image (warm, pulsing). However, the underground bunker remains somewhat generic—dim corridors, stone, ventilation shafts—without occupational or spatial specificity that would pressure a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prism terrace, storm glass vial, and brass ear are vivid and specific. Sensory detail is plentiful—"violet bands," "amber bloom," "silver droplets"—but remains decorative; the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent (gondola on river, terrace above water, far bank arrival). The setting charges atmosphere but does not pressure the protagonist's final action, keeping it below the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.1)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall, neon archives, and holographic vines create vivid sensory texture, and the orchard setting is signaled early. However, environment never constrains a tactical choice—Mina moves through fissures and corridors without spatial friction. The ruby flake pulses but doesn't limit options. Micro-setting (body, tool, object) doesn't charge the final image with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sensory detail is vivid ("ashen charcoal," "starlight," "pale constellations") but remains postcard-static; the sanctuary never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. Spatial choreography is vague—"encroach upon the edges," "stepped through"—without tracking bodies or distances. The doorknocker ring and threshold are repeatedly described but do not force a tactical shift; they ornament rather than pressure the keeper's path.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.1)
    The bioluminescent mushroom caps and violet glow recur throughout and charge the final image, meeting the micro-setting standard. Spatial choreography is vague—where the pressure chamber sits relative to the narrator, how the bolt is secured, and what "the farm's fungal veins" physically are remain unclear. The submarine porthole bolt's "memory" of ocean pressure is metaphorical decoration rather than a mechanical constraint that alters tactics. Sensory detail leans heavily on visual (violet, glow, kaleidoscope) without embodied contact or olfactory/tactile specificity that would ground the narrator's body in the space.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sepia reading room is anchored with sensory detail (dust, amber light, oak table) and the gramophone is handled across multiple beats. The carved panel and hidden compartment shape the final discovery, giving the setting functional weight. However, the environment does not constrain choice or force a tactical adjustment; Lian follows the sound without resistance or spatial friction. The "golden shadows" recur but remain atmospheric rather than charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.4)
    The greenhouse supplies vivid sensory fragments—coppered vines exhaling vapor, luminescent moss, iron-and-jasmine scent—but remains a postcard backdrop; no spatial choreography tracks the knight's movement or constrains his choices. The control panel and moss respond to his touch without obstacle, so setting does not pressure tactics. The final image of armor melting into moss offers a charged reprise, lifting the score slightly, but the orchard never functions as a crucible that alters options or imposes cost.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.1)
    The file room is described vividly ("dim chamber," "high windows," dust patterns) and the button appears in multiple beats, but neither constrains a choice or charges the final image in a way that narrows options. The room functions as backdrop for discovery rather than a spatial pressure that shapes tactics. Micro-setting standard is met (the button as recurring object), but it remains ornamental—Amelia's path would be identical with any small object in any archive.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.1)
    The auric lagoon appears in nearly every paragraph, and the water/reflections motif recurs, meeting minimal setup and reprise. However, the lagoon never constrains a choice or supplies a tactical resource that alters Mara's options—it remains postcard scenery. The key insertion and transmitter are spatially generic; we never learn how she approaches, whether the platform is exposed or hidden, or what physical risk proximity entails. Sensory detail ("starlight like scattered coins," "molten gold") is vivid but undifferentiated across the piece, lacking the urgency modulation that would reflect rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prism atrium, radiant grotto, and fog are vividly rendered and recur across beats, reweighting the atmosphere as the piece progresses. The micro-setting (saxophone, stone, dewdrops) constrains the protagonist's method—whispering rather than roaring—and the final image charges the grotto's hum. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting shapes the dominant stake (preventing the prophecy through place-specific acoustics) and thus clears the 9+ gate test, but the stake itself is abstract, limiting the setting's tactical pressure to a felt rather than decisive constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "ashen skyborne arbor" anchors place vividly, and sensory details (moss, luminous pool, ash-colored canopy) create atmosphere. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Lira moves freely, finds what she seeks, and the setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure. The crystal pool and monuments are described but do not force trade-offs or shift the final image's charge. Spatial choreography is vague (central clearing, stubborn moss clump) and the arbor's physical logic remains soft.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.1)
    The subterranean waterfall, phosphorescent algae, and greenhouse with swirling leaves are vividly rendered and consistently tracked through spatial moves. The compass rose placed on the stone pedestal and later the brazier provides tactile anchoring. Setting does constrain Mara's path (the fissure behind the waterfall), meeting the 9+ gate test in principle, but the environment never forces a difficult choice or alters tactics under resistance—it merely stages sequential discoveries. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered, avoiding catalog syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rain-washed foundry supplies vivid sensory detail (hot iron, old soot, amber light) filtered through the alchemist's professional gaze. The anvil and coin anchor spatial choreography; the storm modulates from hammering to whisper in step with her work. The setting constrains the repair (idle furnaces, precise temperature noted) and the coin on the anvil charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for micro-setting involvement. However, some description ("memories refusing to die") leans ornamental, and the foundry's role in shaping choice is more atmospheric than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.1)
    The gorge supplies atmospheric detail (slick stones, water echoing laughter) and the crocodile's tooth charges the ending, meeting micro-setting criteria. Spatial choreography is loose—Mara's movement through the gorge lacks concrete anchors, and the harp's location floats. Sensory detail leans visual and auditory; tactile and olfactory senses are absent during high-pressure beats. The tooth's glow at closure elevates the score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ultraviolet forest is vivid and consistent, with the pewter strap reflecting light and crystal roots humming notes tied to digits. However, the environment remains decorative; no choice hinges on the forest's properties. The strap constrains nothing and the humming roots enable nothing beyond providing a symbolic match for the equation. Spatial choreography is clear (clearing, mosaic of roots, path of moss), but the setting does not pressure Lira's tactics or alter the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.1)
    The alchemist's market "strung high above city rooftops" is vivid in initial description, and the paintings-as-maps detail is specific. However, spatial choreography dissolves into abstraction: the narrator "studies," "traces," and "aligns" without clear physical grounding or tactical constraint. The fragment and chain are handled metaphorically rather than as objects that pressure choice. The setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a constraint that shapes the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.4)
    The abandoned circus setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (shattered marquee, broken glass ceiling, scented air of sawdust/popcorn, decayed canvas lattice). Spatial choreography is coherent across moves (ticket counter → ladder → attic hatch → alcove). The setting supplies resources (mirrors, clock, hidden alcove) that guide Mara's investigation, meeting the micro-setting test. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off; it functions as atmospheric discovery-space rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.8)
    The glass-orchard library and sea of clouds anchor setting early, and the bottled whisper plus the press are handled on the page. Frost patterns and the lattice transformation charge the final image. However, the environment never constrains a choice—Mara uses the press and frost without spatial friction or resource trade-off. Sensory detail (frost, shards, humming) is vivid but ornamental; spatial choreography (where she stands, how objects relate) is vague. Just misses the 6.1 threshold because constraint is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.4)
    The baroque asteroid, copper spires, vaulted gallery, and enormous mirrors supply vivid visual detail, but none constrains a choice or alters tactics. The "seasonal storms" and "translucent cloth" appear only as backdrop; no character navigates spatial obstacles or trades access for outcome. The 9+ gate (environment/body/tool constrains choice or charges final image) is not met; the setting functions as ornament rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.1)
    The resonance chamber is vividly rendered with brass tones, rusted rivets, and amber luminescence, and the "rust as iron vines" image is distinctive. However, the environment does not constrain Alder's choices—he enters, works, and succeeds without spatial friction. The chamber's sensory detail remains decorative rather than tactical; no tool or recurring object alters his approach. Micro-setting criteria not met for 9-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.4)
    The subterranean lagoon is vividly rendered with "black glass," "bioluminescent algae," and "fossils that pulsed with faint light," and the water staircase is a striking image. The limestone cliffs and mineral musk anchor sensory detail effectively. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Mara moves through it unchallenged, and the spatial choreography (kneeling, stepping onto water, climbing a staircase of liquid) remains legible but inert. The setting decorates rather than pressures the quest, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.1)
    The archway anchors setting and recurs throughout, but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint—Mira's choices do not hinge on stone texture, storm timing, or spatial access. Sensory details ("salt and pine," "turbines," "mist") are vivid but decorative, filtered through poetic register rather than the sculptor's professional priorities. The final line places the lantern "ready to shine again," a motif echo that does not charge the closure with tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.8)
    The amber pavilion, cathedral, and garden are described with vivid sensory detail (cracked panes, incense, etched glass, phosphorescent flowers) and the setting anchors early. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; Mara moves through spaces that admire her rather than pressure her. The postcards function as keys but their mechanics are not grounded in how glass, light, or memory would physically operate, weakening plausibility. Spatial choreography remains clear, and the autumn-to-winter melt provides atmospheric continuity, lifting the score into mid-band despite the lack of setting-driven constraint at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.1)
    The zeppelin library, dunes, and obsidian lagoon are vividly described ("brass hull humming like a distant prayer," "violet reflections on black water") but remain postcard backdrops. The beach-debris messages are told rather than shown in use; we learn Mara "arranged them in spirals, arrows, and fractal patterns" but never see her hands working or a single pattern tested under pressure. Spatial choreography inside the zeppelin and during the descent is vague. The lagoon's crystal "pulsed with data" but its physical properties (size, weight, temperature) are absent, and it does not constrain Mara's final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paper-lantern cove supplies atmospheric sketch but never constrains a choice or complicates action. The ghost town's "cracked cobblestones" and "boarded windows" are catalog items that do not evolve or press tactics. The amber bottle's physical properties (sealed, humming, no opening) are contradicted when it releases a sigh and later dissolves its cork without dramatized effort. Spatial choreography is vague—alchemist stands on rocks, then "turned away," with no legible movement between.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.2)
    The orchard atop a skyscraper is vividly rendered through sensory specifics (pomegranates, plum that sings, rusted phonograph) and the setting accumulates atmospheric weight. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as backdrop and symbolic tapestry rather than as pressure. Spatial choreography is clear, and the micro-setting (wax cylinder, orchard roots) is textured but ornamental. Cap at 7.0 per the Orientation Test penalty applied in Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.1)
    The icebound atrium, copper basin, and phoenix are vividly described with sensory specificity (ice melting into mist, aurora glow, frost-kissed earth). However, spatial choreography is vague—Mira's physical position relative to basin, phoenix, and walls is unclear across beats. The setting does not constrain choice; the atrium responds to Mira's actions without resistance. Micro-setting (the acorn cap, basin) is present but does not alter tactics or charge the final image with a price.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    Vivid, selective details—"driftwood ribs and glass panes," "thin silver strand interwoven with conductive filaments," "cloud band…condensed into a thin, humming veil"—anchor the windblown sanctuary convincingly. Micro-setting (bell tower spine, sensor housing, glue timer) shapes procedural choices. The environment does not constrain a high-stakes decision, limiting the score's reach into the 8-band, but spatial choreography is coherent and sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist's technical focus.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.1)
    The station (stone, copper tubes, sensors) and the yellow lantern are vivid and recur across beats, anchoring the micro-setting. The lantern's glow shapes the final image ("spilled across the stone floor"), satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that an object or tool charge closure. However, spatial choreography remains vague (balcony, floor, machinery positions never cohere), and the "forgotten valley" functions as postcard backdrop rather than a constraint on choice. Sensory selection is almost exclusively visual-plus-hum; no smell, temperature, or tactile grain filters through the janitor's professional lens.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.1)
    The abandoned beekeeping oasis and scorched wasteland are evocatively described but remain postcard backdrops. The stained glass box and hives are mentioned repeatedly yet never constrain a choice or alter tactics. Spatial choreography is vague—where exactly is the pedestal, the house, the hives in relation to one another? The setting provides atmosphere but does not pressure the character's actions at any key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.6)
    The emerald silo is vividly established and recurs throughout, but it functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraining choice or charging the closure. Spatial choreography (silo interior, foundation, valley below) is legible. Sensory details ("dust-laden valley," "liquid glass," "green steel") are present but do not evolve causally with Mara's actions or filter through urgency-driven perception. The setting does not materially alter tactics or shape the final image's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.8)
    The lagoon is vividly rendered—"cobalt lagoon after rain," "surface a mirror," "burnished hush"—and the feather is given physical texture. Setting details recur purposefully (reeds, lily, pebbles in spirals), and the micro-objects (feather, pebbles) structure the poet's ritual moves. However, none of these elements constrain a choice or force a tactical shift; they serve as stage dressing for an unchanging tableau. Spatial choreography is coherent within the single locale.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.4)
    The temple orchard and living stone pillars are vivid and specific, sensory detail is selective (mica veins shimmer, chlorophyll clouds), and the copper wire functions as a tangible tool. However, the environment never constrains a choice—Mara moves freely, and the orchard passively responds. Spatial choreography is clear, but the setting remains postcard backdrop rather than pressure source, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rainwashed tower, moss-draped courtyard, and wet stone create vivid sensory anchors early. The fly amber's glow on cracked marble and prism-forming raindrops supply concrete micro-setting detail that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent within the single courtyard scene. However, the tower's "ancient circuitry" and "inner light" arrive late without prior grounding, and the scholars remain anonymous bodies without occupational texture that would deepen the professional context.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    The jetty is vividly rendered with recurring micro-details: rust-patched cart, timber sighing, phosphorescent algae, wild orchids. Sensory selection is purposeful (bruised violet twilight, bleached coral skeletons) and filtered through the coachman's mission-focused attention. The jetty as narrow vastness constrains the spatial frame and charges the final image, though the body and tools (wooden box, seed pods) do not alter tactics mid-scene. Setting details are integrated into action (scattering pods, shoots pushing through mud) without postcard stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.4)
    The scrapyard setting is vivid and filtered through Rook's perception ("metallic dust that sang under his weight," "rusted towers"). Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (phonograph cylinder, market square, steel chest). The waxed leaf and prism function as micro-setting objects that enable the revelation, reaching the first gate. However, environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; the setting serves as backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.1)
    The observation deck is described lyrically ("glass cradle," "minutes stretched like taffy") but remains a static backdrop; it does not constrain any choice or enable a tactic under pressure. The gilded compass applique recurs and "vibrates" at the closure, providing minimal constraint on the final alignment gesture. Sensory detail leans visual and metaphoric without grounding the body or tools in lived action. Spatial choreography is coherent but does not matter to outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.4)
    The icebound spire is vivid in sensory detail ("frozen teeth clawing the heavens," "ice beneath his boots seemed to soften"), and the "wrong" sky with violet aurora establishes atmospheric specificity. The pocket sundial lid's "soft chime" and the frost cracking under Lysander's swaps show environment responding to action. However, the spire itself does not constrain a single choice with visible cost—Lysander's ritual proceeds unimpeded, and the physical layout (cold ledge, inner chambers) remains abstract rather than tactically legible. The setting charges mood but does not force a tradeoff or shape the final image decisively, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.4)
    The whispering gallery is vividly rendered with "thin ribbons" of light, echoing arches, and marble hall; spatial choreography (chessboard center, hidden compartment, walking patterns) remains coherent throughout. The missing pawns and polished squares constrain Mira's method—her walking pattern triggers the compartment—so the setting does participate in choice. However, the interregnum city outside remains generic and never supplies pressure or resources that alter tactics; the gallery itself becomes a decorative frame rather than an active constraint after the first third.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.1)
    The mountain bookstore is vivid in initial description—"labyrinthine," "winding corridors," "stone ribs"—but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The feather and stone are handled, but neither object limits choice or alters tactics; the stone simply reveals and the feather translates without friction. The micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) does not charge the final image or force a trade-off, capping the 9-band. Sensory detail is present but decorative; the environment does not guide Lira's moves.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.8)
    The platinum labyrinth and tapestry are vivid anchors, and the "time-frozen" frame creates eerie atmosphere. Sensory detail leans heavily visual and metaphorical (gleaming corridors, crystal altar) without tactile grounding—stone, metal, and fabric are named but not handled in ways that constrain movement. The labyrinth's gate opening and walls "breathing" charge key beats, lifting the score, but spatial choreography inside the maze remains generic (corridors twist, he paces) without specific turns or dead ends that shape his route.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.1)
    The canyon, bone towers, and pale spire create vivid atmosphere and recur throughout, but remain largely descriptive. The mural "glows faintly" and the spire "flickers," yet neither object constrains a choice or alters tactics in a pivotal beat. Spatial choreography is coherent (platform, pillar, mist), and sensory detail is selective, but the setting functions as stage rather than crucible. The micro-setting allowance is not met; no tool or body-constrained choice charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.1)
    The floating workshop and acid sea are vivid and purposeful, but they function primarily as backdrop; the gears hum and the sea churns without constraining her choices or altering tactics. The statue's pockmarks anchor the ritual, and the key ring charm warms in response, offering micro-setting pressure that modestly charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (corrosive mist, sea's bite, gear-pulse) and filtered through the alchemist's resolve, though spatial choreography remains stable rather than dynamic under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.4)
    Coastal cave tunnels and the hidden oasis are rendered with vivid sensory detail ("cool and scented with brine and ancient stone," "shafts of golden light"). The cavern pool and painted seashell constrain the discovery sequence and charge the final easel image. Spatial choreography through the labyrinth is clear on retracing. However, the quay and lighthouse setting do not pressure any mid-scene choice, and the studio false-wall detail arrives only in retrospective summary.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cobalt lighthouse, stone balcony, brass lantern, and garden scent are rendered with vivid specificity and sensory density. The vial cork's "cracked surface catching the first light" charges the final image, satisfying the micro-setting constraint test. However, the setting does not materially narrow Mara's options or alter her tactics; the balcony functions as stage rather than crucible. Spatial choreography remains clear; the fisherman's boat, reef, and cliffs anchor distance and approach.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.1)
    The starlit signal station is vividly rendered—cracked walls, flickering consoles, skeletal antennae—and the censer foot's patina bronze texture recurs with purpose. The setting does not constrain a choice: the navigator assembles her engine without spatial friction, and the arrival of ships happens to her rather than through negotiation with the environment. Sensory detail is vivid but largely static; the station hums and the sea breeze mingles with incense, yet these do not alter tactics or charge the closure beyond atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.1)
    The hanging orchard setting is vividly rendered ("roots hung on sheer cliffs," "slick bark," "hollowed trunks") and the storm recurs to test the moss seal, constraining Mara's tactic. However, spatial choreography in the clearing remains abstract—smuggler positions, distance to the log, line-of-sight for the eye's glow are not tracked. The orchard shapes one key choice (placement under moss) but does not charge the final image beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.1)
    The opal dock, mist, twilight palette, and lighthouse are vividly rendered and filter perception through Marlowe's lonely vigil. The dried Edelweiss constrains his investigation and charges the final image when he aligns it "with the longest lull of the sea." Spatial choreography (dock, tower, water) is coherent. Setting detail is selective and purposeful, meeting the 9+ test by using the recurring flower and dock surface to constrain choice and charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.1)
    The blooming cavern is anchored by sensory markers—moss, parchment scent, creek song, warm amber glow—and the rising creek functions as a modest time constraint. The matrix chip's brass teeth and the narrow arch offer micro-setting detail. However, spatial choreography slips: Elian moves from shop to cavern slit to corridor without clear transitions, and the shop's return in the coda feels teleported. The creek's rise is mentioned but does not visibly narrow access or force a tactical choice at closure, limiting environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("air tasted of iron and old rain," "walls exhaled a thin mist"), and the ember grotto's pulsing rhythm charges the atmosphere. However, the environment does not constrain a single choice—the queen's path is frictionless, and the grotto supplies only discovery, not obstacle. Spatial choreography is coherent across the ascent and alcove, but the setting functions as backdrop rather than crucible. The "cobalt grotto above clouds" is introduced late (mid-story) and remains ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "ember nexus at twilight" and "nautilus shell" are vivid in isolation but do not constrain choice or evolve causally. Spatial choreography is unclear: the basin, brushes, and shell's position shift without tracking. The setting provides atmosphere but never pressures a tactic—coals "flare brighter" in response to the ritual without mechanical cost or risk. Micro-setting allowance applies (shell, palette), but neither object alters the attempt or charges the final image with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cabin, pine scent, snow, and birch bark scroll are vivid and anchor the piece sensorially. The scroll functions as a micro-setting object that the narrator handles and that charges the final beats. Spatial choreography is minimal (single room, single character), and the grave marker outside shifts from threat to metaphor without clear physical grounding. Sensory hierarchy and POV filter are present but not deeply leveraged under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.4)
    The water clock shop is vividly rendered with brass gears, frosted panes, and mist, and sensory detail is purposeful (the shop "exhaled," the pendulum's "faint ticking echoed like a lullaby"). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout: Lena moves between mechanisms, lifts the screw into a cradle, traces threads with a brush. The micro-setting (the screw, the pendulum, the water level) charges the final image when "the water inside the clock glimmered like a quiet tear," though the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it serves as backdrop for meditation rather than a crucible for decision.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.2)
    The floating platform, moonstone tea set, and crow quill are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (jasmine scent, crystal shards singing). Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—Lira's actions would proceed identically on solid ground. The quill's crystallizing attribute is described but never limits her tactics. Misses the 9+ gate: environment present but ornamental to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.4)
    The archive and orchard are vividly rendered with selective detail (vaulted aisles, weathered piano, amber glass, rusted gate, ancient grief). The perfume bottle constrains the ritual method and charges the final image when its scent merges with pine. Spatial choreography is clear across moves from archive interior to orchard edge. The hush and impending axe create atmospheric pressure, though the trees function more as backdrop than tactical obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    The ancient temple library is vivid and consistently rendered (vaulted aisles, stone arches, tablets, crystal pedestal). Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, filtered through a heightened register. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains a backdrop. The dictionary-on-crystal moment provides a physical anchor at closure but does not charge the final image with setting-driven consequence, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.4)
    The fjord, station machinery, and horizon measurement frame are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (metallic scent, water pulse, amber glare). However, these elements remain scenic rather than constraining choice; the hydraulic gears and mantle clock key are described but never alter tactics or charge the final image in a way that makes them indispensable. Spatial choreography is clear, and the setting supports tone, placing it in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.1)
    The rainwashed library and midsummer anchor time and place early. Sensory details (old paper, distant thunder, phosphorescent symbols) are present but decorative; none constrain a choice or alter tactics. The candle lantern's mica pane recurs but functions as a passive key rather than a spatial or material pressure. The underground tunnels and subway signage are described in summary ("old subway signage, each plaque scrawled in a different hand") without specific obstacles or spatial choreography that would affect Mara's path.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.4)
    The tunnel setting is vividly rendered with selective detail (rusted conduits, groundwater drip, neon glow) and the brass booth anchors spatial choreography. The glass harmonica disc charges the final image as voices accumulate, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that an object or environment constrain choice or charge closure. However, the tunnel itself does not constrain Mara's choices—she could operate anywhere—and the streetlamps-through-grates image recurs decoratively without altering tactics. The orientation penalty in Q2 caps this category at 7.0 per the global rule.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.1)
    The blooming jetty is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (violet/amber light, jasmine scent, crimson/white flowers), and spatial choreography is coherent. However, the setting remains decorative: no environmental feature constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters the archivist's action. The locket and ledger are handled but do not interact with the jetty's physical features to shape outcome, preventing high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.1)
    The disused station overgrown with ivy is vividly established early and returns at closure ("ivy-clad arches"). The hidden compartment and comet imprint provide tactile specificity. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—the puzzle (cut ivy in a pattern) is stated and solved off-page, and spatial choreography remains vague during the crew's work. The fragment's "warm touch" and "soft chime" charge the final image, qualifying the object-as-micro-setting exception, but the environment itself functions as backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ultrasonic forest is vivid and distinct: "trees emitted constant hums…carving invisible pathways" anchors sensory detail early and consistently. The platinum ring and "knot of ancient bark" provide concrete touchstones. However, setting remains largely atmospheric; the forest does not constrain Lira's choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—she follows the notes without navigating obstacles or making tradeoffs based on environment. Spatial choreography is stable, and the "quiet blaze of lingering light" paints mood, but the micro-setting does not pressure the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.1)
    The gravitational anomaly and laboratory setting are vividly named but remain postcard elements: the anomaly "pressed gently" and "swayed like a slow tide" without altering a single tactical choice. The pen's "exotic nib" receives repeated mentions yet never constrains an action—its "phosphorescent trail" is visual decoration. Spatial choreography is coherent (desk, holo-screen, window) but static; no environmental detail forces a micro-decision or charges the final image beyond metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.8)
    The harbor setting is lushly described with selective sensory detail (moonlight, ripples, kelp scent), and the rusted pier and dock wood anchor spatial choreography. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it serves as atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure. The camera's "empty eye" and the "imprint of a camera lens etched into the dock's wood" attempt micro-setting work, but the mechanics of how silence is mapped onto these objects remain vague, so the objects do not shape the resolution. The setting changes (pier to cliffs) without causal consequence, and the "luminous harbor" recurs as motif without reweighting stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.1)
    The desert canyon and archive supply vivid visual anchors (murals, alcove, basalt dome), and the bronze box functions as a concrete goal object. Spatial choreography is mostly clear across the trail of stations. However, the setting remains largely decorative: the archive's physical properties do not constrain his choices, and the "hollow basalt dome" and "echoing chambers" appear only in the penultimate paragraph without shaping the peak action. The body and tools (fire, tapestry fragment) are mentioned but not used in ways that alter tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.1)
    The sound wave garden supplies vivid sensory textures—vibrating blossoms, humming reeds, auric lagoon—but functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint. Spatial choreography is coherent within the garden (silver twig, floating lily, pond edge) though the lab-to-garden transition is elided. The "observation dome" and "sterile corridors" offer setting contrast, but neither space forces a tactical choice or alters Lira's options. The garden's ambient pulse and responsive chimes charge the atmosphere yet do not meaningfully obstruct or enable the protagonist's actions at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.1)
    The container labyrinth and storm supply vivid atmospheric texture, but spatial choreography remains vague (Milo "follows" a glowing line without distance, turns, or obstacles). The zodiac coin and key are handled across beats, qualifying as micro-setting under the allowance. However, neither environment nor object constrains a choice at closure; the final image is conceptual rather than spatial. No 9+ eligibility without that constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.8)
    The cobalt dock after rain is vividly established with slick wood, reflective surfaces, and canal geometry. Sensory detail (water shutters, mirrored light, waning moon alignment) is purposeful and atmosphere-driven. The dental mirror functions as a recurring object across beats (raised higher, aligned with moon, lowered at mission's end), constraining the guardian's method. However, no environmental constraint forces a tactical choice or alters the outcome—setting enhances mood but does not pressure the guardian's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cobalt library and mist recur frequently, but function as atmosphere rather than constraint; no choice depends on a locked door, cracked pane, or marble surface. The magnetic grotto is cradled twice but never used to alter a tactic. Sensory detail—dust, amber glow, pine scent—is vivid but static, cycling without progression. Spatial choreography across town, library, streets, and vacant lots remains unclear; the reader cannot track who is where when.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sublittoral fringe, basalt altar, and phosphorescent algae provide vivid sensory texture, and the scrimshaw's hidden compartment briefly charges a beat. However, the island itself functions more as symbolic backdrop than spatial constraint—Mara's movements (dock to island to tower) do not impose tactical choices or legible distances. The "disappearing island" premise is described but never pressures her navigation or safety. Micro-setting (body, tool) does not constrain the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.1)
    The wind turbines supply vivid imagery and are invoked throughout, but they function as backdrop rather than constraint. The farmhouse interior is sketched (kitchen, wooden table, cracked floor) yet spatial choreography remains generic. The baton and dried flowers are handled twice but do not alter tactics or options. One positive: the turbine shadows racing across walls create a micro-setting detail that charges the final paragraph, narrowly elevating the score above pure description.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cobalt atrium and frozen lake are vivid but remain postcard description without constraining choice. The humming quartz colonnade is mentioned repeatedly yet never supplies a resource or obstacle that alters tactics. The final amber glow contradicts the frozen premise without dramatized cause, breaking internal consistency. Micro-setting gate not met: body, tool, or recurring object does not charge the final image with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glassblower's courtyard, phoenix, furnace, and concertina reed are named and described, establishing a vivid symbolic environment. However, the courtyard functions as backdrop rather than constraint; no choice is shaped by access, proximity, or material properties. The phoenix's "bruised sky" and glass walls "humming with spectrum" remain ornamental. Spatial choreography is loose—potted ferns, ivy, lotus, and cereus appear without clear positioning or causal interaction with Selene's movement.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.1)
    The laboratory setting is vividly rendered with copper coils, forgotten microphones, and rusted tuners. However, these details remain decorative; no environmental feature constrains a choice or alters tactics. The carbide lamp lens is handled across multiple beats and charges the sensory texture, lifting the score into functional range, but the setting does not pressure the protagonist's actions or shape the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.1)
    The observatory setting is vivid in initial imagery ("brass lenses and ancient maps," "charts that plotted the stars...by intention"), but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The balcony rose and telescope slots are postcard details; no spatial or environmental pressure shapes her choices. The body and tools (vellum, origami, copper-stained fingers) are mentioned but do not alter tactics or charge the final image in a way that would reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    The loft's rain-beaded skylight, brass tables, and measuring tape are vividly rendered and filtered through the cartomancer's professional lens. Sensory detail (the tape's clicks, the hum in the walls, the droplet on the skylight) creates atmospheric cohesion. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it remains scenic backdrop rather than active setting. The micro-setting (tape, cards) is present but does not pressure decisions, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.8)
    The archive's vaulted chambers, bronze prism pagoda, and night-fall exterior provide vivid sensory anchors, and the floor's variable echo constrains the historian's steps. However, spatial choreography remains vague (how far to the pagoda? what specific route?), and the setting does not force a pivotal choice or charge the final image with undeniable cost. Details read as atmospheric catalog rather than tactical constraint. The "atoms of nostalgia" motif recurs but does not bind a decision to the environment's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "blooming library above clouds" offers vivid conceptual texture, and sensory details (marble floor, perfume of rain-kissed clouds, vaulted arches) are selective and purposeful. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it remains a decorative backdrop. The river stone, handled twice, approaches micro-setting function but does not block or enable an action; the protagonist's movements (approaching the podium, lifting the stone) proceed without spatial friction. Anchors are present but do not charge the final image, capping the category below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.1)
    The misty workshop and scattered stars establish atmosphere, and the warm stone, crystal vial, and workbench provide concrete staging. The mist curls and absorbs fragments in the final third, lightly charging the closure image. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Mara's ritual proceeds unimpeded by spatial or material limits. The body and tool use remain gestural rather than pressure-bearing.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.1)
    The tower, tunnel, moss, and hourglass are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory selection (damp moss scent, stone breathing, frosted glass). The hourglass placement on the root and alignment with coffee rings shows the environment constraining a ritual choice, meeting the micro-setting criterion. However, spatial choreography between tower attic and subterranean tunnel lacks clarity—"back in the tower's attic" implies prior departure not shown, and the final balcony appearance adds a third location without warning. Sensory details are consistent and filtered through the POV's scar-reading lens, though the "meteor hush" recurring phrase borders on ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.1)
    The projection booth is anchored with some atmospheric detail (velvet seats, ancient projector, black velvet curtain), and the hidden compartment provides one spatial turn. However, the space never constrains choice or alters tactics—the gazer moves freely through abstraction ("rooms that folded into each other," "galaxies"). Sensory detail tilts heavily visual and metaphorical ("liquid light," "river of memory") without grounding in body, tool, or physical constraint. The booth functions as backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.8)
    The aurora-lit archway is vividly rendered with "violet and emerald shadows" and the cold stone recurs, but setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it remains postcard backdrop. The astronomical instrument is described ("brass limbs etched with constellations") but not handled in ways that affect outcome. Spatial choreography is coherent (archway, stone floor, walls) and sensory detail is selective, lifting the score above functional, but the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is not met.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.7)
    Vivid sensory anchors—glowing dune, violet hue, charcoal sky, amber horizon—establish atmosphere and filter through the guard's mission-driven lens. The dune's blossoms shift color (violet to azure) in response to the sparks, demonstrating causal evolution. However, spatial choreography is loose: the guard's position relative to the dune, the archive, and the emerging trees remains vague. The chess clock and dune are present across beats, but neither constrains a choice at closure; they charge the final image without altering tactics, landing just short of the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.1)
    The mechanical rainforest is vivid ("pistoned moss," "gears and copper leaves," "brass trunks") and establishes a distinct setting early. However, it functions as backdrop rather than constraint—the philosopher moves freely through it, and no environmental feature blocks, enables, or pressures a key choice. The gear appears in his palm, is placed in an engine, and hums; the forest "responds" but does not alter his tactics or force a trade-off. Micro-setting allowance does not elevate the score because the gear's use is frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pebble pier, veiled ridgeway, and cave entrance with star rune provide vivid anchors filtered through a lyric voice. The ticket punch constrains the chest-opening beat, satisfying the micro-setting test for choice constraint. Sensory detail (lantern glow, mist, weathered boards) is purposeful and selective, though the ridgeway's "indirect routes" remain abstract choreography rather than spatial obstacles that alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cobalt fortress, frostbitten air, and dusty spiral staircase are vivid and consistent; the amber-to-copper discoloration functions as micro-setting that charges the closure image when it shifts in response to the bolt. Spatial choreography is clear (base of staircase, music room, spiral ascent). However, the nerve-regeneration timeframe and its bodily effects are never anchored in sensation—no tremor, heat, or perceptual shift that would ground "internal currents aligning"—so the setting's pressure on choice remains conceptual rather than tactile. The snow outside and frost-lined tiles recur purposefully but do not constrain a middle action.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.8)
    The ancient temple library is evoked through layered sensory detail ("scent of old papyrus and inevitable collapse," "shelves seemed to melt into the walls") that charges atmosphere. The iron gall ink pellet and the cracked crown function as micro-setting elements that constrain the titan's path and trigger the climactic collapse. Spatial choreography remains stable, and the courtyard finale anchors the exit. The setting does not, however, force a tactical choice at closure—it reacts rather than resists—keeping it shy of the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.8)
    The monitoring station, steel table, and torn atlas page anchor the scene adequately. The watermark reveal and canyon coordinate function as plot devices but do not constrain a character choice or charge the final image with embodied pressure. Sensory detail is present but generic—"quiet sensors," "measured breaths"—and the reef chemistry exposition arrives late without dramatized spatial or tactile consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.1)
    The repair bay supplies vivid catalog ("rusted cathedral," "cracked concrete," "shattered consoles") but most details remain postcard description; spatial choreography is unclear (where are the workers? how far is the control panel?). The opera glasses constrain one beat (tracing the glyph) and charge the final image, lifting the score into functional range. Timeframe "margin of daylight" drifts without evolving pressure; the sunrise at the end contradicts the earlier sunset slip.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.1)
    The volcanic hot springs, basalt, geysers, and amber pool are vividly named and sensory (steam, ash, candlelight). However, the environment never constrains a choice—Anara moves freely, the script decodes without obstacle, and the unseal ritual succeeds on first attempt. Spatial choreography is coherent but static; the setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure. The kite tangled among geysers is the closest to setting-as-constraint, but it's retrieved without difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.1)
    The arboretum perched on a seaside cliff supplies vivid sensory anchors (pine, rosemary, sea lavender, wind chimes, gulls) and the cliff edge recurs to frame her choice. The setting charges the final image—she walks "toward the cliff's edge, ready to plant her own beacon"—and the storm-scarred oak sapling serves as a micro-setting that constrains her kneeling gesture. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, earning higher credit despite some ornamental catalog moments early on.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse library, oak table, spiral stairwell, phosphorescent algae, and stone chamber anchor space clearly and guide Elian's physical descent. The narrow stairwell and sealed door constrain his path and the dark chamber forces reliance on algae-light, shaping the turn. Sensory detail (sea-salt fog, dust, old paper scent) is filtered through Elian's solitary perspective. The setting participates in closure: the lighthouse "hums" acknowledgment and the walls shift from pressing to supporting, charging the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.1)
    The wind-carved encampment and albino skin provide vivid anchors, and the disappearing-ink droplet is handled on the page. However, the setting remains postcard-level—stone walls "hum in sympathy" without constraining a single tactic or altering Kael's choices. Spatial choreography is vague: we never learn the encampment's size, layout, or relation to the dunes, and Kael's movement ("walked toward the horizon") lacks tactile grounding or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "echoing library under snow" is vivid and recurs across beats: frozen vellum, marble conduit, ice-bound masks, snowflakes on open pages, green shoots through marble. The setting supplies the conduit (a tool) that Maren uses to send the letter, and the final image charges with the thawing metaphor. However, the environment does not constrain a mid-scene choice or alter tactics; it functions more as atmospheric container than spatial crucible. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered, but the library's physicality rarely pressures Maren's decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.1)
    The glass dome and desert rose farm are anchored early and provide atmosphere. Spatial choreography is coherent (central greenhouse, fountain, perimeter). The sandbag and rose petals are handled on the page, but neither constrains a choice or alters tactics under pressure—they serve as symbolic props rather than functional setting elements that drive decision or charge the final image meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sound wave garden is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (swaying reeds, mossy stones, midnight flowers). The rail spike and garden environment recur across beats and charge the final image. However, setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choices or supplying resources that alter tactics. The micro-setting (spike, water's edge) participates in closure but does not force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    The observatory's dome, marble stair, and holographic console are vivid and purposeful. The rosewood nib functions as micro-setting (handled twice, inserted into console slot), constraining the cipher-solving turn and charging the final handoff. Spatial choreography remains clear. However, orientation debt (Q2 penalty applied) caps Q3 at 7.0 per the rubric, and the observatory's physical constraints do not materially shape Mira's choices—she moves freely without access, proximity, or environmental friction altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.1)
    The laboratory is vividly described with "ancient speakers," "ceiling of dim constellations painted in ash," and "cracked floorboards," establishing atmosphere. The amber functions as a recurring object across beats (tracing, stitching, pulsing) and charges the final image. However, the setting does not constrain Lyra's choices—she works "when time folds in on itself" without spatial or resource friction. No tools, access limits, or environmental obstacles shape her tactics; the laboratory supplies what is needed without resistance, keeping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.1)
    The grotto's mist and slick walls are vividly described and the tile flake functions as a recurring object. The sand mandala serves as micro-setting. However, neither environment nor object constrains a choice or alters tactics; they remain decorative anchors for atmosphere. The final image mentions the tile and mist but does not charge them with new meaning or consequence, keeping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.4)
    The ancient plaza and mosaic stepping stone recur throughout and anchor spatial choreography clearly. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraining choice or altering tactics—the protagonist kneels and traces patterns without environmental resistance or resource limitation. The "warm coldness" and "shattered sky" are repeated often but remain decorative metaphors rather than lived conditions that shape behavior. The mosaic's "chipped patterns" appear in multiple beats but do not impose visible cost or friction on the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.1)
    The mystic orchard supplies vivid sensory texture—glowing apples, cinnamon scent, luminous notes—and the hedge maze provides spatial staging for the ghost's performance. The orchard actively responds to the ghost's song, creating a micro-setting that charges the final image. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as backdrop and amplifier rather than crucible. The gate for 9+ (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is partially met through the responsive orchard at closure, lifting the score into mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.1)
    The studio setting is anchored with specific sensory elements (neon ribbons, cracked panes, programmable LEDs) and the muscovite geode is handled across multiple beats. However, the environment functions as backdrop rather than constraint: Mara's choices are not shaped by spatial access, resource scarcity, or environmental friction. The geode's "opalescent veins" and "crystalline geometry" are described but their physical properties do not alter her tactics or force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.1)
    The coastal cave network is vividly rendered with mineral filaments, vapor droplets, and amber glow, but setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint. No choice is narrowed by access, proximity, or resource; the cavern breathes and shimmers on cue to support atmosphere without altering tactics. Micro-setting (the basin, the leaf) is handled but does not charge the closure image with a felt cost tied to spatial logic.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.1)
    The amber warehouse beneath cliffs anchors the piece spatially, and details like "dust," "dim heart," and "canyon echo in a jar" establish atmosphere. However, the environment never constrains a choice or supplies friction; Mara moves freely, the jar vibrates on cue, and the bridge forms without resource cost. The recurring amber glow charges the mood but does not alter tactics or shape the closure decision. Sensory detail trends generic ("amber glow," "soft, approving sigh") and lacks POV-filtered specificity or urgency modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.1)
    The zephyr bluff and mist provide atmospheric anchoring, and the valley altar offers spatial specificity. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop for symbolic action rather than constraining choices—the spy's descent and ritual proceed without environmental resistance or resource scarcity. The engraved pillbox is handled across multiple beats (clutched, aligned, placed, opened) and its compartments matter to the sequence, elevating it to micro-setting status. Sensory detail leans visual and generic ("silver hush," "pale glow") without POV-specific filtering.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.1)
    The fog-bound river crossing is vividly rendered with tactile detail (spindrift, wet stone, muddy path). Sensory selection is consistent and POV-filtered through Arlen's contemplative stance. The environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it remains atmospheric backdrop. The rain-gutter ticking provides temporal texture but does not pressure decision. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.1)
    The abandoned beekeeping oasis, cracked dunes, dead beehive, and lone cactus are vividly anchored and purposefully deployed. Spatial choreography is clear: Mara moves from the oasis heart to the stone altar, traces sun patterns to the hive, and exits across the dunes. The lantern's placement on the altar and movement across the stone tie setting to action. The oasis's fractured-timeline premise charges the environment conceptually, and the dormant hive's awakening depends on proximity and light. Micro-setting (body, lantern, stone) shapes the ending image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.4)
    The harbor, fire escape, and rosebush anchor space and atmosphere early; sensory details (silver ribbons on tide, rusted metal, sputtering lanterns) are vivid and filtered through Mara's purposeful gaze. The vines and their glow constrain her method (she adjusts a latch, plants along the ledge) and charge the final image (still glowing at dawn), satisfying the 9+ gate test for environment shaping choice. However, spatial choreography blurs—her position on "the narrow ledge" versus "the dock's edge" is not clearly tracked, and the alleys' relationship to the fire escape remains vague, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.1)
    Vivid imagery ("tide of clouds," "shelves floated like kelp," "sea of ink") remains postcard description without constraining a single choice or altering tactics. The brass sundial is handled repeatedly but its "atomically reflective surface" never blocks or enables an action with cost. Spatial choreography is vague—Mira "walks," "steps," "places" without clear before/after positioning or distance tracking. No environmental detail pressures the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lotus temple, pond, and spiral are vividly described with prismatic detail, but setting remains postcard backdrop. The spiral does not constrain a choice—Mira steps onto it without resistance or tactical shift. The "mosaic of whispered confessions" and "cascade of silver light" are visual spectacle without spatial consequence or resource cost.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=3.1)
    The radio station, campus, and console remain postcard backdrops; no tool, body constraint, or spatial detail alters a single choice. "Dust-touched charts" and "old console" are mentioned but never handled in a way that shapes tactics. The setting functions as interchangeable scenery rather than pressuring decisions or charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.6)
    The organ and cavern are vivid as atmosphere but do not constrain a middle choice—the compass solves spatial problems without the environment resisting. The luminescent fungi garden arrives late as reward rather than obstacle. Spatial choreography weakens when "the cavern walls quivered" and "passage unfolded" without legible mechanics tying compass geometry to stone yielding. The 9+ gate fails: no environment, body, tool, or object constrains a choice or charges the final image with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.1)
    The quarry is described with atmospheric density ("perpetual veil of mist," "thin line of blood"), and the ribbon fragment and limestone slab provide concrete anchors. However, setting remains decorative: the mist and stone do not constrain Mara's actions or alter her tactics. The fissure's reveal of names arrives late without prior setup, functioning as deus ex rather than earned discovery. Spatial choreography is vague—easel placement, Mara's movement, and prop distances never become legible.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.1)
    The weather station setting is named and furnished with details (tin roof, wind turbine, chamber smelling of iron and seaweed), but these remain decorative; no environmental constraint shapes a choice or tactic. The copper nail and compass are handled twice, satisfying minimal object presence, yet their physical properties do not alter Mara's options. Spatial choreography is coherent across the descent and chamber scene, and the sensory detail is vivid, lifting the score above purely generic placeholder work.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.1)
    The mountain pullout, ridge, and wet-plate glass constrain the fiddler's movements and the ritual sequence unfolds through spatial progression (pullout → trek → summit). Sensory detail is vivid but often decorative ("amber light," "granite face glowing") rather than filtered through urgent POV priorities. The wet-plate glass and scaffold-wrap map function as micro-setting elements that enable the climactic action, lifting the score into mid-band; however, the environment does not pressure a difficult choice—it simply hosts the ritual. The pullout itself is underused after the opening, becoming a postcard backdrop rather than a resource or constraint that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.1)
    The abandoned circus train is vividly rendered ("rusted caravan of cracked wagons…faded banners and empty seats"), and the warehouse office provides dusky light as a recurring atmospheric tag. However, neither setting constrains a choice at a pivotal moment. The foreign notes pinned in the train are handled descriptively, but they do not pressure Arlen's tactics or alter his options on the page. The co-working space at the end is named but not used; the train remains postcard atmosphere rather than a micro-setting that tilts the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.1)
    The observatory setting is vividly described—"marble chair," "telescope lenses," "dome opened"—and the variable stars provide atmospheric texture. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; Mara moves freely through the space, and props appear when needed without spatial friction. The daylily telegram and crystal function as thematic tokens rather than objects that force trade-offs. Micro-setting potential exists but is not leveraged for pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.6)
    Setting details are vivid but ornamental: the vortex, orchard, and lake are described yet never constrain a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome. The "swirling orchard vortex" and "expanding circles of ancient rune-lit water" function as postcard backdrops rather than micro-settings that shape tactics. Spatial choreography is unclear—the druid "steps into the vortex," trees "bend outward," but her position and the mechanics of her movement remain abstract. The amulet's retrieval and the seed's placement occur without spatial grounding or cost tied to the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cobalt glade is mentioned in the opening and closing but does not constrain a single choice; it functions as backdrop. The maze topiary is described extensively yet never blocks, redirects, or alters her path—hedges "part like a living key" on command. Spatial choreography is generic: "center," "nearest hedge," "hidden alcove" provide no layout clarity or tactical consequence. The "perfectly cut maze topiary clipping" is introduced late and handled once without physical or mechanical detail.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered with skeletal trees, roots snaking through bones, and half-lit corridors that create a coherent atmosphere. Sensory detail (chill of centuries, faint luminescence, scent of incense) is selective and purposeful. The hollow among the bones becomes a micro-setting that constrains Maelia's final action—placing the card there is not arbitrary—and the amber thread charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.1)
    The quarry office trailer is mentioned but never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome; it serves as atmospheric backdrop. The speaker grille cloth scrap recurs but functions as symbolic ornament rather than a tool or object that pressures decisions. Sensory detail is present (amber dust, corrugated walls) yet filtered through abstract metaphor ("valley longing") instead of POV-specific professional or tactile perception.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.4)
    The magnetic arbor is vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (iron-kissed leaves, oscillating twig, silver particles) and its resonant frequencies provide concrete texture. The arbor constrains Lira's choice of branch and enables the seed's interaction, pushing the score toward functional integration. However, spatial choreography remains vague—Lira's position on the branch, her movements, and the arbor's scale lack coherent tracking. The body as micro-setting is underused; we don't feel her balance, grip, or physical negotiation with the floating environment.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal atrium is vividly rendered with recurring sensory anchors (silver water, marble arches, pale teal at crescent, amber at full moon) that modulate through the piece. The setting's tidal rhythm and moon-phase lighting constrain the librarian's perception (gears turn slower when light is thin) and charge the final image (creel glowing under waning moon). The fisherman's creel functions as micro-setting, its bamboo fibers and brine scent grounding the abstract stakes. Spatial choreography remains coherent across beats (furnace in atrium, creel on desk, water lapping arches), and the wintersun glow provides consistent atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.8)
    The crystal caves supply vivid sensory anchors—quartz prisms, lavender pool, golden cascade—and the setting participates in closure (the "halo of hope" crowning the ceiling). However, the cave never constrains a choice or alters Mara's tactics; it functions as a decorative stage for the ritual. The pearl's pedestal and the seashell's spiral are handled, meeting the micro-setting allowance, but their presence is ornamental rather than pressuring.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.4)
    The disused station, cracked tiles, ivy, tunnel, and river are rendered with vivid sensory particulars ("air smelled of rust and rain," "water dark and truthful"). The graffiti and tunnel constrain the protagonist's path, and the river functions as both setting and witness, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent across moves. The accordion bellows and patched coat anchor micro-setting through tactile handling, though the setting itself does not force a choice with immediate consequence—it amplifies rather than complicates the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "glowing library in mist" functions as generic atmosphere rather than a constraint; spatial choreography collapses across the alcove-chamber-labyrinth-garden sequence with no stable anchors. Sensory detail cycles through "glow," "shimmer," "hum," "mist" without POV filter or tactical relevance. The watch and crystal are handled on the page but their physical properties (brass, gears, ticking) never shape a choice. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.3 to −0.5) was applied in Q2; here the setting's failure to constrain any decision limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.6)
    The observatory is described lavishly ("velvet," "brass," "vaulted ceiling") but remains a postcard rather than a constraint on choice. Spatial choreography is unclear: Elara adjusts a telescope, lifts a violin, places it on a desk, and the envoy appears on a balcony with no prior spatial setup. The ice violin's "chill seep[ing] into her bones" offers one embodied moment, but the object does not constrain a tactic. The orientation penalty in Q2 caps this category at 7.0, but execution would not reach that ceiling regardless.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.1)
    The grotto's luminous stone walls, moonstone slab, and drifting clouds are vivid and purposefully filtered through the protagonist's ritual attention. The aurora functions as both setting and resource, its dimming after the transfer providing environmental response that charges the moment. The emerald chip on the moonstone slab becomes a micro-setting focal point that constrains her brush technique. Sensory detail is consistent but leans heavily visual; the "cold wind" and "radiant hush" arrive late and could have shaped earlier choices.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.4)
    The umbral grotto, vineyard terraces, and cloud-pierced ceiling are vivid and selective, filtered through Mara's care-driven attention (cool stone, fermented grape scent, violet haze). Spatial choreography is clear across moves. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image in a way that would elevate the score: the grotto provides atmosphere but does not alter tactics or impose cost. Micro-setting (the hairpin on the altar) is present but ornamental rather than pressure-bearing.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lighthouse at dawn is vividly rendered with wind chimes, sea, stone, and lantern light, and these elements recur across the piece. The wind chimes constrain Mara's method (she deciphers their pattern) and the lantern's flicker serves as a diagnostic tool, giving micro-setting function. However, spatial choreography is thin—Mara moves from balcony to floor to stairs without clear blocking—and the environment never forces a tactical choice or alters the outcome; it provides atmosphere and symbolic resonance but does not pressure the central action.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.4)
    The floating platform, pond, and magnetic grotto are vividly rendered with consistent sensory anchors (ozone, iron veins, obsidian walls). However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the magnetic pull and iron filings are described but do not constrain a tactical choice. The pond's ripple-rings are said to "guide her steps" and form "a lattice of symbols," yet the specific mechanics of navigation remain abstract. Strong atmospheric detail that supports tone but stops short of pressuring decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.1)
    The canyon and towers of bone supply vivid atmospheric detail and the arrowhead is handled twice (placement on platform, lifted at end), meeting the micro-setting and object tests. However, environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it remains backdrop. The final image invokes the canyon's "echo" but does not show the setting forcing a decision or providing a resource that changes the outcome, keeping the score in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.1)
    The icebound spire, mist, and keystone are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("thin veil of frost," "luminous fog," "faint chime"). Spatial choreography is coherent: base → ledge → summit. The keystone anchors the final beat and the mist enables the crossing, satisfying the micro-setting constraint test. However, the environment does not meaningfully narrow Selric's options; the mist "accommodates impossibilities" by fiat, removing rather than imposing constraint. The closure image charges the spire ("icy walls reflecting brilliant dimness") but does not make the setting indispensable to the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.4)
    Vivid, lyrical images (sea-glass windows, coral-like shelves, floating tomes) anchor the pier and sunken library with sensory specificity and tonal coherence. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; Eli moves through spaces without friction, and the setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure. The library's mechanics (pages turning without wind, colors emitting from books) are asserted but not explored in ways that shape Eli's decisions. Spatial choreography is clear, and the tone is consistent, but the micro-setting does not charge the final image or force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "ambered observatory deck" and "violet mist" are vivid and consistently tracked, and the deck's cracking glass at the end charges the final image with a micro-constraint (the void "whispering in"). The coins function as a recurring object that shifts meaning across beats. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the setting reflects Silas's isolation and purpose. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice; it remains atmospheric rather than forcing tactical adaptation, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.1)
    The observatory's cracked dome and rusted lenses provide vivid anchoring. The atlas page and crystals function as micro-setting objects that shape the naming sequence. However, the environment does not constrain choice—Lira proceeds unimpeded through each naming. The final constellation image charges the closure moment, lifting the score into mid-band despite the largely postcard-descriptive treatment of the stone arches and amber dusk.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sapphire viaduct supplies vivid sensory anchors (dawn light, mist droplets, refracted rays) and the dripping-rate method grounds the rebuilding in observable environmental detail. The bell fragments respond to the rhythm, which ties setting to action. However, spatial choreography remains vague—how the mage arranges pieces, where he stands, how proximity or access constrains him—and the setting does not force a trade-off or narrow his options during the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    Setting anchors early (ridgeway, reservoir, embankment) with sensory detail (silver ribbon, pine, sapphire hue, lantern glow). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly. However, the ridgeway does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains postcard backdrop. The label and chime are handled but do not pressure decisions. Micro-setting allowance not met; the 9+ gate (environment/tool/object constrains choice or charges final image) is unfulfilled, capping at 8.8. Sensory selection lacks urgency filter—crisis perception would narrow, but detail density stays uniform.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.1)
    The hidden orchard, kaleidoscopic waterfall, and stone circle are vividly described and remain spatially coherent. However, setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint; no environmental feature limits Selene's options or alters tactics. The frescoes appear once without shaping choice. Sensory detail is dense but filtered through generic lyricism rather than Selene's professional or emotional priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.1)
    The arbor, parachute buckle, and harness provide tactile anchors—moss-dulled metal, vine reinforcement, the buckle's "gentle bite"—that ground the seeker's work. Spatial choreography (climb, branch, descent, misty ground) remains legible. However, the "nocturnal arbor above the clouds" functions more as atmospheric backdrop than constraint; no environmental detail (wind shift, leaf cascade) alters a choice or tactic during the revision. The buckle and harness recur and charge the ending, satisfying the micro-setting allowance, but the arbor itself never pressures the protagonist's options.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.1)
    The floating dojo and "sea of shifting chronologies" are vivid in concept but remain postcard description; no environmental constraint shapes Kael's tactics or the jar-slicing act. The basalt platform, glass cylinder, and luminous fluid are present across beats and return at closure, qualifying micro-setting use. Sensory detail is selective but often generic ("dawn light," "low vibrant hum") without POV-specific filtering. Spatial choreography is clear enough for the single scene, though the Guardians and Syndicate's positions are vague.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.1)
    The echo chamber tunnel is vividly described and recurs throughout, anchoring the action. However, it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice or providing resources that alter outcome. The leaf blower and pull cord are handled, yet their mechanics never force a tactical shift. Spatial choreography remains abstract; the alcove with the photograph and the house beyond are stages for effects, not pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.1)
    The frozen garden and mist are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (frost-bitten volumes, skeletal birches, amber glow). However, the environment functions primarily as symbolic backdrop rather than constraining choice or altering tactics; the guardian's actions (stalking, waiting, approaching the pendant) would play identically in any setting. The pendant's placement "half-buried in the snow" is the sole moment where setting intersects with plot. Spatial choreography of the "new wing" and visitor traffic is gestured at but not grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    The ember nexus is described vividly ("amber gloom," "frozen bloom") and recurs across beats, but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it functions as backdrop rather than pressure. Spatial choreography is unclear: the nexus, tower, market square, and "realm" float without legible distance or layout. The crozier's physical handling (brushing liquid, watching metal sigh) grounds some moments, and the final placement "at the heart of the nexus" charges the ending image enough to lift the score into mid-6s despite the cap from orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.4)
    The suspended city and gorge setting are vividly rendered with concrete sensory detail (rusted towers, humming cables, silver-tinted beams during lunar perigee). The antenna's spiral stairwell and quantum coil provide tangible props that Selin interacts with across multiple beats. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining her choices or altering tactics; she climbs, places the shard, and succeeds without environmental resistance or spatial complication that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.1)
    The spectral grotto and starlight imagery are vivid and consistent, and the radio functions as a tool in the climax. However, the setting does not constrain choice or alter tactics; Lio never struggles with access, proximity, or environmental limits. Spatial choreography is clean (boots on deck, hourglass above helm), but the grotto remains a postcard backdrop rather than a pressure on action.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "optical illusion gallery" is described in high metaphor but never functions as setting: no object, wall, or spatial constraint shapes a choice or alters the protagonist's options. Orientation debt compounds the harm—by line 120, we still lack clear "where" anchors (a room? corridor? courtyard?). Sensory detail is stacked but generic ("liquid glass," "cascades of color") without POV filter or purpose. The pedestal, courtyard, and bridge appear without spatial logic or causal link to prior moves.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.8)
    The benthic setting is vividly rendered with bioluminescent algae, pressure-hardened basalt, glass corridors, and coral arches—specific, coherent details that establish atmosphere. However, setting remains decorative; no environmental constraint forces a choice or alters tactics. Spatial choreography is minimal (Mira stands, walks, traces constellations) and the test vessel's movement is told rather than shown with tactile proximity. The anchor chain link appears as a symbolic object but is never handled in a way that constrains action.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.1)
    The mist-clad atrium, marble bench, statues, and ivy-draped alcove are vividly described and tonally coherent. However, the setting functions as postcard backdrop rather than constraint; no environmental detail pressures a choice or alters the protagonist's tactics. The hearing aid and photograph are handled, but spatial choreography remains vague—"vaulted corridors," "cracked balustrade," and "sealed alcove" are mentioned without clear navigation or cost of access. The micro-setting (body, tool) does not constrain the final moment; the protagonist simply raises the hearing aid and the chord resolves, making the environment ornamental rather than integral.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.4)
    Facility details (rusted doors, coiled cable farms, translucent walls) are vivid and purposeful, and the tidal apex triggers the phase arrays, giving environment a role in the sequence. The codex itself—water-soaked vellum, phosphorescent ink, gold flecks—is handled in multiple beats and charges the final image. However, the cavernous chamber and the sand outside remain postcard backdrops; spatial choreography inside the facility is vague, and no micro-setting detail (tool, body constraint, or object proximity) alters a tactic at a choice point.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.6)
    The opal observatory and porcelain shard receive vivid imagery ("frozen lantern," "smooth edge catching pale lantern light"), but spatial choreography remains vague—console, roof, and kitchen positions are unclear. The shard functions as a tool in the ink ritual and returns warm at closure, constraining one choice and charging the final image, which narrowly qualifies the 9+ gate. However, the ink patterns and quantum server remain abstract; no sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's urgency or professional lens.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.4)
    The canyon, bone towers, and echo tunnel are vivid and purposefully atmospheric. The flawed diamond and the birds function as micro-setting elements that shape the ritual sequence. Sensory detail is dense but often ornamental (e.g., "perpetual dusk," "amber haze") rather than constraining choice. The birds' flight patterns do inform the storyteller's method, elevating integration slightly, but the environment does not force a trade-off or constrain the final outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.1)
    The underground garden supplies vivid sensory fragments—phosphorescent moss, frost on stone benches, iron grated chute—but spatial choreography is unclear (how large is the space? where does the phone rest relative to the chute?). The arrowhead's "gravitationally playful pull" and the vines forming a scaffold read as magical set-dressing rather than environment constraining choice. Micro-setting potential exists (the arrowhead on moss, frost as frozen hope) but these details are described rather than dramatized as obstacles or resources that alter the protagonist's tactics. The garden seals "like a promise" at the end, charging the final image, which lifts the score modestly despite the lack of mid-scene spatial pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.8)
    Setting anchors are present (rust-clad towers, sky-bridge, orchard rows, bronze statues) and the "enchanted orchard" frames the action spatially. The locust shell appears in multiple beats, and the orchard's transformation (roots breaking metal-reinforced soil) does alter the final state. However, the environment never constrains a protagonist choice or forces a tactical trade-off; all elements comply with the violinist's music without friction, reducing setting to scenic backdrop rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cobalt arcade is vivid in texture—neon, rows of machines, cracked floor tiles—but remains postcard backdrop until the storm's rain "seeped into the cracked floor tiles" in the final third, a moment that gestures toward environment shaping outcome but arrives too late and too abstractly to constrain a prior choice. Spatial choreography is vague: the "central console," drone hatch, and Milo's position relative to the border are never anchored, making the climax (bottle set, drone retreats, envelope slipped) float rather than land with tactile specificity. The "day's lone mail drop" timeframe is mentioned twice but never tightens a decision; the twilight setting modulates atmosphere without pressing Milo's window of action.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.1)
    The abandoned circus train, carousel, and underground cavern are vividly described with consistent sensory detail (soot-blackened pine, brass lilies, misting hush). However, spatial choreography falters—Mara kneels, then a door "behind her" opens, yet we never learned the carriage layout. The halo fragment and wind bells recur but function as atmosphere rather than constraints; no environmental feature forces a choice or alters tactics. Micro-setting potential exists but remains ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    The scientific poetry library supplies vivid, purpose-driven images: glowing shelves with equations in rhyme, vellum rustling, ozone scent. The tattered silk scarf functions as a recurring object that charges the ending moment when tucked back into Mara's coat. Spatial choreography (aisles, atrium, desk beneath black-hole poems) remains clear. However, the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a tactical obstacle; it serves as atmospheric backdrop rather than crucible, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.1)
    The whispering archipelago, lighthouse library, and sunrise setting provide vivid sensory anchors (sea breezes, crumbling stairwell, soft blues and amber). The watercolor palette and camera function as micro-setting that constrains Mara's ritual. However, spatial choreography is fuzzy—Lio's boat, the cliff, and the water lack clear distances or sightlines. The setting enables atmosphere but does not pressure a choice at closure, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.0)
    The nexus under starlight and the lock of hair both anchor the scene early and supply recurring sensory markers (starlight pulse, ribbon flutter, silvered cobblestones). The disorienting path directly affects the locksmith's movement, and the first star functions as a map that shapes his approach. However, setting remains largely postcard: "shadowed nexus," "hush of cosmic possibility," and "tapestry woven from forgotten dreams" float without grounding the reader in a specific, constraint-imposing locale. No tool, body limitation, or spatial obstacle forces a tactical choice at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.1)
    The greenhouse-and-shipwrecks setting supplies vivid anchor details (rusted hulls, kelp-tangled sextant, brine-laden air) and the fairy ring's spatial pattern does enable the final ritual. However, the environment never constrains a choice—no moment where tidal timing, wreck instability, or fungal toxicity forces a tactical tradeoff. The setting decorates rather than pressures, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.1)
    The forgotten library supplies vivid anchors (dust, cracked teacups, vaulted ceiling, pine-scented hidden chamber) and the micro-objects (afternoon shadow in glass, tea leaves) appear in multiple beats. However, the setting never constrains a choice—every door opens, every manuscript yields, every alignment succeeds—so it functions as backdrop rather than pressure. The swing outside offers atmospheric repetition but no causal role. Spatial choreography is clear, and the sensory selection (metallic hymn of chains, smell of pine) is purposeful, lifting the score into mid-band despite the lack of constraint-driven choice.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.1)
    The waterfall and parapet anchor space early. Sensory detail leans visual and abstract ("liquid amber," "radiant hush," "hues of sunrise and midnight") without micro-setting pressure that constrains a choice. The seed drinks mist, spores settle on branches, the traveler arrives—all occur in a frictionless environment that never limits access or alters tactics. The verdant parapet does not charge the final image; it remains postcard backdrop throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prism sanctuary, starlight, and altar are vividly described with consistent sensory detail (refracted colors, echoing water, hush). However, setting remains scenic backdrop rather than constraint: Elara could perform this ritual in any mystical space with minimal rewrite. The tapestry needle and fisherman's net do charge the final image by returning in the closure paragraph, lifting the score modestly. Spatial choreography is clean, but no environmental feature narrows her options or shapes a key choice.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.6)
    The rain-scoured vault and ancient henge are vividly described but remain postcard backdrops; neither constrains a choice. Spatial choreography is murky: the protagonist enters a vault "beneath" the henge, yet the henge is described as "beyond the chapel," creating impossible geography. The projector and overlapping videos function as props without altering tactics. The cap from Q2 orientation debt (7.0) is superseded by execution quality here, but the setting does not charge the final image or pressure a turn.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sunken ship library supplies vivid, POV-filtered detail (algae, brass microphone, tangled copper). The snow globe appears in multiple beats and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent. However, the environment does not constrain a single on-page choice; Mort floats freely without friction. Micro-setting (console, globe) functions as charged object but not as setting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.1)
    The courtyard above clouds, bolt plate, and graffiti-covered arches provide vivid anchors. The flower press bolt plate constrains two on-page beats (midnight blossom, sunrise tulip), and the mist/lightning timeframe shapes pacing. Spatial choreography is clear (arches, walls, stone pores). The micro-setting charges the final image when travelers press fresh blossoms, turning the space into a living archive—environment evolves causally and participates in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.4)
    The icebound spire, frost-etched windows, and scattered light create vivid atmosphere and the elevator's ten-floor climb structures the descent. However, the environment never constrains a choice; the brass chest, diary, and crystal jars are stage-set pieces that the servant accesses without friction. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered, but spatial choreography (ledge "near the ceiling," winding stairs as "frozen helix") serves description more than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sky gondola and brass telescope are established early and return at closure, but they do not constrain choice—Aria could conduct her vigil anywhere. Sensory detail ("dust-laden starlight," "amber hush") is vivid yet remains static decoration rather than shaping tactics. The gondola's broken strings serve as symbolic backdrop without altering spatial possibilities or imposing physical limits on her movements.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    The hollowed tree trunk library supplies vivid, particular imagery: bark-lined aisles, leaf-filled windows, pigments catching fire on rough bark. The coin's grooves and the secret safe are handled on the page. However, setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Lira's process unfolds without friction from the condemned space or the impending demolition. Cap at 7.0 applied per orientation debt in Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.1)
    The airship and its brass hull, copper pipes, and lanterns supply vivid sensory anchors. The hopscotch board and phrasebook are concrete objects, yet they function as plot tokens rather than constraints—Lira interacts with them once each without spatial friction or evolving difficulty. Spatial choreography is legible (cabin, deck, portholes) but static; the environment does not pressure her choices or charge the final image beyond atmospheric decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    The frozen library, mirrored hall, and gear pedestal are vividly rendered and spatially coherent. The gear assortment constrains the locksmith's task (he must assemble it), and the mirror hall returns at closure, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, filtered through the locksmith's quest, though the environment itself does not force a tactical choice that alters outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.1)
    The orchard planet, twin suns, floating rock arches, and firefly nebula are vividly described but remain postcard backdrops—no environmental constraint shapes a choice or alters tactics. The bell is handled at the end, yet its mechanics do not constrain the attempt. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric but does not pressure the protagonists' moves or charge the closure image with a spatial or material trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lighthouse setting is vividly rendered ("scarred thumb," "stone ribs," "nested patterns of wind") and anchors the atmosphere. However, it functions as backdrop rather than constraint: Elara's actions are unimpeded by the environment, and the dial, pane, and gears respond cooperatively without spatial friction. The broken puppet head and brass dial charge the final image, meeting the micro-setting allowance, but the cliff, sea, and interior architecture remain decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, and frost timeline create purposeful constraint: the night-frost deadline tightens the ritual window, and the altar stump anchors the climax spatially. Sensory detail (humming gears, amber eyes, frost threat) is selective and pressure-driven. The nut's glow and root-light charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test (object constrains choice and charges closure). Spatial choreography remains clear across the maze walk to the stump, and the environment evolves causally (frost retreats, light blooms).

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.4)
    The braided ravine is vividly rendered with foam lattice and sensory detail filtered through Mara's scientific lens. The setting constrains her initial insight and supplies the reeds for the scaffold, pushing into the 6-band. However, occupational verisimilitude is thin—polymer self-assembly guided by "natural flow" reads implausible without mechanism. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glass orchard library, swirling clouds, translucent bark, and vapor notebook are vivid and sensory, establishing a dreamlike register. However, setting remains ornamental: no environmental constraint shapes a choice, no spatial detail alters tactics, and the final image does not depend on a specific property of the world. The 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges closure) is not met, capping the score at 8.8; execution stays in the mid-band because description is atmospheric but does not pressure the vendor's path.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.1)
    The desert fortress after rain, tidal pools, and the coral pavilion are vivid and purposefully layered with sensory specifics (slick walls, brine droplets, blue glow). The pavilion constrains Lir's actions—he must touch it to subsume remorse—and the cracking coral signals a shift at closure, charging the final image with visible change. Spatial choreography is clear and the recurring objects (coral, pools, stone) anchor the accumulative design, though the "beneath the dunes" geography is established but not exploited for tactical friction.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.1)
    The clock tower interior ("gears and constellations," "stained glass," "brass balcony") and silos are evoked through ornamental description but do not constrain choice or alter tactics. The cuckoo clock weight is retrieved and replaced, yet its mechanics (how dropping it summons workers, how bridges are built between towering silos in one night) remain unexplained. Spatial choreography is unclear: workers "emerged" from silos and "laid wooden planks between towering silos" with no physical grounding. The setting supplies atmosphere but does not pressure the librarian's actions or charge the final image with tactical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    Moonlit canyon, basalt column, and the broken mirror provide vivid anchors and sensory detail (silver cliffs, liquid quartz moonlight, humming shards). The mirror's shards align with fissures in stone, creating a micro-setting that constrains Aria's method and charges the final tableau. However, the environment does not force a tactical choice or alter her approach under pressure; the tremor is noted but does not redirect action. Sensory selection is largely atmospheric rather than filtered through Aria's professional or personal priorities, reading closer to travelogue than lived urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.1)
    The serpentine grotto is vividly rendered with glittering mist and floating columns, and the inverted-gravity hour supplies a memorable atmospheric constraint. However, the setting does not alter Liora's tactics or force a choice—she walks through, aligns symbols, gathers seedlings, and leaves. The recurring manuscript doodle and the seedlings function as setting-adjacent objects but their role in constraining action is minimal; they guide rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.1)
    The siskin alder grove is anchored early with vivid sensory detail ("leaves whispered like distant flutes," "dappled light"). The porcelain insulator and twisted alder sculpture function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. However, the environment does not constrain choice or alter tactics—Auris moves through the space without friction, and the grove serves as atmospheric backdrop rather than a force that shapes his actions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "rust-colored dunes," "crimson sky," and "magnetic nexus at twilight" provide vivid color and atmosphere but remain postcard description—no spatial choreography (distances, access, obstacles) constrains the tutor's choices. The basalt stone is handled twice (warms, glows) and the imagined sky-board returns at closure, offering minimal constraint but charging the final image enough to enter mid-band. Sensory selection defaults to visual (sky, star, shadow) without hierarchy shaped by professional or personal priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.1)
    The workshop is vividly described ("iron ribs humming with unseen currents," "windows black as midnight parchment") but functions as backdrop rather than constraint; tools hang passively, and the crystal plates appear without spatial grounding. The diary clasp and its mechanics are told rather than handled on the page. The rooftop appearance in the final third shifts location without transition or spatial choreography, and the fireworks crowd remains entirely abstract. Micro-setting elements (clasp, plates) are introduced but do not constrain the protagonist's choices or alter his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.1)
    The treetop village and birch trunk are vividly rendered, but they do not constrain choice or alter tactics—Lira's cultivation succeeds without spatial friction. Sensory detail ("olfactorily sensitive," "wildflower hush") is repeated but does not shift with urgency or force a micro-decision. The setting decorates rather than pressures; no environmental cost shapes the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating rock arches, inverted rivers, and phosphorescent leaves create vivid, purpose-driven atmosphere that supports the accumulative lens. The inverted-gravity hour constrains Mira's flight path and enables the discovery beat. The broken arrow tip—handled twice (brush/lift, then release into basin)—functions as micro-setting object that charges the final image. Sensory selection (glint, hum, chime, glow) reflects urgency and filters through Mira's professional focus. Minor: some details (translucent coral, kelp metaphor) lean ornamental but remain tonally coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.1)
    The shipping-container labyrinth is vividly realized with "canyon-like streets," "rusted steel," and wind channeling through metal walls. Sensory details (anemometer's "red needle trembling like a nervous heart") are specific and purposeful. The patch anchors on the map and the tarp-as-canvas ground the investigator's process. The setting constrains movement and channels wind, directly shaping Mara's survey tactics and the final convergence point.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ice cavern is vividly described with aurora-veined frost and breathing ice, and the amber sheet glows concretely. However, the setting does not constrain a single choice or alter tactics; it remains a painted backdrop. The micro-setting option (body, tool, object) is not leveraged to charge the closure, which itself is absent. Spatial choreography is clear, but the environment never pressures the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.1)
    Thunder-echo range, canyon hush, and driftwood markers are vivid and recur with purpose. The gilded flute constrains the seam-opening action, charging the final image when placed at the fire's edge. Spatial choreography (stone shelter, ridge, outcrop, cliff) tracks clearly. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered, though some phrasing ("avalanchingly quiet," "texture of possibility") leans abstract rather than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.1)
    The topaz workshop and halo fragment receive vivid sensory treatment (walls pulsing violet, light refracting through dust), and the brass cradle and ink are handled across beats. However, none of these constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—they function as atmospheric backdrop. The body and tools (press, ink, copper plates) are described but do not shape Mara's tactics or the ending's charge, keeping the score in the functional-but-replaceable band.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (ribbons of light, shifting greens and violets, natural cathedral). The pendant functions as micro-setting object, handled across multiple beats and physically present in key moments. However, neither environment nor object constrains a choice at closure; the ridgeway serves as backdrop and the pendant operates frictionlessly. Spatial choreography is clear (firepit, hill, mist) and idiom fits the mythic register.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.4)
    The quartz arbor, mist, frost patterns, and car windshield are vividly rendered and filtered through Liora's mystic sensibility. Spatial choreography is clear (prism placed against glass, light spreading through cabin). The frost patterns constrain her method—she aligns the prism's facets with "the most intricate frost spirals, as if matching teeth in a secret lock"—demonstrating purposeful environmental interaction. However, the arbor itself remains largely decorative postcard backdrop rather than pressuring choices or supplying resources that alter outcome, and the sedan's presence feels convenient rather than motivated by prior world logic.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.1)
    The orchard and bamboo forest are anchored early with selective sensory detail (dew-slick ground, plum blossoms like snow, bamboo brushing cheeks). The amber bead functions as a micro-setting element that constrains the ritual: its light guides placement and charges the pedestal, enabling the thread's rise. However, the orchard itself does not pressure Mara's choices—she follows a prescribed path without spatial obstacles or environmental friction altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.1)
    Vivid images (sapphire fruit, floating rock arches, azure glyphs, crystal veins) create atmosphere, but spatial choreography is vague—mine shafts "beneath the orchard's roots," cavern distance unstated, forge placement "beneath one arch" without tactical detail. The silk's tactile moment ("wind caught in cotton") is brief; its wrapping around the forge and infusing strikes is asserted rather than shown constraining or enabling a choice. The orchard and arches frame the piece but do not pressure the blacksmith's decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.8)
    The bay's cracked floor, rusted hulls, and flickering fluorescents anchor place, but spatial choreography is unclear—Lira spreads maps "across the concrete," steps "through" a slit, yet her physical position relative to conduit, fuel line, and crew remains vague. The green shard recurs and charges the ending when it fractures, lifting the score toward mid-band. Sensory detail skews visual and abstract ("lattice of possibilities," "ribbons of light") without embodied texture that would constrain choice.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.4)
    The haunted lantern room is vividly sketched with sensory detail (iron ribs, cold stone, broken panes). The sea glass and river stones supply tactile anchors, and spatial choreography remains coherent. However, the setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics; Marek's ritual proceeds uninterrupted by environmental pressure. The "haunted" label and the lamp flickering out promise stakes that never materialize in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.1)
    The emerald lighthouse, basalt steps, and sapphire currents supply vivid color but remain postcard description; none constrains a choice or alters tactics. The glass lantern wick and prism are handled across beats, but spatial choreography is vague—where the cairn sits relative to the lighthouse, how the beam physically travels underwater, and the mechanics of "total internal reflection" are never grounded in action. The setting supplies atmosphere but does not pressure the ritual or outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.8)
    The floating rock tea house, blue morpho wing, and crystal gardens supply vivid, high-register imagery, but spatial choreography is incoherent: Lira moves from tea table to alcove to garden to loom without legible transitions or physical grounding. The sun trails and mist create atmosphere yet remain decorative—they never constrain a choice or alter tactics. The loom "woven from moonlight" is pure metaphor without material properties that matter to action. Sensory detail is visual-heavy and ornamental, filtered more by authorial voice than Lira's priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.6)
    The tower, sextant, and oak are named but never constrain a choice or alter tactics. Spatial choreography is vague: Eli "drifts up," "steps into the corridor," and later "descends" with no coherent map. Sensory selection defaults to moonbeam repetition and "rattling wind" without POV-filtered urgency. The sextant's broken limb and the oak's roots are mentioned for atmosphere, not to pressure the work.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.8)
    The mica window returns across multiple beats—scattering light, breathing, glowing—and charges the final image as visitors place memories upon it. The orchard's metallic roots, copper-jasmine scent, and silver-bark vines supply vivid sensory anchors. However, spatial choreography is abstract: Lira's position relative to window, trees, and gathering spirits remains unclear, and no environmental constraint shapes a tactical choice. The setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure lever.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.8)
    Setting details are ornamental: "cobblestones whispered history," "market itself was a façade," "shelves curved like riverbanks" describe atmosphere without constraining choice or altering tactics. The attic, market, and library never pressure the recluse's movements—he simply lifts a hatch and enters. No tool, body limit, or spatial feature shapes a decision. The "hidden in plain sight" premise is told but never dramatized through access friction or discovery cost.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sensory detail is vivid and layered—cracked marble, jasmine mingling with oolong, vines curling around stone—but remains postcard description that does not constrain choice or alter tactics. The tea house setting appears in the second half and supplies atmosphere rather than pressure; the bread's warmth and the tea's steam are poetic texture without spatial or material consequence. The loaf functions as a symbolic object rather than a constraint that shapes the protagonist's options at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    The frozen library, glacial marble pedestal, and frequency-measuring device anchor the action and constrain her method (she must measure silence via book-spine hum). The environment charges the final image when clouds part to reveal pale sun and the library "exhales." Sensory hierarchy is consistent (aural focus on frequencies and hush, tactile frost). The setting avoids postcard description and integrates purposefully, meeting the 9+ test of constraining choice and charging closure, though some details (pillars of ice, vaulted ceiling) recur more for texture than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.4)
    The pirate market beneath the rotting pier is vividly sketched—salt, ferment, driftwood stalls, aromatic vapor—and the spatial choreography (central tent, lantern storage, pier exit) remains coherent. The antique watch fob's temperature shifts (warm, cold, warm again) anchor sensory detail in the present. However, the setting does not constrain a choice at closure; Lila's final walk toward the horizon ignores the market's spatial logic, and the "until sunrise" clock, though mentioned, does not tighten her moves. The watch fob charges the final image modestly, lifting the score into mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lavender bluff, aurora, and tin compass ring are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("pastel glow," "metallic tang," "soft binary code"). However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Arin moves freely through tasting and observation without spatial or resource limitation. The micro-setting (ring, wind, spores) charges the final image poetically but does not pressure a decision, keeping this in mid-band despite strong descriptive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.9)
    The crystal cavern is vividly rendered with auroral light and glittering walls, and the broken lock's "fractured rainbows" and rusted locker create atmosphere. The canvas and mirror function as micro-setting tools that constrain Lena's final move, charging the closure image when reflected light aligns the lock. Spatial choreography is clear, though the cave itself remains more backdrop than active pressure—its beauty is described rather than forcing tactical choices until the mirror beat.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.9)
    The greenhouse city, zinc plate, and bottles supply vivid texture, and the plate's color-change grounds the candor mechanic in observable physics. However, setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no locked door, depleted resource, or spatial trade-off alters her tactics. The cavern of crystal shelves and sky-vent appear exactly when needed without scarcity or access cost. The piece reaches mid-band through atmospheric specificity (bioluminescent ferns, vaulted hall of parchment) but cannot enter higher bands without the setting pressuring a choice or charging the final image with environmental cost.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.8)
    The whispering bluff and suspended iceberg fragment are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail—"copper arm that glisten when sunrise kisses the sky," "long shadows that ripple across the cliffside." Setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome, remaining primarily atmospheric. The body-as-micro-setting (tightening copper joints, feeling wind on cheek) appears but does not drive a turn. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the details are filtered through the tuner's priorities, but the world remains a backdrop rather than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.4)
    The glass dome, desert setting, and roses are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail ("ozone and old metal," "molten sky and cracked earth"). The magnetic north shift and dome shielding provide concrete environmental pressure. The box's organic wood constrains her method—she draws on its living quality to compress fears. However, spatial choreography during the burn sequence is vague; we don't track Vira's position relative to flames, vines, or the box clearly enough for the stakes to feel urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.1)
    The courtyard anchors multiple beats (dawn, stone bench, lanterns at night) and sensory detail is vivid ("wet stone and incense," "walls amber"). However, the setting remains postcard-decorative—no spatial constraint or resource alters Mara's choices; she places objects, reads, and guides visitors without friction from the environment. The mailbox is described but its physical state (locked/unlocked, location shift) is unclear across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.1)
    The sunken lab, copper braid, hangman's dice, and kelp-bound journal are vivid and specific. However, spatial choreography is vague—where Selene stands relative to the altar, the door, the compartment—and the lab's pressure-sealed door becomes a "melody" without clear mechanical constraint. The crystal and dice constrain no on-page choice; they are handled but do not alter tactics or charge the final image with a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.1)
    The salt crystal chamber and pockets of gravity are vividly described, and the lantern, wildflowers, and coffee grounds recur across beats. However, spatial choreography drifts—Mara moves from dock to grotto to chamber without clear transitions or physical grounding. The setting elements (gravity pockets, fissure, slab) do not constrain a choice; they serve as ornamental backdrops. The micro-setting (lantern, tin box) is handled but never alters tactics or charges the final image decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.6)
    The nocturnal brook, fireflies, and forest are vividly described but remain postcard scenery—none constrain a choice or alter tactics. The crane's wing sits on a stone without spatial friction. Sensory detail (pine, rain, molten glass) is lush but disconnected from pressure or POV filter; it reads as catalog rather than character-selective perception.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.8)
    The rooftop garden and meteor shower are vividly rendered with sensory detail ("rusted iron rail," "mossy stone bench," "intermittent strobe of meteors"). However, setting functions largely as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice—the protagonist could hold this conversation in any location without altering tactics or outcomes. The borrowed sugar and neighbor's hummingbird feeder add texture but do not pressure the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.6)
    The velvet garden supplies vivid but static imagery—roses "trembling," "unfurling like pale hands"—without constraining a single choice or altering Lira's tactics. Spatial choreography is nonexistent: no sense of scale, proximity, or navigation. The setting functions as a backdrop for thematic declarations rather than a lived-in environment that Lira uses or that pressures her. Sensory detail tilts heavily visual and serves atmosphere over plot; the twilight-to-dawn transition is declared but not felt as urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.1)
    The marble sanctuary supplies vivid sensory anchors—vaulted ceilings, dripping stalactites, pearl twilight—but these details remain postcard descriptions that do not constrain Liora's choices. The dripping water functions as a metronome image yet never alters her tactics or timing. The heritage rose thorn returns in the final third with a "soft crimson light" and glow, charging the final image modestly, which lifts the score into mid-band despite the lack of choice-level pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.1)
    The serpentine nexus, cavern, and stone altar supply vivid backdrop but function as postcard landmarks rather than constraints on choice—the protagonist moves freely without spatial friction. The whispering seashell half does constrain the final beat (pressing it to the whole shell triggers the hymn), lifting the score above pure ornament. Sensory detail is heavily visual and atmospheric ("petrichor," "quartz light") but rarely filtered through the protagonist's professional or personal priorities; the world feels like a museum tour rather than a lived-in pressure chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.4)
    The glacier shrine is vivid in opening lines—"candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice," "borrowed starlight…painting the walls with trembling silver"—but remains postcard description; it never constrains a tactical choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. The melted snow globe sits at the altar yet is handled only once (palm on liquid surface) with no spatial consequence. The 9+ gate (environment/tool/object must constrain choice or charge final image) is not met; the globe "pulsed brighter" is summary glow, not a charged spatial moment. Micro-setting allowance: the globe could function as object-as-setting, but its presence does not alter the whisperer's moves or generate friction, keeping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.4)
    The parapet, bamboo whisk, fireflies, and moon-path puddles are vividly rendered with sensory specificity. However, the environment remains atmospheric décor that does not constrain choice or alter tactics. The whisk is "placed on the wet stone" and traced symbolically but never limits options or charges the ending under pressure. Spatial choreography is coherent, but the micro-setting does not drive a turn.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.1)
    The wasteland orchard is vividly sketched with selective detail (twisted trees, phosphorescent fruit, radioactive dust storms) and the setting recurs at key beats. The rusted table and the gnarled apple tree anchor the reassembly and discovery beats. However, the environment does not constrain Mira's choices or alter her tactics; she moves through it without friction. The diamond's cradle and the magnetic-stone seal appear as conveniences rather than resources that shape the ending, preventing the setting from charging the closure image or meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.8)
    The cobalt glass portico, copper coils, and stormlit clouds provide vivid sensory anchors and recur across beats, shaping the visual field. Spatial choreography is legible (observatory above clouds, mirrors on portico, coils draped over glass) and the storm-versus-dawn contrast charges the final image. However, setting details remain decorative; no environmental constraint forces a tactical choice or alters the protagonist's approach. The observatory functions as backdrop rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.1)
    The loft, dunes, and music box supply vivid sensory anchors—"sand-torn wood," "rose-gold sunrise," "brass key tarnished but still humming"—and the setting modulates from "feral" to "chapel of resonance." However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it serves as backdrop. The music box appears early and returns at closure, but its role is symbolic rather than tactical, so the 9+ gate (environment/object constrains choice or charges final image) is not met.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.1)
    The drift-ice marina, copper coils, and obsidian key anchor the setting with vivid sensory detail and the key's vibration constrains the unlocking action. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; spatial choreography is clean but the setting does not pressure Elara's choices—she adapts seamlessly without environmental friction. The golden sunset and ethereal glow recur but remain descriptive rather than altering tactics or charging the final image with new meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (ice singing "a thin, glassy hymn," viaduct's "low, resonant hum"). Spatial choreography is clean, and the compass placement atop the viaduct constrains one on-page action. The micro-setting (viaduct, ice, basalt pillars) charges the final image when the ice "breathes" and the "crack sounded… of release," meeting the 9+ gate requirement. However, occupational detail (horizon mapping, magnetic tracking) remains ornamental; the mechanics never pressure a choice, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    The tunnel, lantern, and rusted valve are anchored and spatially coherent; the valve becomes a tactile pivot in the climax. Sensory detail is selective—amber glow, damp stone, water droplets as stars—and filtered through Mara's investigative focus. The lantern's flickering correlation with humidity shifts subtly grounds the discovery. The environment enables the final action (the valve) and thus meets the micro-setting constraint test, pushing the score into the mid-6s despite some reliance on generic underground atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.1)
    The music-box shop is anchored with selective sensory detail (fog, amber lamp glow, ticking boxes, cracked window admitting sunlight). The clockwork heart's physical state (dust-caked gears, tiny pistons, brass filigree) is vivid and the brass rod and central spring constrain the repair action in the climax. Spatial choreography is clean. However, occupational verisimilitude is thin—no tools, measurements, or credible repair sequence—and the shaft of sunlight arriving on cue to animate the heart reads as symbolic convenience rather than engineered causality.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    The acid sea, brass ribs, copper workshop, and kaleidoscope are vividly rendered with sensory specificity and consistent idiom. The bell's arrow-tip warmth and the neon-green acid droplets painting constellations show setting integrated into action. The kaleidoscope constrains navigation choices and the workshop's gears respond to Mara's presence, elevating function beyond postcard. However, much description remains ornamental—hissing sea, floating forge evolution—serving atmosphere more than choice-point pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.1)
    Setting detail is vivid and specific: amber-lit server rooms, forgotten emojis, static-thick air, dusty terminals. The archive functions as a micro-setting that constrains Lia's path through metadata and sublayers, and the "wall of obsolete emojis" gates the concealed server farm. The patch insignia returns at closure, charging the final image with a thread of connection. Spatial choreography is clear and the archive's layers reward the piece's accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.1)
    Setting details ("frosted roots," "weathered van," "tarnished mirrors") appear but remain postcard descriptions that do not constrain choice or alter tactics. The orchard and ice floes never pressure a decision; the protagonist walks through them without resistance. The crystal fragment and mirrors function as objects rather than micro-setting that charges the final image, and spatial choreography (distance from lighthouse to van, mirror arrangement) stays vague across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.4)
    The drift-ice marina, cracked piers, and shifting ice supply vivid sensory anchors (brine, pine, groaning ice underfoot). The parasol tip returns across beats and charges the moon-lit moment, satisfying the micro-setting allowance. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the dockside moves. However, the disaster-relief work and volunteers' stories float as backdrop without constraining the protagonist's final choice or charging the closure image—setting illustrates rather than pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "amber pavilion" and "oldest trellis" anchor space; the vines' tendrils curling toward ash in one beat shows setting in minor action. Sensory selection (scent of fermenting grapes, amber light) is present but filtered through generic lyricism rather than the sentinel's occupational or personal bias. The setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image with specific cost, capping the score under the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is coherent within the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "murmuring pavilion" and "kinetic parapet" are vivid in image but remain atmospheric backdrops; neither constrains a choice or alters tactics. Sensory detail is selective and poetic (sand, stars, cool breath) but filtered through a generic lyric register rather than the Keeper's professional or personal priorities. Spatial choreography is vague—villagers "approach," the prophet "arrives," but distances and bodies remain abstract. The pavilion's micro-setting potential is untapped; it charges the final image poetically but does not pressure the protagonist's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lavender field and rusted factory ruins are described lyrically but function only as backdrop; no environmental constraint shapes Mara's choices or the villagers' arrival. The dove gray map case is handled twice (opened, then closed at the end), meeting minimal micro-setting presence, but its mechanics do not alter tactics. Spatial choreography is vague: villagers "gathered around the board" without legible distances or movement. Sensory detail (purple perfume, amber glow) is vivid but ornamental, not purposeful. The setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image beyond atmosphere, capping the score in mid-band despite description density.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.1)
    The library, stained glass, crystal, and oak table are vividly rendered with selective detail (must of old paper, marble floor, fractured light). The crystal constrains observation and charges the final image through its "humming" and "glow fade," narrowly meeting the 9+ gate requirement. However, spatial choreography is static—Mara never navigates obstacles or uses the environment to alter tactics. Sensory hierarchy remains visual throughout without stress-driven narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.7)
    The fog sculpture garden is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (mist, translucent monolith, vapor-and-light statues, videotapes) and establishes a coherent atmosphere. Driftwood markers function as navigational tools, shaping the prophet's route and serving as a recurring motif that glows at closure. However, the environment does not pressure a pivotal choice; the garden facilitates rather than complicates, and the chalk's interaction with fog (a thin white line rising) charges the final image without altering tactics or revealing cost. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lunar observatory "above the clouds" and brass cradle supply vivid sensory anchors, but spatial choreography remains vague (the sage "stood on the rim," then "opened the brass cradle" with no intervening movement clarifying proximity or scale). The leaf's fall "far below" and the telescope measuring escape velocity offer atmospheric detail without constraining any on-page choice or altering repair tactics. Setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure or resource that charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "radiant haven above the clouds" supplies vivid atmosphere—gold sunrise, fluttering curtains, cloud-rim glow—but remains postcard description that does not constrain choice or alter tactics. The vinyl fragment and harp are handled in multiple beats, yet their physical properties (jagged edge, crackle, imperfect grooves) do not affect Mara's decisions or the outcome. Spatial choreography is clear (hall, room, balcony), and the "scent of hope" (pine and rain) is specific, but these details ornament rather than pressure the action.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.1)
    The nocturnal observatory, floating isle, copper plates, and clockwork key anchor setting through selective detail. The key's "faint tick" and "rhythmic pulse" appear multiple times and the translucent doorway charges the final image. However, the environment does not constrain choice—Lira's work proceeds without spatial friction, and the luminous chamber appears only after the problem is solved, offering reward rather than obstacle. Micro-setting (the key, the telescope lens, the stone arch) is present and purposeful but does not alter tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.1)
    The secret garden is introduced early and supplies moss, roots, vines, and hedges, meeting setup. Sensory detail ("midnight perfume," "cleft in ribs") is vivid but often abstract or decorative. The tooth and vertebrae constrain one middle beat (the repair), satisfying minimal development, but the garden does not pressure Mara's choices or alter tactics—it functions as backdrop. The final image ("garden glimmered") is passive description rather than a charged reconfiguration tied to spatial constraint, missing full payoff. No 9+ gate met; cap at 8.8 even if description were stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.1)
    The grotto is lushly described ("emerald serpents," "water pool," mist) but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The sea glass and spiral arrangement are handled across beats, elevating the score, yet neither environment nor object forces a tactical choice or alters the outcome. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.1)
    The moss garden is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail (emerald silence, cracked glass, honeyed scent) and constrains micro-setting through the drip pattern and dormant interface. However, the environment never pressures a difficult choice—Lira encounters no barriers, so the setting functions more as evocative backdrop than tactical constraint. The amber pendant and stones are handled on the page but their physical properties don't alter her approach. Strong description elevates the score, but the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is not met.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "feral nexus in mist" receives repeated atmospheric description ("swirling hush," "veil," "pulse") but remains a generic dreamscape without spatial anchors or concrete constraints. The spiral seashell fragment is handled twice (placed on a page, slipped into pocket) and its curve guides ink, lending some micro-setting function. However, the environment does not pressure a choice or alter tactics; it is backdrop rather than crucible, and the setting could be replaced with minor adjustments to metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    The verdant arbor at dawn is anchored early with sensory detail (dew, pine scent, pre-dawn light, canopy), and the ancient stone altar provides spatial grounding. The harvest moon's ascent from silver to golden halo modulates atmosphere and charges the climactic beat when pollen settles on Mara's shoulders. However, the glade functions largely as backdrop; no environmental constraint (distance, weather, obstruction) shapes Mara's choices or tactics, and the vine tendril's glowing response feels like stage-setting rather than a micro-setting element that alters her approach.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.1)
    The withered orchard and subarctic crater provide vivid atmospheric anchors, and sensory details ("frost-kissed roots," "bark creaking like an old song") are filtered through the alchemist's reverent focus. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it functions as backdrop rather than crucible. The plate, discarded items, and patterns are described repeatedly but remain ornamental—no spatial logic or resource limitation shapes the protagonist's moves. Micro-setting credit is unavailable because no object or bodily constraint charges the final image with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=5.6)
    The marble cavern, phosphorescent moss, and bronze plates supply vivid sensory anchors and spatial coherence. However, the environment functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no cavern feature blocks Corin or alters his tactics. The crystal and timer mechanism are handled across beats, but their use is frictionless, preventing the setting from charging the final image or forcing a micro-choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.4)
    The bronze grotto is vividly rendered with sensory specifics (shingled hush, mineral veins, whalebone reverie), and the lamp's flame interacts with the walls to reveal calcified statues. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—spatial details remain postcard-level decoration. The body and the lamp (micro-setting candidates) appear in multiple beats but do not charge the final image with a cost tied to their properties, keeping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.1)
    The loft, kettle, and rain-beaded skylight are vividly rendered and consistent. The ash wood blank's grain "whispering of forests long felled" and the iron gouge "catching light like a tamer's whip" anchor sensory detail in Mara's professional past. However, spatial choreography wobbles: she stands at the window, sets the blank on the table, then places the finished carving on the windowsill and later the hearth without clear movement or distance tracking. The skylight participates only as atmospheric backdrop; it does not constrain a single choice or charge the final image beyond decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.1)
    The kinetic lagoon and rusted carousel provide vivid sensory anchors (metallic heart pulse, cracked brass platform, translucent ghost). Spatial choreography remains coherent. However, the lagoon functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choices or shaping tactics. The "disposable camera wheel" is handled but does not alter options or charge the final image with tactical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.1)
    The spaceport is vividly sketched with "silent hull," "cracked control panel," "massive conduit," and "dormant servos," establishing a concrete ruin. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop for demonstration rather than constraint—conduits and panels cooperate with the intern's intentions without spatial friction or resource scarcity. The sextant's use to "set voltage flow" and align with panels gestures at instrumental constraint but the mechanics remain abstract; we never see her struggle with access, tool limits, or environmental resistance that would make the space pressure her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.4)
    Vivid sensory anchors (petrichor, cracked stained glass, crystal slab) establish atmosphere, but most detail remains decorative postcard description that does not constrain choice. The crystal "whispers" and "pulses" yet these effects guide no decision; the scribe's act of inscribing proceeds identically whether the crystal responds or not. Spatial choreography is clear, and the sanctuary's "soundless" quality is maintained, placing the work in mid-band for functional but non-essential setting use.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.1)
    The twilight barge canal and sundial are vivid, but setting functions as postcard backdrop rather than constraint. The rusted lock offers a brief tactical obstacle, yet its mechanics remain vague ("aligning the sundial's gnomon with the rusted gears") and success arrives without spatial friction or resource trade-off. Sensory detail (violet sky, cool water, stone arches) decorates rather than pressures choice, and the city's spires at the end serve as symbolic flourish, not lived environment.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.1)
    The golden dock under snow is vividly rendered and recurs across beats, anchoring the spatial frame. Fog and rope are handled on the page (he kneels, traces knots, coils the rope). However, setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the environment remains postcard backdrop rather than pressure source. The fulgurite glass and wooden chest function as props without meaningful resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.1)
    The garden setting is evocatively described ("crumbling stone," "veined marble," "bruised violet" sky) and sensory detail is present across multiple beats. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains a backdrop for lyric observation. The golden thread is handled twice but functions as symbolic ornament rather than a physical constraint that shapes action. Spatial choreography is clean within the single location.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.1)
    The suspended palace and stalactite architecture are vividly described and anchor the opening, satisfying the orientation test. However, the environment remains largely decorative; the prince moves through it without the space constraining his choices or altering tactics. The cradle assembly mentions gears and crystal shards, yet these materials do not impose meaningful limits or create friction. The setting charges the final image moderately (palace sways, "breathing"), but this effect is asserted rather than earned through prior spatial pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.1)
    The obsidian lagoon, black volcanic sand, and kelp-drift air are vividly rendered and consistently present. The coin-on-pier graft anchors the action spatially and reappears in the final image. However, setting does not constrain choice—Mira could perform the ritual anywhere; the lagoon's properties (shallow water, black sand warmth) affect atmosphere but never alter her tactics or the ritual's outcome. Sensory selection is broad but undifferentiated by urgency; the narration catalogs rather than filters through Mira's professional or emotional priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.8)
    The city setting is evocative (cracked cobblestones, moss-draped alleyways, marble arch) and sensory details are vivid, but the environment never constrains a choice or alters Mara's tactics—she moves freely from fountain to plaza to alcove without friction. The stained glass box is described repeatedly but its physical properties (weight, facets, hinges) do not force trade-offs. Spatial choreography is clean and the world feels consistent, but the setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.1)
    The nebula garden is vividly described with sensory detail (violet hush, crystalline walls, luminous mist), but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint. No environmental feature narrows a choice or alters tactics. The gear's placement "at the heart of a luminous chrysalis" charges the final image modestly, earning minimal credit for micro-setting, but the setting never pressures the protagonist's path.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.4)
    The greenhouse is vividly anchored with "glass panes frosted with the memory of seasons" and "jasmine intertwined with the metallic tang of stone," and the highest arch becomes a functional convergence point for the butterfly spiral. The ribbon roll rests "beside the stone table," grounding micro-setting. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Eliam arranges stones and unfurls ribbons without friction from the space itself. The final basin monument is described but does not emerge from a greenhouse-specific resource or obstacle, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.1)
    The obsidian ridge, bronze tower, and pendulum bob are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (molten rose hue, salt-etched wood, metallic skin). However, setting remains postcard description; the ridge does not constrain Mara's choices or supply resources that alter outcome. The micro-setting (tower interior, pendulum cradle) is static backdrop rather than tactical pressure. Spatial choreography is clean and the tone supports the lyric frame, lifting the score to functional mid-band despite lack of choice constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    Vivid atmospheric detail (cobalt silo, velveteen gloom, copper-hued glow) establishes tone effectively. The antique sovereign case is described with care ("faded vellum," "compartments adjusted like a lover's embrace") and appears in multiple beats. However, the environment remains decorative; neither silo nor case constrains a tactical choice or alters the gardener's approach. Spatial choreography is coherent but the setting does not pressure the protagonist's decisions at any turn.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.8)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vivid and return at key moments (drafting table on the ledge, barley reflecting the spire's sheen, the lake as mirror). The crystal contraption and ancient runes supply world-specific detail, and the aurora's emerald curtains guide the copper-plate solution. However, environment remains scenic backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or force a tradeoff. The spire's ledge could be any elevated platform without altering tactics or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ember alcove, mist, and shortwave radio dial glow are vividly described and return across beats, creating atmospheric coherence. The radio constrains one choice (aligning the dial to the exact frequency), which lifts the score into functional range. However, much of the setting detail—"thistled calm," "dust that hung like old parchment," "rooftops glimmered faintly"—remains ornamental, never altering Mara's tactics or supplying resources that affect the outcome. The "ember alcove" itself does not pressure a decision at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.1)
    The vanishing-point architecture and self-rocking chair create vivid atmosphere, and the mask's porcelain shards are described with care. However, setting remains decorative—no spatial constraint shapes a choice, no tool or surface alters her tactic. The powder settles "into cracks like tiny constellations," but this image does not charge the closure or enable/block an action. The gallery "breathes" and "trembles" in passive response rather than exerting pressure on her decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.7)
    The sewer setting is vivid and sustained (bioluminescent algae, dripping arches, sedimentary silt), and the sunken city frame creates atmosphere. The chronometer cog and sediment function as micro-setting elements that constrain the narrator's method and charge the thematic resolution. However, spatial choreography within the sewer remains static; the narrator sits among arches without movement or environmental pressure that alters tactics. The setting supports tone and closure imagery but does not force a tactical choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.1)
    The velvet library is vividly textured (old paper, rain, marble, autumn leaves) and anchors the reconciliation spatially. The zither's rosette recurs with charged specificity and shapes the final image when children trace its design. However, spatial choreography is vague (podium/desk confusion, townspeople's positions unclear), and the weeks-later coda shifts setting without clear transition. Sensory detail is rich but not filtered through distinct POV priorities—every image receives equal poetic weight regardless of urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.1)
    The rusted greenhouse is vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (corroded frames, salt-bruised panes, iron arches groaning), and the setting's decay anchors the thematic contrast with renewal. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Mara's ritual proceeds unimpeded by spatial limits, material scarcity, or the ruin's dangers. Sensory catalog (humming vines, amber glow, firefly spores) enriches atmosphere but remains ornamental. No object or spatial feature forces a micro-decision that shapes the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lightning collection tower and its amber veins provide vivid sensory anchors, and the matchbox physically constrains the final beat by requiring Mara to turn the key. Spatial choreography is loose—"inside the keeper's small office," "tower's core," "hidden compartment"—but functional. The "nectar dusk" atmosphere saturates description yet remains external; it does not shift under pressure or reflect Mara's urgency. The micro-setting (matchbox, lacquer box, key) charges the closure image, lifting the score above mid-band despite the delayed spatial grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.1)
    The bay, pier, and perfumer's shop are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (brine, amber halos, milky shard). However, the setting never constrains a choice or charges the final image—it remains atmospheric backdrop. The shard's placement on a bench and the houses' synchronized sigh are described but do not alter tactics or stakes, keeping this functional but replaceable.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.1)
    Vivid sensory palette (phosphorescent currents, foxglove-stained violet, bioluminescent organisms) establishes underwater atmosphere. Spatial choreography remains mostly clear. However, the garden functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no environmental feature narrows a choice or charges the final image. The "structural weakness" in the cracked arch is mentioned but does not meaningfully limit or enable the statue's actions; it could be any conduit without altering outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.6)
    The infinite staircase is named and visually sketched (marble arches, stone risers, polished glass disc), but spatial choreography remains abstract—Aric teleports from "the base" to "the eighth landing" to "the twentieth landing" without transitions or micro-setting detail that constrains choice. The bronze contraption and rotating disc are described but never handled or adjusted on the page in a way that alters his tactics. The setting functions as backdrop rather than crucible; removing the staircase and replacing it with any other "endless" structure would not break the story's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.0)
    The rooftop greenhouse, smog, moonlight, and rain collector anchor setting consistently and charge the atmosphere with saffron-lit specificity. The moon-tipped brush and wet paper recur across beats, and the glass panes filter moonlight into "silver specks" that pulse through Mara's actions. Spatial choreography is clean; the final image ("walls themselves were listening") ties environment to the closure gesture. However, the setting does not constrain a choice—it supplies mood and texture but does not alter tactics or narrow options at the closure beat, capping the score at 7.0 per Q3 guidelines.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.1)
    The grotto-behind-waterfall setting is vivid in initial description (mist, wilted lilies, stone veins) and returns in the final image (prism of jade and rose), establishing a purposeful frame. However, the environment does not constrain any choice: doors thaw conveniently, galleries appear without spatial navigation, and the amphitheater's discovery imposes no access cost or tactical trade-off. Sensory detail remains static across the narrative—no evolution as events unfold—and spatial choreography is vague (market, galleries, amphitheater locations never clarified).

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lighthouse and island are present early and vividly described ("jagged teeth," "stone floor," "lantern room"). However, setting never constrains a choice—the clock maker moves freely through space without spatial pressure altering his tactics. Sensory detail is present but ornamental; the environment does not force adaptation or supply meaningful resources at the closure beat. The yoyo and hunger stone function as plot devices rather than grounded objects whose physical properties matter tactically.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.1)
    The carnival funhouse is vividly described with strong sensory detail (copper, rot, viscous syrup air), and spatial choreography through the hall of mirrors to the carousel horse is coherent. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; it does not constrain Mara's choices or supply resources that alter her tactics. The clasp and carousel horse are objects within the setting but their interaction feels arbitrary rather than emergent from the funhouse's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.1)
    Vivid figurative language ("seaweed around the driftwood circles," "ribbon of amber") creates atmosphere, but the orchard-on-driftwood remains physically impossible without taught logic, undermining spatial grounding. The xylophone mallet constrains one choice (striking driftwood to generate rhythm), lifting the score slightly. Sensory detail is repetitive (clouds described in every paragraph) and does not narrow perception under urgency. The setting never shapes a tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    The turtle-shell city is vivid and specific: "layered like ancient scarps," terraces, observatories, bronze gate, cracked mosaic. The mosaic functions as micro-setting that encodes coordinates and triggers the hidden passage, constraining Mira's path and charging the middle turn. Spatial choreography (spiral corridors, flanks, cliffs) remains coherent. The setting returns at closure ("redraw its spirals with new meaning"), reweighting the opening image. Strong integration lifts the score into the 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.1)
    The disused railway station and ivy are described vividly and recur throughout, but they function as backdrop rather than constraint. The mailbox's rusted hinges present a brief obstacle solved immediately with a steel rod. The station's decay mirrors thematic material (noble lies, façades) but does not pressure Arlen's choices or alter his tactics. The final image—sunlight striking the letter, ivy retreating—reads as symbolic convenience rather than spatial consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.1)
    The submerged pavilion is vividly rendered with sensory detail (moss, algae scent, marble columns, mist), and spatial choreography is clear. The inkwell and pavilion constrain Mara's movements slightly (wading, slipping the inkwell into a cavity), giving micro-setting function. However, the environment does not decisively shape a choice or charge the final image; Mara's task proceeds unimpeded, and the setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.1)
    The flooded library setting is vivid and purposeful: water seeping through cracks alters ink hue, the vaulted ceiling trembles with currents. The antique ink stamp and scanner gears supply concrete tools that recur across beats. However, spatial choreography in the vault descent and the flooded streets remains gestural; the environment pressures atmosphere more than choice. The setting charges the final image but does not constrain a pivotal decision with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.1)
    The floating island tea garden and glass basilica are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (jasmine, sandalwood, dew-slick stone). Spatial choreography is legible across the scene. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image in a way that alters options; the setting remains a backdrop for ritualized action rather than a crucible that shapes tactics or outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.6)
    Setting details are vivid and purposeful: the floating observatory's rotors, the geode on its magnetic cradle, the fissure in the foundation. Spatial choreography is coherent (rim, decks, lower chambers, observation deck). The geode and fissure constrain the protagonist's final action—thrusting his palm toward the crack—which charges the closure image. Sensory selection (rust, ozone, low frequencies) is effective, though some metaphors ("intangibly tangible") blur rather than sharpen the physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.1)
    The observatory supplies vivid atmospheric detail—"stone arches," "marble floor," "vaulted chamber"—but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The star trails etched in marble guide Lira's path, yet their mechanics remain decorative; she could follow any map with identical ease. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the drone's role (hovering "over the chip" when she presses a lever "beside" the pedestal) creates minor positional confusion. The setting never pressures a choice or alters tactics, capping the micro-setting test.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cobalt terrace and driftwood shore are vivid and tonally consistent, with selective sensory details (night-black water, brine and wind, half-buried carvings). The watch hand as micro-setting object recurs across three beats and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate in principle. However, spatial choreography between terrace, boat, shore, and return is vague—no anchors for distance, transit time, or how the protagonist orients during the sifting process—and the environment does not constrain a middle choice, only bookends the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.1)
    The storm-worn parapet and mist provide atmospheric texture, but spatial choreography remains unclear: where is the opposing negotiator standing, how does the box move between them, what prevents or enables their actions? The antique drawer pull recurs as a symbolic token without constraining a choice. Sensory hierarchy is generic—"slick stones," "salt," "mist"—without POV filtering or occupational detail that would ground a negotiator's professional focus.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.1)
    The coastal kayak launch, utility poles, and compass receive vivid sensory treatment filtered through metaphor-heavy narration, and the kayak itself becomes a tactile micro-setting ("hull humming," water lapping). However, none of these constrain a choice or alter tactics; they function as backdrop for interiority. The utility poles appear as navigational beacons but are never tested against an alternative or used to solve a problem the scene dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    The bioluminescent lake is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (phosphorescence, glowing kelp, coded messages on water). The underground setting supplies the newspaper-line clues and the pedestal chamber, guiding the protagonist's path. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure—it serves as backdrop and clue-delivery system. The baseball and mirror are handled, but spatial choreography remains clean throughout. The lake's "breathing" at the end charges the final image, lifting the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.1)
    The orchard under permanent moonlight is evocative but functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint. Spatial choreography is vague—Liora moves through "tangled vines" and "hidden alcoves" without clear geography. The spices and their mixing provide one tactile moment, but the setting never pressures a choice or alters tactics. The phoenix and its "last cry" appear only as mood rather than causal element.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.1)
    Vivid sensory texture—mist, moonlight, vapor scent—creates atmosphere but remains postcard description. The glade never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics; the saucer crack "map of sorrow" is ornamental metaphor without spatial consequence. Micro-setting option: the dolls' tea set could function as constraint, but the cartomancer's handling (unfasten clasp, lid falls) involves no obstacle or trade-off. The "staircase of mist" she follows has no physical stakes—ascending costs nothing and opens no door that was previously closed.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.1)
    The recycled spaceship is named early and "rusted corridors" and "patched panels" provide texture, but spatial choreography is absent—where the veil is, how Nara moves to it, what tools or props constrain her actions remain unanchored. The final garden erupts in abstract color without sensory grounding (scent of forests is told, not shown through Nara's reaction). The crystal and photographs function as magic tokens rather than objects with weight, temperature, or tactile resistance that shape her attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.1)
    Black sand and volcanic imagery are vivid but used as backdrop rather than constraint. The jar's trembling and sparks create atmospheric texture, yet no environmental detail shapes a choice or tactic. Spatial choreography remains coherent (beach, stone, boat), and sensory selection reflects the lyric register, but the setting never pressures Mara's actions or charges the final image with causal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.1)
    Vivid architectural detail (translucent marble, phosphorescent pulse, glass roses) creates atmosphere but remains postcard description—none of it constrains Kael's choices or alters tactics. The blackout is declared but never pressures movement or resource; the sundial's "coded angles" are mentioned yet their mechanics don't shape on-page problem-solving. Sensory selection is generic (walls "humming," lamps "flickering") rather than POV-filtered or action-integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.1)
    The tidal bluff, basalt, aurora, and tide pools are named repeatedly but remain postcard elements—none constrains a tactical choice or alters the rock-placement sequence. The painted rocks function as props rather than tools whose properties matter; their "Fibonacci spiral" and "perfect ratios" are asserted but never shown to affect Selene's method or outcome. Spatial choreography is vague: we never learn how far apart the rocks are placed, whether the tide threatens the sequence, or how Selene navigates the ledge under aurora light. The aurora appears in nearly every paragraph as atmospheric decoration without pressing a decision or charging the final image beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.1)
    The observatory setting supplies vivid sensory anchors (copper dome, ozone, lightning, brass console) and the storm modulates with the poet's ritual. The timer, envelope, and timetable function as micro-setting objects but do not meaningfully constrain a choice—props are handled in sequence without friction. Spatial choreography remains clear. Missing 9+ gate: no environmental element narrows options or charges the final image with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.1)
    The glass atrium, brook, and sundial are described vividly but remain postcard elements. The needle card and sundial do not constrain a single on-page tactic or choice; spatial choreography (how the two duelists move, where the sundial sits relative to the brook) is vague. The mechanical arm "whirring" and the brook's "babble" provide sensory texture but do not alter any action. No environment, body, tool, or recurring object charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "rusted library under stars" is invoked repeatedly but never grounds spatial choreography or constrains a choice. Sensory detail defaults to stock imagery: "moon cleared the skyline," "silver glaze turning the rusted iron into veins of light." The setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure; no on-page action depends on proximity, access, or environmental friction. The wildflowers sprouting in stone cracks are described but do not alter tactics or charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.1)
    Vivid metaphorical images (tidal arbor, cloud staircase, silver film doorway) but all are abstract set-dressing without spatial grounding or constraint on choice. No clarity on whether the pianist is physically above clouds or in reverie. The broken clock and piano are mentioned repeatedly but never constrain a tactic or alter the final image with concrete pressure. Sensory detail is visual-only and generic (gleaming, shimmering, frost).

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.7)
    The ridge setting is vivid (jade vines, granite, orchids pulsing with sunrise colors) and filtered through Mara's empirical-whimsical lens, but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The lanterns' glow intensifies in response to her translations, charging the final image, which lifts the score into mid-6s. Spatial choreography (camp beside ridge, woven mat, satchel) is clear. The "scent of old stories" rising toward clouds is a purposeful reprise of earlier "citrus and rain," but the ridge does not pressure a tactical choice—Mara's translations succeed without environmental friction.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    The islet, rain-scent, stone, and compass anchor the scene with consistent sensory detail. The bonsai and lace-pattern imagery recur and charge the final paragraphs. However, the setting remains largely postcard: no environmental constraint meaningfully alters a tactic or choice on the page. Spatial choreography is clean, but the world does not pressure the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.0)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse is richly and consistently rendered—cracked glass, broken panes, droplets, wilted tomatoes—and these details are not postcard-like; they shape the experiment (humidity gradients, widening cracks, fresh air). The environment evolves in tandem with the premise, turning from “tomb” into “breathing sanctuary,” so the setting meaningfully mirrors and enables the conceptual arc. Sensory detail is mostly visual and textural but well chosen and filtered through Mara’s scientific sensibility. While the setting subtly constrains options rather than forcing sharp choices, it still feels integral to the piece’s logic and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    The canyon, frost, kilns, and mine are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action: frost lines literally reveal the route, the canyon’s walls mirror glass and amplify sound, and the stars feed the final kiln image. Environmental details feel filtered through a glass artist’s eye—light, refraction, and surfaces dominate perception. Crucially, the physical setting constrains options (hidden grooves, narrow crevice) and charges the final image of the canyon “listening” to the glass. A touch of descriptive repetition keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    The winterglass conservatory, frost-humming panes, and glass that “exhales” are vivid and sensorially rich, and the environment is consistently filtered through Mara’s tactile and auditory bias. The setting is not just backdrop: its silence, the stopped clock, and glass acoustics meaningfully frame the stakes and charge the final image of a pilgrimage site. Objects-as-setting (tuning fork, case, copper lattice) feel specific and integrated. The atmosphere occasionally verges on decorative flourish, but overall it’s tightly yoked to mood and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    The underwater library is vividly rendered—the glass walls under sea pressure, phosphorescent ink, marble tablets, and bioluminescent fish all contribute to a strong, coherent atmosphere. The environment meaningfully charges the imagery and stakes (light struggling “against the crushing pressure,” the library as a “giant, trembling eye”). However, the setting mostly shapes mood and symbolism rather than constraining Marlow’s choices; he encounters little tactical friction from the environment. Even so, the closing image of the glow seeping into the abyss is powerfully grounded in the world established.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ridge, terra-cotta arbor, hollow, and bell are vivid, recurring anchors that create a distinct, atmospheric place. Environmental details (wind, amplified quiet, lanterns like fireflies) are well-filtered through the community’s precariousness and soft tactics. The arbor functions as a micro-setting that shapes action (drop point, gathering space, bell location) and charges the final images of dawn and moonlight. Some sensory range beyond sight and sound, or a single sharp, tactile moment under pressure, could deepen the immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    The viaduct, fog, jasmine, and twilight are vividly realized and clearly filtered through Milo’s sensibility, producing a strong, unified atmosphere. Setting is not just backdrop: the balcony hides the tear, the arches conduct the released love as light, and the blooming vines visibly register the transformation at the end. The environment charges the final image and feels integral to the magic system, not decorative. A slight trim of piled imagery in a few lines could make it even sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    The living bridge garden is vividly and consistently realized, with concrete, sensorial details (vines, mist, creek, glowing arches) that are filtered through Mara’s temporal obsession. The environment actively participates—vines sensing curiosity, the bridge pulsing, arches blooming in response to the child—so setting is not just backdrop but mechanism. World rules (halo fragment, hyperbolic corridors, time-charged mist and photographs) remain internally consistent within this surreal frame. The final image of the glowing bridge and humming fragment is powerfully charged by prior environmental setup.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned carnival and its prize redemption center are richly realized—“rusted cathedral,” broken mirrors, dust‑covered dispensers, phosphorescent fungi—and these details are filtered through Mara’s mission rather than reading like a catalog. Setting meaningfully shapes action via the piano bench lock, the descent, and the collapsing wall, and the environment charges the final images (ruins against sunrise, seed planted in sand). Tools and objects (arrow, bench, vault, fungi-lit stair) function as micro-settings that constrain choice. The piece avoids confusion about space and time while sustaining a strong, coherent atmosphere that supports its themes of ruin and renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse, kelp-laced glass, and ring of shipwrecks are vividly realized, with color-sound synesthesia and aurora-lit brine creating a strong atmosphere. Setting details (rusted masts humming betrayal, coral’s missing song, kelp on glass) are integrated into action and theme rather than feeling like a tour. The environment charges the final images but doesn’t significantly constrain Mara’s choices or tactics, which keeps this just below the very top band. Nonetheless, it is a clear strength of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.0)
    The emerald station, moonlit rails, jade door, and crystal-scroll library are vividly rendered with strong sensory and imagistic control. Setting details recur (lanterns, light motifs, flowers, moonbeams) in a way that supports tone and theme rather than feeling like a tourist catalog. However, the environment mostly decorates and reveals; it rarely constrains tactics or forces difficult decisions. The world rules around light and codes are consistent and legible inside the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid, coherent, and thematically integrated: the thawing ice, silent consoles, and meltwater “like liquid glass” all mirror Mara’s work and preoccupations. The control room, furnace, and vials are used as tools and charged objects rather than postcard décor, culminating in the final image of panels flickering back to life and colored reflections. The environment shapes possibilities—she can repurpose this dead infrastructure into a safe zone—though it stops short of exerting concrete physical constraint or danger. The sensory richness is strong without confusing geography or timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rusted library under a cracked dome is vivid and consistently filtered through Mara’s perception, with shelves “groaning like old bones” and constellations spelling her name. Setting isn’t just décor: the hidden lever, collapsing aisle, and rearranging stars materially shape choices and charge the ending image. The seashell and vial also function as charged objects embedded in the environment rather than free-floating symbols. A slightly broader sensory range (beyond sight and sound) could deepen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and specific: the storm-tossed ridge fort, the cliff, sea, single star, and turret all recur and evolve, charging the atmosphere. Details like “rain‑kissed iron,” “flaking gold leaf,” and “phantom serpent” winds feel integrated with action rather than touristic. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactical choices, it strongly shapes the piece’s liminal, besieged mood and charges the final image of the booklet on the highest turret dissolving with the dawn. The sense of place is memorable and consistent with the story’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    The frozen courtyard, twilight, and ice violin are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the action and meaning—especially the melting droplets as “tiny comets” marking timelines. Setting details recur and evolve (frost on chassis, melting ice, stars at the end), charging the final image of the janitor sweeping. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain choices, but it strongly shapes tone and thematic resonance. Overall, atmosphere is a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    The crystal forecourt, rain, abandoned cinema, and backstage theater are vivid and sensorial, with puddles, dust, old velvet, and glowing stones all doing atmospheric work. Setting is tightly integrated with the premise—the rain, stones, and lens literally mediate how truth manifests—and the final image of lingering light on the stones effectively charges the environment. However, the setting mostly frames revelation rather than constraining concrete choices, which keeps it short of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.0)
    The garden maze is richly and consistently evoked—breathing hedges, marble statues, moss alcoves, the oldest oak, the final clearing and fountain—and these details are integrated into the story’s progression. The maze’s pathways literally change in response to the marbles, and reaching the oak and hidden clearing depends on this particular environment, so the setting materially shapes the narrative. Sensory specificity is high and generally purposeful, although sometimes it leans into decorative lushness. The final image of the maze and dew-like acknowledgment is clearly charged by the established space.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and specific—floating xenobiology station, aviary of “great winged creatures,” bioluminescent vines—and strongly filtered through Lira’s technical and sensory attention. The environment doesn’t just decorate; the magnetic nexus, flora, and aviary all participate in the experiment’s conditions and in the final re-seeing of the station as a breathing organism. Weather and atmosphere (“frosted clouds,” “icy warmth”) are integrated into action and tone rather than tacked on. The one limitation is that constraints from the environment never significantly limit her options; it’s more evocative than coercive.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    The flooded opera house, lantern light, and water-etched staff lines are vivid and specific, and the environment is never mere backdrop. Setting actively shapes method and meaning: humidity alters the violin, water creates the code, lantern tremors mirror instability, and their eventual steadying marks closure. Details consistently filter through Mara’s musical and reverent sensibility. The world feels fully charged without slipping into incoherent ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mountain weather station, wind, antennae, and the humming console are vivid and consistently filtered through Mirela’s perception, creating a dense, coherent atmosphere. Crucially, the environment is not just backdrop: the barometer, humidity, pressure logs, and the physical deck with auroral sky all directly shape what she can do and how the final insight manifests. The recurrence of environmental elements (wind, antennae, aurora) in the closing image charges the final moment with setting-specific resonance. A slight excess of atmospheric language around similar motifs keeps it from feeling razor-perfect, but it is still publishably strong.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting work is vivid, specific, and tonally integrated: “rusted artery of stone,” parallel derelict tracks, the tunnel hum as “factory ghost shift” all create a tangible, lived-in industrial underworld. The beaded valve wheel and the transistor radio function as charged objects that both focus attention and help carry theme. Environment largely serves atmosphere and concept rather than tactile constraint, but it does subtly guide choice—this is a place where buried chemicals, secrecy, and lingering “ghosts” feel inevitable. A slight shortfall in how physically the space limits options keeps it below the top band, but this is excellent, publication-ready scene-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is richly realized—the overgrown library, mossed catacombs, river, and obsidian refuge form a coherent, atmospheric world. Details are specific and purposeful (“shelves that grew like vines,” “silt,” “phosphorescent thread”), and the environment evolves with the journey rather than sitting static. The catacombs and fissures shape the physical route, while the library’s overgrowth and the river’s hymn charge the theme of regenerative silence. The final return to the library, with vines subtly retracting, gives the place a living presence that supports closure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and sensorial—Sage Ridge, the ancient oaks, the clouded moon, the eclipse’s “silver ring of light”—and consistently filtered through Liora’s ritualistic attention. The oak roots and saplings, along with the locket, recur as charged images that frame the final reorientation of the village’s life. However, the environment doesn’t significantly constrain choices; it shapes atmosphere and symbolism more than tactics. Still, the landscape and objects meaningfully charge the ending rather than feeling like postcard dressing.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    The silo-as-library, the ash, glyphs, conduit, and vaulted chamber are vividly rendered and consistently used as tools and constraints in the historian’s investigation. Environmental details (the hum in the walls, vibration in the brick, the chamber’s pulsing glyphs) directly shape his actions and lead to the climactic placement of the tapestry fragment. The setting’s logic holds and evolves with the plot rather than sitting as backdrop. The final image of the reclaimed silo “breathing” charges the environment with thematic and narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lighthouse and rocky island are vividly evoked and thematically integrated—the beam, wind, salt, and stone all echo the guidance/secret motifs. The environment feels specific and lived-in (lantern lenses, telegraph coils, rusted chest), and it charges the final images of the gull and the beacon of “salt and secrets.” However, the setting rarely constrains choices or tactics; it’s more a richly painted backdrop and symbol engine than an active pressure source. Still, for atmospheric and thematic work, it’s strong.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vividly specific and integrated: the floating cathedral, dimensional anchor, loop pedal, and indigo palette all work together to build a singular atmosphere. Environmental elements (the anchor’s pull, inhaling walls, silence-absorbing arches) interact with the ritual and shape the stakes conceptually, not just decoratively. The recurring motifs of silence and indigo meaningfully charge the final image of the world bathed in that single hue. At times, the world’s rules remain abstract, but they stay internally consistent and don’t impede comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, and mirrored horizon are vividly rendered and consistently shape events—the glass carries vibration, the ice becomes a resonant membrane, the horizon fractures into batons of light. Setting is tightly woven with action rather than ornamental description, and the nautilus and glass cookie extend the environment into tools. Weather/light (dawn, frost, shimmer) track with and amplify the emotional arc. The environment doesn’t force hard tactical trade-offs, but it strongly charges the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glowing viaduct after rain, phosphorescent arches, and fractured horizon are vivid and consistently threaded, giving the piece a strong, coherent atmosphere. Environmental details are sensorially rich and filtered through the character’s metaphysical quest (rain as a song, droplets as notes), which suits the lyric mode. The setting does shape the final image (viaduct’s glow turning to a “somber sunrise,” rain dripping from consciousness), recharging earlier imagery. However, the environment rarely constrains concrete choice or tactics; it’s more stage and symbol than functional terrain, which limits it from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cavern setting is vivid and conceptually integrated: a “throat of stone” whose damp air swallows sound directly underpins the need for felt vibration instead of heard music. Objects like the petrified drum-skin turntable and wax shells are not just atmospheric but functional to the story’s mechanics. Environmental features (muted air, stone filament) evolve into active participants in the transformation, culminating in the glowing ribbon of hush. The final image of the cavern breathing with the world above effectively charges the setting with ongoing thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    The courtyard, arches, vines, and breathing fountain are vivid and cohesive, with details consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Setting isn’t just decorative: the hidden alcove and shaft directly provide the tactical solution, and the courtyard becomes a charged sanctuary in the final image. Weather, light (“bruised violet” sky, dusk into night), and small elements like the cat enhance tone without confusing spatial logic. A touch less generalized abstraction (“layered tranquility”) and more concrete sensory variety could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.3)
    The greenhouse for extinct plants is vividly and consistently rendered, with amber glass, fossilized ferns, phosphorescent vines, and extinct orchids shaping both mood and imagery. Setting details are deeply tied to the premise (extinction, memory, preserved scents) and recur meaningfully, especially when the orchids release petrichor at the end, blending with the perfume. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain Arlen’s choices, it richly charges his perceptions and the final image. Sensory specificity, especially olfactory and visual, feels purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    The terra-cotta grotto, baked-earth walls, amber veins, and electric-scented air are vividly rendered and recur with evolving significance as he maps, uncovers layers, and finally weaves the rope into the stone. Setting is not just postcard description: the walls’ mineral glaze and concentric tunnels are the mechanism by which he literally and thematically accesses “time,” and the final image depends on the grotto accepting and glowing with the rope. The integration of environment with action and theme is strong, though the density of figurative language sometimes risks turning the grotto into a generalized mystical backdrop rather than an absolutely singular place. Even so, the setting clearly charges and constrains the final choice, justifying a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific—“sunken orchard greenhouse,” “wrecked hulls of ancient ships,” and the “waterlogged floorboards” are memorable and sensorially rich. Environment participates in meaning: the ships echo the music at the end, the vines begin to sway in response to the melody, and the ruined rainforest context charges the entire scene. These details are consistently filtered through sonic perception, aligning with the protagonist’s gift. The world feels coherent and integrated, not a postcard backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    The amber grotto is sensually and conceptually rich—“liquid gold” walls, static hum, and mapped emotional residue all feel vivid and purposeful. Environmental details are not mere decoration: the grotto’s static and light are instrumental to Mara’s method and recur in the final images (“amber glow sealing the static charge,” “amber light that still lingered in memory”). The surrounding city—incense, lamps, fractured markets—extends the atmosphere and reinforces the emotional economy. A slightly tighter weave between setting and on-page jeopardy could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    The coastal town, “breezy library under stars,” pier, and lighthouse are vividly rendered with consistent sensory texture (brine, old paper, starlight, lantern). Setting is filtered through the story’s concerns—trade, reading, and navigation—and the lighthouse and balcony placement of the locket effectively charge the final imagery. However, the environment rarely constrains concrete choices; it frames and echoes theme more than it generates tactical pressure. Still, atmosphere and specificity are strong enough for high-band within that mode.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is rich and specific—the crystalline orchard, shimmering crater, phosphorescent moss, and obsidian arbor all create a distinctive, fully realized atmosphere. Details are strongly filtered through the piece’s emotional logic (the “luminescent ache,” webs of light, and reflected yearning), and the environment directly charges the final image as the orchard’s ache shifts to a steady glow. The arbor functions almost as a character-object, anchoring ritual and closure. At times the density of imagery edges toward ornamental, but clarity and spatial sense remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rooftop canal system, stone-ribbed city, and sleeping giant understructure are vivid, specific, and integrated into action (skiff travel, bridge of light, descent through the canal). The environment’s logic stays consistent and tonally supports the mythic, time-sculpting premise. The pendant and water both function as micro-settings in the climax, shaping what she can do and charging the final silver-water image. Some images are lush enough to verge on ornamental, but they still orient and rarely stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cavern orchard is vividly specific—stalactites, dripping silver notes, luminous fruit—and tightly integrated into the ritual (drops triggering vibrations, bridge of vines, petals from trees). Setting and objects repeatedly interact with action and theme, not just sit as backdrop, and the final dawn filtering through stalactites recharges earlier imagery. The environment doesn’t quite constrain choices as hard as it could, but it decisively shapes tone and the closure image. Overall, atmosphere and specificity are publication-level.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    The library at dawn, “sapphire hush,” dust, ink, pipes, and conduits create a vivid, coherent environment that’s consistently filtered through Maren’s task. The setting isn’t just scenic—it shapes the logic of the search (pipe chases, crawl spaces, hidden basement). The blue glow and commuters at the threshold charge the final image, making the space feel transformed by her actions. A slight tendency toward lush repetition keeps it just below the very top band, but the atmosphere is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: “mossy trellis,” “cool sheen,” storm season, copper coil, mycelial filaments and greenhouse details all reinforce the nursery as a living laboratory. Weather, moisture, and fungal networks are not mere backdrop but integral to the experiment’s logic and mood. Sensory choices feel filtered through a plant-obsessed mind, particularly in the droplet-as-data-point imagery. The environment shapes what is possible but stops short of constraining a sharply dramatized choice at the peak, which keeps this below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tidal island, basalt cliffs, receded tides, and mist-gathering gutters are concrete and atmospheric, and they tie directly to the post-war water scarcity. Weather and terrain (rain trails, algae-slick rock, salt-slick stones) meaningfully shape Mara’s movements and the key discovery. The convergence scene leverages setting well, with water spiraling up and mist varnishing the cliffs, charging the final image. A slightly tighter integration of tides or island topography into the choice mechanics could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    The musical crystal cave is vivid and sensorially rich—quartz and opal walls, harmonic resonance, overlapping shadows—as more than a backdrop; it’s the story’s primary actor. Environmental details (chiming floor, echoing arches, shadows becoming ribbons of light) are tightly woven into how magic works and how characters experience change. The cave’s rules stay consistent and culminate in a charged final image of pearl-light spilling into woven shadows. The density of description occasionally edges toward ornamental, but most details pull double duty for atmosphere and mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “ivory harbor after rain,” piers, lanterns, fog, and tide-as-archive imagery create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels integral to the premise. Setting details are strongly filtered through the archivist’s sensibility (sound, memory, fragments) rather than reading like a neutral catalog. The valve-as-tool and the harbor geography both charge key images (the note traveling dock to dock, the dawn chord, the final departure), though they rarely constrain concrete choices. World rules stay consistent and legible within the slightly mythic register.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    Setting is the standout: mist, cracks, ivy, the colossal eye-like vault, and the amber-lit cavern all feel vivid and integrated with her actions. The environment actively guides choice through the crack-arrows, reactive ivy, inscribed constellations, and architectural gating (staircase, iron door), not just as postcard description. The starlit vault and city streets also charge the final image, creating a strong atmospheric loop. Very strong work here, just shy of the most incisive constraint-driven settings.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.3)
    The stargazer’s tower, cliff edge, mist, and whale migration are vividly realized and strongly filtered through Lira’s attention, with recurring use of sea, sky, and stone as active presences. The tile, tower, whales, and windows all recur and charge the final image, especially when the tile’s glow becomes a “lighthouse for wandering thoughts.” Setting, though, mostly serves mood and symbolism rather than imposing concrete constraints or forcing different tactics on Lira. A touch more functional interaction—where the open tower or weather materially affects what she can do—would push this toward the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    The crystalline cavern, magnetic fields, prismatic hues, and solar storm create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s consistently filtered through the immortal’s perception. Environment is not mere backdrop: magnetism and the storm generate the amulet’s arrival and enable the corridors, and the prismatic escondite fading in the final image charges the closure. Occasionally the imagery edges toward decorative overload, but the setting is specific, integrated, and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    The funeral home prep room is vividly and economically evoked—lilies, incense, polished oak, and the sense of “whispering shadows” create an immediate, coherent atmosphere. Setting and environment actively matter: the mourners’ grief and the “dense fog” of sorrow are required conditions for the ink’s activation, and the curtains fluttering at the breach charge the turning point. The ink pot functions as a recurring object-as-setting, anchoring the scene physically and conceptually through to the final “clink.” Overall, the space feels specific and thematically tuned without slipping into static tour description.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the story’s great strength: the “blooming labyrinth of bonsai forests,” bruised-violet sky, fluorescent hut, and amber light scattering through lanterns are vivid and sensorially layered. Details are consistently filtered through the stationer’s work—light, hum, moss, paper—so atmosphere and concept tightly interlock. The environment shapes his movements (stone paths, bonsai corridors) and charges the final image (labyrinth inhaling, lamp-ghost humming), though it rarely constrains concrete choices. It achieves high lyric specificity and tonal cohesion, even if its role is more atmospheric than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    The port and container labyrinth are vividly rendered and filtered through the narrator’s sensibility; details like the rusted forklift, cracked vent, and slow tides create a coherent physical and tonal environment. The poison label as an object-as-setting literally “filters” the scene, charging both the middle murals and the final image. The sea’s tide subtly structures when erased histories appear and vanish. Setting is not just backdrop but a charged medium for the story’s central metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    The abandoned observatory, cliff, sea, and brass dome are vividly realized and consistently threaded through the piece, with strong sensory images (crumbling stone steps, cracked windows like pages, gull cries and waves). Setting and recurring objects (cello, shell, ledger, telescope) are well-integrated into action rather than touristic description. The final image of her descending the cliff as the observatory’s echoes merge with the sea nicely recharges prior details. Environment doesn’t strongly constrain her choices, but it powerfully shapes tone and symbolic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    The raft-city carnival is vivid and specific, from creaking hulls to misty dawn to graffiti on plastered walls, and it’s consistently filtered through the city’s motion and economy. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the floating layout and tourism riverfront directly shape the reorganization tactics and the stakes of privatization. The foundation stone chip and river’s edge recur meaningfully, charging the final image with the city’s history and vulnerability. A bit more sensory variety under peak pressure could push this higher, but what’s here is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lunar summit, crater rim, basalt dust, nascent Earthrise, and the chemical kit are all vividly rendered and tightly integrated into action rather than postcard description. The environment materially shapes what’s possible (tripod sinking into powdery basalt, insulated kit, vacuum-suitable rigging) and charges the final images of him descending and looking back toward Earth. The recurring imagery of “dawning hush,” pale light on the crater, and the grain perched on basalt creates a strong atmospheric throughline. This is very close to top-tier literary-description work, with only a slight sense that some phrases recur enough to feel a bit ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is exceptionally textured: the mist-coated rail depot, anchor vibrations, oil lamps, and water basin all feel lived-in and specific, filtered through Mara’s non-visual perception. Crucially, the environment is not decorative; mist and refracted light actively enable her method, and the depot’s atmosphere charges the final images. Spatial and sensory choreography are clear and coherent throughout. The only limit is that the broader world (ship, city, tech) remains gestured rather than fully dimensional, keeping this at “very strong” rather than absolute top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rusted outpost and frozen lake are vividly rendered and omnipresent: metal ribs, waning moon on ice, subterranean streams, and the transmitter all feel tactile and specific. Environment constrains and channels choice—her isolation, the permafrost, and the outpost’s decaying technology drive her to use the glass, antenna, and bell as tools rather than generic scenery. Recurring elements (lake surface, ice cracks, falcon’s orbit, rusted bell) evolve meaningfully and charge the final image of the thin vein of water and “ice singing.” The setting is not just pretty; it is the story’s primary pressure and its thematic engine.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and coherent: the ancient archway, hanging shutters, cobblestones, and market stalls are sensorially alive and filtered through a tonal lens that fits the premise. The environment actively matters—sun on stone is the signal to begin, the archway becomes the town’s focal point, and cobblestones are the medium of restoration. World rules (stones sliding into place, well water singing) are consistently followed in their magical realism. Some imagery edges toward decorative repetition, but it rarely muddies spatial or atmospheric clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    The underwater temple is vividly drawn—violet gloom, kelp-draped pillars, stained glass windows, bioluminescent fish—and consistently filtered through Mara’s perception. Crucially, the environment isn’t just backdrop: the altar, column hollow, and “temple’s heart” dictate how the vial is used and how the price is exacted. The temple’s continuing role as “silent guardian” and place of ongoing tribute charges the final image. A bit of description borders on luxuriant, but it largely serves atmosphere and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, fog, and copper glow are vividly rendered and recur in ways that charge the atmosphere and final image. The environment isn’t just backdrop: the reef, fissures, and prison isolation underpin the logic of missing bodies and the need for a map. Sensory detail is rich and mostly purposeful, though sometimes leans toward decorative lyricism. The closing return to the balcony and beam solidly ties setting to thematic transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    The orchard greenhouse in endless night, with metal-wind, frost-bitten vines, and winter-cracked fields, is vividly and consistently rendered, and the alchemical environment directly shapes what’s possible (awakening metal-vines into memory, fertilizing soil with venom). The greenhouse and bead charge the final image of lantern-like blossoms against darkness in a way that reweights all prior description. Occasionally the density of imagery flirts with overload, but spatial and atmospheric anchors remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.0)
    The canyon labyrinth setting is vivid, sensorial, and consistent, with the red stone, tide pools, and orchid-scented air all reinforcing the mood. The environment is not just backdrop: stone walls, corridors, and arches are directly involved in her weaving and in the final image of a “tapestry of stone and light.” While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it is inseparable from the story’s premise and ending. The recurring contrast between emptied tide pools and humming labyrinth deepens atmosphere effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid and memorable—roots like “pale rivers of memory,” marrow-whispers, bioluminescent veins—creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting details are filtered through Mara’s reverent, task-focused perception, which keeps the description purposeful rather than touristic. The environment subtly acts on the action—the roots recoil and then guide, bones rattle in time with a “distant, unseen clock”—and the restored altar catching dawn light charges the final image. The recurring interplay of roots, bones, and light strongly anchors both tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.0)
    The golden arcade, neon roofs, cracked chalked pavement, and recycled-circuitry drone create a distinctive, integrated environment that’s vivid without being confusing. Setting details are consistently filtered through the ritual and nostalgia frame, and the arcade directly charges the final image via the drone “woven from recycled arcade circuitry.” While the space doesn’t heavily constrain tactical choices, it does meaningfully shape atmosphere, tools, and the conceptual stakes around obsolescence and futurity. This felt like the story’s strongest craft element.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.3)
    Setting and atmosphere are the story’s greatest strength: the cobalt observatory, brass domes, glass roof, dormant telescope, and autumn wind create a vivid, coherent environment. Details like the flame’s heat seeping into the threads and the telescope becoming “a mirror for her thoughts” are filtered through the protagonist’s vocation and mood. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, but it does meaningfully charge the final image of dawn on the copper dome and the stitched sky as proof. The “echoed silence” motif roots tone in the space and evolves with the emerging conspiracy.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mangrove labyrinth, singing spirits, moonlit lagoon, and condensation-glass imagery are vividly rendered and integrated into action rather than static description. Environment participates in the ritual—roots weave syllables into soil, spirits catch drifting letters, water forms a “second sky” for messages—so the setting is more than backdrop. Sensory detail is strong and consistent with the numinous tone, though the atmosphere occasionally verges on uniform (always hushed, reverent) rather than showing sharper local contrasts. The recurring shard as object is effectively charged into the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.5)
    The mist-clad atrium and twilight are vividly rendered and thematically tuned, with the fog mirroring “shared anxieties” and the space “breathing” like a collective psyche. The brain coral as recurring object is especially strong, anchoring the abstract work of healing in something tactile and recurring through to the final image. The environment doesn’t much constrain choices or logistics, functioning more as a mood chamber than an active stage. Still, the specificity and integration of setting with emotion and theme are notably strong for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.3)
    The ruined, fog-choked orchard and the luminous murals are vividly realized, with recurring fog/light imagery that charges the final sunrise and thinning mist. The environment shapes mood and theme strongly, and the orchard’s “rebirth” provides a clear spatial metaphor for inner change. However, the setting rarely constrains concrete choices or tactics; it mostly frames emotion. Strong atmosphere, but not yet using place as an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sound wave garden is vividly and specifically rendered—“blossom of air shaped by harmonic currents,” “chorus of microscopic bells,” “cascade of miniature auroras”—and Lena’s attention as a visual artist gives the setting a strong POV filter. Environmental details don’t just decorate; they are the operating mechanics of the magic and directly frame her final understanding. The garden’s behavior (pulses, echoes, reflected tones) remains consistent and evolves with events, culminating in the synced heartbeat motif and the garden “holding its breath” again at the end. This environment clearly charges the final image, though occasionally the density of imagery edges toward ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.3)
    The entomologist’s greenhouse is vividly imagined—the insects’ hum, glass panes, moss, seedlings, and gourd seed all recur and fuse into the final image of an archive of rebellion. Setting and atmosphere clearly filter through the story’s concept: patterns in seedlings, insect gossip, and vents carrying chants all embody the secret language and resistance. Community gardens beyond the greenhouse are more sketched than lived-in, but they still extend the spatial logic of the rebellion. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices in-scene, yet it convincingly charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    The gargantuan shell, reef, and galaxy postcard are vividly and consistently rendered, creating a distinct, immersive atmosphere. Setting images (shell walls, reef-shadow light, starlight pollen) recur and charge the final “library of light” image effectively. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it does shape the story’s metaphoric logic and tone throughout. The sensory palette leans visual but is rich and character-filtered enough to feel purposeful rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “opal library above clouds,” glass orchids, and museum of extinct feelings are vivid and coherent, with strong sensory specificity and consistent surreal rules. Setting is tightly integrated into action (light refracting through orchids, echoes in vaulted arches, cloud-parchment outside) and charges the final image of the library as beacon. However, the environment rarely constrains choice; it mainly amplifies atmosphere and theme. Visually and conceptually rich enough to approach top-tier, but not yet structurally indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    The archive is vividly evoked—the “dim vaulted” space, dust, stone walls, wind stirring parchments—and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensory and professional lens. The glass ink well and vellum function as micro-setting objects intertwined with the magic system. While the environment doesn’t sharply constrain her options, it clearly charges the final image (archive breathing, ink well as beacon) and anchors the lyric atmosphere effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    The crumbling amphitheater in a dormant volcano is vividly rendered and tightly woven into action (the tremors, the “breath,” ash settling, water glinting). Setting is not just backdrop: the volcano’s water systems justify the floodgate, the amphitheater’s “breathing” frames the stakes, and the final image of the water as a sapphire thread from the balcony is charged. Details like basalt floor, cracked marble, and ash as “ancient score” feel purposeful and filtered through the story’s sensibility. The environment subtly constrains and infuses every choice without becoming a static catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    The attic of the vintage bookshop—with its single skylight, dust motes, old books, and parchment—feels vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Lila’s sensibility. The environment is not just backdrop; the skylight and dust patterns literally dictate her mapping method, and the attic’s isolation versus the streets below underwrites the story’s vertical bridge between solitude and community. The final image of the glowing map on the attic wall is meaningfully charged by this spatial and atmospheric work. This is one of the piece’s most publication-ready aspects.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and idiosyncratic: a drifting prism terrace, amber fields, glass corridors, temperature-sensitive ink, and the corn maze below all feel specific and coherent. Environment shapes action—the hidden panel, maps, and maze geometry determine his path rather than serving as mere backdrop. Recurring objects (terrace, corn, maps, chairs) are filtered through his perception in ways that mirror the theme of thresholds and distances. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that physical constraints never bite very hard; the setting is evocative more than adversarial.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    The underwater research facility, bioluminescent algae, coral pedestal, and glass-panel epochs are vivid, sensorially rich, and unified by a coherent aquatic/astral aesthetic. The setting is well filtered through Aria’s astrologer gaze (constellations in fireflies, maps in ash), which helps avoid a tourist-catalog feel. The feather and the facility do charge the final image conceptually, but the environment rarely constrains choice; it primarily provides mood and spectacle rather than tactical limitations. Still, as atmosphere and specificity, it’s strong and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    The iridescent geode cave, crystal pillars, and crater-glass mosaic are vivid and specific, with strong visual logic tied to the emotional-color conceit. Setting is not just decorative: the cracked crystal pillars, deepest bend, and central fissure all map directly onto where and how she pursues and resolves the problem. The environment’s kaleidoscopic, “cheerful gloom” mood also supports the tonal and thematic aims. The one limit is that the cave rarely constrains her tactically; it tends to mirror and host, not meaningfully endanger.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.0)
    The tidal arcade, neon ribbons, starlight, glass, and water are vivid and specific, and they’re not mere backdrop: the tide literally “dictates the next step” and erases the ink, and the reflected starlight and ripples are part of his method. The recurring bishop and water imagery evolve through the piece and charge the final image of the bishop’s crown imprint. Sensory detail is strong, especially visually, and mostly integrated into action rather than static description. The setting meaningfully underpins the story’s core idea of order emerging from fluid chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    The twilight garden, sea pulse, pool of fallen constellations, and night-bloom create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that strongly colors every action. Setting is consistently filtered through Lira’s ritual focus and integrates with the magic system (gaps, moonstone dust, constellations whispering to water). The environment doesn’t quite constrain her choices—she never has to adapt tactics because of the garden—but it certainly charges the final image of the night-bloom broadcasting her verse. Rich, purposeful description just shy of the constraint needed for the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.0)
    The harbor, prism atrium, mist, nets, and pond are vividly and consistently rendered, with a strong bias through Mira’s visual and occupational sensibilities. Environmental elements don’t strongly constrain choice, but they do decisively charge the imagery and final moments—the glass, tide, and prisms are inseparable from the thematic resolution. The weather and light evolve over the piece (dawn mist to steady light to noon), giving the setting a temporal arc that parallels her inner shift. This is rich, purposeful atmosphere, even if it doesn’t quite push into constraint-based genius.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    The moonlit ridge, ash-filled valley, and village square are sensorially vivid and tonally consistent, with the porcelain box functioning as a charged object that clearly anchors the final image. Environmental elements like ash, moonlight, and the ridge mirror her scars and thematic concerns in a mostly organic way. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but it does charge the atmosphere and closure image (the box’s light against night, children’s faces, the remembered fire). Occasionally the imagery veers toward generalized celestial/lyric language rather than sharply particular detail.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tide‑polished grotto, sea‑foam, brass gauge, and decorative balloons create a vivid, coherent atmosphere, with strong visual specificity and some tactile cues. The setting is consistently integrated into the imagery—reflected light, water echoes, carvings mirroring spirals—so the environment feels thematically resonant rather than pasted on. However, it rarely constrains choices or action; the grotto and shoreline shape mood and symbolism more than tactics. The final reveal of sea‑etched spirals ties the world nicely to Arin’s equations but still reads as confirmation rather than an active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and cohesive: misty post-shift world, ivy-veiled passage, stone corridors, and the film negative’s glow all create a strong atmospheric field. Details are usually filtered through Lira’s professional sensibility, turning walls and echoes into lived-in tools rather than mere backdrop. The environment meaningfully charges the final image—the quiet university corridors humming with dreams—but only lightly constrains her choices. Overall, the space feels tangible and thematically integrated without becoming static description.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and consistently integrated: the echoing terrace, prism parapet, rain, and bells all feed the sensory field and support the ritualistic tone. The environment participates conceptually—the parapet and mirrors catch and refract light/heartbeat—but rarely constrains concrete options or tactics. Still, the final image of doors and future springs growing out of this specific terrace feels charged by the established atmosphere rather than generic. It’s strong atmospheric work, even if it doesn’t fully cross into choice-shaping terrain.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ancient terrace, firelight, and “slow dance of celestial bodies” are vividly rendered and threaded throughout, creating a strong, cohesive atmosphere. The ebony clipboard as a dark object on white marble and then among swords provides a clear, charged visual anchor at the end. While the setting does not strongly constrain tactical choices, it does shape tone and thematic resonance—the terrace becoming a “living altar” is a powerful image. Description occasionally leans toward decorative repetition, but overall specificity and integration are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    The salt flat is richly realized—cracked riverbeds as a map, brine pool as “natural amplifier,” sky as “bruised”—and these aren’t postcard details; they directly shape what he can do and how the ritual works. Environmental rules (resonant salt, lull of thunder) remain consistent and drive the mechanics of the climax. The final image of the shimmering, fissured surface “bearing the invisible imprint” charges the setting with thematic weight. Line-level, the density of imagery is high but generally controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    The silver courtyard, snow, and hovering prism sanctuary are vividly rendered with strong, consistent imagery; sensory details like “air tasted of ice and ink” create a distinctive atmosphere. Setting and weather are integrated into the action in modest ways (snow muffling footsteps, flakes as punctuation), and the prism’s environment is essential to the story’s conceit. However, the courtyard and snow very rarely constrain choice or tactics; they are more atmospheric than operative. The final image is charged by setting, but not decisively shaped by it.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    The decommissioned radar dome, inward-turned dishes, and ember-lit interior are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Selene’s sensibility, generating a strong, coherent atmosphere. Specifics like “massive parabolic faces turned inward” and the scent of distant pine prevent white-room syndrome and echo the thematic inward-listening. The campfire stick and dome jointly charge the final images of her leaving with a portable “lantern of ethical wonder.” The environment does not significantly constrain action, so its contribution is more tonal and symbolic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    The verdant grotto above the clouds is vivid and sensorially rich, with clouds, vines, bioluminescent moss, and light all integrated into Lira’s perceptions and actions. The environment supports the tone and theme of suspended, liminal remembrance and contributes to key images (signals visible to future wanderers, wind carrying the anthem to valleys). However, the setting rarely constrains choice or tactics; it frames and amplifies rather than forces decisions. Its role is thus powerfully atmospheric but only moderately functional.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    The icebound sanctum, aurora, rope, and organ are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action; the environment and tools are not backdrop but the mechanism of the ritual. The melting ice, glowing rope, and aurora’s response concretely mirror the internal thaw and charge the final image of the “living library.” A slight excess of descriptive flourish aside, the setting feels specific, lived-in, and thematically functional.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    The vine-draped bunker, rewilded forest, and storm are vivid and specific, with strong sensory choices (moss, ivy, phosphorescent spores) that feel filtered through this world’s logic. Setting and atmosphere are tightly woven into the premise—the decaying directive, the forest’s “heartbeat,” and path-sentience all arise from the environment rather than being bolted on. The final image of the bunker humming and vines stretching outward meaningfully echoes the opening. The environment enhances meaning but stops short of directly constraining a concrete decision, which keeps it just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “ancient Babylonian palace reimagined” is vividly evoked through dusk light, wind‑chimed arches, courtyards, and stone corridors, all filtered through an astronomer’s priorities. Setting supports tone and theme—the palace as a bridge between earthly archives and celestial forces—and the environment evolves from dusty neglect to charged sanctum and then to subtly prospering markets. While the palace doesn’t physically constrain choices, the altar, balconies, and archives function as charged micro-settings that shape what Nabu can do. The specificity is strong and atmospheric without devolving into a generic ancient-past postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    The soundless obsidian sanctuary and the “shifting grace” walls are vivid, specific, and tonally aligned with the story’s quiet mysticism. Setting details (sound-absorption, porous reality at night) are not just decorative; they frame when and how Mara can act and charge the final image of the sanctuary as beacon. The music box and pin function as a micro-setting object that powerfully anchors closure. Some sensory range beyond the visual and tactile could deepen immersion further, but what’s here is purposeful and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ruined orchard, fog, twilight frost, and silvered glass are richly specific and tightly integrated into the magic system—Arlen literally uses the orchard’s breath and fog to repair the sextant and capture the dream. Environmental details evolve with the action (fog thinning, silhouettes of trees emerging) and charge the final image of a breathing, silver-veined orchard. The setting is not just backdrop but an active medium that constrains method and possibilities. The consistency and purposefulness of these images elevate the atmosphere well above decorative description.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    The orchard in the cathedral, cracked stained glass, and the interplay of light with quartz create a strong, distinctive atmosphere that feels integral rather than decorative. Environmental details are filtered through Lira’s craft and purpose: the canopy’s “pulse” and the choir-like light directly inform the mending method. The setting recurs at the end, charging the final image of walking beneath intertwining branches as a generational pact. On the downside, the density of lush description occasionally skirts excess, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    The astral orchard and the satellite-library bathrooms are vivid, specific, and tonally unified, with strong, imaginative images (floating trees, luminous pollen, mosaic of cracked tiles). Setting is consistently filtered through the curator’s conceptual concerns, which keeps it from feeling like a postcard tour. However, the environment rarely constrains options; it primarily functions as charged backdrop and metaphor rather than an active limiter of choice. Still, the recurring objects-as-setting (the orchard, the shell, the tiles) do effectively charge the final image of the constellations-map on the asteroid.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, original, and consistently filtered through the story’s obsessions with books, plants, and sound—the mountain-bookstore, cliff-shelves, humming volumes, phosphorescent fungi, and living vines are all memorable. Environment actively shapes action: gaps in shelving, the collapsing floor, and the vine-covered door constrain and enable Selene’s tactics. World rules (botanical names as keys, symphonic hums as signals) are implied through use rather than dumped. The final image of glass libraries echoing the same unheard symphony feels earned by the earlier spatial and sonic imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The abandoned carnival ship, foggy bay, cracked mirrors, and garden are vividly realized and tonally consistent, with strong, specific imagery (rusted brass, broken carousel horses, a river of ink) that supports the “trapped freedom” mood. The environment participates thematically (derelict carnival revived by recovered names) and charges the final image of other vessels awaiting their discoverers. However, the setting rarely constrains choices or tactics; it is more atmospheric than operative, keeping this just below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    The clock tower mechanism room, vault, and stairwell are vivid and purposeful; gears, pendulum, balcony, and rope all interact with Mara’s actions rather than sitting as backdrop. The environmental logic (door at midnight, seam in the vault, clock freezing) charges both the opening and closing images. Objects-as-setting (rope, seal, clock hands) constrain what she can do and directly frame the final state of the world. Description is rich without losing spatial clarity, and it mirrors the story’s conceptual concerns effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.3)
    The harmonic caves are vividly realized through sound, light, and texture, and the environment is not merely decorative: ice cracks literally encode the map, the fissure “spine” determines where the stone must sit, and the cave’s acoustics define the stakes. Details like “a narrow tunnel of sapphire light” and ice that “dripp[s] silence into the air” are sensorially rich and thematically aligned. World rules around resonance and energy beings stay consistent and are learned through action, not exposition. The setting actively shapes tactics and the final image, though at times the lush description threatens to outpace immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    The glass humming pavilion, lone beacon tower, and ruined world are sharply drawn and recur as functional anchors rather than backdrop. The environment materially shapes the central ritual (alignment on the cracked stone floor, glass walls singing with the rekindled light) and charges the final image of the pavilion as a testament that “fractured things can become whole.” World rules feel consistent for this level of lyric fantasy; the shard, stars, and pavilion’s acoustics interlock cleanly. A touch more sensory variety beyond light and sound could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is a pronounced strength: the stormlit observatory, solid fog, whispering crystal, and basalt obelisk are vivid, sensorially rich, and tightly interwoven with the memory/identity motif. Environmental changes (storm ending, fog solidifying, sunrise) mirror the internal progression and charge the final images of lingering shadows and hush. The rules of this quasi-fantastical world feel internally consistent and are learned through his actions rather than exposition. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain choices, it powerfully charges meaning and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the “blooming fortress,” ivy and roses, jasmine, and the starless night all filter through the designer’s sensibility. Environmental elements actively respond (walls inhaling words, fortress smiling, vines cradling fireworks), which charges the final images. The recurring fortress and sky imagery meaningfully frame the contrast between hopeless darkness and crafted light. A slight excess of similar lush descriptors risks blur, but spatial and tonal anchoring remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto, stars, and tidal pool are vividly rendered and recur as mirrors of cosmic and emotional states, with strong sensory specificity (silver spill, basalt slab, cool breeze). The jade cicada and reflective water function as micro-setting elements charging the final image of time as a sea and the cicada going dull. Setting is integrated into her method of reading transitions (ripples, reflections) rather than feeling like backdrop. It doesn’t significantly constrain her choices, which keeps it just short of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    The bunker corridors, ventilation shafts, and xenial trellis above the clouds are vividly rendered and filtered through Lio’s bodily perceptions. The inversion of gravity and humming vines establish consistent, distinctive world rules learned via action rather than exposition dumps. Setting meaningfully charges the ending as the bunker’s hum echoes the trellis’s lullaby, tying environment to internal change. A slight excess of decorative description in places keeps it just shy of top-tier economy.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting and atmosphere are the story’s strongest elements: the “drifting prism terrace,” singing translucent stones, misty river, and violet-banded sky create a vivid, coherent otherworld. Details like the hull humming to match the terrace and the storm glass’s colors are well-integrated into action rather than static description. The environment mirrors and amplifies the inner calm but rarely constrains choices; Lira’s tactics would be similar on almost any magical vessel. Even so, the recurring imagery of glass, light, and water strongly charges the final image of the river as “a mirror of calm.”

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is lush, specific, and sensorially rich: “fermented jasmine and silicon,” “blooming data trees,” and pixelated rain establish a distinctive atmosphere. Environment and objects (waterfall, orchard, murals) are directly tied to the path of discovery, even if they don’t deeply constrain her options. The world’s rules feel internally consistent in a mythic-sf way, and the final image of roots intertwining with data streams reuses setting to charge the ending. There is a mild sense of over-saturation in description, but it does not seriously harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight is vividly and consistently realized, with strong, selective imagery (starlight seeping through cracks, pale constellations on the floor, corridor of pure starlight). Setting and recurring objects (threshold, ring, embers, veins) meaningfully intersect with action and closure: the environment literally becomes the conduit for transformation. The space reflects and shapes the internal stakes of isolation vs. connection. It falls just short of the very top band because the sensory palette leans heavily on the same visual/abstract register, with less textural variation.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm, the violet glow, and the pressure chamber are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through the narrator’s perception. Setting is not mere backdrop; the fungal “veins,” pulsing caps, and spores literally respond to the pressure and the quantum process, charging both the decision moment and the final image. The submarine bolt as a small, recurring object is well-integrated into the environment, carrying history and transforming visibly during the climax. Overall atmosphere is rich and purposeful, though a few descriptive phrases lean toward ornamental rather than pressure-linked.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sepia reading room, oak table, carved panel, floorboards, and gramophone are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action: the etched cipher and hidden compartment literally reside in the setting. Sensory details—amber light, dust, old paper, jasmine outside—are specific and coherent with the contemplative tone. The environment constrains the search tactics (listening to the wood, lifting specific boards) and charges the final image of the quiet gramophone and open scroll. At times the descriptive density edges toward ornamental, but it mostly remains purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    The greenhouse-orchard is richly realized through metal vines, vapor, luminescent moss, iron-and-jasmine scent, and breathing walls, all filtered through the knight’s perception. The environment isn’t just backdrop: it literally responds to his actions (vapor shapes, moss spores, armor melting into moss), and the endless night as canvas metaphor charges both opening and ending. World rules (alchemical, responsive, stage-like) remain internally consistent. At times description edges toward excess, but it mostly serves atmosphere and thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    The foster care file room is vividly rendered and thematically charged, with dust, ledgers, and high windows all doing double duty as mood and metaphor. The environment directly shapes the story’s logic—the dust and light literally enable the silhouettes, and the forgotten files embody the histories she’s trying to rescue. The button as micro-setting/tool also charges the final image. Detail density is high but mostly purposeful and filtered through Amelia’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    The auric lagoon, starlight, puddle reflections, and rusted transmitter are vividly realized and consistently filtered through the story’s poetic logic, giving the piece a strong, unified atmosphere. The environment is not mere backdrop: the water becomes a literal map, a memory-reservoir, and the physical locus of resistance, and it decisively charges the final images. Sensory detail skews visual but is specific and purposeful, with a clear tone. A small amount of description verges on ornamental, but overall the setting work is a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    The grotto, prism atrium, fog, and dewdrops are vividly rendered and thematically aligned with silence, refraction, and dissolution. Setting is woven into action—the prism refracts his whisper, the mist receives the “language of fog,” and the grotto itself “hums” in response—rather than sitting as static backdrop. Sensory detail is rich and mostly purposeful, though there is some repetition of similar images (“in mist,” “radiant grotto”) that could be trimmed. The final image of him fading into fog with the valley breathing his song is strongly charged by the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly and consistently rendered, with strong integration of objects (moonstone dust, monuments, crystal pool) and environment (ashen canopy, falling leaves) into the magic system. World rules are implied through action rather than explained, and the setting’s texture supports the tone of hushed ritual and prophecy. The environment does constrain discovery (water hidden beneath roots, canopy reflected in the pool), though it rarely forces difficult choices. Still, the final image of luminous script on the ground and moonstone dust mist is striking and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    The subterranean spaces, greenhouse, phosphorescent moss/algae, and waterfall are vividly rendered with multisensory detail and a strong, consistent mood. Setting is filtered through Mara’s tinkerer mind and history-minded gaze, and the waterfall later powering the new clock lets environment meaningfully charge the final image. Some details (e.g., silver dust, exotic ferns) are more atmospheric than constraining, but they rarely feel like empty decoration. Overall, place is a genuine asset that supports tone and theme while remaining legible.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rain‑washed foundry, idle furnaces, anvil, and metallic air are vividly realized and consistently filtered through her alchemical mindset. The environment is not just backdrop; the anvil and faintly glowing furnaces are necessary for the ritual, and the rain’s shift from hammering to whisper mirrors the emotional modulation. The recurring rain/furnace/metal textures charge the final image of her walking into the rain with the repaired coin’s story behind her. Detail density is high but mostly purposeful, with few wasted scenic gestures.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    Echo Gorge, the misaligned harp, and the dawn-lit water are vividly rendered and consistently threaded through the action. The environment does more than decorate: echoes, stone walls, and water all mediate the confessions and the final transformation, and the gorge’s later hum functions as an extended setting consequence. The crocodile’s tooth operates as a micro-setting/object that charges the final image. The only thing keeping this out of the very top band is that the environment rarely constrains tactical options; it mostly supports mood and metaphysics.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ultraviolet forest is vividly and consistently rendered, with strong sensory specificity (“mosaic of crystal roots,” “violet light that seared her skin”). Environment and object-as-setting (the strap) both constrain experience and decisively charge the final image as the light softens to amber and then ordinary sun. World rules—painful flashes as the price of revelation—are clear and integrated. A small amount of phrase repetition edges toward over-insistence, but atmosphere remains rich and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    The alchemist’s market above rooftops, rope ladders, stalls, and arches are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. Setting is well-integrated into action (walking narrow ledges, descending ladders, wind tugging on the coat) and the market structurally frames the translation ritual and its dissolution. The lighthouse fragment as recurring object strongly charges both the middle ritual and the final image. The environment could constrain choices more directly, but as a lyric piece the atmospheric work is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.3)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is richly evoked—marquee, broken glass ceiling, calliope, cracked mirrors—and these details meaningfully shape action (dust as map, fissures as spirit paths, cramped alcove above the ticket window). The horological and circus elements interlock to create a distinct, texturally dense environment rather than a generic haunted building. Setting is filtered through Mara’s professional and spectral attentiveness, keeping it from feeling like a catalog. It stops just short of 9+ because the environment constrains mood and discovery more than it forces hard tactical trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    The glass orchard library, frost, clouds, and letterpress are vividly rendered and consistent, with specific, imaginative details (“shelves glinting like frost‑kissed panes,” clouds turning to letters) that feel integral rather than decorative. Setting materially shapes tactics—Mara uses frost geometry on the glass panes, the glass cracks, the clouds become text, and the final lattice of panes becomes the new architecture of time. The environment’s transformation charges the final image, though it rarely constrains choice or imposes practical obstacles. Overall, the world feels striking and purposeful, aligned with the story’s conceptual concerns.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    The baroque asteroid, violet nebula, silver rain storms, and time-synchronized core create a striking, unified environment that feels specific and lived-in. Setting is not mere backdrop: storms, mirrors, and the asteroid’s core pulse all constrain timing and method, and the shard-as-object charges the final image. Description leans lush but remains purposeful, consistently mirroring Lira’s emotional and thematic concerns.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vividly and consistently rendered, from the “fog‑laden dusk” and old clocktower to the humming resonance chamber and “garden of iron vines.” Details are not postcard-only; the chamber’s acoustics, rust covenant, and later the lanterns powered by resonance all entwine with the story’s premise. The world rules (metal remembering decay, truth affecting the covenant) are coherent and learned through Alder’s actions and perceptions. Environment clearly supports tone and concept even if it rarely forces hard tactical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is rich, specific, and thematically charged, from the abandoned factory town to the “subterranean lagoon beneath limestone cliffs” and the bioluminescent “liquid glass” staircase. Environmental details are consistently filtered through Mara’s sensibility (minerals, rain-scent, tectonic memory), giving the world strong textural coherence. Crucially, the lagoon and water staircase are not mere backdrops—they shape the nature of the portal and the way she crosses thresholds. The final juxtaposition of factory silhouette and lagoon song effectively charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and specific: storm-tossed archway, dim harbor, turbine hum, and driftwood-strewn surf all feel tangible and atmospherically integrated. Environment is not mere backdrop; the arch becomes portal, studio, and eventual attractor for visitors, while weather and turbines modulate mood. Details are filtered through Mira’s artistic sensibility (stone as grain, scars as memory), which keeps them character-specific rather than touristic. It stops short of absolute top-tier because the physical constraints of the space never quite force a difficult choice or tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.3)
    Setting is a major strength: the amber pavilion, bruised sky, melting snow, and the cathedral’s hidden garden are vividly drawn and tonally integrated. Environment and objects (postcards, glass, lenses) actively shape the experience and charge the final image of the moonlit night-flowers. However, while the world is sensorially rich, it rarely constrains tactics; it’s more atmospheric than coercive. The specificity is high enough for strong publication, even if not maximally functional.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is richly imagined and specific—floating library, sand‑carvers’ cathedrals, obsidian lagoon—and these locations are not mere backdrops; they actively shape tactics (beach debris language, subterranean descent, broadcast from the zeppelin). The environmental logic remains consistent and is filtered through Mara’s archivist sensibility. The brass panels glowing violet at the end powerfully recharges the lagoon imagery. A slight overreliance on visual/philosophical description over other sensory textures is the only modest limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    Paper-lantern cove, the ghost town, amber, and light-fountain images are vivid and coherent, creating a strong, specific atmosphere. The recurring lanterns and glass/amber motifs charge the final image, tying setting directly to the town’s rebirth. Sensory detail is mostly visual but purposeful, consistently filtered through the alchemist’s preoccupation with memory and resurrection. The environment rarely constrains action in a tactical way, so its role is primarily symbolic and tonal rather than logistical.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    The orchard atop the skyscraper, with its pomegranates, singing plum, and rusted phonograph, is richly imagined and consistently filtered through Harel’s sensibility. Environmental details are not just decorative: the fruit, roots, and wax cylinders all echo the themes of preservation, language, and emotional residue, and the orchard explicitly frames the final image as a “living archive.” The vertical juxtaposition of ancient garden and steel city supports tone and concept without confusion. While the setting doesn’t tightly constrain concrete choices, it undeniably charges the narrative’s stakes and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    The icebound atrium under starlight is vividly and consistently realized, with the glass walls, mist, and melting ice all evolving in step with the ritual. Environment and object-as-setting (acorn cap, copper basin, frost-kissed earth) actively participate in the action and charge the final image of planting the seed. The sensory palette is rich and purposeful rather than touristic, and the space clearly constrains the story to a single, numinous locus. This is one of the story’s strongest dimensions, though the lushness occasionally borders on decorative excess.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “windblown sanctuary above the clouds,” built of “driftwood ribs and glass panes,” is vivid and atmospherically integrated with the microclimate sensors and bell. Weather, architecture, and tools (rope, cable, console) all interact to create a coherent, textural environment in which wind and hush are meaningful forces. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain tactical choices beyond the need for specific wind patterns, it strongly charges the imagery and tone, especially at zero hour and dawn. The specificity and consistency are high, even if not fully exploited for pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    The shooting star tracking station, valley, and lantern are richly imagined and specific, with consistent atmospheric logic. The environment isn’t just backdrop: the station hums with “ancient algorithms,” records the vow, emits a chord, and the ground tremor mirrors the emotional bridge between fragile and infinite. The yellow lantern glass functions as a recurring micro-setting object that decisively charges the final image (“molten sunrise,” cracks reflecting fallen stars). This integration of setting and thematic closure is strong and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ash world, beekeeping oasis, cracked hives, ghosts, and glass house are vivid and tightly integrated, with strong sensory and imagistic specificity. The stained glass box and bees-as-memory clearly charge the final image, as the amber tear literally seals the earth and covenant. The environment isn’t just backdrop; it mirrors and reframes the thematic concerns of memory, silence, and renewal, giving the ending real atmospheric heft.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.3)
    The emerald silo, dust-laden valley, hourglass beneath the foundation, and silver-sand sky are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through the time-obsessed premise. Environment does real work: the silo as antenna, the hidden hourglass, and grains of sand as memories charge the mechanics and the final image. The setting evolves with events—glow, luminescence, map of time-threads—rather than staying static description. A slightly more tactile sense of Mara’s body in this space could push it higher, but as-is it’s strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lagoon, shoreline, reeds, and weather are vividly rendered and consistently filter through the poet’s contemplative gaze, creating a strong, immersive atmosphere. The environment isn’t just a backdrop: ripples, light, and stillness are the medium through which his art and the feather’s “power” manifest. The final image—the lagoon glowing faintly with the feather like a star—is charged by all the accumulated sensory work. At times the descriptive density verges on ornamental, but it still largely serves the piece’s lyric aims.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    The temple orchard, living stone pillars, copper-wrapped oaks, and “bruised amber” sea are vivid and specific, and they recur to charge the final image of a single breathing organism. Details feel filtered through Mara’s caretaker mindset (botanical diary, bark textures), giving the setting a lived-in, purposeful quality. The environment directly shapes the premise: the pillars’ reactions and the orchard’s layout make the experiment and its social impact possible. A minor ding comes from occasional descriptive abstraction (“bio‑energies”) that’s less concrete than the strongest lines.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rainwashed tower, mossy courtyard, and overgrown sculptures are vividly rendered, with sensory detail integrated through Arin’s attention (wet stone, drizzle, amber light). The environment materially participates: the tower is the contact site, the sculptures guide his path, and the rain modulates the amber’s radiance and the final “breathing” of the structure. The setting’s mood (“bronze quiet,” “silvered sentinel”) supports the contemplative, reverent-but-skeptical tone and charges the final image of the tower shining with inner light. At times the description edges toward decorative lushness, but it rarely stalls or confuses the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific—“vaulted jetty,” “wild orchids,” “phosphorescent algae,” and the dead reef all accrue into a strong sense of place. Environment meaningfully charges the final image: the narrow jetty, the sea, and the battlefield-turned-garden concretize the “narrow vastness” theme. The reef, jetty, and blooming plants shape the story’s tone and meaning even if they don’t sharply constrain tactical choices. Description is occasionally lush to the point of redundancy, but mostly purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    The scrapyard wasteland is richly evoked—“rusted towers,” “metallic dust that sang under his weight,” and the glowing post-war horizon create a coherent, textured world. Setting details are filtered through Rook’s sensory bias (sound, scent, vibration) and echo the themes of ruin and salvage. The environment subtly shapes action (buried tech, collapsed kiosks) but rarely constrains it; almost nothing in the geography resists him. It’s strong, atmospheric work just short of using place as an active pressure on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    The observation deck, river of light, violet-and-ash sky, and time dilation field are vivid, with details like “glass cradle” and “residual quantum echo” giving a strong atmospheric frame. The deck’s temporal properties actively matter, enabling the glimpse and the possibility-map; the compass and charcoal sketches are well-integrated environment-objects. World rules are sketched minimally but stay internally consistent. At times the imagery leans toward decorative density rather than pressure-linked concreteness, which keeps this just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    The icebound spire, wrong-colored sky, and aurora are sensuously rendered and give the story a strong, consistent atmosphere, with nice integration of tools (sundial lid, chess pieces) into the environment. The setting supports tone and theme (liminal time, thawing of frost/knowledge), and the melting spire at the end charges the final image. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics or choices beyond mood and a light sunrise deadline, so it’s more evocative backdrop than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    The whispering gallery, marble hall, pawnless chessboard, and drifting penumbra create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels integral to the story’s mood. Environmental details (echoing walls, inhaling/exhaling arches, acoustics responding to her steps) are well integrated with action and theme. The chessboard in particular anchors the setting and charges the final image. The setting feels specific and purposeful rather than generic, though it pressures choices more symbolically than practically.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mountain-bookstore is vividly specific and omnipresent, with details like “stone ribs,” “wind‑blown pages,” and lung-like breathing tying environment directly to Lira’s inner state. Setting actively shapes events—the hum opens a new corridor, the pedestal chamber focuses the climax, and the mountain’s heartbeat and breath charge the final image. Sensory variety (pine, ink, vellum, thunder) is rich without losing spatial coherence. This is one of the story’s most publication-ready strengths.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.0)
    The time-frozen village, platinum labyrinth, and tapestry create a vivid, coherent atmosphere, with thunder, metal, and woven hush echoing his psychological stasis. Setting details are filtered through his chess-obsessed mind, and the environment evolves meaningfully: frozen world → interior labyrinth → dissolving maze → village reanimating. The environment functions thematically more than tactically; it cocoons his transformation rather than constraining specific moves. Still, the specificity and integration with the final image (labyrinth mist, banner of peace, time resuming) are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    The canyon, bone towers, and pale spire are vividly realized and strongly filtered through the premise of echoes and refracted light. Environment isn’t just backdrop: echoes carry the poetry, bone towers “remember” and physically resonate, and the spire refracts words and light, all of which directly shapes the ritual’s mechanics and the closure image. The consistent use of mist, bone, and echo textures charges the final hymn and glowing spire. A bit more non-visual sensory grounding (temperature, sound of crowds, touch) could push it higher, but as-is it’s publishable-level world texture.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop floating on an acid sea is vividly imagined and sustained, with consistent motifs of corrosion, machinery, and the prow statue. Setting details are filtered through her emotional state—the acid’s bite, the workshop’s pulse, the sunrise—so atmosphere and interiority support each other. The acid sea provides a mild external pressure (it tries to dissolve the foundations) and its calming at the end charges the closure image. A slight excess of decorative imagery keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is a major strength: the quay, lighthouse, cobblestones, cave tunnels, and hidden oasis are rendered with vivid, textured detail that’s clearly filtered through a painter’s sensibility (“tunnels twisted like the brushstrokes of a tempest”). The coastal cave network and oasis are not just postcard scenery; they structure the journey, create the sense of test, and charge the final image of the painted canvas. Recurring objects-as-setting—the cracked mirror, seashells, easel—converge meaningfully in the studio scene. The environment consistently supports tone and theme without confusing geography or scale.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cobalt lighthouse, restless sea, garden scents, and dawn light are sensuously rendered and tightly integrated with the magical mechanics (the beam flickering with the vibration, the cork catching first light). The environment is not just backdrop; it participates in the ritual and charges the final image of the lighthouse as a heart. Sensory detail leans heavily visual and olfactory in a purposeful way that fits the premise. The setting does not strongly constrain physical options, but it consistently mirrors and amplifies the internal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is richly specific and fully integrated: the “starlit signal station,” thin air, failing hydraulics, and antique tech all filter through the navigator’s attention and mood. The censer foot and the station itself function as charged micro-settings, culminating in the final image of the station as sanctuary and the censer storing coordinates. Weather, sky, and machinery meaningfully color the stakes without devolving into static description. This is vivid, economical worldbuilding that shapes tone and closure even if it rarely constrains tactical choices in a concrete way.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    The hanging orchard and storm-lashed ravine are vivid, original, and tightly integrated into mood and action (“my boots echoing against the hollowed trunks,” the storm testing the moss seal). The environment constrains choices—hiding the eye under a moss “truffle,” storms that could betray or protect it—and charges the final image of a “storm-kissed silence” where truth is cultivated. Details feel filtered through Mara’s professional and emotional lens, not like a tourist catalog. This setting is a major asset and materially shapes the story’s texture and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and tonally precise: “opal dock in mist,” “bruised lavender” sea, and the stone tower all fuse environment with emotion. Details are filtered through Marlowe’s perspective, with the alpine Edelweiss cutting against the maritime world in a purposeful way. The dock, tide, lighthouse, and flower recur to charge the final image, where the beam and the lingering imprint of the blossom reweight the whole story. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, it thoroughly anchors and intensifies the psychic and thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is a major strength: the moss‑clad village, blooming cavern, rising creek, and brass chip all feel sensorially specific and tonally unified. Environmental details like the creek’s rising and the cavern’s glow shape mood and symbolically echo choice, even if they only lightly constrain action. The shop’s later scent shift from dust to blossoms reweights earlier cavern imagery effectively. World rules (glimmer changing with water, ants as guides) are consistent within the story’s quiet fabulism.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is rich and specific—“cobalt grotto above clouds,” “ember grotto on the ridge,” iron-and-rain air, crystal basin—and consistently filtered through a numinous, dreamy sensibility. Environment matters just enough: she must climb, the grotto’s pulsing and mist literally present her the map and the orb, and the emptied grotto at the end charges the final image. The balance tilts toward atmospheric excess, but the world rules feel internally stable for this mythic mode. A stronger sense of physical constraint from the terrain would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “ember nexus at twilight,” the pocket sun, the basin of sand, and the nautilus shell all create a vivid, tactile atmosphere with strong visual and olfactory cues. Setting is tightly integrated with the action: the coals flare in response to the experiment, the shell literally houses the light, and the environment colors the mood of the vow. The specificity of tools and materials (moonstone, carnelian, columella curl) feels purposeful rather than touristic. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain choice, it does charge the final images in a memorable way.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.5)
    The mountain ranger cabin, pine-scented air, snow-capped peaks, and radio hiss create a strong, specific atmosphere that matches the introspective, liminal mode. The birch bark scroll, firelight, and grave indentation in the snow recur and visually anchor the otherwise abstract interiority. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain choices, it does charge the final image as he steps into the cold with the grave in sight, framing his renewed resolve. Description is selective and filtered through the narrator’s sensibility rather than generic scenic listing.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    The water clock repair shop, fog, brass, and occluded panes are vivid and consistently filtered through Lena’s perception, giving the piece a strong, unified atmosphere. Setting details do real work: fog and frosted glass enforce “occluded views,” the water clock’s level and chime mirror emotional shifts, and the shop’s dim light and mist embody the theme of indirect perception. The environment also charges the final images (fog lifting, sunrise, water glimmering) without feeling like a postcard tour. Description is dense and occasionally borders on overripe, but it stays legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    The floating rock, silver mist, moonstone tea set, jasmine steam, and crow quill are vividly rendered and woven into nearly every beat, creating a strong atmosphere. Setting details are filtered through Lira’s ritual focus, and the environment participates in closure via the rock’s descent and wind scattering the remnants. While the platform doesn’t strongly constrain her choices—she’s never forced into a different tactic by the environment—it does charge the final image and frame the entire experience. The specificity and consistency of sensory detail are publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sheet music archive and the doomed orchard are vividly rendered and tightly integrated: scores become a “living map of regret,” the orchard’s hush presses on the windows, and the final axe stroke directly charges the last image. The perfume bottle as a recurring object-as-setting is strongly used, infusing the physical space and governing the ritual. Environmental details consistently mirror and shape the emotional stakes without feeling like a mere backdrop. The world’s rules for this magic remain consistent and legible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ancient temple library, with its vaulted aisles, impossible tablets, and crystal heart, is vivid and tonally integrated. Details are consistently filtered through the cosmic, introspective mood, and the environment evolves (stacks → stars → void → restored library). The setting does begin to constrain action via the crystal pedestal and the dissolving floor into constellations, charging the final images. It stops just short of fully inextricable, as the ritual could theoretically be transplanted to another mystical locus with modest changes.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    The fjord, the horizon measurement station, and the hydraulic machinery are vividly rendered with specific, purposeful detail (the “silver glass” water, water-driven gears, razor-edged teeth). Setting is tightly integrated with action: his job, the counting ritual, and the physical tremors from the gears all arise from the environment. The mantle key and station heart at the end charge the final image with a lived-in, tactile sense of place. This is a strong, atmospheric micro-world that feels distinctive and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm and permeable barriers are vividly realized and filtered through the narrator’s professional and sensory priorities. Details like “caps pulsed like soft lanterns,” ventilation hum, and flexing barriers in the storm integrate setting with function rather than sit as backdrop. The environment shapes tactics in the storm and charges the final image of leaving the glowing fields. A bit more constraint from the environment (e.g., real physical limitations) could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rainwashed library, old paper smell, distant thunder, and phosphorescent subway tunnels create a strong, coherent atmosphere that’s filtered through Mara’s mathematically inflected gaze. The candle lantern and mica pane function as a recurring micro-setting object that shapes discovery (revealing symbols) and charges the final image. Environmental details like ratios mapping to library aisles show the world constraining choices rather than serving as static backdrop. The only limit is that weather and season color mood more than they alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.5)
    The subway utility tunnel, brass booth, streetlamps above, and glass harmonica disc are vividly rendered with strong sensory specificity and atmosphere. Setting is not just backdrop: underground isolation vs. city above and the physical loop of the tunnel charge the final image of her stepping out and the “subterranean heartbeat.” World rules around the booth and disc feel consistent and are learned through image rather than exposition. The environment subtly mirrors and shapes the theme of estrangement and connection.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “blooming jetty at twilight,” the sea, flowers, jasmine-scented wind, and starlight are vividly realized and tightly integrated with action, constantly filtering through the archivist’s sensibility. Setting is not just backdrop: tide, sky-color shifts, and floral imagery all modulate the ritual and explicitly bracket when the covenant must be renewed. The final image—jetty under first light, locket pulsing like a heart—is strongly charged by these environmental specifics. This is a rare case where lush description is both purposeful and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ivy-choked disused station is richly evoked and functionally embedded: the overgrowth becomes a literal map, a barrier, and then the revealed heart of the place. Environmental details—the overgrown ticket booth, cracked stone slab, signal lights—are not just atmospheric but enable the retrieval and frame the final charged image of the humming station. The setting’s decay vs. reactivation nicely mirrors the theme of dormant connections reawakened. This is one of the story’s strongest craft elements.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ultrasonic forest is vivid and specific, with non-visual sensory emphasis that fits a blind protagonist, and the environment (hums, notes, bark, constellations) actively shapes how she navigates. The platinum ring and meteor-iron crystal function as micro-setting objects embedded in the world’s logic. World rules are internally consistent and learned through description tied to her movement rather than pure exposition. The setting is lush and purposeful, though occasionally on the brink of over-ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The gravitational anomaly, lab, and “garden of data” are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through the narrator’s professional lens, giving the piece a strong, coherent atmosphere. The dry pen and anomaly function as quasi-setting objects that recur and are meaningfully recharged at the end. While the environment influences cognition and mood (“pulling our thoughts like tides”), it rarely constrains concrete options in a way that sharpens choices. Still, the specificity and integration of world details are strong enough for publication-level atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    The harbor is vividly rendered through light, sound, and even smell (“scent of kelp and nostalgia”), and almost every paragraph routes perception through this place. The environment is not just backdrop: waves, wind, and moonlight actively participate in the music, and the final promise is tied specifically to this harbor as a charged site Lira will return to. Details are selective and thematically aligned with silence, reflection, and forgottenness. The setting guides tone and meaning more than concrete physical choices, but it does so with consistency and specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    The desert canyon, half-buried archive, basalt dome, murals, ash-like dust, and glowing mural at sundown create a vivid, coherent environment that feels essential rather than decorative. Setting elements directly shape the plot (hidden niche behind phoenix, stone that slides, columns with glyphs mirroring his self-portrait, murals that “seal” the archive), and the archive’s physicality reinforces the themes of memory and erosion. The final image of the mural glowing amber under canyon sunset is strongly charged by place. A slight tendency toward lush cataloguing is mostly kept in check by clear ties to action and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sound wave garden and auric lagoon are vividly and consistently rendered, with synesthetic detail (“vibrating blossoms,” “pond of light,” “liquid light through the soil”) integrated into action rather than static description. Setting meaningfully shapes events: Lira literally plays the environment, the lagoon stores and releases entangled memories, and the final image of a glowing, memory-rich garden under pulsing stars is charged by all that’s come before. At times the density of imagery edges toward over-decoration, but clarity and atmosphere remain intact. The world feels particular and thematically aligned rather than generic speculative wallpaper.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.0)
    The port-city container labyrinth and geomagnetic storm are vividly evoked and feel specific rather than generic; details like rusted stacks, humming conduits, and static-tuned radios create a strong atmosphere. The environment is not just window dressing: the storm’s magnetism powers the whisper, lights the map, and justifies the coin’s function. Spatial logic stays coherent as Milo moves from aisles to container A-12 to the hidden tunnel. The final image of the labyrinth “breathing with his rhythm” effectively fuses setting with the story’s conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “cobalt dock after rain,” slick planks, and still canal are vividly and consistently rendered, and the environment is tightly woven with the action of reflection and pattern-making. The water, dock, and moonlight are not just backdrop but the actual medium of the guardian’s work, returning in the final shimmer at dawn. Sensory detail is selectively rich without losing spatial clarity. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain choices, it meaningfully charges the imagery and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.7)
    The cobalt library in mist, the stained glass, and the amber-lit windows are vividly rendered and strongly atmospheric, giving the piece a distinctive visual palette. Setting details are consistently filtered through the story’s concerns with quiet, reflection, and second thoughts, and the library functions as a symbolic and literal hub for the town’s change. The magnetic grotto as object-setting also meaningfully charges the final image. However, the environment rarely constrains choices in a concrete way; it frames emotion more than it shapes action.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.1)
    The opening “sublittoral fringe” and harbor imagery are vivid and specific, and the disappearing island with phosphorescent cliffs and basalt altar creates a strong, atmospheric locus for the story’s magic. Setting is consistently filtered through sea- and tide-inflected language, supporting the liminal, transformative mood. The recurring objects (scrimshaw, crystal, whale) effectively function as micro-setting elements that constrain and enable choices. Occasionally the description veers toward lush ornament rather than pressure, but it remains coherent and tonally apt.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the farmhouse, “remade hush,” and looming turbines form a coherent emotional and political landscape. Details like turbine shadows slicing the light and the brittle bouquet scent are filtered through Mara’s sensibility and mirror the grief/joy tension. The turbines and hush recur and clearly charge the final image, even if they don’t physically constrain tactics. Overall the atmosphere is rich, controlled, and tightly integrated with theme and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and humming quartz colonnade are vividly rendered and recur as active participants in the scene. Environmental details (color shifts, vibrations, the lake’s edge not truly cracking) mirror and modulate the poet’s inner state and the thematic work on boundaries. The setting meaningfully charges the final image—the lake glowing amber under his feet and the atrium holding his verse like “frost on glass.” While the world’s rules remain dreamlike, they are internally consistent and taught through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glassblower’s courtyard, furnace, shards, and plants are vivid and sensorially specific, with atmosphere strongly supporting the lyrical, magical tone. Setting and objects (shards of sunrise, furnace heat, glass walls, glass flowers) consistently mirror and charge the theme of fractured-but-luminous perception. The environment meaningfully shapes the magic’s form and the final image, not just serving as backdrop. A slight tendency toward decorative proliferation keeps it shy of the very top band, but the world feels coherent and lived-in for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is striking and specific—the “laboratory of lost sounds,” copper coils, rusted tuners, and golden shadows create a coherent, sensorial environment. Details are well-integrated into action: the carbide lamp lens, crystal chimes, and resonator are not just décor but the actual mechanism of the experiment. The walls and forgotten microphones “listening” enrich the atmosphere and charge the final image of the lab as a cathedral-like space. Though the environment doesn’t tightly constrain tactical options, it meaningfully shapes what is possible and how the stakes are framed.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory is vivid and specific—brass lenses, ancient maps, balcony, furnace, glass dome—and its tools (telescopes, slots, charts) are integral to her method. Environment repeatedly shapes action: cranes are placed in telescopes; the balcony and single rose create the key liminal space for transformation. Recurring objects (vellum stencil, cranes, coordinates) strongly charge the final image of the workbench and new sunrise coordinates. The piece balances atmosphere and function very well, with only slight overrichness of description at times.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    The loft, rain, skylight, rusted brass tables, and onyx-ink cards create a distinct, sensuous environment that feels lived-in and thematically apt. Objects-as-setting (tape, cards, map, skylight) are integrated into action, not just described, and the final droplet on the tape cleanly charges the ending image. Sensory detail is mostly visual/auditory but filtered through her professional lens, which helps specificity. The setting remains more atmospheric than constraining, which keeps it just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.0)
    The archive and bronze pagoda are vividly rendered—breathing walls, shifting light, old parchment scent—creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting is not merely decorative; the encoded stone patterns and the central pagoda directly shape the protagonist’s tactics and the story’s ritual logic. World rules feel internally consistent and are learned through action (odd footsteps, humming pagoda) rather than exposition dumps. A bit of descriptive repetition keeps it from feeling as lean and sharp as top-tier work, but the environment still meaningfully charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “blooming library above clouds,” stained glass twilight, cloud-swirled balcony, and rain-scented air create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels integral to the story’s contemplative mode. Setting details are filtered through his sensibility as a watcher of dusk and dreams, which keeps them from reading like a neutral tour. The library and stone together charge the final image of him stepping out with “unbound hope” into the sky, though the environment rarely constrains his options in a concrete way. Overall, it’s rich and specific, if more symbolic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    The misty workshop under stars is vividly drawn and threaded throughout—mist curling around the tail fragment, the workshop “breathing,” stars mirroring pulses. Details like broken glass, shells, feathers, and the warm stone feel tactile and thematically apt rather than generic. The environment strongly charges the mood and final image, though it rarely constrains concrete choices beyond providing a ritualistic stage. Overall, the specificity and integration with interiority are strong enough for upper‑band, if not quite transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tower, tunnel, moss, and hourglass are rendered with rich, multi-sensory specificity that coheres into a distinctive atmosphere (“dark artery that had once carried prayers to the earth,” “meteor hush”). Setting is not mere backdrop: the tower’s verticality and the subterranean tunnel structure the journey and the ritual, and the final sunrise through the slit window recharges both time and wound motifs. Objects-as-setting (hourglass, coffee mug, coffee rings) are tightly tied to thematic and plot beats. The environment feels integral to tone and closure, not a transplantable stage.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    The projection booth and old movie palace are richly evoked and consistently threaded through the action (humming booth, sputtering projector, hidden compartment, “audience of shadows”). Details are tactile and cinematic—dust like snow, velvet, rusted tin—and clearly filtered through the story’s dreamy register. The setting also charges the final image, with the ancient projector screening freed love and the shadows applauding. What keeps this just shy of the very top is that the environment frames and amplifies more than it constrains concrete choice.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    The aurora-lit archway, cold stone, and marble marked by silver lines create a vivid, specific locus that’s consistently returned to and recharged. Setting and object-as-setting (archway, auroras, stone) actively shape the ritual and the final image—the archway becoming a permanent vessel for the released verses. Environmental detail is well integrated into action rather than feeling like a catalog, and the atmosphere is cohesive. A slight overabundance of similar-color, similar-register descriptors keeps it just short of top-tier sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    The world is vividly, specifically realized: the endless terminal, glowing dune in bloom, amber sky, and violet/azure sand all work through the guard’s gaze and thematic frame. Setting is not postcard-only; the dune houses the wave lattice, responds to the charm, and physically mediates the sparks that regrow the world. The chess clock and dune together strongly charge the final image and stakes. A slight tilt toward visual over other senses keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mechanical rainforest is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through the philosopher’s altered perception (“pistoned moss,” “copper leaves,” “brass trunks”). Setting is not mere backdrop: the engine, trunks, wind, and branches all participate in the journey and charge the final image of him leaving with the rainforest’s song inside him. At times the density of description edges toward decorative, but overall the environment is the piece’s most distinctive strength.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is richly evoked and cohesive: the pebble pier, veiled ridgeway, misted sea, silent harbor, and rune-marked cave all feel of a piece and carry mood. Details like the lighthouse “flickered like a heartbeat” and the ferry lantern “like a lullaby” integrate environment with theme rather than sitting as backdrop. The recurring sea and ridgeway explicitly charge the final image of Mira stepping onto the path again at sunrise, now altered. At times the descriptiveness verges on uniform softness, but spatial and atmospheric clarity are never lost.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt fortress, snow, and icy interiors are vividly rendered and tonally coherent, with recurring details (spiral staircase, discoloration, bolt) integrated into the central image. The environment meaningfully colors the stakes—cold, ice, and silence as the price of protection—even if they do not sharply constrain tactics. The snow and cobalt walls frame the final understanding of “safety” effectively. Description sometimes verges on luxuriant, but it remains clear and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ancient temple library is vividly evoked—“vaulted aisles,” “scent of old papyrus and inevitable collapse”—and its decay meaningfully intersects with theme and action when the building literally collapses under the exposed lie. Environmental details are selectively chosen to reinforce mood rather than catalogued. The setting also evolves with events (from hushed cathedral to falling ruin) in a way that charges the final image. It could edge higher if the physical layout constrained tactics more explicitly during the search or collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sea level monitoring station, reclaimed pier, steel table, and instruments are vividly evoked and tightly woven into the action (logging reefs, assembling data, tapping on metal). Setting and atmosphere mirror the “drifting moored” theme effectively, with tides and rising sea levels echoing emotional states. The recurrent physical objects (atlas page, console, station lights) charge the final image. The environment shapes mood more than concrete tactical choices, which keeps it just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.5)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay and buried stone circle are vividly evoked and tightly fused to the story’s mood and mechanics (the hum literally travels through the concrete and engines). Details like the “rusted cathedral,” “cracked concrete,” and “broken doors” feel purposeful, not ornamental, and they evolve with events as the bay transforms into a sanctuary. The opera glasses and stone circle work as micro-setting tools that charge the final image and constrain how she can act (listening, tracing glyphs, looking). A slight bias toward visual and sonic imagery over other senses is the only small missed opportunity.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    The volcanic hot springs, moss, basalt, steam, and geysers are vivid and consistently integrated into action—the relic is under the pool, the kite is tangled among geysers, the vapor column and singing plants shape the ritual. Environment is not postcard backdrop; it’s the mechanism and stage of change, and the final image of the hot springs “singing a new song” charges the closure. Sensory focus is mostly visual and textural but suits the mythic tone and never drifts into cataloguing. The setting’s logic (geothermal, mineral amber, vegetal telepathy) remains internally coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    The arboretum-on-a-cliff setting is richly sensory and tightly integrated: salt wind, pines, rosemary, sea lavender, and wind chimes all echo her internal weather. Details are consistently filtered through her trauma and healing practices, so the environment feels lived-in, not touristic. The cliff and former lighthouse function conceptually as guidance/beacon metaphors that charge the final image of her “own beacon of hope.” What’s missing for the very top tier is a stronger way the physical environment constrains or forces a concrete choice rather than primarily mirroring mood.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse library and its descent chamber are vividly realized through salt, dust, fogged glass, and phosphorescent algae, and they mirror and pressure the inner journey. The environment constrains choice—the narrowing stair, the slammed door, the ambient darkness—and becomes an active participant in his transformation. Recurring environmental cues (walls closing, the lighthouse “breathing” and humming) charge the final image and are not mere decoration. Detail is selective and purposeful, though occasionally leans into overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    The desert and wind-carved encampment are vividly rendered, and details like the eclipse light, sand, and stone hum echo and reinforce the cosmic, time-focused theme. Setting is filtered through Kael’s perceptions in a reasonably character-specific way, especially once the camp “thrums” with the same rhythm as the ink patterns. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain his choices—he could perform this ritual in many other liminal spaces—so it works more as atmosphere than as a tactical constraint. Still, the sensory specificity and integration with tone and concept are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.5)
    The “echoing library under snow” and cryogenic details are vivid and consistent, with tactile images like frozen vellum, humming shelves, and snow revealing green shoots that charge the final turn. Setting is integrated with theme (silence, preservation, thawing dissent) rather than feeling like a backdrop, and the environment’s transformation at the end reinforces conceptual change. However, the setting rarely constrains concrete choices or tactics; Maren’s act and the networks’ spread could occur in many speculative environments with minor adjustment. Its strength is atmospheric and symbolic more than decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.0)
    The desert rose farm under a glass dome is vivid and specific, with the amber glass, oasis, and sandbag scrap creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting details (roses curling thorns, dome foundations shored up with sandbags, dawn “amber fire”) are tightly woven into action and theme. However, the environment mostly hosts symbolic acts rather than constraining choices or imposing practical limits. It charges the final image effectively but stops short of exerting real pressure on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “sound wave garden” is vividly and consistently rendered, with sound-as-landscape integrated into nearly every action beat: reeds, ripples, pulses, and constellations all behave as acoustic phenomena. The environment actively guides choice (the garden’s pulses tell him where to step, when to act) and charges the rail spike and final images (reeds singing, tide rising). The world’s rules—sound as structure, silence as presence—remain internally consistent and learned through his engagement rather than exposition. A slight excess of similar-feeling images prevents it from reaching absolute top-tier precision, but the setting is a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    The observatory above the clouds is vividly and economically rendered—the pewter sky, humming telescope pipes, and glass dome all feel specific and atmospherically apt. Details are filtered through Mira’s sensibility as a newsprint heiress, with images like the dome as a “floating thought” and the pipes like rustling pages linking space to theme. The setting doesn’t much constrain tactics, but it substantially charges the central actions and final image. The heavens “turning the pages of a fresh edition” is an effective, setting-rooted closing metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “laboratory of lost sounds” is vividly evoked and conceptually rich—rustling ancient speakers, backward-ticking clocks, meteor hush, and the ash-painted constellations all cohere into an atmosphere that deeply supports the premise. The environment isn’t just decorative; it frames the haunted firmware, makes the miracle plausible, and is itself transformed into a sanctuary at the end. The amber, the desk, and the lab together charge the final image. A touch more use of the environment as active constraint, rather than primarily mood, would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    The whispering grotto, mist, and lilac-tinged atmosphere are vividly rendered and thematically integrated: echoes, condensation, and breathing walls all mirror the “unlearning” and the emergent hush. The setting is not just a backdrop; it holds and magnifies the hush and ends the story as a transformed, lilac-veiled space. Details are sensorial and consistent, with the environment evolving as the hush gathers and then softens the grotto. The only thing keeping this from the very top is that the grotto influences mood more than concrete tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the ancient plaza, soot-gray stones, shattered sky, and mosaic tesserae carry strong sensory and tonal weight. Environment and object-as-setting directly charge the final image, with the plaza becoming a “living diagram of hope” and Hearthsteel resonating underfoot. Details are integrated with action (kneeling, tracing chipped patterns) rather than offered as static postcard description. The world’s rules are impressionistic but consistent enough for this lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    The theater, hedge maze, and orchard are richly evoked through smell, sound, and color—apples as glowing lanterns, branches humming chords, cinnamon-thickened air. The setting isn’t just decorative; it mediates access (only after closing), channels the magic (orchard responding to song), and charges the final image (apples falling like soft applause). Details feel coherently filtered through a lyric, synesthetic sensibility. At times the density of description edges toward luxuriant excess, but spatial and atmospheric orientation remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    The light painting studio, glass, programmable LEDs, and the muscovite geode are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the action, not just backdrop. The environment actively enables her method (mapping light on glass/skin, feedback loops) and the morning-after glow charges the final image. Sensory detail is strong and filtered through her technical/artistic mind, reinforcing tone. The world-building stays consistent, though atmosphere sometimes leans more ornamental than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    The coastal cave network, basin, amber, and glowing fossil are vividly realized, and the environment is integral to the story’s concept of mapping echoes and emotions. Setting details are sensorially rich (light currents, mineral filaments, vapor lanterns) and consistently filtered through her cartographic practice. Crucially, the caves and leaf-as-object charge the final image—the fossil drifting to the cavern’s mouth and the glimmering caves—which would lose most of its power in a different setting. World rules around the “factually mystical” objects stay internally consistent within this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “amber warehouse beneath cliffs,” canyon echo, buttons, and hourglass sand are vivid, coherent images that establish a strong atmosphere and symbolic ecology. The setting is filtered through Mara’s task-focused lens, giving the environment a purposeful, almost ritual quality. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, it does meaningfully charge the final images (cliffs listening, echo crossing a canyon, the amber light swelling). The world’s rules stay internally consistent and feel tactile despite their surrealism.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and coherent: zephyr bluff, mist, snow mantle, valley, altar, and spring all feel sensorially specific and tonally aligned. Environment and objects (snow, stars, pillbox, altar) meaningfully shape action by determining his method of encoding and decoding redemption. Weather and season (between frost and thaw) mirror his liminal emotional state without feeling inconsistent. At times the description leans toward ornamental lyricism, but it generally remains purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    The fog‑bound river, mist, gutters, and wet stone are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Arlen’s contemplative gaze. The setting does more than decorate: the fog obscures then reveals the silver strand, and the river as “living palimpsest” is structurally central to the thematic question. However, environment rarely constrains concrete choices; it shapes perception rather than forcing tactical adaptation. Still, the atmosphere is rich, specific, and integrated with the conceptual frame.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: cracked dunes, salt crust, dead hives, chimney-smoke horizon, and the beekeeping oasis all feel specific and sensorially grounded. Environmental details actively shape the action—she follows sun patterns, interacts with hives, and leaves the lantern as a beacon—so the world is not mere backdrop. The oasis’s resistance to change and fractured timelines conceptually charge the final image of the thrum drifting outward. A slight overabundance of atmospheric description occasionally risks dilution, but overall the setting is a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    The harbor by moonlight, fire escape, brick stacks, and glowing vines are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Mara’s sensibility, creating a cohesive, almost tactile atmosphere. Recurring details (silver ribbons on the tide, oil lanterns, mist, ship bells) evolve slightly with the action and underwrite the theme of tending dark corners. The lockmaster’s tool and the fire escape function as micro-setting elements that influence what she can do and how. A slight excess of similar moon/silver imagery edges toward sameness, but overall specificity and tone are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tidal library above clouds, sea of ink, sky-whale ribs, and humming stone circle are vivid, specific, and consistently threaded, giving the piece a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting details are not mere backdrop: floating shelves, reflective light, and the stone circle’s hum participate in the ritual and in the final charged images. However, the environment shapes symbolism and mood more than it constrains concrete choice or imposes hard limits on tactics. The work is thus very strong on atmosphere and object-charged imagery, just shy of fully using setting as pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, rain, and twig spiral are vividly rendered and sustain a strong, unified atmosphere; details like the “mosaic of whispered confessions” and “constellations made of ink and water” are memorable and specific. The environment meaningfully charges the final image—the pond, temple, and spiral form the closing “harmonious chorus of prismatic quiet.” However, the setting mostly serves as aesthetic and metaphoric amplification rather than as a hard constraint on choice or tactics. It’s excellent scene-painting but stops just short of making the environment feel inescapably determinative.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    The university radio station is vivid in its midnight hum, static, console, and charts, and the valley-wide chorus at the end extends the setting into an atmospheric network. Details like the ionosphere, firehouse radio, and refrigerator hum integrate world and concept without feeling like a tourist catalog. Still, the environment rarely constrains tactics in a concrete way; it frames and flavors the action more than it forces specific choices. The final sky shimmer image is strong but could be more tightly tied to a material constraint or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cavern-cathedral, organ pipes, constellated window, and luminescent fungal garden are vivid, specific, and strongly filtered through the explorer’s experience. Setting is not mere backdrop: alignment to starlight, moving walls, and the resonant garden directly shape action and the final image. The world’s rules around music reshaping space remain consistent and are conveyed through events rather than exposition. A slight excess of atmospheric abstraction in places keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    The quarry in mist, the stone, and the ribbon are vividly rendered and consistently integrated into Mara’s perception, giving the piece a strong atmospheric coherence. Setting is not mere backdrop: the quarry “answers” her work, the fissure physically reveals names, and the final stone tear/ribbon image charges the ending. Sensory detail is selective and thematically aligned (stone, mist, echoes, tactile tracing of names) without feeling like a checklist. A bit of repetition in describing hush and mist keeps it from feeling even more dynamically alive, but it’s still a notable strength.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    The experimental weather station, tin roof, turbine chamber, iron-and-seaweed smell, and gale-swept reef create a tangible, atmospheric environment that feels lived-in and specific. Weather is not just backdrop; the storm and turbines directly affect options and mood, and the copper nail/compass pairing charges the final image. Sensory detail is varied and well-placed without devolving into a mere catalog. The world’s speculative elements (jet stream shifts, resurfacing island) are coherent and enrich tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    The mountain ecosystem—scenic pullout, ridge, pine needles, scaffold-wrap lookout, amber light—feels vivid and integrated with the magical logic. Environmental conditions (reaching the highest ridge, wind reading the map, sunrise through needles) are necessary to activate the amnesty and charge the final image. Details are selective and atmospheric rather than tourist-listy, matching the lyric mode. While the pullout itself isn’t heavily used later, the broader mountain setting consistently shapes tone and action.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    The settings—the dusky warehouse, the rusted circus train, the co‑working space at dawn—are vivid, sensorial, and consistently filtered through Arlen’s temperament. The circus train in particular is more than atmosphere: its compartments, banners, and windows become a physical analogue for loops and boundaries and charge the final return. Environmental details evolve with the narrative (from startup bustle to abandoned wagons to a new workspace) and mirror Arlen’s inner shift without feeling over-explicit. The only limitation is that the startup office stays more impressionistic than tactically used.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    The observatory and night sky are richly and consistently rendered (the dome opening, variable stars as a “tapestry,” scents of daylily and ozone), and they are not mere backdrop: the telescope and starfield are the decoding apparatus. Setting details are filtered through Mara’s vocation in a way that feels lived-in and thematic rather than touristic. The observatory’s responsiveness (walls pulsing, hum from lenses) effectively externalizes her inner state. A touch more constraint—how the environment could have limited or sharpened a choice—would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cursed lake and swirling orchard vortex are vividly rendered and tightly intertwined with action—the chant, the contracting ice, and the final calm mirror all arise from environmental logic. Setting images evolve meaningfully (vortex → radiant garden → honest mirror), reinforcing the story’s transformation. Details feel purposeful rather than touristic, and the orchard/lake pairing charges the final image. This is a strong, nearly publication-ready use of atmosphere and specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cobalt glade, labyrinthine hedges, and silver-lit alcove are vividly rendered and recur at the end, charging the final image of the beacon painting the glade in hopeful cobalt. Setting and atmosphere are tightly woven into action—the hedge shivering, the scent of rain-kissed pine, the portal opening in situ—rather than functioning as backdrop. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices beyond providing a ritual space, but it does meaningfully frame and reweight the climax. Overall, the sensory and tonal specificity of the place is a major strength.

    The catacomb orchard is richly evoked and central: skeletal trees, roots entwined with bones, and half-lit corridors are not just backdrop but the mechanism through which Maelia enacts her repair. The environment responds—roots shiver, bones align, the orchard “inhales”—so setting and action are tightly interwoven and charge the final image. The recurring objects (roots, bones, card, amber) create a coherent atmospheric system that supports both tone and theme. This could press even higher if the physical constraints of the space more explicitly shaped her available choices or risks.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    Echo Valley, the quarry, dust, rock crushers, and the cramped office trailer are vivid and sensorially grounded, with recurring amber light and dust imagery tightly braided to mood. The environment works as more than backdrop: the echoing valley and industrial grit mirror her inner “after the applause” emptiness and gradual settling. The speaker cloth as a micro-setting object is handled in a tactile way and charged in the final image, although it doesn’t literally constrain choices. Overall, setting is specific, atmospheric, and well integrated into the character’s perception.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    The magnetic arbor above the clouds is vivid, sensorially textured (“iron-kissed leaves humming with static”) and functionally integrated as both setting and experimental apparatus. World rules are consistent enough—branches with different frequencies, silver particles from the arbor—and these details directly mediate Lira’s attempts and insights. The environment is not just backdrop; it shapes her methods and the central image of reestablished harmony. A slight excess of descriptive density in places keeps this just short of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tidal atrium, moonlit water, furnace, and bamboo creel create a distinctive, sensorially rich environment, with recurrent details (tides, moon phases, cold light) echoing the theme of fluctuating identity. Setting is filtered through the librarian’s duties and perceptions, avoiding generic fantasy décor. The environment meaningfully charges the final image: the glowing creel in the winter-sun-like atrium as beacon for seekers of wonder. While the setting seldom constrains physical choices, it is structurally and thematically inseparable from the story’s logic and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.0)
    The crystal caves, quartz prisms, pool, and shell form a vivid, coherent environment that shapes the entire piece’s mood and final image. The setting is not just decorative: the cavern’s acoustics, the quartz pedestal, and the ceiling “crowned” in light all charge the closing promise. Details are consistently filtered through the same hushed, reverent sensibility, reinforcing the theme. The one shortfall is that the environment rarely constrains choices; it’s more altar than obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid, specific, and fully integrated: the disused station, ivy, cracked bathroom, tunnel, and river all feel tactile and lived-in, with sensory details (“rust and rain,” ivy as “curtains”) that serve mood and meaning. Environment actively guides choices: graffiti in a particular bathroom leads to a tunnel beneath the tracks, and the hidden river space frames the climactic communion. Recurring objects double as micro-setting—the patched coat and accordion are not just described but used to echo the narrator’s fractured continuity and breath. The final image of leaving through ivy into a “bruised” sky, with the bellows humming, is strongly charged by all this prior environmental work.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    The glowing, mist-wrapped library is vividly rendered and coherently weird, with the dust halos, floating glyphs, and luminous petals all contributing to a unified atmosphere. Setting is not just postcard; the architecture (alcove, vaulted chamber, pedestal, garden) stages the progression deeper into the mystery. The watch, crystal, and mist interact nicely (the map “projected…onto the mist”), charging the environment with function as well as mood. Some description verges on ornamental, but overall specificity and integration are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    The velvet observatory, vines, ice violin, brass desk, and visible sky-promise create a distinctive, sensorially rich environment that feels integral rather than ornamental. Setting details—vines on arches, the balcony where the envoy stands, the visible glow in the sky—actively shape what’s possible and charge the final image of the autonomous skyward garden. The world’s rules (telepathic plants, coffee divination, crystalline instruments) remain consistent and are learned through action. Occasionally density veers toward decorative lushness, but orientation and atmosphere remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    The skyborne grotto, aurora, moonstone slab, and emerald chip form a rich, coherent environment that feels specific and otherworldly. The aurora is not just backdrop but the literal resource she must harvest, and the “threshold of stillness” shapes the premise of capturing a last spark before time resumes. Spatial and atmospheric anchors are clear and consistently filtered through her reverent attention. The final image of the chip glowing at the grotto entrance underlines how setting and object together charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    The vineyard, umbral grotto, clouds, and sensory details (pine, fermented grapes, lichen glow) create a vivid, consistent atmosphere. Setting is strongly filtered through Mara’s caretaking sensibility and supports the tone of hush and renewal. The grotto and hairpin charge the final images, though they rarely constrain choices in a concrete way. Richness and coherence are strong, but the environment doesn’t quite become an active antagonist or necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lighthouse, sea, wind, and dawn light are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Mara’s work and the thematic preoccupation with reflection and guidance. Environmental elements aren’t just postcard scenery: wind chimes function as an oracular tool, the lantern and balcony shape how she tests the shard, and the spiral steps and beam frame her entry and exit. The setting subtly mirrors the interior stakes (certainty vs. flux) without feeling like blunt allegory. While the environment doesn’t physically constrain choices much, it meaningfully charges the imagery and final mood.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vividly realized and thematically aligned: the floating rock platform, concentric pond rings, magnetic grotto, and “sycamore hush” create a cohesive, sensory-rich world. Environmental elements participate in meaning and mild constraint (the ripples as map, magnetic pull directing her path, platform inducing trance and bearing her home). Description is largely purposeful rather than touristic, with recurring images (rings, magnetism, sycamore) echoing the thematic focus on patience and revelation. The only limit is that physical constraints rarely force difficult choices; the setting shapes atmosphere and symbolism more than tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    The canyon, towers of bone, echoes, and wind are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through the skimmer’s attention, creating a strong, immersive atmosphere. Setting is not just decorative: the echoing canyon and bone towers literally shape the magic system (resonance, pressure waves, mapping without motion) and charge the final image of her navigating internally. Environmental details like “centuries of dust” and the vibrating towers integrate with theme and closure instead of feeling like a postcard. A bit more interaction between physical constraint and moment-to-moment choice could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    The icebound spire above the clouds, the distant automated cities, and the keystone garden folly are vividly and consistently rendered, with sensory detail focused on cold, mist, and light. Setting is not mere backdrop: the ledge, mist walking, and height shape how he can reach the keystone, and the factories below sharpen the thematic contrast. The recurring keystone and luminance imagery also charge the final image of “fireflies that refused to be measured by machines.” At times, description edges toward ornamental lushness, but it remains legible and mostly purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is the standout strength: the pier, hull, underwater library, and sky lanterns are rendered with vivid, specific, and tonally coherent detail. The environment isn’t just decorative; the sunken ship and salt-filled gloom make the discovery feel hidden and weighty, and objects like the lantern and teal hue charge the final image. World rules for this lyrical-fantastical space are consistent and learned through Eli’s movement rather than exposition. The only limit is that the setting rarely constrains his choices in a pressurized way; it mostly enables wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ambered observatory deck, dying stars, and violet mist create a distinct, coherent atmosphere that clearly belongs to this story and POV. Setting and object-as-setting (coins, cracked ambered glass) recur and are reweighted at the end, especially the micro-fracture in the glass and the deck “breathing” with him. These details do more than decorate; they mirror his “stellar doubt” and charge the closure image. A slight overreliance on similar color/texture descriptors keeps this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory, cracked dome, scattered light, and rusted lenses are vivid, specific, and constantly in play with the action (light catalyzes crystallization, pillars become “conduits of luminous memory”). Setting and object interact meaningfully with theme, especially as the observatory becomes a sanctuary and the haloed ascent reframes the place. Details feel filtered through Lira’s sensibility—attuned to echoes, dust motes, and inscriptions—rather than a neutral tour. Environment substantially charges the final image and helps define the story’s mood.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    The sapphire viaduct, river, mist, and dawn light are vividly rendered and recur with purposeful variation: mist becomes dripping metronome, arches refract light, and the sunrise ultimately refracts through the restored bell. Setting is tightly integrated with action—the viaduct quite literally enables the method and charges the final image. Sensory specificity is strong without confusing spatial relations. The world rules of this quiet magic remain consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    The reservoir, ridgeway, lanterns, and wind chime create a strong, cohesive atmosphere and recur meaningfully, especially in the final images of the water as an “ancient eye” and the chime’s approval-like tinkle. Details feel selectively chosen and tonally consistent, with the environment mirroring the communal act of remembrance. The setting, however, rarely constrains options or tactics; it is more symbolic than operative. Even so, the sense of place is vivid and integrated into the emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    The orchard, waterfall, singing stones, and frescoed alcove are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Selene’s alchemical perspective. Setting elements are not merely decorative: the dew crystal’s origin, the alcove revelation, and the oldest oak all function as sites or tools of transformation. The environment actively participates in the closure with the orchard “breathing” and the world brightening in an “everlasting sunrise.” The density skirts excess but largely stays purposeful and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “nocturnal arbor above the clouds” is vivid and consistently rendered, giving the piece a strong, cathedral-like atmosphere that aligns with its contemplative tone. Environmental details like swaying branches, mist, and the storm shape how he moves (climbing higher, then descending) even if they don’t sharply constrain tactics. The parachute buckle and canopy together charge the final silhouette image in a satisfying way. At times, description leans more toward lyrical repetition than new, pressure-relevant specifics, but overall the setting feels integral and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    The floating rock dojo above a “sea of shifting chronologies” is vivid and distinctive, with basalt, glass cylinder, and bioluminescent brain all concretely rendered. Setting details are well-integrated into action—the blade swing cracking the dojo’s serenity, the cylinder shattering, the platform drifting higher as history rewrites around them. The environment supports tone and theme more than it constrains tactics, but the glass cylinder and dojo clearly charge the final image of a sanctuary that literally and figuratively ascends. A slight overreliance on conceptual description (history as ink in water) keeps this from the very top tier, but the world feels specific and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and atmospherically coherent: rain, brook, shed, skylight, vents, and moss all contribute to a clear sense of place and tone. Importantly, the environment is not just decorative—the airflow through hidden vents and the skylight’s moonlight directly shape how the seed can bloom. Sensory detail is mostly well chosen (light, scent of earth, sound of brook) and integrated into action rather than pausing it. While the brook and storm are more tonal than tactical, the room’s physical design meaningfully constrains and enables choices.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    The echo chamber tunnel, cracked stone column, hourglass, and abandoned house are vivid and sensorially charged, and the leaf blower as a ritual tool is a strong, concrete anchor. Setting and objects are consistently woven into action (the tunnel amplifying, the frame shivering, the hourglass marking the start), so the environment feels integral rather than decorative. The world rules remain metaphorical but internally consistent: sound as blade/ash, grief as dust, laughter as embers. The main limitation is that physical constraints almost never limit options; the setting amplifies meaning more than it pressures choice.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    The frozen garden and mist are richly evoked and tightly integrated with the story’s concept—petals as stories, mist as veil, light as boundary-breaking. Setting images evolve (frozen roses unfurling like pages, mist-woven verses) and recur to charge the final image of the garden as an opened, uncertain archive. The environment doesn’t quite force tactical choices, but it deeply colors perception and thematics in nearly every line. This is a strong, publication-ready atmospheric execution.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ember nexus, twilight, and crozier form a richly textured, coherent micro-setting that’s constantly in play as resource, constraint, and final image. Sensory detail is selective yet vivid (ash ground into powder, cold flame, colors bleeding into indigo), and the environment visibly responds to his actions (“the ember nexus pulsed in response”), charging the ending. The setting is tightly bound to the mechanics of the magic as well as the thematic stakes of rebirth. It stops just short of the very top band because some imagery edges toward decorative repetition rather than further constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rusted tower city over a gorge, humming cables, and silver perigee light are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Selin’s technical-pragmatic mindset. Environmental details matter to the logic: the tower’s antennae, the gorge hollows’ luminescence, and the vertical relation to the villages below all tie into how the chord travels and how rebirth is visualized. The shard, cables, and gorge form a recurring physical network that charges the final images of cables singing and glow drifting upward. At times the density of imagery edges toward decorative, but clarity holds and the setting feels lived-in and integral.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.5)
    The spectral grotto, mist, starlight, and lattice of sound create a vivid, consistent atmosphere that clearly frames the story’s liminal logic. Setting details like swirling water and phosphorescent threads integrate with the action rather than sitting as backdrop. The grotto meaningfully functions as a threshold space where world-rules bend, charging the ferry’s reappearance and the final memory image. Now and then diction edges toward ornamental repetition, but it doesn’t break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.0)
    The optical illusion gallery is richly and consistently realized—bending walls, fractal arches, mirrored pedestals, a courtyard, and golden rain all feel of a piece. Description is filtered through the architect’s sensibility so it serves atmosphere and concept, not just spectacle. The environment shapes the imagery of connection and perception, though it rarely constrains his choices in a tactile way. Still, the setting meaningfully charges the final movement into the street and lingers as a conceptual frame.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    The benthic city is vividly realized—glass corridors, pressure-hardened basalt, bioluminescent algae, sonar arrays—and these details filter through Mira’s professional and emotional focus. Setting is not mere backdrop: the depth, filtered starlight, and alien lattice concretely shape navigation tactics, while the anchor link functions as a charged object that constrains mass and powers the final image. Environmental logic is internally consistent and thematically aligned with depth/sky tension. This is one of the story’s most publishable strengths.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mist-clad atrium, glass dome, marble benches, and weeping statues create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels confidently rendered and supports the piece’s lyric ambitions. Details like the cracked balustrade and the sealed alcove behind ivy emerge in step with the action rather than as static backdrop. The environment does not strongly constrain choices, functioning more as mood and metaphor than as a tactical landscape. Still, the recurring interplay of mist, stone, and light meaningfully charges the final image of the restored photograph and bowed statues.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    The facility and oceanic environment are vivid, specific, and sensorially rich—“crashing hush,” “jellyfish bellies,” coiled cables like serpents—and the tide and undersea infrastructure meaningfully frame the speculative machinery. Setting is not just backdrop; the rising tide, cable farm, and sealed doors shape what is possible and when. That said, the environment rarely corners Mara into inventive tactics or tight trade-offs; it’s evocative more than actively adversarial. Still, the world feels coherent and distinctive, and it charges the central images effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    The opal observatory, snow, aurora, and ink-soaked console create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that clearly shapes mood and tone. Environmental details (snow-muffled silence, opal walls amplifying the shard’s chime) are integrated into action rather than postcard description. The recurring shard and ink function almost as micro-settings, constraining how she can interact with the ghost and charging the final image of her on the roof with the shard in her coat. The world’s rules (quantum server, ink-based algorithm) feel internally consistent within the lyrical speculative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vividly realized and integral: towers of bone, canyon of endless echoes, and the tunnel are not postcard backdrops but the very medium through which language is preserved and entombed. Environmental rules (echoes responding, tunnel humming, walls sealing the language) consistently shape what’s possible. The bone towers’ shadows “whispering the same song” in the final line charge the closure image with lingering resonance. This is strong, economical worldbuilding where the environment functions as both constraint and final repository of the story’s stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    The herbalist’s underground garden, phosphorescent moss, frost, and stone veins are vividly imagined and consistently threaded, creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. Environmental details aren’t just decorative: the moss hums, sways under the arrowhead’s pull, and the vines actively lift and then seal, so the setting participates in the action and final image. The tool-like objects (arrowhead, phone) are grounded in the space and evolve visually with events. Despite the lushness, most description feels purposeful rather than touristic, and the closing frost-and-dawn contrast lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific: rust-clad towers, sky-bridge, enchanted orchard, and twisted oak statues create a coherent, tactile world. Environmental elements actively matter—the metal-reinforced soil resisting roots, statues policing paths, gears grinding below, and ribbons of light coating spires all participate in the change. The orchard and mechanical city distinctly mirror the thematic tension between life and monotony without feeling like generic backdrop. A slight limitation is that the larger mechanical regime remains abstract; we never quite feel its reach beyond this locale.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.1)
    The cobalt arcade at twilight is vividly realized, with neon, empty aisles, machines, and the drones at the periphery all integrated into action and mood. The arcade’s border function and the “day’s lone mail drop” give the space narrative purpose beyond backdrop. The thunderstorm bottle reflecting neon and raining into cracked tiles neatly fuses setting, object, and theme in the final beats. Description edges lyrical but remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting work is rich and distinctive: rusted rails, soot‑blackened pine, wind bells, brass lilies, mirrors, and the circus train all interlock into a coherent, atmospheric world. Environment and recurring objects (train, carousel, halo fragment, bells) actively charge the final images rather than serving as backdrop. The rules of the magic stay consistent in mood and effect, and the train as physical space meaningfully evolves as Mara acts. Some images verge on decorative excess, but they rarely confuse spatial or situational clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is the story’s strongest asset: the “scientific poetry library” is rendered with rich, specific detail (equations in rhyme, Heisenberg sonnets, poems about black holes) that feels internally coherent. Environmental elements actively participate in the action—the vaulted ceiling, curvature, and shelves are how Mara manipulates space and memory rather than mere backdrop. The library’s ambience and physicality shape the tone and final image of a breathing, quasi-sentient institution. It stops just shy of 9-band because the environment doesn’t meaningfully constrain a difficult choice; it’s more a canvas for wonder than a pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    The lighthouse, reef, whispering archipelago, and sea are sensuously evoked and tightly interwoven with the imagery of light, books, and jasmine. The setting is not mere backdrop: the archipelago’s geography and the sea’s role as carrier/receiver of ciphers actively charge the story’s logic and final images. The micro-setting of the palette, camera, and crumbling stairwell is tactile and bound up with Mara’s vocation. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactics, it does meaningfully shape the emotional and thematic frame of every action.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The “shadowed nexus under starlight,” silver cobblestones, and humming galaxies create a consistent, atmospheric space that suits the lyric mode. The setting is vivid and sustained, especially in the early paragraphs, and the starlight motif recurs into the ending. Yet the environment rarely constrains tactics or presses the locksmith’s choices; it’s more stage and mood board than active pressure. This keeps the piece from the highest band despite strong sensory and tonal coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is vivid, specific, and strongly integrated: hull constellations, salt-soaked soil, brine air, and the apple rows emerging all affect how the magic works and how memory is visualized. Objects-as-setting (fairy ring, broken sextant) are tightly woven into the environment and charge the final image. The space is consistently navigated—hulls to central wreck to greenhouse center—without white-room moments. A touch less descriptive density in places could sharpen, but atmosphere and specificity are at a near-publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    The forgotten library is vividly realized through tactile, specific details—dust like whispers, cracked teacups, pine-scented hidden rooms, the empty playground swing outside—and these aren’t mere decoration. Environment and objects actively shape tactics and closure: the sun’s angle, the altar, the hidden chambers, and especially the interplay of light with the shadow-glass structure key beats. The setting’s evolution (breathing, cracks sealing, walls whispering gratitude) mirrors the thematic arc of resilience and directly charges the final image. A slight bias toward visual and conceptual imagery over non-visual immediacy is the only minor limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and consistent: the “verdant parapet beside a waterfall,” mist, moonlit pool, storm, and crystal rain all interweave with the magic. The environment does more than decorate—it provides the water and mist that activate the seed and later supplies the storm that is transmuted into nourishing rain. Sensory detail leans heavily visual and lyric but maintains a coherent mood that supports the theme of wonder. It stops short of 9-range because, while atmospheric, the setting rarely constrains choices in a way that generates real pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prism sanctuary, starlight, echoing water, and net create a vivid, coherent environment that strongly shapes the story’s mood and method. The setting is not decorative; the prism refracting and muting light, the altar, and the water all mirror and support the theme of modulated silence. The final image of softened starlight and breathing colors directly charges the closure. This is publishable-level atmospheric work, though occasionally it approaches saturation with similar kinds of beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rain-scoured fresco vault, the projector beam, and the henge outside are vividly realized, with weather and architecture strongly inflecting tone and imagery. Setting details are filtered through her cartographic and empathetic sensibility (map tears, stone fissures, rain as temporal medium), and the environment “breathes” with the climax. While the space rarely constrains specific tactical choices, it decisively charges the final image of the chapel’s muted awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sunken ship library is vivid and specific—algae, sand-sealed windows, wax cylinders, corroded brass, and the snow globe all contribute to a strong, immersive atmosphere. The environment mirrors the themes of memory, preservation, and submergence without feeling like a generic undersea wreck. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain Mort’s choices beyond being underwater, it meaningfully charges the imagery and the final ascent and shattering. The integration of the micro-setting (console, wires, globe) with the macro-setting is particularly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    The misty courtyard above the clouds, the arches, and the storm are vividly rendered and consistently threaded through the action. The flower press plate and graffiti function as micro-setting elements that are tactile, specific, and charged in the final image. Weather (lightning, thunder, mist) shapes cadence and ritual but doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices. Overall, atmosphere is rich and integral, though more as lyric backdrop and conceptual charge than as a concrete limiter of action.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound spire, amber-glowing stone, frost-etched windows, and crystal jars create a vivid, unified atmosphere. Environmental details like scattered light and ice do more than decorate: they enable the diary’s unlocking and literally light his descent. The world’s rules are consistent within the piece’s fantasy logic and filtered through his functional familiarity with the tower. At times the description trends lush for the relatively low on-page pressure, but it remains specific and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sky gondola, dust-filled night, and “dust‑laden starlight” are richly specific and recur to charge both her actions and the final image. The gondola’s broken strings, aurora, and distant comet all function as more than backdrop; they mirror and intensify the theme of fractured yet remembering space. The brass telescope as a handled object further grounds the atmosphere. Setting is integrated, vivid, and thematically resonant without losing spatial clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    The hollowed tree trunk library is vivid and specific (“bark‑lined aisles,” “leaf‑filled windows”), and the environmental details (coin in a deep alcove, hidden floorboard safe) are well integrated into Lira’s actions. The setting’s organic materials and light are actively used to shape the mural’s behavior (pigments that “catch light like water droplets”), and the demolition context subtly presses on the space. The tree’s interior being left as a “cathedral of sky” at the end charges the final image and gives the place thematic weight beyond postcard description. A slightly heavier sense of physical constraint (dust, vibrations, danger) during the active demolition prep could have made the environment feel more pressuring, not just atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting work is rich and specific: brass hull, copper pipes, sea of clouds, hopscotch board, and starling murmurations are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the light-magic. The environment actively participates in the story—the copper veins, deck, lanterns, and engine are all used as tools in Lira’s tactic. Tone and atmosphere are coherent and evocative without major confusion. It stops just short of the highest band because the environment doesn’t visibly constrain a hard choice or impose a real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The frozen library above the clouds, crystal singing volumes, and mirrored hall are vivid and sensorially rich, consistently filtered through the locksmith’s task. Setting images (frost, clouds, mirrors, light) echo the themes of memory and repair and are integrated into action rather than feeling like a static backdrop. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics—he rarely has to adapt to it under pressure—but it does charge the final image of him vanishing among clouds with the steady clock. Overall atmosphere is highly effective and coherent, if more evocative than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    The orchard planet, twin suns, floating rock arches, and nebula of respite are vivid, specific, and integrated into action—the arches pulse with light at the bell’s chime, and the nebula’s peak timing shapes the ritual. Details like the brass watering bell coaxing blossoms to open and fireflies forming a “nebula” feel organically magical rather than touristic. The environment supports tone and theme of sanctuary and shared nourishment. While setting does not strongly constrain tactical choices, it clearly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lighthouse and sea are vividly rendered and inseparable from the story’s operation—the cliffs, bruised stone, amber lantern, and hammering waves all inflect the ritual and final image. The environment isn’t decorative: the lighthouse as “vessel for a single breath” and the sea’s rhythm matching the clock directly charge the closure and the sense of time’s pause. Details are consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, keeping tone and atmosphere tightly aligned. This is high-level scene anchoring and mood, with setting actively shaping the mythic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is richly realized and integral: the cliffside labyrinth, cursed orchard, humming mechanical birds, and night frost all shape mood and meaning rather than acting as wallpaper. Environmental constraints matter—labyrinthine passages, patrolling birds, and the encroaching frost frame what must happen and by when. The final image of light spilling through roots and cracks, frost retreating, and travelers emerging from shadow directly depends on these earlier spatial and atmospheric choices. A slightly more tactile sense of physical navigation through the maze under time pressure could push this even higher, but as is, the world feels both specific and thematically charged.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    The braided ravine, foam, reeds, and later bridges are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with character perception and action. The environment directly shapes the method (foam lattice → reed scaffold → polymer bridge) and then charges the final image (annual returns, glowing ravine). Details feel selected through Mara’s scientific-musical bias, not like a tourist catalog. Setting is not just backdrop; it constrains choices and becomes the story’s generative engine, which earns the high score.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glass orchard library and swirling cloud-sea are vividly specific and consistently rendered, with strong image-work like shelves of “translucent bark” and moonlight “fracturing into shards.” The environment is more atmospheric than constraining, but it does charge the final image: an origin-word inked in silver on a cloud-borne floor feels inseparable from this setting. Details are integrated into action (shelves rearranging, branches trembling) rather than static description. It’s rich and coherent, though slightly monotone in staying at a single, ethereal register.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and specific: a desert fortress after rain, slick stone, tidal pools, an icebound coral pavilion under the dunes, all filtered through Lir’s sensory attention. Environmental elements actively shape the magic system—the after-rain pools model memory flow, the cold coral arch is the conduit, and the final sandstorm carries remorse away. Weather and landscape evolve with the action rather than sitting as static backdrop. The world rules remain consistent and legible, and the recurring setting images meaningfully charge the closing transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the astronomical clock tower as “a spiraling citadel of gears and constellations,” the silo network, and “borrowed starlight” all recur and are functionally used (the tower yields the weight and balcony; the silos receive sound and bridges). Environmental details are filtered through the story’s musical/ritual lens, giving the world a coherent tonal logic. The clock, silos, and bridges directly charge the final image of a unified city breathing as one. A slight bias toward visual/auditory imagery over other senses keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    The moonlit canyon is richly evoked—“moonlight spilling…like liquid quartz,” basalt columns, fissures, hums—and consistently filtered through Aria’s technical and visionary gaze. The environment is not just backdrop; the canyon functions as an active memory lattice that responds, hums, shifts, and effectively becomes a character. The mirror-stone interface and alignment of shards to fissures integrate setting into the central action rather than pausing it for description. While the canyon doesn’t sharply constrain tactical choices, it clearly charges the final image and the whole premise would collapse without this specific place.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and specific, from the glittering mist and “leviathan bones” of floating columns to the living lamps in the library atrium. World rules around inverted gravity and clandestine marks are consistent and learned experientially. The grotto and library aren’t mere backdrops—they shape what is possible (only during the inversion, only for the marked) and charge the final image of the seedlings in the atrium. A touch more tactile constraint in moment-to-moment navigation of the grotto would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.0)
    The siskin alder grove, hedgehog, porcelain insulator, and twisted alder torso form a vivid, coherent micro-world with strong sensory and imagistic presence. Details are integrated into action (the reed in the cracks, the insulator humming, the hedgehog reacting) rather than offered as static description. The environment mirrors and then transforms with the emotional arc as the grove becomes a “living archive of cracks turned into chords.” While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain choices, it clearly charges the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “rust-colored dunes,” “magnetic nexus at twilight,” and sky-as-chessboard imagery are vivid and atmospherically consistent, with the basalt stone functioning as a charged micro-setting object. The environment meaningfully inflects the ritual—the currents, eclipse, and stars shape his metaphors and the final alignment of pieces. However, the setting rarely constrains choice or imposes concrete limits; it’s more stage and mood than pressure. A touch more tactical engagement with the physical world would lift this into elite territory.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    The workshop under stars, iron ribs, crystal plates, and rooftop fireworks are vividly rendered and threaded through the piece. Setting is filtered through the protagonist’s sensibility (tools as notes, windows as parchment), giving it a strong atmospheric signature. The workshop and rooftop do charge the final image—open doors, apprentices, diaries—but they rarely constrain concrete choices or tactics beyond providing a stage. The world feels cohesive and textured, yet slightly more like a poetic backdrop than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.5)
    The treetop village, hanging terrariums, hollowed birch trunk, and “mist‑clad river” create a vivid, coherent atmosphere, and the olfactory focus is well integrated into the environment. The setting reinforces the theme of suspended, swaying serenity and frames Lira’s balcony as a liminal space between canopy and sky. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; the flower could almost have bloomed in any tranquil garden without altering the story’s logic. The final image is charged more by the scent and ritual than by any specific spatial or environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the standout strength: the orchard planet, inverted gravity hour, floating arches, and upward rivers are vividly and specifically rendered. Environmental details like roots swaying like kelp and water running upward are integrated into action (navigation, basin for the tip) rather than static description. World rules feel internally consistent within the surreal frame. However, the environment rarely constrains difficult choices; it colors the journey more than it pressures it.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.0)
    The port and container labyrinth are vividly drawn and recurrently engaged: canyons, corridors, and the central tower all shape how wind behaves and how Mara conducts her survey. Environmental details—fog, rusted steel, whispering tunnels—are filtered through her professional eye and support the contemplative, liminal tone. The setting also participates in the climax as containers “shiver” and the vortex spirals around the tower. It stops short of truly constraining her choices but feels integral rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ice cavern and aurora are vividly rendered, with consistent sensory logic (light, color, echo, frost) and a strong atmospheric through-line. Details like the veined frost and auroral bands feel filtered through her synesthetic perception, so setting and POV are well fused. The environment does modestly shape effect (the song paints the walls, fissures open, the cavern holds the archive of sound), though it rarely constrains concrete choice. Still, the final charged image of the cavern holding a pulsing amber heart makes the setting feel meaningfully active rather than postcard-static.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    The canyon, thunder echo range, and “canyon hush” are vividly evoked and consistently filter Mara’s perceptions, giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine. Environmental features actively shape tactics: silence matters, echoes orient, the ridge and fissure define where and how she can act, and the flute as object-tool is physically embedded in the world. The final hum of the range and the stars taking the flute’s “silent song” charge the ending image with place-specific resonance. This is one of the story’s most fully realized dimensions, even if the physical world could constrain her choices a bit more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    The topaz workshop under vanishing stars is vividly and consistently rendered, with the halo fragment, brass cradle, and refracting topaz dust building a strong, unified atmosphere. Setting details are filtered through the conceptual stakes (light as equation, walls whispering), maintaining tone while avoiding pure postcard description. The environment charges the final image—the workshop as a “galaxy of murmured feelings”—though it doesn’t strongly constrain Mara’s choices in a concrete, tactical way. Overall, the specificity and integration with theme are high, but the setting functions more as resonant backdrop than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway is vividly rendered (“natural cathedral,” “tunnel of shifting greens and violets”) and recurs as a charged backdrop that mirrors the pendant’s glow and the theme of wonder. The environment feels consistent and atmospheric, and the aurora’s “pulses” loosely echo the pendant’s vibrations. However, the setting rarely constrains action or forces specific choices; it’s more a beautifully painted stage than an active pressure. Still, the final image of the ridgeway as a place of pilgrimage gives the setting real conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the “quartz arbor in mist,” the frost-laced sedan, and the prism all work as a coherent magical-physical environment rather than postcard backdrop. Environmental details—frost filigree, quartz limbs, mist—are tied directly to action (aligning facets, blooming frost, engine resonance). The final image of Liora stepping onto the plain road from under the arbor reweights the earlier atmosphere, turning a dreamy space into a threshold. While mostly lyrical rather than constraining, the car and frost window do function as a micro-setting that enables a very specific ritual method.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    The orchard and bamboo forest are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through Mara’s loom/metaphor consciousness. Setting details (bamboo paths, stone pedestal, plum blossoms, canopy through which the filament rises) are not postcard extras; they shape her route and charge the final image of the thread leaving the orchard. The recurring amber bead within this environment strongly anchors atmosphere and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    The orchard planet, sapphire fruit, copper groves, floating rock arches, and azure glyph-lit shafts create a vivid, cohesive environment filtered through the blacksmith’s sensibility. Setting elements recur meaningfully: the mines enable access to the silk, and the arches and "planet’s pulse" return at the forge where the final transformation occurs. The world’s rules—magic in stone, singing crystals, silk as conduit—are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition. While the arches and orchard don’t strongly constrain tactical options, they charge the final image and clearly entwine place with the story’s emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay and the green shard are richly rendered and consistently integrated into perception and action, especially the closing image of the shard fracturing into “stars” across the newly woven worlds. Sensory specificity is high and POV-filtered (the “rivers of light,” “glass‑bottle breath”), creating a distinct, atmospheric locus. The environment supports the premise, but it seldom constrains choice or imposes practical limits; it’s more stage and metaphor than active obstacle. Very strong atmosphere, just shy of fully tactical use.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lighthouse, lantern room, wind, and sea are rendered with vivid, selective detail that strongly supports the mood: “sigh of wind against the iron ribs,” “cold stone slab,” and “broken panes” all feel lived-in and textured. The micro-setting—the lantern room with its dead lamp and stone slab—directly enables Marek’s ritual and charges the final image of the glowing spiral. The haunted aspect is more atmospheric than actively threatening, but the environment’s transformation into “sanctuary” at the end reweights earlier details nicely. The setting is tightly integrated, though more direct constraint on his options could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting work is vivid, coherent, and integrated: the emerald lighthouse, basalt steps, sapphire currents, and phosphorescent sea create a strong, specific atmosphere that supports the ritual. Environmental elements actively participate (light turned inward to the ocean’s “hidden heart,” water shimmering with symbols, cliffs ignited in emerald fire). The recurring lighthouse and sea imagery meaningfully charge the final image of renewal, with the lighthouse walls “humming a chorus of renewal.” While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical options, it consistently shapes tone and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific: floating rock tea house, amber mist, crystal flowers, moonlight loom, all filtered through Lira’s sensory and professional bias as a dye master. Recurring objects (tea, wing, donor heart, sun trails, rock) evolve and charge the final image, with environment and objects shaping what she can perceive and access (hidden alcove, garden, loom). World rules (donor heart decoding wind-script, sun trails as paths) are consistent within their surrealism and integrated into action. The lushness verges on ornamental at times, but overall atmosphere and specificity are strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vividly and consistently realized: stormlit tower, cracked windows, narrow stairwell, ancient oak, and the humming grid all feel specific and atmospheric. Details are well integrated into action—the storm softening as sorrow lifts, moonlight enabling the sextant’s healing, the oak as memory-archive. The environment meaningfully charges the final images (dew-glistened windows, oak’s whisper, moon behind clouds yet “lingering glow” in his chest). This is a major strength of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is lush, specific, and tightly integrated: the greenhouse, mica window, metallic trees, and endless night all recur and evolve as the ritual unfolds. Details like “bark glimmering with the scent of copper and jasmine” and “leaves unfurled like tiny mirrors” feel both sensorially vivid and thematically apt. The environment meaningfully charges the final images (endless night softening; the window breathing), even if it rarely constrains choice in a tactical way. At elite level, some pruning of images would heighten impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: rain-kissed town, cobblestones, cramped attic, market façade, and the interdimensional library all feel specific and tonally unified. Environmental elements (midnight, attic hatch, oak desk, bustling market vs. shadow-library) mirror the hidden/visible paradox and guide his choices. The library as a curved, breathing, humming space is especially strong and charges the central encounter. Setting could constrain physical options a bit more directly, but it already meaningfully charges the final image of him returning to cobblestones under a calm city.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is richly particular: cracked marble arches, overgrown courtyard, shattered throne, vines, jasmine, steaming oolong, and the secret tea house all create a coherent, atmospheric world. Details are well-filtered through this character’s reverent noticing and recur meaningfully (vines reclaiming stone, bread crumbs, the arches at entry and exit). While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain his options, it does charge the final image and underwrites the theme of reclamation. The sensory balance and integration into action are strong enough to approach publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    The frozen library above the clouds, the “pillars of ice,” “quartz hush,” and “vault of frost” are vividly rendered and tightly integrated into action (frozen spines as instruments, glacial marble as pedestal). Environmental details consistently filter through the archivist’s professional lens, making the setting feel both fantastical and functionally used. The library and sky actively shape the climax: the hum of books powers the device and the clouds’ “shards of silver” reinforce and echo the vows. It stops just short of 9+ because the environment rarely constrains her options; it enriches and charges the final image more than it forces hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    The pirate market beneath the rotting pier is vividly and economically realized through concrete, sensory detail (salt and ferment, driftwood stalls, iron-tasting rumors). Environment shapes tactics and outcome: lantern-lit secret tunnels, the rotting boards, and the thrown lanterns into the gloom materially affect the action and atmosphere. The antique watch fob and the pier’s waves recur to charge the final image with time, legacy, and precarious safety. A slight tendency to reuse “comforting unease” rather than finding fresh physical correlates keeps this just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, inventive, and consistently filtered through Arin’s perceptions—lavender scent as “soft binary code,” aurora’s colors, mineral memory in the soil. Environment and tools (the bluff, forest, compass) actively shape what’s possible: tasteable wind, forest “votes” changing humidity, and the final image of stars and soil charging the emergent compass. Sensory detail is rich across smell, taste, and sight, with a strong atmospheric throughline of futuristic pastoral. The world’s rules feel self-consistent and are learned via action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vividly rendered (“walls glittered like frozen starlight”) and its physical properties—light, reflections, crystalline surfaces—directly enable the mirror trick and the lock’s transformation. Setting and object details are tightly braided into the climax, with the aurora-like light at the end charging the final image. At times the description edges toward decorative repetition rather than evolving function, but the environment is clearly more than backdrop. Overall, specificity and integration with action are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    The greenhouse city, toxic sky, bioluminescent ferns, crystal shelves, and bottled conversations create a vivid, specific environment that feels organic to the premise. Setting details consistently mirror and support theme (breathing towers, wilting when dishonest, vent exhaling clean air with truth), and the environment directly constrains stakes and options. The final image of brightening greenhouse and unfurling vines charged by truth-speaking successfully ties the world to the closure. A slight tendency toward lush description over tactile interaction is the only minor limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    The bluff, clouds, workshop, wind, copper arm, and iceberg are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the meaning of the piece. Environmental details like gulls falling silent, neighbors’ terraces, and shadows rippling across the cliffside all reinforce the mood and the nonverbal “performance.” The setting also subtly constrains action—the height, wind, and remoteness make sound and motion natural mediums for his art—though this could be pushed slightly further. Overall, the world feels specific, coherent, and thematically charged.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    The glass-domed desert rose farm, magnetic shielding, and heat are vividly rendered and consistently threaded through action (fire suppression, controlled burn, magnetic calibration). The environment meaningfully constrains choices: the dome, roses, and fire system direct what kind of solution Vira can pursue. Recurring images of glass, sand, and roses charge the final images of the vine twining around the box and the travelers’ arrival. A slightly heavier use of non-visual senses under peak pressure could deepen atmosphere further.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific—wet stone, incense, amber walls, the vibrant courtyard at dawn—and atmospheric details reinforce the theme of calm amid intrusion. Environment and objects (shop, mailbox, courtyard bench) are integrated into the action of discovering, listening, and exhibiting. However, the setting rarely constrains choices; it colors mood more than it pressures tactics. Still, the recurring courtyard and weather imagery meaningfully charge the final calm-within-bustle image.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    The sunken laboratory is sensuously and specifically rendered—rusted steel, coral tiles, kelp-leather journal, algae ink, pressure-locked doors—and the ocean’s presence shapes tone and some action (doors sealing, lab rising). The recurring integration of water, pressure, and breathing metal gives the piece a strong atmospheric unity. Still, the environment rarely constrains tactics in a concrete way beyond the door-pressure mechanism. The setting is immersive and thematically aligned, but not yet fully weaponized against the character.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and particular—the decaying whale, receded sea, salt crystal “growing chamber,” and fluctuating gravity create a memorable physical and metaphysical space. Environmental details are filtered through Mara’s rituals and questions, so they feel lived-in rather than decorative. Crucially, the chamber and its gravity pockets charge the final image, where the re-stabilized walls and returning tide embody the new order of memory. The world rules remain consistent enough to support the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    The nocturnal brook, fireflies, and forest are vividly rendered and consistently threaded through the ritual, giving the piece strong atmosphere and sensory depth. The brook and its flow are not mere backdrop—they’re oriented with the wing, mirror the sky, and then still and transform into a “river of stars,” charging the final image. Details are selective and coherent with the summoner’s focus on quiet and resonance. World rules around the ritual and environment feel internally consistent even in their lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rooftop garden and meteor shower are vividly rendered and deeply entwined with mood and concept; details like the rosemary bush, rusted rail, and hummingbird feeder feel chosen rather than generic. The environment supports the notion of buildings as living archives and charges images like the meteors “stitching” into brick’s grammar. While the setting doesn’t strictly constrain choices, it does shape the ritual stakes and the final image of meteor-lit lessons. A bit more direct interplay between environment and concrete decisions could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.0)
    The “velvet garden at twilight” is vividly and consistently evoked—violet velvet, breathing roses, twilight to amber morning—and its sensory palette supports the story’s liminal, introspective mood. The seashell and ledger function as micro-settings/objects repeatedly integrated into action (listening, recording, raising shell to sun). However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; it’s more atmospheric than operative. The final image of the garden “awash in violet and gold” witnessing her transformation effectively charges the closure despite this.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    The marble sanctuary, dripping stalactites, and aurora are vividly rendered and recur in ways that support mood and meaning rather than feeling like a static postcard. The dripping water as metronome and the marble floor as canvas concretely interact with Liora’s actions (calibrating verse frequencies, inscribing onto stone), which ties environment to choice. Light (“pearl twilight,” “silvery haze”) modulates subtly with emotional beats and helps charge the final images. This is rich, purposeful atmosphere, though the piece leans slightly more on visual/lyric texture than on environment as hard constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    The canyon, stone spiral, cavern, and starlit nexus are vividly evoked and tightly fused to the mood. The seashell and the stone altar function as micro-setting anchors that directly shape the climax—placing the shell triggers the lattice and the final hymn. Sensory detail (quartz light, petrichor, luminous threads) is specific and purposeful, consistently filtered through her lyric, listening-oriented perception. The environment doesn’t sharply constrain choices but it richly charges the final images and the story’s overall atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.0)
    The glacier shrine, candlelight, and borrowed starlight are vividly rendered and integrated into the action (e.g., starlight through fissures, candle flames catching it, the ice walls becoming a “choir of quiet light”). The melted snow globe functions as a recurring object that clearly charges the setting and the final image. The environment, however, rarely constrains her choices beyond a general cold, so it’s more atmospheric than tactical. Still, the specificity and consistency of the imagery create a strong, immersive atmosphere that supports theme and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vividly and consistently rendered: “whispering parapet after rain,” moonlit puddles as “moon paths,” fireflies as punctuation, and the damp, listening stone all cohere into a strong atmospheric container. Details are sensorially rich and integrated with action—the slick stones affect how he walks, the mist catches on the whisk, the rain and parapet “listening” parallel his own attention. The parapet, whisk, moon paths, and fireflies recur and charge the final image, so the environment genuinely participates in meaning, not just as postcard description. The risk is mild over-saturation: similar textures and images recur without always adding new pressure, though clarity and atmosphere remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    The wasteland orchard is vividly rendered with specific, integrated details—twisted trees, radioactive dust storms, glowing fruit, rusted stalls—which establish a strong, coherent atmosphere. The environment supports theme (decay vs. sanctuary, corruption vs. stillness) and charges the final image when the storms cease and the leaves catch “untainted” light. Still, the setting is more backdrop than active constraint; radiation and weather color mood but rarely narrow choices or tactics in the moment. The world feels memorable and textured but not yet fully weaponized against the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stormlit observatory, cobalt glass portico, brass telescopes, coils, and mirrors are vivid and sensorially rich; the atmosphere of oil, ozone, and static is consistent and immersive. Setting elements actively participate in the action—the storm powers the coils, the portico gathers and refracts light, the observatory becomes a literal and symbolic lighthouse at the end. Details are strongly filtered through the visionary’s preoccupation with light, shadow, and prophecy. At times description edges toward excess, but it remains legible and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    The “feral loft beneath the dunes,” sand, shells, crates, and the amber dawn are vividly rendered and recur in ways that support mood and theme. The music box and jars act as micro-setting objects that charge the final images, turning the loft into a “chapel of resonance” and tying environment directly to meaning. While the dunes and loft rarely constrain practical choices, they do shape what is possible conceptually (a place where sound can be bottled and carried on the wind). The specificity is strong and purposeful, though occasionally veers toward decorative lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.3)
    The drift-ice marina, undersea vault, lighthouse decks, and humming ice floes are vividly realized and strongly filtered through Elara’s attention to sound and metal. Environmental details often do double duty: ice and sea hum are not just pretty; they participate in the resonance that opens the hidden panel and shape her methods. The recurring interplay of light (sunset, lantern, glow) and sound (hum, sigh, chord) builds a coherent, atmospheric world. While the setting could constrain choices even more directly, it already meaningfully charges the central mechanics and final images.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly rendered and integrated into nearly every beat. Environment is not mere backdrop: the ice’s state, the viaduct’s hum, and the basalt pillars all constrain her ritual and charge the final images (edge where ice meets water; dawn on the shimmered surface). Details are selective yet lush, with recurring motifs (ice song, moonlight veins, rusted lattice) evolving meaningfully across the piece. The setting’s physical and symbolic properties directly support the thematic arc and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tunnel is vividly rendered—steel echoes, damp concrete, old fans, etched symbols—and the lantern functions as both light source and atmospheric anchor. Setting is well integrated into action, from tracing seepage to locating the rusted valve, so the environment genuinely shapes what can happen. The recurrent sensory focus on moisture and sound (“low thrum,” “distant screech”) strengthens mood and thematic ties to memory. Occasional over-insistence on symbolic echoes (“reverberate,” droplets as “tiny stars”) edges toward heaviness but does not break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.5)
    The antique music box repair shop is vividly evoked through fog, ticking gears, cracked cases, and lamplight, all filtered through the chaplain’s sensibility. The recurring heart-object and the music boxes “awaiting their own resurrection” tie setting directly into theme. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, it does charge the mood and the final contrast with the penitentiary corridors. Sensory detail leans visual and atmospheric but feels selective rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is richly imagined and consistent—the gears-and-cogs workshop, acid sea, bell, kaleidoscope, and prism all interlock tonally and visually. Environmental details are filtered through the story’s playfully scientific/magical logic and occasionally affect action (hovering over the acid, droplets painting constellations that become a map). The world’s rules feel stable even in their strangeness, though the environment rarely constrains choices in a way that would push this into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting—the social network archive, vaulted servers, obsolete emojis, rusted racks—is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Lia’s archivist gaze. Environmental details (hidden sublayer, concealed server farm) directly shape her path and the story’s discoveries rather than acting as backdrop. Atmosphere (“hum of forgotten data,” “digital afterlife”) supports the core thematic concern with memory and absence. The final image of the archive “puls[ing] with the living echoes” neatly ties environment into closure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes, van full of vintage mirrors, and glowing shard create a distinctive, atmospheric setting with strong visual cohesion. Details like “each step echoing like a ticking metronome” and ice floes shimmering with newfound color are vivid and tonally aligned with the mythic mood. The environment lightly participates in the logic (the lighthouse breathing, guiding lost sailors), but mostly as backdrop and symbol rather than as a constraint on choices. Strong description and consistency lift this, though the setting could more directly shape action to reach a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered—the cracked piers, frothy ice, brine and pine scents—and remains present throughout, shaping mood and imagery. Environmental detail is well-integrated into action and thought (ice shifting “like a slow, patient breath,” wind whipping spray) rather than dumped. The parasol tip functions as a micro-setting object that meaningfully charges the final image. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, it clearly constrains emotional registers and underwrites the story’s calm, terminal atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    The vineyard, amber pavilion, autumn light, and fermenting grapes provide a vivid, sensorially anchored atmosphere that matches the contemplative tone. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the soil, vines, and trellis are repeatedly tied to the idea of memory and scarred love, charging the final image of the letter-ash as “dark root.” However, the environment rarely constrains concrete choices; it functions more as metaphorical mirror than as active pressure. Still, the specificity of vineyard work and terroir gives the piece a grounded texture that many similar lyric pieces lack.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    The desert, murmuring pavilion, kinetic parapet, and conjured clearing are vividly rendered and integrated into action rather than feeling like background wallpaper. The environment shapes what is possible (shade, water, a place for teaching) and the recurring imagery of dunes and stars lightly charges the ending. Sensory detail leans visual and conceptual but still feels specific and textured. The setting enhances tone and theme more than it constrains hard choices, which keeps it just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lavender field and rusted factory ruins are vividly evoked and thematically aligned, with concrete sensory details (mist, purple blossoms, vines on girders) that create a strong atmosphere. The environment supports the healing motif (ruin plus growth, scent drawing villagers), and recurring objects like the map case and feather help charge the final images. However, the setting remains more symbolic than constraining—rarely forcing or limiting choices—so it stops short of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.0)
    The shadowed library, dawn light through cracked stained glass, and the dangling crystal create a strong, coherent atmosphere that’s visually and sonically rich. Setting is tightly integrated with theme—light as language, hush as memory—and the crystal’s presence charges the final image. However, the environment shapes mood more than constraining choices; Mara’s tactics don’t meaningfully depend on physical constraints of the space. Still, specificity and recurrence are strong enough for high-band work.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fog sculpture garden, junkyard, tapes, monolith, and sea-foam breath are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with mood and meaning. The environment constrains and guides behavior (fog maze, driftwood markers, monolith as focal point) and directly charges the final images (glowing driftwood, fog’s sigh, ghost ship’s horn). Sensory detail is rich and varied, especially in sound, without losing spatial coherence. The setting feels singular and inextricable from the story’s premise and ending.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lunar observatory above the clouds, silver arches, trembling stone, and the brass cradle create a rich, coherent environment that constantly interacts with the action. The setting’s rules—escape-velocity telescope, shaking foundations, leaf sound traveling as vibration—are fantastical but consistent and taught through use, not exposition. Environment constrains and enables choices: he can only attune his tools through the falling leaf’s echo, and the observatory’s quakes test the repaired mechanism. The final image of the observatory as sanctuary and lighthouse elegantly recharges the earlier setting work.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “radiant haven above the clouds” is vivid and consistently evoked through light, clouds, breeze, and the balcony, giving the piece a strong, unified atmosphere. The vinyl shard and its “scent of hope” work as micro-setting elements that recur and charge the final image. While the environment doesn’t materially constrain choices, it does meaningfully color the ritual and reappears at the end with Mara listening to the “choir of clouds.” Overall, the specificity and integration are strong, though still more decorative than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    The nocturnal observatory, floating isle, telescope, and luminous chamber are vividly rendered and consistently threaded through action rather than dumped as lore. The environment feels coherent—clockwork, runes, and sky all mesh—and the isle’s core meaningfully charges the final image of shadows migrating inward. While the setting mostly supports mood and concept rather than constraining tactical options, the specificity and integration are strong for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    The secret garden and hedge maze are vividly rendered and integrated with Mara’s perceptions—the “midnight perfume,” moss, roots, and hedges all echo the themes of hidden experiments and quiet repair. The baby tooth and garden interact as environmental tools that enable the central act, and the closing images of the garden glimmering while she redraws star maps feel charged. That said, the maze and garden rarely constrain tactics; they frame mood more than they alter what she can or cannot do. Still, as a lyric micro-setting, the environment is specific, coherent, and thematically resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    The serpentine grotto, mist, sea glass, and water pool are vividly rendered with strong sensory texture, especially visual and olfactory (“zephyr bloom” scent). Setting is tightly integrated with the ritual—altar stone, spiral on the cavern floor, mist curling around the glass—and supports the contemplative tone. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or imposes real limits; it mainly serves as a resonant backdrop. The final image of mist and glass “reflecting the cosmos” is charged but still more atmospheric than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned data center turned moss garden is richly specific and visually original, with details like “broken aisles,” “cracked glass floor,” and “circuit vines” doing strong atmospheric work. Setting is filtered through Lira’s sensibility and clearly charges the final image: the servers’ metal under her hand and the garden “breathing” make environment and object integral. The icicle drip pattern and moss response integrate world-logic and almost-mystical ambience without confusion. Occasionally the description flirts with over-lushness, but it remains controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.3)
    The “feral nexus in mist,” humming veil, and narrative river create a strong, unified atmosphere that feels particular rather than generic. Setting is consistently filtered through her writerly sensibility (mist as “patient reader,” book “inhaling”), and the seashell fragment functions as a micro-setting/tool that charges the final image. The environment influences mood more than concrete options—she is never physically constrained or endangered by it. Still, the nexus clearly charges the closure and is more than a postcard backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    The forest glade, altar, vine, moonlight, and dawn are vividly evoked with strong sensory specificity, and they feel meaningfully inhabited rather than touristic. Environment and recurring objects (vine, altar, moonlight) directly shape what’s possible and charge the final images, especially the golden halo, glowing pollen, and the rustling canopy “like pages of an ancient book turning.” World rules around the harvest moon and the grove’s sacredness are internally consistent and shown through action, not exposition dumps. The density of description occasionally approaches lushness-for-its-own-sake, but clarity and tonal fit remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    The withered orchard in a subarctic crater is vivid, specific, and consistently threaded through (“frost‑kissed roots,” “dead trees,” “bark creaking like an old song remembered”). The environment mirrors the internal stakes—frozen, dead, yet capable of luminous reanimation—and the crater/orchard bond is central to the covenant. However, the setting almost never constrains or redirects her tactics; it’s more witness and echo than obstacle or resource. That keeps it just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    The marble cavern, phosphorescent moss, rusted arch, and reflective bronze plates are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Corin’s task-focused perception. Environment directly shapes method and meaning: marble and fissures create the echo-rich acoustics and reflective pathways that make the timer’s restoration and echo-harvest possible. The final image of marble walls glowing with starlight and photons “dancing like a memory” over the crystal timer nicely charges the closure. A slight excess of lush description in mid-story keeps it from feeling razor-honed, but the setting is both memorable and functionally integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bronze grotto under starlight is richly, specifically rendered and constantly active in the scene: mineral veins, fissures, dripping water, and bronze dust all participate in the magic. Environmental features directly shape events (lamp orientation to the moon, walls revealing hidden mass, water turning into statues), so the setting is far more than backdrop. The final image of the grotto breathing, with crystal veils and “constellations of tiny whales,” charges closure through place. A touch less ornamental layering could have made the constraints of the space even sharper, but as is, the setting is a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft, copper roofs, and circus-town ambiance are vivid and consistently filtered through Mara’s emotional state, with the kettle, steam, sap, and glass intertwining atmosphere and action. The micro-setting (loft, window, table, stove) is used tactically: steam enables the crystallization, the windowsill and hearth stage the lantern’s evolving role. Weather and light (“rust-hued peace,” rain as metronome) do real thematic work without devolving into a mere postcard. The only shortfall is that the environment influences mood and process more than it constrains concrete choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    The kinetic lagoon, rusted sky-carousel, drifting mist, and brass platform produce a rich, coherent atmosphere that’s consistently filtered through Mara’s perception. Setting details like the lagoon’s pulse syncing with the camera wheel and the water’s soft luminous arcs at the end actively charge the final image rather than sitting as backdrop. World rules stay impressionistic but internally consistent, appropriate for a lyric magic-realist piece. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactical options, but it strongly shapes tone and the meaning of the pact.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    The abandoned spaceport is rendered with consistent, purposeful detail—corridors as “vectors,” conduits as arteries, boarding gates lit again—closely tied to her engineering lens. Environment shapes tactics: she uses control panels, conduits, and life-support bays as tools, not just backdrop. The sextant and terminal together charge the final image of revived lights and beacon. Some passages lean into abstract metaphor over concrete sensory detail, which slightly mutes atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.0)
    The soundless sanctuary, crystal forecourt after rain, and sunrise are vividly rendered with strong sensory specificity (petrichor, muffled robin, stained glass) that’s clearly filtered through his sensibility. The environment meaningfully charges the action—the crystal is both workspace and quasi-presence, and the sanctuary’s silence makes the single final chime impactful. However, the setting mostly supports mood rather than constraining concrete choices; he rarely has to navigate real limits imposed by the space. As atmosphere and symbolic environment it’s very strong, just short of fully embedding itself as a tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    The twilight barge canal, rusted lock, radio, and city spires are vividly rendered and recurrent, creating a strong, integrated atmosphere. Environment and object-as-setting (the sundial, the lock) do shape choice: he must work with this specific old mechanism in this liminal waterway. The setting evolves meaningfully—twilight to dawn, static lock to opened flow, mist lifting to reveal spires—mirroring the thematic shift. A bit more non-visual sensory texture and concrete constraint could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dock, snow, fog, rope, and harbor are rendered with vivid, specific sensory detail and recur in ways that charge the final images (“golden dock under snow,” fog veiling, rope like a sleeping serpent). Setting is strongly integrated with mood and theme—the oceanic hush and weather mirror his patience and the fragile nature of knowledge. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactical choices, the fulgurite, rope, and fog as recurring objects/conditions do meaningfully charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.0)
    The shadowed autumn garden, crumbling arch, mossed mosaics, statues, and the tactile leaf carpet are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through the traveler’s sensibility. Setting and recurring objects (thread, rose, statues) charge the atmosphere and final image, though they constrain mood more than concrete choice. The environment feels specific and integral, but less as a physical obstacle than a symbolic and emotional field.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    The suspended palace, stalactites, and mechanical world are vividly rendered and recur throughout, giving the piece a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting details are specific (stalactite roots, silver tears of water, humming gears) and thematically aligned with the nature/industry tension. The environment occasionally shapes action (salvaging from stalactite roots; placing the cradle under the greatest stalactite), and the final image of the palace as a "suspended garden of gears and feathers" is charged. Still, the setting rarely constrains choices under pressure; it’s more evocative backdrop than active obstacle or resource.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    The obsidian lagoon, black sand, dunes, and migrating clouds are vivid, sensorially rich, and tightly woven with Mira’s inner life. Environmental details do conceptual work: the fire-memory in the sand, the pier-sand junction, and the lagoon-as-sanctuary all reweight the final dawn image (“black sand to molten amber,” red thread as “sunrise promise”). The setting doesn’t physically constrain options so much as thematically charge every choice, which fits the lyric mode. At this level, it’s strong enough for publication but a notch below the rarest work where environment also enforces concrete tactical limits.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific—cracked cobblestones, mossed alleys, violet dusk, empty basins—and closely integrated with action through the etched symbols on fountains and the city’s exhalation at the end. Environmental details consistently mirror and deepen mood without devolving into a tourist catalogue. The city and its fountains materially shape the ritual path and the final transformation image. A slight tendency toward lush description for its own sake keeps it shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    The nebula garden is vivid and continuous, with details like “star‑woven vines,” “crystalline walls,” and petals that behave almost like a weather system, creating a distinct, immersive atmosphere. Setting is not just decorative: it shapes the mechanics (sonar mapping corridors, soil seeding the gear, pulsar alignment) and charges the final image as the soil glows and a filament of light rises. World rules are consistently implied through action rather than exposition, and the environment clearly mirrors and deepens the internal stakes of non-destructive illumination. This is near–publish-ready level atmospheric work.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    The greenhouse is vividly evoked and functionally central: it houses Mara, attracts the butterflies, frames the rituals, and becomes the town’s sanctuary. Details like frosted panes, humid dusk, and jasmine/stone scent feel selective and purposeful, echoing the grief/beauty paradox. The environment directly shapes tactics (watching light, tracing migrations, hanging ribbons, gathering villagers) and charges the final image of the singing gravestone. This is close to publication-ready atmospheric work.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    The tidal obsidian ridge, black tide, and bronze clock tower are vividly and consistently evoked, with strong sensory specificity and a coherent atmospheric palette. Setting is filtered through Mara’s purpose, with the sea and tower mirroring her pursuit of balance and literally syncing rhythms at the end. The pendulum, ridge, and tide all participate in the final charged image, reweighting the world’s equilibrium. At times the description verges on luxuriant excess, but it generally supports tone and theme rather than stalling them.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cemetery, the cobalt silo, the sovereign case, and the velveteen gloom are vividly rendered and recurrent, with the silo and case charging the final images (“reflecting his silhouette,” “humming softly against his chest”). Details are sensorial and consistent with the mood, and the setting is integrated into action rather than dumped. However, the environment rarely constrains his choices or tactics; it mostly supports atmosphere and theme. As a result, it’s strong and memorable but not quite structurally determinative.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    The obsidian spire, frozen lake, aurora, and copper plates are vivid and specific, and the environment directly shapes tactics (aurora collectors, barley on the frozen “runway”). Setting details are well integrated into the action rather than read like a static backdrop. The final image of the spire and reflective lake effectively charges the sense of transformation. It could nudge higher if physical constraints (cold, danger of the ledge, failure of the plates) pressed more tangibly on moment-to-moment choices.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ember alcove, mist, dust, and radio glow are vividly rendered and sustain a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting details (dust as story-bearer, mist carrying sound, rooftops catching fragments) are thematically integrated rather than decorative. The environment functions mostly as mood and metaphor rather than as a hard constraint on choice, but it does charge the final sanctuary image of the alcove and its watchful glow. Overall, very strong atmosphere with only mild overrichness.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.0)
    The vanishing point gallery, self-rocking chair, and shimmering powder create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that strongly colors every action. Spatial and visual motifs (walls converging, vanishing point light, lattice on the cracked floor) are specific and recur to charge the final images. The environment feels responsive to her ritual, which meaningfully ties setting to outcome. Occasionally the description verges on decorative, but overall the world is distinct and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and distinctive: bioluminescent algae, dripping arches, marble ruins, and waterlogged streets create a strong, coherent atmosphere. Environmental details are tightly integrated with theme—the sediment layers, seafarer’s cog, and water rising to the city above all mirror layers of narrative and the upward movement of ideas. The sewer as sanctuary versus the rising city provides a meaningful spatial metaphor that charges the final image of sunrise and seepage. This world feels lived-in and rule-consistent without exposition bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    The velvet library in autumn is richly realized through tactile detail (velvet shelves, dust, old paper, rain, rattling shutters) and consistently intertwined with action and sound. The space shapes acoustics, communal intimacy, and the mood of sacred quiet, and the zither on the podium plus the rosette as focal object charge the final image. Sensory choices feel filtered through the teacher’s artistic sensibility rather than like a generic catalogue. A slight risk of over-saturation remains, but the setting is vivid and integral.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rusted greenhouse, salt-scarred glass, and comet-lit “ruby veins” form a richly textured, coherent environment that is inseparable from the story’s mood. Setting is not postcard décor: it participates in the action (vines responding, pruning, glowing neural foliage) and charges the final image of the greenhouse as a beacon. The physical constraints and decay of the place also mirror the thematic work of renewal-from-ruin without overt lecturing. This integration of environment, image, and closure is strong enough for near-publishable quality on this axis.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lightning tower, drone hives, lacquer box, and “honeyed” light form a cohesive, vividly textured environment that clearly belongs to this story. Setting details are specific and purposeful (glass rods, mechanical colonies, city gathering at the base), and the tower’s function directly shapes events. Recurring amber/honey/nectar imagery charges the final image and ties environment to theme. The world-building feels rich without derailing the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is richly evoked—the quiet spring bay, dreaming streetlights, perfumer’s shop, and cottages all come through with strong sensory specificity and consistent mood. Details are filtered through the narrator’s attention to subtle shifts, which suits both character and theme. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but recurring objects (houses, streetlights, bay) do charge the final images once the hush spreads. Occasionally the descriptive density borders on ornamental, yet overall the atmosphere is cohesive and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    The underwater garden is vividly rendered with consistent, specific imagery (phosphorescent currents, kelp arches, cracked basalt arch, bioluminescent organisms). Setting details are not just decorative: the currents, kelp, seagrass, and structural weakness all participate in the action and thematic work. The sensory palette leans heavily visual and metaphorical, with less textural or bodily grounding, and occasionally tips toward cataloguing. Still, the world rules feel coherent and the environment meaningfully shapes what can happen.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    The infinite staircase and the eighth landing contraption are vivid and thematically charged, especially with details like equations sketched on stone risers and the bronze frame over polished glass. The setting is not merely decorative: the staircase’s endlessness and subtle shifting directly embody and test the premise of perpetual motion and “boundless confinement.” Environmental evolution (“the whole structure quivered,” “quiet rupture”) is tied to Aric’s actions and charges the final image of him on the twentieth landing. Some sensory range beyond sight and motion could deepen embodiment, but what’s here is purposeful and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rooftop greenhouse and smog-choked city are vividly rendered, with “saffron quiet” and moonlit glass panes creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting is not postcard-only: the elevation, glass, and moonlight actively enable the paintings’ glow and the “conduit” function of the space. The calligrapher’s brush and rain collector work as charged objects, especially in the final cleaning/polishing image. The environment doesn’t quite corner a hard choice, but it clearly charges the premise and ending.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    The grotto city behind the waterfall is vividly and consistently evoked—mist, rosewater, wilted lilies, hidden murals, amphitheater—anchoring tone and theme with strong sensory specificity. Setting is not mere backdrop: the waterfall echoes in the calligrapher’s strokes, the stone’s “thaw” parallels cultural revival, and the emerald prism refracted through mist charges the final image. World rules (lens revealing memory, murals waking, beekeeper’s ghost near the falls) feel internally coherent for a mythic-lyric mode. The environment meaningfully shapes what’s possible but still skews more atmospheric than tactically constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.5)
    The rocky island, low tide, and lighthouse interior are vividly evoked, with sea breath, jagged cliffs, and grinding gears building a strong, consistent atmosphere. Objects like the hunger stone and yoyo function as micro-setting anchors folded into action. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or tactics beyond initial access at low tide; it’s more backdrop than active pressure. The specificity and mood are publication-quality, but not yet fully weaponized against the character.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    The abandoned carnival funhouse and hall of mirrors are vividly realized and tightly integrated with the story’s logic—the mirrors, carousel horse, and broken architecture all actively mediate how fear manifests and can be confronted. Environmental details (photon haze, copper/rot air, viscous luminance) do more than decorate; they condition movement, perception, and the ritual itself. The shattered carousel horse as a kind of “carnival heart” gives the setting structural importance. The final image of luminance and floor-pulsing roses feels inseparable from this specific place.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vividly original and central: the driftwood circle, floating orchard, and blue hour sky are not mere backdrops but the physical medium of his music (branches, roots, sea, and clouds all become instruments). Environmental specifics—like waves answering in “syncopated applause”—are tightly integrated with the story’s core mechanic. The xylophone mallet and floating grove charge the final image, though the world’s rules are more poetic than materially constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, original, and tightly interwoven with action: the turtles’ shells are both city and language, and their ridges, mosaics, and timed passage at the sun’s zenith all constrain and enable choices. Environmental images (sunwashed harbor, distant cliffs, shell corridors) are strongly filtered through Mira’s cartographic and pattern-obsessed gaze. The world’s rules feel internally consistent and are learned through her work rather than dumped. The recurring image of the turtles’ slow migration humming with patterns meaningfully charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    The abandoned railway station, ivy, rosebush, mailbox, and silver light are vividly rendered and recur in purposeful ways. The environment is strongly tied to theme: ivy as imprisoning lies, the station as failed hope, and the light of the letter driving ivy back. The setting charges the final image as the ivy retreats and sunlight freezes the ink, even if it doesn’t materially constrain tactics. A slight sense of over-layered symbolism keeps it out of the very top band, but it’s a clear strength.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    The submerged pavilion and river are vividly realized with strong sensory detail (amber light, moss on boots, algae scent, mist as “a hushed blaze of damp copper”). Environment and object-as-setting (the inkwell) do more than decorate: the river’s level, the slick stones, and the pavilion’s erosion shape how she moves and where she hides notes. The setting also charges the final images—the amber glow on broken stones, the moonlit reflection on the brass inkwell. At times the density of description brushes purple, but spatial and sensory coherence are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underwater library is vividly and consistently evoked—marble shelves, seepage altering ink, lantern light, tidal currents, floating buoys—and these environmental details shape tactics (lantern use, blackout, tidal-powered lights, submerged corridors). The antique stamp and scanner act as tools embedded in the setting, not mere props. Water, darkness, and architecture all meaningfully contour what Mara can do and charge the final image of illuminated ruins. A slight risk of over-ornamentation, but the world rules and atmosphere hold together convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    The floating island tea garden and glass basilica are vividly, sensually rendered, with strong integration of sight, scent, and texture (dew-slick stone, roasted jasmine, sandalwood). World rules—detaching shadow, dream-recording glass, twilight veil—stay internally consistent and are learned through action. The environment thematically mirrors his state (ascending/descending, comfort/accusation) and charges the final image, though it rarely constrains his tactical choices in a concrete way. A touch less descriptive layering might sharpen, rather than blur, a few moments of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    The floating observatory is vividly realized—the bruised sky, humming instruments, magnetic cradle, rotors—and the fissure in the foundation plus leaking potential directly motivate the climactic action. The geode, visor, and building interact in a tactile, rule-respecting way that feels coherent with the world’s physics. That said, the environment primarily supports mood and metaphysics rather than materially constraining his choices; he could likely make the same decision in many other high-tech perches. It’s strong, atmospheric setting, but stops short of fully indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    The observatory is vividly realized—the stone arches, marble star trails, prisms, and the “brilliant dimness” create a strong, consistent atmosphere. Setting is integrated with action: the etched trails guide the drone, the pedestal and mechanisms shape what is possible, and the dome becomes a “living archive” in the final image. Some description veers towards redundancy, but it rarely stalls momentum. The environment clearly charges the ending even if it doesn’t sharply constrain choice.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    Setting and atmosphere are the story’s strongest assets: the cobalt terrace, night-black water, and driftwood shore are vivid, sensorial, and thematically keyed to memory and guilt. The environment does more than decorate—it structures the piece’s two main shards (terrace vs. shore) and the carvings physically host the revelation. The watch hand and carvings function as micro-setting tools that charge the final images. Occasionally the descriptive density risks feeling ornamental, but clarity is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.0)
    The storm‑worn parapet, sea mist, and slick stones are vividly rendered and recur in evolving ways (from hostile to “scarred yet steadfast” as the mist thins). Weather and environment mirror the emotional trajectory, and the antique drawer pull functions as a charged micro‑setting object by the end. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain tactics, it strongly anchors atmosphere and closure imagery. The final image of cleared mist and bare stones cleanly reweights earlier description.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coastal launch, sea, sunrise, and utility poles are vividly realized and thematically integrated with navigation, regret, and horizon-seeking. The compass and poles function as micro-setting elements that echo his inner attempts to orient himself, and the recurring sea imagery reinforces the emotional stakes. However, the environment rarely constrains action in a concrete way; it mirrors mood more than it shapes choices. Strong atmosphere and specificity, but more textural than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    The underground bioluminescent lake is vividly imagined and consistently present, with strong visual motifs (glowing algae, newspaper headlines on water, luminous kelp). Setting is not just backdrop: it delivers clues, houses the crate, reflects past silhouettes, and brightens at the baseball’s sacrifice, charging the final image. Sensory detail leans visual, but the integration of coded messages and phosphorescent responses ties space to theme and action. A bit of description verges on decorative, yet overall the environment feels specific and meaningfully engaged.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    The moonlit orchard, silvered mist, and spice-filled alcoves are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through the story’s fairy-tale lens. The setting does more than decorate: it supplies the necessary ingredients, anchors the permanent moon motif, and becomes the charged final space she will guard. The environmental details (moonlight, phoenix echo, glowing fruits) echo her liminal role between life and rebirth. At times the description verges on saturation, but it maintains clarity and a coherent atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “midnight glade above clouds” is vividly and consistently rendered, with clouds, mist, oaks, porcelain, and crystal all working together to create a tactile, specific otherworld. Setting details actively charge the action—the crack reflecting “the world below,” the vapor forming a staircase, the blossom and dew embodying lost time. The environment participates in the magic but rarely constrains choice in a way that tightens options; its role is more lyrical than tactical. Even so, the final images (crystal blossom, dew, rain of stars) feel organically rooted in the world established at the start.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    The recycled hull, dying galaxy, and final luminous garden are sharply imaged and tonally coherent with the piece’s elegiac mood. Setting details (patched panels humming, “museum of memories,” unnamed colors in the garden) feel purposeful rather than touristic and are filtered through the story’s melancholy spirituality. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices, but objects-as-setting (ship, crystal, garden) clearly charge the final image. World rules are consistent within the poetic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    The black sand beach, active volcano, and “slow dance of celestial bodies” are vividly rendered and strongly tonal, with the volcanic rumble and glowing sand echoing the idea of constant transformation. Setting is well integrated into action (sand absorbing sparks, fisherman drawn to the glow), but it rarely constrains choice or forces different tactics; it’s a charged backdrop more than an active agent. The recurring images—the jar, sparks, glowing sand, volcano—do meaningfully charge the final understanding of transformation. Strong atmosphere, slightly short of using environment as true pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    The luminous fort, glass roses, phosphorescent walls, and half-painted sundial create a striking, coherent atmosphere that’s strongly filtered through the story’s love of light/dark imagery. Setting is not just backdrop: the sundial and marble shards materially shape Kael’s tactics, and the cradle beneath the vaulted dome is a vivid closure-space. At times, description edges toward decorative excess, but clarity holds and the environment stays legible. The setting doesn’t quite *pressure* choices so much as elegantly support them, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integral: black basalt bluff, paused tide, aurora, and star dust are not mere backdrop but the medium of Selene’s work. Environmental details directly shape what she can do—the pools hold the dust, the bluff ledge receives the stones, the tide pausing “listens” and then carries the violet flame downstream. The final image of glowing stones on the bluff as a “living map” heavily relies on setting to carry thematic weight. Description is rich but generally purposeful, with the landscape and cosmic phenomena charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stormlit observatory above the clouds is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail (copper dome, ozone scent, lightning “silver veins”). Setting consistently mirrors the internal project of mapping scars and literally channels the ritual into the storm. However, the environment mostly amplifies mood rather than constraining tactics or forcing difficult choices. It’s atmospheric, memorable, and thematically apt, but not yet fully weaponized as pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.5)
    The glass atrium, quiet brook, sundial, and needle card form a coherent, specific environment that recurs and meaningfully charges the final image (needle card on sundial; brook as witness). Setting details are integrated into action (waiting for the brook to settle, reflections in glass) rather than offered as static backdrop. The rules of this slightly uncanny world feel consistent and are learned through observation. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain options, it strongly supports mood and thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “rusted library under stars,” broken panes, moonlight, and the later “mosaic of green light” are vivid, selective, and strongly filtered through the piece’s lyric sensibility. Setting is not mere backdrop: prison, rust, shelves, and cracks in the stone all directly host the resistance (sorting books, planting seeds), and the final glowing library is charged as a transformed environment. The recurring moon and stars support a consistent nocturnal, clandestine tone. This is a major strength, though the physical constraints of the prison rarely push back against what the characters attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is richly imagined and specific: the deserted station, tidal arbor above the clouds, cloud staircases, monochrome film tunnels, and cloud auditorium all feel vivid and coherent in tone. Recurring objects (piano, clock, compasses, reel) operate as micro-settings that charge the final image. World rules, while surreal, are consistent enough to feel intentional rather than arbitrary. Description is dense but generally integrated into action and mood rather than static postcarding.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    The island, ridge, lanterns, and approaching monsoon are vividly rendered with strong sensory detail filtered through Mara’s perspective, and they sustain a coherent, mythic yet precise tone. The ridge in bloom and the sky’s “tentative blue” do more than decorate; they embody the stakes (memory rooted in place, time before monsoon) and charge the final image of blossoms carrying chants inland. World rules about dreams, memory, and knowledge fruit stay internally consistent and are revealed organically. This is close to elite-level setting work, only held back slightly by occasional density of imagery that edges toward ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    The islet, bonsai grove, rain-washed landscape, and sea are richly rendered and consistently tied to mood and theme, with recurring motifs like lace-like clouds and cerulean sky. Setting details are not mere postcards; the compass on the stone, moss, shells, and bonsai all feed into the ritual atmosphere and the final emotional charge. Weather and environment don’t strongly constrain tactics, but they do charge the final image of a sea that “no longer held sorrow.” The specificity and cohesion of the world are publication-ready, if slightly lush.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.2)
    Setting details are functional but lean on clichés ("wounded beast," "golden ribbons") rather than specific, sensory observation. The environment serves as a passive backdrop for the experiment rather than a source of friction or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.1)
    Imagery like "glassy hush" and "black snow" establishes a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that anchors the piece. However, the environmental constraints are weak; the frost patterns function as a convenient GPS rather than a source of physical friction or danger.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "winterglass" setting is evoked with vivid, atmospheric sensory details ("breath of frost") that ground the scene well. However, the environment remains a static backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure on the character's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.0)
    While the bioluminescent imagery is vivid, the environment lacks physical consistency (walking vs. swimming, sound physics underwater). The setting serves as a passive backdrop for the ritual rather than a pressure cooker that constrains the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the "terra-cotta arbor" provides a visual anchor, the setting largely consists of generic markers ("ridge," "chapel") that serve as a passive backdrop. The environment does not constrain tactics or force trade-offs, failing to integrate with the conflict beyond atmospheric dressing.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting is atmospherically consistent but relies heavily on abstract, cloying descriptions ("secret of bloom," "forgotten rain") rather than concrete, grounding details. The environment yields instantly to the protagonist rather than constraining him.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is described with high density but remains abstract and difficult to visualize spatially due to the reliance on metaphor ("hyperbolic geometry," "Möbius strip") over concrete sensory grounding. While the "living bridge" is central, the environment operates more as a thematic backdrop than a physical space that constrains movement or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the carnival imagery is present ("rusted cathedral," "broken mirrors"), the setting serves as a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker. The specifics (piano bench lock, fungi) feel like inventory items rather than a lived-in environment that constrains the protagonist's tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is vivid and imaginative, utilizing the prompt's elements well, though the physics are dream-like ("fire feeding on the void" underwater) rather than grounded. While the imagery is lush, the environment acts more as a backdrop than a source of constraints or resources that force specific tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is rendered through heavy, decorative ornamentation ("emerald," "polished jade," "crystal") that creates a static, postcard effect rather than a tactile environment. The lighting contradicts itself (simultaneous sunset and moonlight), confusing the spatial grounding. The descriptions stifle momentum rather than creating a container for action.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting contains vivid imagery ("liquid glass," "thawing veins"), but suffers from logical disconnects, such as operating a glass furnace in a sealed control room without ventilation or fuel details. The opening line's "humming consoles lay silent" creates an immediate sensory contradiction that undermines grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.6)
    While the "rusted library" offers some atmospheric imagery, the spatial logic of the scene is incoherent (e.g., the physics of the shell, thread, and cast). Specific details, like the "mechanism behind the third shelf," feel like video-game quest markers inserted without integration into the setting's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting relies on personification ("stones groaning," "phantom serpent") and abstract metaphors rather than grounded sensory detail. While the location is clear, the "pebble-shore" descriptor conflicts with the "ridge fort" setting without spatial explanation, leaving the environment feeling constructed from unrelated parts.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.6)
    Sensory details are competent ("pale shards," "slick stone") but largely decorative, failing to constrain the protagonist’s choices or tactics. The cold is mentioned but explicitly ignored by the protagonist ("remarkably composed"), rendering the setting a passive backdrop rather than an active pressure on the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.0)
    The "crystal whispering forecourt" is described with vivid, if repetitive, sensory details ("shimmering," "glimmering"). However, the setting remains a static, atmospheric backdrop that does not causally constrain the character's choices or generate friction.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is atmospherically dense but functions as ornamentation rather than a constraint. While vivid ("mottled bark," "moss-covered alcove"), the garden feels like a passive backdrop that affirms the protagonist rather than a concrete place with rules. The "measurable luck" concept is relegated to background decor rather than integrated into the world logic.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on generic sci-fi atmospherics ("glimmered," "whispered," "steel beams") that serve as a backdrop rather than a constraint. While the imagery of the aviary is cohesive, the environment does not pressure the character's choices or offer resistance to her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid visuals like the flooded pit and warping vellum anchoring the mood. However, the atmosphere remains static, acting as a backdrop rather than a pressure cooker that forces adaptation. The reliance on "antique" and "ghostly" tropes limits the specificity of the world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.0)
    The atmospheric details are vivid and specific, blending the mechanical ("rusted panels," "barometer") with the botanical effectively. The setting functions as an active tool in the resolution, grounding the more esoteric elements of the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is rendered through heavy atmosphere ("rusted artery," "gloom") but lacks spatial specificity or sensory grounding beyond the visual and auditory abstract. The environment is treated as a container for metaphors rather than a physical space that constrains the character's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.2)
    The atmosphere is consistent but relies on generic fantasy tropes ("tattered vellum," "ancient stone arches"). While the "obsidian refuge" and "origami swan" offer specific visuals, the setting largely functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting consists of generic nature imagery ("ancient oaks," "quiet valley") that serves as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint. The "dreaming roots" description feels like overlaid sentiment rather than a concrete environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with tangible details like "rusted skin" and "cradle of oak" establishing a clear atmosphere. However, the environment yields too easily to the protagonist; the silo functions more as a static backdrop than a source of constraint or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting is established with consistent, if generic, atmospheric details ("lanterned stone," "steaming tray"). While the lighthouse serves as a central image, the spatial interaction between the character and the environment is confusing (e.g., the telegraph/lantern alignment). The setting provides mood but does not meaningfully constrain the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the "loop pedal" concept suggests a specific atmosphere, the setting description relies heavily on abstract adjectives ("waning," "resonant," "fragile") rather than concrete grounding. The spatial geography of the cathedral is vague, leaving the reader in a "white room" decorated with generic fantasy tropes like "dimensional anchors."

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.4)
    The imagery is vivid and specific ("mist curled," "glass spire," "frozen lake"), establishing a strong aesthetic. However, the setting functions largely as a passive canvas for the protagonist's magic rather than an environment that constrains options or forces tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.8)
    Imagery is vivid ("towers fell upward") but the setting lacks concrete sensory grounding, feeling like a floating backdrop. The mix of ancient runes and "procedural generation" creates an unearned aesthetic clash that confuses the world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, offering vivid, imaginative specifics like the "petrified drum skin" turntable and "walls pulsing with memory." While the descriptions occasionally drift into purple prose, the physical environment clearly constrains the sensory experience (vibration over sound) in a way that suits the deaf protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is described with atmospheric, albeit purple, detail ("vines like whispered secrets"). While vivid, the environment functions more as a backdrop for mood than a source of constraint or tactical resources. The "hidden shaft" appears conveniently to resolve the plot without prior establishment in the scene's geography.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting of the "greenhouse for extinct plants" is evocative and anchors the atmosphere effectively. Sensory details are vivid ("amber glass," "petrichor"), though occasionally the description becomes heavy-handed and slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting is vivid but suffers from ornamental excess; descriptions like "shadows painted ancient murals" prioritize poetic effect over grounding. While the grotto is visually distinct, it functions more as a static stage for the poet's performance than a pressure cooker that constrains his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.0)
    The "sunken orchard" and "skeletal guardians" provide a distinct, atmospheric backdrop, though descriptions occasionally drift into static set-dressing. The setting does not significantly constrain the protagonist's choices; she moves through it without friction or tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting is atmospheric ("liquid gold," "old rain") but functions as a passive backdrop that cooperates perfectly with the protagonist. It fails to constrain choices or apply pressure, serving only as a container for the magic system.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.8)
    While atmospheric, the setting relies on generic "cozy" descriptors ("breezy," "scented pages," "lanterns") rather than specific, grounding details. The spatial relationship between the library, the pier, and the lighthouse is vague, serving as a theatrical backdrop rather than an environment that pressures choices.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is described with high-density abstraction ("crystalline orchard," "ribbons of violet") that creates a visual wash but fails to constrain action. The physical rules of the space are unclear (e.g., cracking dew-kissed stems in a crystalline orchard), leading to a lack of grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "rooftop canal" and "giant's nap" concepts are imaginative and visually vivid, offering a strong aesthetic foundation. However, the setting often feels like a static backdrop for metaphors rather than a physical space that constrains the character's choices or creates obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is vivid but ornamental, functioning as a static backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint. The invented word or typo "stalactules" (likely stalactites) distracts in the opening, and the description relies on standard fantasy adjectives ("silver," "pale," "gleaming") rather than specific, grounded sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.1)
    While the library atmosphere is established with some sensory details ("dust and ink"), the setting description suffers from the mechanical repetition of the phrase "sapphire hush." This reduces the setting to a recurring keyword rather than a vivid, inhabited space.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.0)
    While sensory details are abundant, they often veer into cliché ("tasted of ozone," "glistened... like tiny prisms") or ornamental excess ("thunder rolled like a metronome"). The setting serves as a static backdrop for the experiment rather than a pressure cooker that forces choices. The "mossy trellis" is visualized but does not constrain the protagonist's options in a meaningful way.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with vivid sensory details like the "perpetually bruised" sky and "salt-slick stones" effectively grounding the post-apocalyptic atmosphere. The tidal island context is integrated well into the movement and imagery, though the "stone altar" feels like a generic prop.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the descriptions are lush, the setting relies on generic high-fantasy signifiers ("quartz," "opal," "amber") that do not constrain the character's tactics. The atmosphere is asserted through repetitive labeling ("bright darkness") rather than sensory pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    Atmospheric detail is vivid and consistent ("salt-stained wool," "cracked coral maps"), establishing a strong mythic tone. However, the setting functions largely as a static backdrop for aesthetic objects rather than a source of constraints or obstacles. The environment is beautiful but compliant, offering no friction to the protagonist's goals.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.4)
    The setting relies on abstract, atmospheric adjectives ("silver particles," "ancient echo," "amber light") rather than concrete, grounding details. The spatial layout is somewhat floaty, with the "starlit vault in mist" feeling more like a video game backdrop than a physical place. The environment facilitates the journey too easily rather than providing texture or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is lushly described ("sea breathed mist," "windows yawning") but functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than a source of constraint. The tower and ocean set a mood but do not pressure Lira’s choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting suffers from "white room" syndrome decorated with generic fantasy markers ("crystalline," "violet," "sapphire"). The specific term "escondite" feels like a register break or unearned exoticism in an otherwise standard lexicon. Sensory details are visual and abstract ("lattice that defied Euclidean logic") rather than tactile or grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sensory details like lilies and polished oak are vivid but skew toward cliché ("whispering shadows"). The setting provides atmospheric backing for the magic system but does not exert concrete pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.2)
    Atmospheric detail is vivid and consistent, effectively establishing a surreal tone ("sky of bruised violet," "bonsai labyrinth"). However, the setting remains decorative; the environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices or force tactical shifts. The descriptions, while lush, occasionally drift into catalogue-style observation rather than interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.1)
    The atmospheric description of the "rusted bones" and "corrugated metal" creates a solid visual texture. However, the specific interaction between the tide, the vent, and the label feels contrived—a mechanical puzzle solution rather than an organic part of the world. The setting frames the action but rarely constrains the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.2)
    While atmospheric, the setting is often obscured by strained metaphors ("wind seemed to turn each cracked window pane into a page‑turn") that confuse spatial reality. Specificity is sacrificed for "literary" abstraction, leaving the geography vague.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the concept of a "raft city" is evocative, the description remains at the "postcard" level ("kaleidoscope," "bright banners") without specific sensory grounding. The setting functions as a generic backdrop rather than a tactile environment that constrains the protagonist's physical movements.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is established with vivid, albeit adjective-heavy, sensory details ("thin silver glow," "jagged rim"). While atmospheric, the description occasionally stalls momentum, and the specific "chemical kit" details feel somewhat contrived against the high-tech backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is atmospherically described with decent sensory details (sound/vibration), though the reliance on visual descriptors ("mist-coated," "iridescent," "pale gold") clashes with the protagonist's sensory limitations.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting provides a functional atmospheric baseline with the "rusted outpost" and "frozen lake," but the sensory details often lean into generic post-apocalyptic tropes ("metal ribs shriveled," "pale wind"). The environment effectively isolates the character but does not constrain her choices in a specific, tactical way.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.1)
    While images like "lattice of silver" and "scent of pine and iron" offer sensory texture, the setting relies heavily on generic tropes ("ghost town," "cobblestones," "ancient archway"). The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the magic rather than a source of constraint or atmosphere that resists the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.5)
    Atmosphere relies on standard underwater tropes ("violet gloom," "pillars draped in kelp"). The setting's credibility collapses when the bioluminescent fish literally spell out a word in English/glyphs to direct the plot, turning the environment into a mechanic rather than a place.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the atmosphere is initially distinct, the specific phrase "copperlight repose" is overused to the point of semantic satiation. The setting fails to constrain the protagonist, who literally hovers above the environment, negating its physical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.5)
    Atmosphere is consistent but relies on abstract, "white room" descriptions ("endless night," "frost-bitten vines") without concrete spatial grounding. The setting functions as a backdrop for metaphors rather than a physical space that constrains the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.0)
    While the red canyon imagery is vivid, the presence of a "wharf weaver" and "tide pools" in this dry landscape creates a spatial disconnect that is never grounded or explained. The setting details often drift into abstraction ("orchid solace") rather than concrete, sensory constraints that shape the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.5)
    The "catacomb orchard" offers a vivid, surreal visual, but it functions as atmospheric wallpaper rather than a tangible environment that constrains action. The "bioluminescence" and "rattling bones" provide mood but do not force tactical adjustments or create physical obstacles. The geography feels dream-like and ungrounded.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    The atmospheric details, such as the flickering neon and humming consoles, effectively evoke the requested setting and mood. However, the environment functions primarily as a static backdrop and does not exert pressure or constrain the protagonist's tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting is visually distinct ("cobalt observatory," "brass domes") but remains static and ornamental, failing to constrain the protagonist's actions. The descriptions lean toward purple prose ("bruised with dying stars") rather than sensory details that impact the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is atmospherically described but operates as a passive backdrop that actively aids the protagonist rather than providing friction or constraint. The "glass pane" appears conveniently in the wild, and the geography shifts vaguely to suit the plot's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is atmospheric but functions as a pathetic fallacy ("mist... reflecting the shared anxieties") rather than a grounding reality. The physical space is vague ("marble columns," "atrium"), and the medical context clashes jarringly with the unexplained magical realism elements.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the "ruined orchard" and "thick fog" provide atmospheric backdrops, they remain generic labels that do not constrain the character's actions or force specific tactical choices. The setting is viewed from a distance, lacking tactile interaction; the "knowledge network" introduces a jarring sci-fi element that clashes with the established fantasy tone without reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "sound wave garden" is vividly described with synesthetic imagery ("colored ribbons," "blossom of air"). However, the setting functions primarily as a magical projection screen that facilitates the epiphany rather than an environment that applies constraints or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.5)
    The greenhouse provides a functional backdrop with some sensory grounding ("metallic echo," "moss"), though descriptions often drift into abstraction. The setting is largely static and does not constrain the protagonist's choices or force a tactical pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is vivid ("turquoise reef," "violet nebulae") but operates as a decorative backdrop rather than a constraining environment. The sensory details are predominantly visual and ethereal, lacking the tactile grounding or spatial logic that would make the "gargantuan shell" feel inhabited. The environment does not pressure the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.6)
    While the "opal library" and "glass orchids" establish a cohesive atmospheric aesthetic, the setting remains abstract and ethereal, lacking the tactile grounding needed to constrain character choice. The repetition of "opal" and generic descriptions of "deserted marvels" prevents the environment from feeling like a lived-in space with distinct physical rules.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is atmospheric but generic ("dim vaulted extinct language archive") and relies on abstract metaphors ("smelled of... forgotten promises") rather than concrete, grounding sensory details. The environment does not constrain the character’s choices or shape the action.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is imaginative but overwrought, with descriptions like "stone seats shifted with each sigh" bordering on pathetic fallacy that obscures physical reality. Spatial logic is difficult to parse; the relationship between the amphitheater, the floodgate, and the city's irrigation remains vague. While atmospheric, the sensory details often rely on mixed metaphors (e.g., rusted links singing hymns) that distance the reader rather than grounding the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.4)
    The setting relies on "vintage" tropes ("yellowed maps," "dust motes") that create a generic atmospheric backdrop without constraining the character's choices. Specificity is ornamental rather than functional to the plot's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the visual of a "drifting prism terrace" is distinct, the setting logic is porous—the presence of "wooden chairs" on a floating abstract platform feels like an unearned prompt insertion. Atmospheric descriptors ("fractured hush") are repeated rather than evoked through sensory interaction. The world feels like a static stage set rather than a pressurized environment.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the bioluminescent imagery aims for atmosphere, the spatial logic is porous; the presence of fireflies ("living stars") inside a submerged deep-sea facility is physically confusing and unexplained. The setting serves as a passive backdrop that yields to the protagonist's desires rather than a concrete environment that constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is described with a high density of visual adjectives ("iridescent," "kaleidoscopic," "sapphire," "translucent") that create a wash of imagery without grounding spatial logic or constraining action. The environment feels like a passive backdrop for the magic system rather than a physical space that pressures the protagonist. Sensory details are almost exclusively visual and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "tidal arcade" is a vivid and specific setting concept that integrates well with the water mechanics of the plot. However, the description leans heavily on atmospheric "purple" phrases ("neon ribbons," "murmur of sea-salt air") that create a static backdrop rather than a pressuring environment that forces difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "twilight garden" establishes a cohesive atmospheric mood, but reliance on high-fantasy abstractions ("smelled of salt and memory") blurs sensory specificity. While the "moonstone speck" is visualized, the setting functions primarily as a passive backdrop rather than a constraining environment that forces tactile choices.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the imagery is consistent, descriptions are ornamental and "purple" ("soft sigh," "jeweled crowns") rather than functional constraints. The prism atrium and mist serve as static backdrops for the epiphany rather than environmental pressures that shape the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is atmospheric but functions primarily as a pathetic fallacy ("ash whispered back," "stars... echo the beats of her own heart") rather than a physical space with friction. While the imagery is vivid, the environment mirrors the character's internal state too perfectly, lacking the resistance or constraint required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "tide-polished grotto" is evocative, offering a distinct visual aesthetic with "sea-foam draped columns" and "reflected light." However, the setting functions primarily as a static backdrop; it does not constrain Arin’s choices or offer resources that alter his tactics under pressure. The description lists sensory details rather than integrating them into the action.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.1)
    The atmospheric details of "perpetual mist" and the "green-threaded artery" of ivy create a vivid, immersive world that grounds the fantastical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.1)
    While visually descriptive, the setting relies on heavy ornamentation ("bruised sky," "stone air") rather than concrete constraints that influence character tactics. The environment operates as a passive backdrop for metaphors rather than a physical space with resistance or logic.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.2)
    While atmospheric, the descriptions often defy physics or logic (e.g., a sky that "spun lazily" suggests dizziness rather than grandeur). The "ebony clipboard" feels slightly anachronistic against the "ancient terrace" without enough grounding to make the contrast purposeful. The setting serves as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with the "lattice of white fissures" and "brine pool" effectively grounding the abstract concept. The acoustic properties of the salt flat are integrated well into the action, though the "unfinished map" metaphor feels slightly overextended.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the atmosphere is consistent, the setting relies heavily on synesthetic abstraction ("metallic tang of unresolved poems") and clichés ("colors no mortal eye could name"). The descriptions are ornamental rather than functional, failing to constrain the character's choices or ground the scene in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.0)
    The radar dome offers some vivid visual imagery ("rusted cathedral," "parabolic faces turned inward"), anchoring the scene better than other elements. However, the setting remains a passive backdrop for internal monologue rather than a force that pressures the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the imagery is consistent, the setting relies on generic "floating island" tropes ("bioluminescent moss," "suspended above clouds") that do not constrain the protagonist's choices. The environment cooperates too perfectly with the mood to create friction or specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting relies on standard fantasy tropes (runes, aurora) and adjective-heavy description. While vivid, the environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than applying pressure or constraining choices.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.5)
    Sensory details are vivid ("rusted metal crate," "phosphorescent spores") and establish a cohesive atmospheric aesthetic. However, the setting functions largely as a backdrop for the ritual rather than a source of constraints or tactical obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting consists of generic signifiers ("crumbling balconies," "stone corridors") that lack specific, lived-in sensory detail. The environment never pressures the character or influences the outcome; the "palace reimagined" feels like a painted backdrop rather than a physical space with constraints. Time and space are compressed into a vague "dusk" that stretches indefinitely.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on abstract descriptions ("muted mural," "shifting grace") rather than concrete grounding, and the sci-fi terminology ("rewired," "cellular") clashes jarringly with the high fantasy atmosphere. The defining trait of the sanctuary (soundlessness) is contradicted by the protagonist's spoken dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is vivid and atmospherically unified, effectively grounding the reader in the "glass-mountain" tone. However, the density of "silver," "crystal," and "frost" imagery occasionally clutters the pacing without constraining the protagonist's choices. The environment provides a stage for the ritual but does not exert pressure or force tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.8)
    The concept of an orchard in a cathedral's rafters is evocative and provides a strong visual anchor. However, the setting functions primarily as a backdrop for metaphors ("light fell like a choir") rather than a physical space that constrains Lira's choices or tactics. The "deciduous vows" anthropomorphize the setting to the point of abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.5)
    The imagery of the astral orchard is vivid ("luminous pollen," "floating trees"), but the setting functions as a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker. The spatial geography is dream-like and unmoored, and the sudden introduction of a "tiled bathroom" in an asteroid library clashes tonally with the mythic atmosphere without being integrated into the world's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is vivid and imaginative, effectively using the "gaps" in the shelves to guide the protagonist's physical path. However, the descriptions occasionally veer into generic fantasy tropes (living vines, phosphorescent fungi) rather than specific, lived-in details that constrain choice beyond the immediate puzzle.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.2)
    While atmospheric, the setting is a collage of abstract images ("ghostly whispers," "living canvas") that fails to ground the reader in a coherent physical space. The lack of spatial logic—transitioning instantly from ship to ink river to garden—disorients without purpose, preventing the environment from acting as a genuine constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.0)
    The clock tower environment is rendered with competent atmospheric details ("amber lamps," "copper-glinting") that establish a cohesive aesthetic. However, the setting remains a static backdrop and does not constrain the protagonist's tactics or force difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting is atmospheric and consistent, but the descriptions suffer from repetitive phrasing ("gently luminous," "crack patterns in ice") that breaks immersion. While the visual of the "harmonic caves" is established, the environment functions more as a static backdrop than a source of pressure or constraints on the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=4.1)
    While atmospheric keywords ("humming," "vibrating") are present, the setting remains an abstract backdrop that does not constrain the protagonist's choices. The "glass humming pavilion" feels like a stage set rather than a pressurized environment.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is atmospheric but lacks spatial concreteness; the "solid fog" and "crystal" function as magical conveniences rather than constraints that force choice. The "summer-quill" is an ornamental proper noun that never affects the physics of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.6)
    The "blooming fortress" offers a distinct visual anchor, but descriptions often rely on "purple" abstractions ("velvet blank," "silent witnesses") rather than tactile constraints that pressure the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on purple prose ("whispered promise," "silver spill") rather than sensory details that ground the action or constrain the character. Spatial orientation is vague; it is unclear where the chronicler stands in relation to the clans or if she is even visible to them.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.5)
    The sensory details of the "flavors of silence" are vivid and imaginative. However, the use of "xenial" to describe the trellis is distracting and imprecise (suggesting hospitality in a way that doesn't fit the structure), and the setting feels slightly untethered from physical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.0)
    Atmospheric descriptions ("violet bands," "sunrise caught in glass") are vivid but ungrounded, serving as decoration rather than constraint. The confused physics of the terrace versus the gondola prevents the setting from operating as a tangible, lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=3.1)
    The setting is a catalogue of visual adjectives ("kaleidoscopic," "neon," "holographic") that acts as ornamental wallpaper rather than a physical space. The environment never constrains movement or forces a tactical trade-off, lacking tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.0)
    Atmosphere is heavily established through repetitive adjectives ("ashen," "charcoal," "cold"), but the setting remains spatially vague—a "white room" filled with fog. The description relies on abstract sensory wash rather than concrete, particularized details that would ground the sanctuary in a physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.5)
    The bioluminescent farm is described vividly and integrates with the plot mechanics ("violet glow," "fungal veins"). The setting actively supports the "concepts become physical" premise.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is established through a heavy layer of sensory adjectives ("sepia," "dust-kissed," "amber") that remain decorative rather than constraining. While the room contains the puzzle, it offers no atmospheric resistance or distinct spatial geometry that forces the character to adapt his tactics. The description leans on clichés of old libraries without grounding the reader in a specific, lived-in reality.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.0)
    While the imagery is dense ("coppered vines," "luminescent moss"), the setting operates as a surreal backdrop rather than a source of constraints. Descriptions like "factually mystical glow" break immersion by applying abstract labels to sensory details. The environment feels dream-like and malleable, failing to provide the resistance needed to ground the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the dusty atmosphere is described, the room lacks specific grounding in the "post-emancipation" era. The "magic dust projection" physics break verisimilitude without establishing a clear speculative rule-set, leaving the world feeling like a convenient stage rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.7)
    While the "auric lagoon" is visually distinct, the description leans into ornamental purple prose ("silver veil," "scattered coins," "molten gold") that feels like a stage set rather than a pressure cooker. The setting provides atmosphere but fails to impose physical constraints or tactical difficulties on the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting is vividly described but spatially confusing, mixing "hollow cavern," "radiant grotto," and "prism atrium" without clear geometry. Sensory details are abundant but often abstract ("filaments of color," "trembling ghosts") rather than grounding, creating a floaty atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is visually distinct ("ashen skyborne arbor") and established early, but description remains largely ornamental. The environment cooperates with the protagonist immediately ("branches swaying gently," "crystal pool") rather than providing constraints or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is vivid but strictly ornamental, relying on repeated adjectives like "phosphorescent" and "silver" without constraining choice. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for travel rather than a source of pressure or necessary resources.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.1)
    The foundry atmosphere is established with sensory details ("rain hammered," "smell of hot iron"), though the imagery sometimes contradicts itself (furnaces "glowing faintly" vs. fire "not yet been lit"). The setting provides a backdrop but offers no physical resistance to the character's goal.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.3)
    The setting is vividly described with sensory details ("liquid amber," "slapping the slick stones"), but the imagery often drifts into abstraction that lacks spatial solidity. The "misaligned harp" is a compelling concept but remains physically vague—its source and mechanics are unclear, serving more as atmospheric set-dressing than a grounded constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.3)
    While the ultraviolet imagery is consistent, the setting functions more as a symbolic stage than a physical place with tangible constraints. Descriptors like "impossible shades" and "strange light" tell rather than show, and the environment lacks a specific texture beyond the visual.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.0)
    The alchemist's market is visually evocative ("brass constellations," "storms of ash") and establishes a distinct atmosphere. However, the setting acts largely as a painted backdrop; it does not physically constrain the protagonist or force specific tactical trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.2)
    Atmospheric descriptions are vivid but occasionally purple ("bruised clouds," "tired animal"). The spatial geography is incoherent, placing an attic above a room explicitly described as having a shattered glass ceiling open to the sky.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.2)
    The imagery is vivid ("frost-kissed panes") but operates as a static, surreal backdrop that fails to constrain the protagonist's choices or provide tactical resources. The "glass orchard" feels like a floating stage for metaphors rather than a physical space with rules that pressure the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.2)
    Imagery is vivid but purely decorative ("baroque asteroid," "copper spires"), serving as a static backdrop rather than a constraining environment. The "time becoming visible" phenomenon is a convenient magical device that does not ground the reader in a specific, lived-in moment.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.0)
    The atmosphere is established with decent sensory details like "low brass tones" and "fog-laden dusk," creating a cohesive mood. However, the setting primarily functions as a backdrop for the magic system rather than a constraint that forces specific tactical choices or physical struggles.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting creates a consistent atmosphere but relies heavily on generic "mystical cave" tropes like bioluminescent algae and "petrified guardians." The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the epiphany rather than applying constraints or tactical pressure on the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the imagery is consistent, it leans heavily into purple prose ("loomed like a weathered throat") that distances the reader. The setting changes (storm softening) occur via pathetic fallacy rather than logical progression or character agency. The "turbine-hum" attempts atmosphere but becomes a repetitive tic.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is rendered with lush, adjective-heavy description ("bruised sky," "amber light," "frozen waterfall") that sets a mood but remains ornamental. The environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices or force tactical shifts; it serves merely as a backdrop for the magical event. Sensory details prioritize the visual and abstract over the tactile or visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the imagery is grandiose (obsidian lagoon, violet reflections), it operates as a static backdrop rather than a constraint on action. The setting details are decorative lists that do not force the protagonist to adapt her tactics or navigate physical obstacles in real-time. The lack of a grounded scene makes the environment feel like a mood board rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.7)
    While the "paper-lantern cove" provides atmospheric imagery, the setting dissolves into abstract metaphors ("fountain... of light," "streets lit up like constellations") rather than concrete, tactile experience. The environment is passive, yielding instantly to the protagonist's will rather than offering constraints or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    The rooftop orchard is vivid and atmospheric, providing a strong backdrop for the scribe's work. However, the mechanics of a "phonograph shaving" tending the orchard are surreal to the point of confusion, slightly undermining the physical grounding of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is vivid but leans heavily on abstract synesthesia ("humming a note of forgotten harvests") rather than concrete, constraining details. While atmospheric, the environment serves as a static backdrop for the ritual rather than a pressure cooker for choice.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is established with some vivid sensory details ("driftwood ribs," "humming veil"), though the logic of driftwood above the clouds is distracting. The environment functions well as a backdrop for the sensors, but it does not significantly constrain the protagonist's choices beyond providing the wind.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the "weathered stone and copper tubes" provide a basic aesthetic, the setting relies heavily on vague atmospherics ("ancient algorithms," "invisible hands") rather than concrete, tactile grounding. The mechanics of the station are abstract, and the environment functions more as a mood board than a pressure cooker for the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.1)
    Atmosphere is heavy with abstract metaphors ("memory of honey," "sigh of ash") that prevent tactile, sensory grounding. The setting functions as a stage for poetic contemplation rather than a physical environment that constrains the character’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.8)
    Sensory details are vivid ("green metal panes," "ash-gray urn") but static; the setting functions as a decorative backdrop rather than a source of constraints that shape tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.1)
    Sensory details are vivid ("cobalt," "iridescent green") but operate as ornamental painting rather than a grounded environment affecting choices. The setting's reaction to poetry is abstract, lacking the physical rules or constraints necessary to create genuine atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.2)
    While visual details are present ("bruised amber"), the setting logic is inconsistent (stone pillars breathing "chlorophyll clouds"). The environment is described in purple terms that feel decorative rather than constraining, and the "living stone" elements break verisimilitude without establishing a clear magic system first.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is established with vivid, albeit adjective-heavy, imagery ("silvered sentinel," "twisted metal ribs") that grounds the scene visually. However, the atmosphere is marred by the forced repetition of specific phrases ("bronze quiet") which creates a static, artificial feel. The environment functions as a backdrop for success rather than a source of pressure or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sensory details are vivid and consistent ("bruised violet," "phosphorescent algae") but frequently veer into ornamental description that does not constrain the protagonist's choices. The setting serves as a passive backdrop for the theme rather than an active force applying pressure to the coachman's task.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the "rusted towers" and "amber" provide color, the description often lapses into mixed metaphors ("ears pruning the hush") that obscure rather than clarify. The physical reality of the dog interacting with this world is ignored (e.g., how paws manipulate a prism). The setting feels like a generic backdrop rather than a source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.2)
    Atmospheric description is vivid but leans heavily on generic sci-fi tropes ("residual quantum echo," "river of light") that function as set dressing rather than constraints. The setting feels like a passive backdrop for the internal monologue rather than a source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is visually distinct but operates as a static backdrop for the ritual rather than a source of physical friction or constraint. Sensory details tilt toward the ornamental and abstract ("clouds pulse like living ribbons") rather than the concrete. Spatial choreography is vague; the mechanics of the climb and the chamber's layout are glossed over in favor of atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.8)
    The atmospheric description of the gallery is the story's strength, with vivid sensory details like "thin ribbons" of light and "dust that clung to the stone." However, the chessboard's mechanical function feels slightly out of place in the otherwise ethereal setting.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.4)
    Atmospheric details are vivid but veer into "white room" abstraction with floating corridors and vague geography. The setting feels like a static backdrop for metaphors rather than a physical space constraining the action.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the atmosphere is consistent, the imagery relies heavily on purple prose and abstract metaphors ("wind that never moved," "frayed like old nerves") rather than concrete, grounding details. The "woven hush" and "platinum labyrinth" feel like symbolic props rather than a lived-in environment that constrains the character.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is vivid but rendered through high-fantasy abstractions ("wounded beast," "frozen finger") rather than tactile, grounded detail. While the imagery is colorful, the environment functions more as a responsive mood ring for the protagonist than a physical place that constrains action.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.7)
    The imagery is vivid and establishes a cohesive atmosphere ("skeletal ship," "acid-etched horizon"), though the "gears-and-cogs" feel largely ornamental rather than functional. The setting frames the scene well but does not sufficiently constrain the protagonist's tactical choices or impose physical limitations.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.2)
    The atmospheric description is vivid but leans heavily on "purple" abstraction ("mixing oil with memory," "scented with brine"). While the aesthetic is cohesive, the setting functions as a gallery of images rather than a source of constraints or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is established with vivid but generic "purple" descriptors ("gold over the restless sea," "ribbons of rose and amber") that act as ornamentation rather than constraint. The "vial cork" is a confusing object—is it the stopper or the vessel?—and its physical reality is blurred by abstract metaphors. The environment provides no friction; the lighthouse and sea merely reflect the protagonist's mood.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.5)
    Atmosphere is consistent but relies on adjective-heavy description ("cracked hush", "indifferent sky") over concrete grounding. The station's mechanics ("hydraulics fail" vs. magical censer) clash, creating a setting that feels like a collage of prompt words rather than a cohesive world.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.3)
    The "hanging orchard" concept is imaginative and provides a distinct vertical geography that grounds the scene. However, the setting is often obscured by heavy adjectival stacking and abstract metaphors ("broken cathedral," "old sorrow") rather than concrete sensory interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=4.2)
    While "opal dock" is a vivid image, the setting primarily functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of pressure or resources. Descriptions like "bruised lavender" and "stone tower" lean into generic atmospheric tropes without specific, tactile grounding that would constrain the character's movement or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.8)
    While atmospheric, the setting operates on vague fantasy tropes ("blooming cavern," "hidden throat") rather than concrete, physical rules that constrain the character. The geography feels fluid and convenient, lacking the specificity needed to ground the magical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=3.4)
    The setting is vivid but suffers from "white room" syndrome cloaked in adjectives ("liquid sapphire," "cobalt," "ember"). The geography is confusing—an ember grotto within a cobalt grotto above clouds—and serves as a passive backdrop rather than a constraint that forces tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.0)
    Sensory details like "iron and pine" provide some atmosphere, but the "ember nexus" remains a decorative backdrop rather than a constraining environment. The setting does not influence tactics or outcome, serving only as a stage for the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the cabin is established, the setting is obscured by heavy metaphorical filtering ("peaks stare like indifferent judges"). The sensory experience is replaced by interpretative adjectives, distancing the reader from the physical reality of the cold or the room.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the atmosphere is consistent, the physical reality of the shop is often obscured by heavy-handed metaphor (e.g., fog *inside* a shop that acts as a filter). The setting details—"dim light," "brass gears"—are generic steampunk markers that serve as backdrops for internal monologue rather than obstacles or tools that constrain the character's physical actions.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting uses standard high-fantasy tropes (floating rock, moonstone) that provide a consistent atmosphere but fail to constrain the protagonist's choices. While sensory details are vivid ("jasmine," "glass shards"), they function largely as ornamentation rather than active elements that shape the plot's outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is atmospheric ("vaulted aisles," "thin breath of autumn") but relies on generic descriptors ("antique," "weathered") rather than sharp, specific details. The environment functions largely as a passive backdrop for the ritual rather than offering constraints that force tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on generic "cosmic library" tropes (vaulted aisles, silence) without tactile grounding. The "softcover dictionary" clashes tonally with the "ancient temple" and is not integrated beyond its function as a prop. The environment does not constrain the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.7)
    The atmospheric conceptualization is the story's strongest asset; the "hydraulic clock" and "horizon measurement station" are vivid and imaginative anchors. Specific sensory details like "silver glass of water" and "amber and steel" effectively ground the surreal premise in physical texture. However, the setting remains largely static, serving as a backdrop for the ritual rather than an active force of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.2)
    The bioluminescent visuals are vivid ("caps pulsed like soft lanterns"), effectively establishing the atmosphere. However, the physical constraints are weak; the "permeable barriers" and "laser pointer" operate via "techno-magic" that solves plot problems instantly rather than creating spatial or environmental friction.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the "rainwashed library" provides a distinct visual container, the setting functions passively, offering no resistance or pressure to the character's movement. The transition to the subway relies on dream logic that bypasses physical grounding, making the environment feel like a static backdrop rather than a force in the story.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is evocative, effectively blending the grittiness of the subway with the surreal quality of the glass harmonica. However, the atmosphere relies heavily on dense adjectival stacking ("impossibly thin," "ghostly glow") which occasionally pushes the tone toward generic etherealism.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is vivid and established early, providing a strong atmospheric container for the scene. However, the descriptions often veer into purple prose ("perfume of salt and memory") and remain static; the environment ornaments the ritual but does not pressure the character's choices or constrain his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is vivid but functions largely as a static backdrop for the fable rather than a source of constraint. While sensory details like the "silvered pebble" are nice, the "ivy as curtain" imagery feels decorative, and the spatial geography of the station remains vague during the critical "contraption" scene.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.5)
    The ultrasonic forest is established with consistent, vivid sensory details that ground the fantasy elements in a specific atmosphere. However, the heavy reliance on synesthetic abstraction ("contours of memory") sometimes distances the reader from concrete, navigable geography.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is atmospheric ("humming," "tide of spacetime") but suffers from "white room" syndrome, functioning more as a metaphorical space than a physical location with constraints. While the imagery of the "orchard of data" and "ribbons of light" is vivid, it lacks the tactile grounding needed to make the anomaly feel like a dangerous environment rather than a backdrop for philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting is rendered with "postcard" description ("silver sigh," "glass eye reflecting moonbeams") that creates a static atmosphere rather than constraining choice. While the camera leaving an imprint is a nice image, the environment largely serves as a passive backdrop for the magic rather than a source of resources or resistance. The "luminous harbor" is generic magical realism furniture.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=3.4)
    Setting details are generic ("sandstone," "basalt," "dim alcove") and do not constrain the character's actions. The environment feels like a passive backdrop for a linear puzzle hunt rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.7)
    The setting is vivid but operates as a surreal dreamscape ("fragrance composed of vibrating blossoms") that fails to constrain the protagonist's choices. While atmospherically consistent, the "sound wave garden" lacks physical grounding or specific, limiting rules that would generate narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.1)
    The container labyrinth and geomagnetic storm provide a vivid, if somewhat generic, atmospheric backdrop. While sensory details are present ("electric tang," "rusted shipping containers"), the setting functions more as a stage set for magical effects than a source of constraint or pressure. The geography remains vague, lacking specific anchors that would ground the movement.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.0)
    The "cobalt dock" and "rain-slick wood" create a distinct, consistent visual atmosphere. However, the setting feels somewhat static, serving as a backdrop for the light show rather than an environment that pressures the character or constrains tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is atmospherically consistent but relies heavily on "magical library" tropes (dancing dust, mist, amber glow) that serve as mood lighting rather than constraints. While the imagery is vivid, the environment rarely forces a tactical choice or impedes Mara’s goals. The "mist" behaves metaphorically rather than physically, softening the reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the setting uses specific terms like "sublittoral fringe," the description relies heavily on decorative adjectives ("bruised horizon," "moon-struck daggers") that distance the reader. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the magic system rather than a source of pressure or constraint on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting is the story's strength, with vivid details like the "cracked porch" and "cedar shavings" grounding the abstract concepts. However, the "indifferent" turbines and "racing shadows" occasionally veer into pathetic fallacy without constraining the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.1)
    While visual, the setting relies on repetitive, purple descriptions ("cobalt atrium," "humming quartz") that feel like a stage set rather than a tangible environment. The imagery is dense but untethered to physical laws or constraints that would pressure the character.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is atmospheric but floats in a hazy, metaphorical space ("glimmered with shards of sunrise") rather than grounding the reader in a concrete physical location. While the plants are specific, the glassblower's furnace and courtyard often feel like set dressing for the theme rather than a constraining environment that forces tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the "laboratory of lost sounds" is established with some vivid sensory details, the environment is static and does not constrain the protagonist's choices. The atmosphere is marred by the repetitive overuse of the phrase "golden shadows" (five instances), which reduces the setting to a lexical loop rather than a tangible space.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.5)
    The "timeless observatory" provides a moody, atmospheric backdrop but lacks specific, constraining physical details that influence the character's tactics. The setting feels like a generic stage for the magical realism elements rather than a lived-in space with tangible limitations.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the setting is described with vivid sensory details, the prose suffers from "purple" over-description ("rain-beaded skylight," "midnight-worn cards") that functions as decoration rather than constraint. The environment provides atmosphere but does not pressure the character's tactics or timing.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.7)
    The setting suffers from purple abstraction; "traveled across the end of innocence" confuses spatial orientation with metaphor. While the "bronze prism pagoda" is visually distinct, the environment is filtered through heavy personification ("walls themselves breathed") that distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy clichés ("velvet cushion," "crystal pedestal," "blooming library") that provide a pleasant aesthetic but fail to constrain action or choice. The environment functions as a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker, with "white room" syndrome masked by flowery adjectives.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is atmospheric ("silver mist," "scattered canopy") but functions as a passive backdrop or magical helper rather than a source of constraint. The mist "wrapping the scene" and "absorbing each fragment" removes friction instead of adding pressure. The environment feels generic and lacks tactile grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.1)
    Atmosphere is heavy but relies on abstract, confusing descriptors ("grains of water," "meteor hush radiance") that distance the reader. The physical space serves only as a container for metaphors rather than a constraint on action.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.2)
    The opening establishes a tangible atmosphere with velvet and dust, but the setting quickly evaporates into abstract metaphors ("inner universe," "liquid light"). The loss of physical grounding weakens the scene's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.0)
    The setting is a generic "white room" decorated with high-fantasy adjectives ("violet and emerald shadows") that fails to anchor the reader in a specific time or place. The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraints or resources that influence the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.4)
    Imagery is vivid and atmospheric ("petals of sand," "amber at the horizon") but largely decorative. The setting does not constrain the protagonist or force tactical shifts; it yields immediately to his actions. The mix of high fantasy and quantum jargon ("wave functions") creates a jarring lack of cohesion in the world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=4.5)
    The "mechanical rainforest" offers vivid imagery ("pistoned moss," "brass trunks"), but the setting functions largely as a static backdrop that yields to the protagonist rather than constraining him. While the sensory details are imaginative, they often slide into "purple" abstraction ("mental foliage," "steel sky") that distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting consists of generic fantasy markers (pebble pier, silent harbor, glowing cave) that function as a backdrop rather than a constraint on action. While atmospheric consistency is maintained, the environment never forces a tactical shift or authentic interaction beyond the functional use of the ticket.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established with vivid, if heavy-handed, adjectives ("bruised sapphire," "frost-lined") that create a consistent atmosphere. However, the "nerve regeneration" aspect is disconnected from the physical reality of the scene, failing to constrain choices or act as more than background flavor.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting consists largely of generic high-fantasy tropes ("cathedral of stone and dust," "vaulted aisles") that serve as backdrop rather than constraint. While the image of shelves melting into walls offers a glimmer of specificity, the environment mostly fails to pressure the protagonist’s choices. The "pause of shifting constellations" is decorative framing rather than an integrated temporal mechanic.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is established with some evocative imagery ("hummed with quiet sensors," "reclaimed pier"), effectively grounding the mood. However, the specificity suffers from purple prose ("whispered their loss") that prioritizes poetic effect over concrete spatial reality. The station feels more like a stage for metaphors than a functional scientific outpost.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.2)
    The "rusted cathedral" and "broken hulls" provide a generic sci-fi backdrop that functions as a passive canvas for the protagonist's projection. The setting offers no mechanical resistance or constraints; it is atmospheric but ultimately yielding.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting is vivid and specific, with "moss clinging to basalt" and "steam" creating a distinct atmosphere that integrates well with the telepathy element. However, the description often feels static or list-like rather than filtering strictly through the protagonist's immediate, pressured perception. The environment facilitates the plot but rarely obstructs the character or forces a tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.8)
    The arboretum is described with competent but standard literary imagery ("tapestry of pine," "salt of the wind") that establishes mood without pressuring choices. While sensory details like the pine needle and wind chimes are present, the setting remains a passive backdrop rather than an active force that constrains the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established with evocative sensory details ("sea-salt breath," "fogged panes"), but the description often slides into purple prose that distances the reader. The environment feels like a stage set for the theme rather than a tangible space constraining the character's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    Imagery is vivid ("chrome feathers," "jagged alcoves"), effectively establishing a surreal atmosphere. However, the setting primarily serves as a passive backdrop for the ritual rather than offering constraints or resources that shape the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.7)
    The setting creates a consistent frozen atmosphere, but relies on generic dystopian tropes ("skeletal trees," "frozen vellum") rather than specific, tactile details that constrain choice. The environment serves as a static backdrop rather than an active force pressuring the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.2)
    The glass dome and desert rose farm provide a consistent, cohesive visual atmosphere that grounds the scene. However, the mechanics of "inculcating plants" drift into ungrounded magical realism that clashes slightly with the physical grit of the airship scrap.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.0)
    The atmosphere is lyrically consistent but suffers from "white room syndrome," relying on synesthetic metaphors ("rippled like invisible chords") that obscure physical reality. While the auditory imagery is vivid, the lack of tactile grounding makes the environment feel like a painted backdrop rather than a pressure-cooker for the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is described with vivid but often confusing imagery ("telescope pipe hummed... like rustle of newspaper"), creating a dreamlike atmosphere that lacks physical grounding. The observatory feels like a stage set with magical props (a console that accepts a wood pen) rather than a functional space that constrains the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.5)
    The atmosphere is vivid but relies on purple abstractions ("phantom wind," "constellations painted in ash") rather than grounded sensory details. The juxtaposition of high-tech firmware and antique furniture feels incoherent and unearned by the world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=3.5)
    While the atmosphere is consistent, it relies on abstract, synesthetic descriptions ("lilac unease," "emergent hush") that lack concrete sensory grounding. The setting feels like a stage set for the prompt words rather than a lived-in environment that constrains the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting consists of generic post-apocalyptic tropes ("shattered sky," "soot-gray stones") that serve as theatrical backdrops rather than constraining environments. The sensory details are abstract and repetitive ("warm coldness") rather than concrete, failing to ground the reader in a specific, lived-in physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sensory details are abundant but often abstract or "purple" (e.g., "liquid violet," "violin's sigh") rather than grounding the scene in physical reality. The environment feels like a generic portal fantasy backdrop rather than a specific, lived-in place that constrains the character.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is rendered with heavy ornamentation ("sun-dappled," "neon ribbons") that functions as decorative backdrop rather than a constraint on action. While vivid, the description does not shape tactical choices or impede the protagonist's progress.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the "coastal cave" is atmospherically described, the setting relies on abstract visual markers ("glowing," "amber hue") rather than tactile, constraining details. The environment acts as a passive backdrop for the magic rather than a source of pressure or physical resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is atmospheric with some evocative imagery ("walls breathing," "layer of sunrise"), but it suffers from "white room" syndrome, lacking spatial logic or grounding. The relics feel like a collection of abstract metaphors rather than physical objects in a lived-in space, and the "warehouse" creates no constraints on the character's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting describes a generic fantasy landscape with flowery but abstract phrasing ("crags breathing cold"). The atmosphere relies on the repeated phrase "silver hush" rather than sensory specificity that constrains the character's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.1)
    Atmosphere is established but relies on generic "literary" tropes (fog, mist, gloom) rather than specific, grounding details. While the visual of the river is functional, the "gloom-hill" descriptor feels like an unintegrated prompt artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting relies on abstract, poeticized descriptions ("clung to memory," "vessels that sang") rather than grounded sensory reality. The inclusion of scientific terms like "photons" creates a jarring register clash with the mythic tone, and the environment feels disjointed from the logical constraints of an abandoned wasteland.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is atmospherically consistent ("luminous," "silver ribbons") but relies on generic magical-night tropes. Specific elements like the "lockmaster's bitting gauge tooth" feel mechanically inserted rather than integrated into the world's logic or constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting relies on generic ethereal tropes ("rolling sea of mist," "vaulted sky") without specific, grounding details that constrain action. Spatial relationships, particularly regarding the stone circle's location relative to the clouds, remain vague.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is vivid but leans heavily on decorative, ethereal descriptions ("sequined ribbons," "shimmering") that distance the reader rather than grounding the scene in sensory reality. The environment facilitates the protagonist’s journey effortlessly rather than providing constraints or tactile resistance. The "dissolving" temple at the end undermines the spatial anchor established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on generic adjectives ("restless static," "old university") rather than concrete, tactile details that constrain action. The environment functions as a backdrop rather than an active pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the "underground cathedral" is atmospherically described, the spatial logic is occasionally confusing (e.g., aligning a compass with a "distant constellated window" deep underground). The setting serves as a passive backdrop for the magic system rather than a pressure cooker that forces specific tactical adaptations.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.4)
    The atmospheric setting is established early but often drowned in heavy-handed personification ("stone walls swallowing sound," "stone inhaled the sorrow"). While the "perpetual veil of mist" sets a mood, the environment functions more as a stage for metaphors than a tactile space that constrains the protagonist’s actions.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.2)
    The atmospheric details ("iron and seaweed," "muted drums") are vivid and establish the setting well. However, the description occasionally drifts into decorative overwriting that slows momentum without constraining the character's options.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.4)
    While individual images like "amber light" are vivid, the setting is an incoherent mix of naturalistic mountain details and unanchored construction metaphors ("scaffold wrap flutters"). The environment functions as a passive backdrop that yields immediately to the protagonist's magic rather than a resisting force. The specific phrase "scaffold wrap flutters" feels foreign to the "pine-laden" context, likely forced by a prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.4)
    The circus train offers a distinct, surreal visual metaphor that grounds the digital concept effectively. However, the "dusky" lighting descriptor is overused, and the office setting feels generic compared to the specificity of the rusted wagons and foreign currency markers.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is a collection of "purple" descriptors ("trembling desk," "mountain of echoes") that provide atmosphere but fail to constrain the protagonist's choices or tactics. The observatory cooperates with the protagonist rather than existing as a physical space with rules and limitations; the environment functions more as a pathetic fallacy than a grounded stage for action.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is imaginative ("swirling orchard vortex") but rendered in purple prose that distances the reader. The imagery acts as atmospheric wallpaper rather than a constraint that forces specific tactical adjustments.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the atmosphere is colored with specific hues ("cobalt," "violet"), the setting lacks tactile grounding and spatial coherence. Descriptions are often confusing mixed metaphors, such as a plant clipping that gleams "as if forged from moon metal," blurring the line between organic and inorganic without purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "catacomb orchard" offers vivid, macabre imagery ("roots snaking between ossified bones") that effectively grounds the surreal premise. However, the setting remains a static backdrop that yields to the protagonist's magic without providing resistance or forcing tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is visually distinct ("rust-spotted van," "corrugated walls"), but the description suffers from pathetic fallacy, where the environment perfectly mirrors the protagonist's internal state ("landscape itself listening"). The quarry offers atmosphere but does not provide concrete constraints that force the protagonist's hand.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "magnetic arbor" is an imaginative, specific setting that grounds the fantasy elements well. However, the environment functions primarily as a compliant tool for the protagonist's success rather than a source of friction or constraint. Sensory details are vivid but occasionally veer into purple description.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific details like "bronze cogs" and "silver water" establishing a distinct atmosphere. The environment effectively anchors the tone, though it functions more as a passive backdrop than a source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on "purple" abstractions ("prisms that whispered ancient lullabies," "trembling gleam") rather than concrete, grounded details. While the crystal cave is visually established, the bunker context is vague and unconnected to the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting consists of generic abandoned-industrial tropes (cracked tiles, ivy, rust) without specific, grounding sensory details that constrain the character. While the spatial movement from station to tunnel is clear, the environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than an active force pressuring the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.3)
    Setting details ("mist," "glowing," "parchment") are generic fantasy tropes that fail to constrain choices. The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than an active pressure on the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is atmospheric ("velvet," "amber," "brass") but operates as an aesthetic backdrop rather than a physical space that constrains action. Spatial geography between the observatory, the empire, and the floating city is dreamlike and unclear.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is atmospherically vivid, establishing a distinct mood through "skyborne" and "aurora" imagery. However, the description is largely ornamental and static; the environment facilitates the action rather than imposing constraints or forcing specific adaptations.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.8)
    Atmospheric description ("violet haze," "phosphorescent lichen") provides a consistent visual palette, but the setting feels generic and floaty. The environment serves as a backdrop for the protagonist's success rather than a source of friction or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.2)
    The lighthouse setting provides atmosphere but acts largely as window dressing; the "breezy" dawn and "whispering" sea do not constrain Mara's actions. While the wind chimes and shard are integrated as tools, the sensory details often veer into abstraction ("sigh of the stone") rather than grounding the scene in concrete immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.1)
    Visuals are vivid ("silvery dawn," "obsidian"), creating a consistent ethereal atmosphere that anchors the reader. However, the setting functions primarily as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraint or physical pressure that forces adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is atmospherically described with vivid imagery ("towers of bone," "endless echoes"), establishing a strong mythic mood. However, the environment functions largely as a static backdrop for the ritual rather than a source of physical constraint or obstacle that forces specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting contains some evocative imagery ("frayed like old drafts"), but the description often relies on abstract labels ("absurdly ornate," "accommodates impossibilities") rather than concrete sensory details. The world-building regarding the automated cities feels distant and disconnected from the immediate scene on the spire.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.2)
    While atmospheric, the setting relies on dense, clashing metaphors ("fragment of sunrise" at night) rather than grounded sensory detail. The physics of the library are contradictory; books "float like coral" in "salt-filled gloom," yet the protagonist walks and breathes without gear or explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting is atmospheric and establishes a consistent mood, though it relies heavily on abstract adjective-noun pairings ("violet mist," "ambered glass") rather than tactile interaction. The coins serve as a specific anchor, but the "observatory deck" largely functions as a passive backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is vividly described with strong atmospheric details ("amber of day," "rusted lenses"), though it relies heavily on personification ("stone arches breathing"). The environment provides the tools for the ritual but does not offer resistance or constraint; the observatory feels more like a stage set than a physical space impacting the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.9)
    The "dripping rates" mechanic successfully integrates the viaduct setting into the plot's resolution, moving beyond mere backdrop. However, the descriptions ("frozen river of light") lean heavily on ornamental similes rather than sensory details that deepen the immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=3.0)
    Atmosphere relies on "purple" abstractions ("whisper of old pine," "echoing water’s memory") rather than concrete grounding. The time of day is contradictory (midnight vs. twilight), and the spatial logic of the town—stirring "beneath the reservoir" yet its people gathering on the ridge—is muddy.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is vivid and colorful ("kaleidoscopic waterfall," "phosphorescent snow") but leans on ornamental descriptors rather than constraints that shape the action. The imagery is pleasant but feels like a backdrop rather than a pressure cooker for the protagonist's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is atmospheric but suffers from abstract, oxymoronic descriptions ("soundless echo," "silent metronome") that undermine sensory grounding. The "nocturnal arbor" feels vague and ethereal rather than a tangible environment that constrains the protagonist's physical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting details ("basalt," "bioluminescence") are vivid but largely ornamental, failing to constrain the protagonist's choices until the magical resolution. The "shifting chronologies" concept is introduced but remains a background flavor rather than an active environmental pressure that forces tactical shifts during the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, establishing a moody, "storm-born" tone that effectively permeates the setting. However, the reliance on poetic abstraction ("invisible veins," "breathing light") occasionally distances the reader from the physical reality of the shed. The specific sensory reality of the corpse flower is sanitized into "damp soil" and "wonder," missing the gritty specificity of the actual object.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.1)
    The atmosphere is cohesive but relies on stock Gothic furniture ("cracked stone column," "forgotten jokes") that feels more theatrical than lived-in. While the "echo chamber" concept is established, the spatial logic dissolves into abstract metaphors about sound tides rather than grounding the action.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.3)
    Atmospheric details are consistent and vivid (mist, amber, frozen spines), establishing a strong mood. However, the "books as flowers" trope is standard, and the setting description occasionally stalls momentum with ornamental phrasing rather than constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting is an abstract "white room" filled with purple descriptors ("amber gloom," "perpetual hush") rather than concrete, sensory reality. Spatial grounding is absent; the "market square" and "highest tower" feel like floating concepts rather than accessible geography.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting concept ("rusted towers") is evocative, but the execution relies on mixed metaphors ("scent of a shard of hush") rather than concrete geometry that constrains action. The environment functions as a backdrop for the magic system rather than a physical space that forces tactical trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is atmospheric but functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of pressure. The repetition of the exact phrase "spectral grotto under starlight" three times diminishes the immersive quality, reducing the setting to a recurring tag.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric but functions as a passive canvas for the magic rather than a source of constraint. Descriptions rely heavily on abstract similes ("like liquid glass," "fractal arches") instead of grounded, sensory details that force the character to adapt tactics. The environment bends to the character's will rather than pressuring him.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the benthic imagery is consistent, the "sonar arrays... treat each photon as a node" line creates a jarring scientific error (mixing sound/sonar with light/photons) that breaks verisimilitude. The setting is described through generalities rather than specific, sensory interaction that constrains the character's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.8)
    The atrium setting is atmospheric and consistent, effectively establishing a mood of melancholic decay. However, the imagery relies heavily on generic gothic tropes ("mist," "weeping statues") rather than specific, tactile details that constrain the action.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with vivid sensory details like "jellyfish bellies lit from within" and the "scent of salt and old circuitry." The setting is anchored and specific, effectively blending the industrial with the oceanic. However, the "forgotten research facility" trope relies heavily on standard genre descriptors ("rusted steel," "coiled serpents") without surprising subversion.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with vivid sensory details like "frozen lantern" and "midnight ink" creating a cohesive mood. The setting actively grounds the surreal interaction, though the mechanics of the observatory remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, synesthetic details ("towers of bone," "bleached ribs") establishing a distinct atmosphere. However, the environment feels static, serving as a passive backdrop for the ritual rather than an active force pressuring the character.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.4)
    While the underground garden is visually distinct, it relies on familiar genre tropes (phosphorescent moss, humming leaves) without specific, grounding sensory texture. The description frequently drifts into abstraction ("promise a harmony untamed") rather than anchoring the reader in concrete, lived observation.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.5)
    While visually descriptive ("rust-clad towers," "locust shell"), the setting relies on a generic binary of "evil gears" versus "good nature" without specific, lived-in texture. The environment functions as a backdrop for the fable rather than a source of constraint or tactical resources.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.8)
    The atmosphere is vivid and consistent ("cobalt light," "neon," "clinking token"), establishing a clear mood. However, the setting operates largely as a backdrop rather than a constraint; the "arcade" elements (machines, aisles) don't meaningfully affect Milo's tactics or the drone's behavior beyond providing a console surface.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.2)
    Atmospheric details like "brass lilies" and "soot-blackened pine" are vivid, but the spatial logic is incoherent (moving vs. rusted static). The setting functions more as a backdrop for poetic musing than a physical space that constrains the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, effectively blending the scientific and poetic elements requested. However, the descriptions often rely on abstract metaphors ("breathed verses," "lattice of ink") rather than tactile grounding that constrains the character's physical actions. The environment facilitates the magic rather than providing resistance or texture to the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.2)
    While atmospheric, the setting is constructed from generic high-fantasy descriptors ("whispering archipelago," "crumbling stairwell") that do not constrain the characters' actions. The imagery is vivid but lacks the specificity and grounding required to create a tangible world.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=2.4)
    The setting relies on "white room" abstractions like "whispering void" and "silvered cobblestones" that lack sensory grounding or physical constraints. The environment functions as a passive, ornamental backdrop rather than a pressure cooker that forces specific tactical choices or interactions.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.4)
    The central image of a greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is visually striking and imaginative, anchoring the surreal concept. However, sensory details often feel decorative ("brine-laden," "amber") rather than restrictive, and the spatial logic operates on dream rules that reduce physical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting relies heavily on atmospheric tropes ("dust," "whispers," "ancient stacks") rather than concrete, tactile constraints that force choices. While the imagery is consistent, the library functions as a passive backdrop for the magic ritual rather than a pressurized environment that resists the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.0)
    The setting is described through abstract, flowery clichés ("liquid amber," "misty sigh") rather than concrete, grounded sensory detail. The lack of tactile constraints makes the environment feel like a painted backdrop rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is atmospheric and visually distinct, with effective use of light and water imagery to create a mood of solemnity. However, the environment functions primarily as a static backdrop for the ritual; aside from the "hum," the sanctuary does not exert pressure or constrain Elara's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.4)
    Atmospheric details ("wet plaster," "bruised purple sky") establish a strong mood but remain largely decorative. The setting provides a backdrop rather than constraining the protagonist's choices or forcing tactical adaptations.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.3)
    The sunken library provides a vivid, atmospheric backdrop, but the physics of the scene (underwater acoustics, the snow globe's behavior) break verisimilitude. The setting serves the mood well but fails to act as a concrete constraint on the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the atmospheric imagery of mist and lightning is consistent, the setting lacks physical grounding; the "courtyard above clouds" feels spatially abstract. The interaction between the digital elements ("living circuit") and the physical stone is asserted through metaphor rather than concrete, tactile constraints that shape the character's movement.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.1)
    Atmosphere relies on decorative adjectives ("frost-kissed," "silver pillars") rather than tactile constraints. The mention of a "translation algorithm" within copper goggles creates a jarring anachronism that breaks the fantasy aesthetic established by the "ancient mechanisms."

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.4)
    Atmosphere is vivid but confusing; the physical reality of the gondola (dangling vs. docked) is never resolved. Sensory details are abundant but often abstract ("dust-laden starlight fell like ash"), prioritizing poetic sound over spatial clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    The "hollowed tree trunk library" is established with evocative, specific sensory details like "bark-lined aisles" and "leaf-filled windows" that ground the scene. However, the spatial relationship to the demolition site is muddled, slightly weakening the atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is established with vivid, if slightly ornamental, imagery ("brass hull humming," "amber breath"). While the atmosphere is cohesive, the sensory details are often filtered through poetic abstraction rather than immediate, tactile interaction that constrains the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.6)
    While the "frozen library" offers a vivid tableau, the setting operates as a static backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint. Details like "frozen rain" and "crystal volumes" establish a dreamlike mood but do not enforce tactics or consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is vivid and imaginative, with specific details like the "floating rock arches" and "nebula of respite" establishing a distinct atmosphere. However, the environment acts cooperatively, bending to aid the characters rather than providing the resistance or constraint necessary to generate dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=3.8)
    Atmosphere is heavy but marred by severe repetitive artifacting and abstract overwriting. The specific phrase "bruised awe" appears three times (once grammatically disjointed: "stone ribs bruised awe"), which breaks immersion and reveals the prose's mechanical nature. The setting is described through metaphors that obscure rather than ground the physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the juxtaposition of the "mechanical birds" with the rotting, cursed orchard creates a vivid, specific atmosphere. The "cliffside labyrinth" provides clear spatial grounding, even if the navigational challenge is minimized.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ravine is described with heavy-handed similes ("stone walls twisting like intertwined strands of DNA") that impose theme rather than grounding the reader in physical reality. While visual, the setting functions as a passive backdrop for an epiphany rather than a source of friction.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.1)
    While the imagery is consistent and vivid, it relies heavily on ethereal, "white room" abstractions (clouds, vapor, light) that lack tactile grounding. The environment is pliable, rearranging itself to aid the protagonist rather than offering the resistance or constraint needed to deepen the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmospheric blending of desert, coral, and ice creates a vivid, surreal sense of place that anchors the piece. The sensory details—brine weeping from walls, the pink glow—are specific and immersive, effectively establishing the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.5)
    Imagery is vivid ("soft sunrise captured in amber") but the spatial reality is dreamlike and confusing; the logistics of wooden planks bridging massive grain silos are glossed over. The setting serves as a symbolic backdrop rather than a constraining physical environment.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is atmospheric but generic, leaning on standard descriptors ("moonlit," "silver," "basalt") that do not constrain the protagonist. The environment cooperates instantly with the protagonist's desires, failing to function as a source of pressure or distinct physical reality. Spacial choreography is vague beyond the immediate "portable lab."

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.2)
    The visual of the gravity-inverted grotto is imaginative, though the description occasionally drifts into purple prose ("glittered like shattered glass"). However, the setting fails to exert pressure; the gravity inversion is treated as a scenic backdrop rather than a physical constraint that forces difficult tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=3.5)
    The premise of an &quot;intensely quiet&quot; world is immediately contradicted by the opening line where &quot;leaves whispered like distant flutes.&quot; Sensory details are ornamental rather than restrictive, and the setting fails to impose constraints on the character's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=3.9)
    The setting consists of generic high-fantasy signifiers ("magnetic nexus," "star-cloaked elders") that provide atmosphere but do not constrain action or shape tactics. Descriptions rely on visual adjectives rather than tactile or specific sensory details that would ground the abstract premise. The "nexus" functions as a backdrop, not a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is atmospheric but suffers from "white room" syndrome, relying on heavy, abstract metaphors ("iron ribs," "unseen currents") rather than concrete grounding. The environment feels like a stage set for the concept rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is established with generic fantasy tropes ("mist-clad," "ancient vines") that do not constrain the action. While the "hollowed birch trunk" adds a specific touch, the environment largely functions as a static backdrop for the summary.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting of Galdor is vivid and imaginative, with the gravity inversion providing a strong visual anchor for the scene. However, the descriptions often lean on heavy adjectival stacking ("translucent coral," "shimmering," "phosphorescence") rather than functional details that constrain the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    The "labyrinth of shipping containers" is vividly realized, creating a tangible atmospheric pressure that anchors the narrative effectively. Sensory details like the "rust," "hum," and "foggy hush" build a specific, immersive world that stands as the story's strongest element.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the sensory imagery is vivid ("veined with frost"), the setting remains a static canvas that offers no friction or constraint to the protagonist. The environment is painted upon rather than navigated, failing to generate the pressure required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.8)
    The atmosphere is consistent but relies on generic fantasy tropes ("fabric of reality," "ancient seals") and repetitive descriptors like "hush." While the visual of the flute catching the sunrise is vivid, the setting functions more as a static backdrop than a source of pressure or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "topaz workshop" and "vanishing stars" create a consistent, dream-like atmosphere, though the imagery leans heavily into abstraction ("violet hue that whispered equations") rather than concrete grounding. The setting effectively isolates the character but functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraint or resource.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.2)
    While visual descriptions of the aurora and ridgeway are vivid, they rely heavily on flowery abstractions ("natural cathedral," "living tapestry") rather than concrete, grounding detail. The setting functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint on the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.1)
    The juxtaposition of high-fantasy elements ("quartz arbor") with a modern "battered sedan" feels disjointed and unexplained, breaking immersion. Descriptions are dense and ornamental ("glimmered like a captured sunrise," "delicate icy filigree") rather than serving to constrain the character or ground the scene physically.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=3.8)
    The "ancient loom" atmosphere is shattered by the tonal dissonance of a "local rummage sale" box; repeated descriptors like "stoically sparkling" flatten the sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.8)
    Sensory details are vivid but purely decorative ("violet dawns," "sapphire fruit," "copper grove"), creating a static painting rather than a tangible environment. The setting functions as a backdrop; neither the mines nor the orchard constrain the protagonist’s choices or force tactical adaptations. The world feels ethereal and detached from the physical necessities of the character's trade.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.5)
    Sensory descriptions are vivid but often veer into abstraction ("rivers of light," "curled through broken consoles") that unmoors the reader from the physical space. The setting feels more like a canvas for metaphors than a concrete, inhabited environment that constrains the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.4)
    Setting details are generic lighthouse tropes ("iron ribs," "broken panes") that fail to constrain action. The shift from "haunted" to "sanctuary" is asserted through adjectives rather than earned through a change in sensory interaction or physical limitations.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is painted with heavy visual adjectives ("emerald," "sapphire," "phosphorescent") that create a static postcard effect rather than constraining action. The integration of modern elements ("print newspaper," "total internal reflection") clashes jarringly with the established mythic tone, breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the imagery is consistent, the setting feels like a collection of generic fantasy aesthetics ("floating rock," "crystal flowers") rather than a grounded place that exerts pressure. The geography is pliable, shifting to provide "hidden gardens" exactly when the plot requires them, lacking spatial coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the "stormlit tower" and "copper jars" offer visual texture, the setting is largely a collection of generic fantasy tropes lacking specific grounding. The atmospheric logic breaks when the "rattling wind" of the storm somehow allows for a "silent corridor" where a pin drop can be heard, shattering immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the imagery is consistent, the setting relies heavily on abstract metaphors ("breathing cathedral," "loom of woven dawns") rather than tactile, grounding details. The description often floats in a "white room" of light effects, lacking the physical constraints or specific geography needed to anchor the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is rendered through generic &quot;purple&quot; descriptors (&quot;rain-kissed,&quot; &quot;cobblestones,&quot; &quot;ancient tomes&quot;) that lack specific, lived-in texture. While the imagery is consistent, it feels like a backdrop for a fable rather than a physical space that constrains the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.8)
    Atmospheric description is the story's strongest asset, creating a cohesive mood of melancholy and decay ("vines draped the low roof," "scent of jasmine"). However, the setting is largely static and does not constrain the character's choices. The jarring intrusion of the "guerrilla gardening" label into a ruined palace setting creates a slight tonal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is atmospherically rich ("pillars of ice," "bruised violet") but relies on abstract, ornamental description rather than constraining the character's tactics. The environment provides a backdrop for the ritual but does not force specific trade-offs or physical limits.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with sensory details like "salt and ferment" and "rumors that tasted like iron" grounding the scene effectively. The environment actively pressures the characters, particularly the rotting pier and the gloom.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is vivid and functions well as a mechanism; the detail of the forest election altering humidity to shift the compass is a strong, integrated causal link. However, the atmosphere often drifts into purple prose ("soft binary code," "whispered of forgotten futures") that prioritizes aesthetic vibe over tactile grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is vivid but ornamental, relying on heavy adjective use ("frozen starlight", "crystalline floor") rather than tactile details that constrain action. The environment functions as a backdrop for the magic rather than a source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "greenhouse city" and "toxic sky" provide vivid, if standard, solarpunk fable imagery. However, the setting serves largely as a passive backdrop for the moral; it offers no physical resistance to the protagonist's movement, functioning more as scenery than a source of constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.8)
    Imagery of the "iceberg fragment" and "copper arm" is vivid, but the lack of a specific temporal anchor ("Every morning") prevents grounded spatial choreography or immediate sensory pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting is vivid but strictly ornamental, serving as a canvas for metaphors ("mosaic of molten sky") rather than a physical space with constraints. The "magnetic north" mechanics operate as magic rather than a grounded environmental rule.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.5)
    While the setting is established, the atmospheric descriptors clash; "sandstorm calm" is repeated against a backdrop of "yesterday's rain," creating sensory confusion. Details like "cracked wooden door" and "vintage coats" are generic placeholders that do not constrain the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.0)
    Atmospheric details ("kelp leather", "copper threads") provide a specific aesthetic, but the setting lacks physical coherence. The mechanics of the "pressure" and the lab's position relative to the water are confusing, undermining the reader's ability to visualize the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting is imaginative, blending the whale carcass with the salt chamber effectively, but the environment functions largely as a static backdrop. While the descriptions are vivid, the "fluctuating gravity" is atmospheric rather than a physical constraint that forces the protagonist to adapt her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is vivid but relies on generic fantasy tropes ("ancient runes," "silver parchment," "molten glass"). While the sensory details are present, the environment serves as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure on the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is atmospheric, though the imagery ("ghosts of stone," "silver streaks") leans heavily on romanticized tropes that distance the reader from the physical reality. The rooftop garden creates a clear stage, but the "cracked open" sky feels overwrought for the quiet interaction that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=3.7)
    The setting relies on generic, high-diction fantasy descriptors ("violet velvet," "pale hands") that fail to constrain the character’s choices. The environment functions as a pathetic fallacy, mirroring Lira's mood perfectly rather than providing the resistance or tactile grounding required for high-band specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, utilizing the "marble sanctuary" and "aurora" to establish a cohesive mood. However, the description leans heavily into purple prose ("glimmered with pearl twilight," "cradle every lingering sigh") that slows momentum. While the "stalactites drip" element effectively marks time, the environment generally feels like a static backdrop for the prop-heavy ritual rather than a source of constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the "serpentine nexus" and "concealed cavern" offer a cohesive high-fantasy aesthetic, the setting remains abstract and devoid of tactile grounding or physical rules. Descriptions rely heavily on purple adjectives ("shimmering quartz light," "dormant fireflies") rather than specific, interacting details that constrain the character's actions. The environment feels like a passive backdrop for the character's monologue rather than a source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.2)
    Sensory details are vivid and lyrical ("trembling silver," "liquid mirror") but function primarily as atmospheric decoration rather than constraining choice. The setting is established clearly, but the "glacier ice" and "shrine" do not exert pressure or force tactical adjustments.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the atmosphere is consistent, the description relies heavily on pathetic fallacy (stones listening, parapets whispering) that distances the reader. The setting details are ornamental rather than constraining; the rain and mist are aesthetic backdrops that do not force difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.5)
    The wasteland atmosphere is established with decent sensory tags (“whispering sea of ash”), but the logic strains credibility (paper letters surviving radioactive storms). The setting serves as a static backdrop rather than a source of dynamic pressure or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.1)
    While there are attempts at atmospheric imagery ("oil and ozone"), the setting feels static and is undermined by the repetitive insertion of required object phrases ("cobalt glass portico"). The environment is a backdrop for the summary rather than a pressure cooker that constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.0)
    While the atmosphere is consistent, the spatial logic is confusing; a "loft beneath the dunes" implies a subterranean space, yet shutters admit light. The descriptor "feral" is abstractly applied to the architecture, and sensory details prioritize ornate synesthesia over concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=3.5)
    Atmosphere relies on "purple" descriptors ("golden limbs," "sea whispered") rather than grounding, tactile specificity. The technical setting is vague, treating copper coils and frequencies as magic rather than tools, which distances the reader from the physical reality of the labor.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.1)
    Imagery is vivid ("silver veins," "glassy hymn") but defies physical logic—a viaduct "after rain" alongside a "frozen lake" creates a confused atmospheric mix. The setting serves as a screen for projection rather than a source of concrete constraints or tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=5.2)
    The subway setting is established with standard tropes ("cold concrete," "steel") but lacks specific, grounded sensory details that constrain the character. The atmosphere relies heavily on pathetic fallacy (the tunnel "breathing easier," walls "humming a soft lullaby") rather than tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on generic signifiers ("dust," "gears," "silver curls") rather than specific, grounded details that constrain the characters' choices. The atmosphere is asserted through repetitive abstract labels ("vibrant hush") rather than evoked through unique sensory particulars that shape the scene's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.0)
    The steampunk aesthetic is vivid and imaginative, but the setting functions primarily as an ornamental backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure. While the "acid sea" and "floating forge" are visually distinct, they do not impact the protagonist’s tactics or force specific trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting conflates physical and digital space without establishing the rules of the reality (e.g., VR vs. meatspace). Descriptions like "rusted rack" alongside "wall of obsolete emojis" clash, breaking suspension of disbelief regarding the nature of the archive.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting blends high-fantasy imagery (ice spirits, lighthouse) with jarringly incongruous modern elements ("weathered van," "vintage store mirrors") without grounding the logic. While descriptions are visually dense, the environment does not constrain the character or force tactile interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the "drift-ice marina" is a strong concept, the execution relies on heavy personification ("ice groaning," "wind sang") that obscures the physical reality. Sensory details are filtered through so much metaphor that the spatial geography and tactile experience of the "wreckage" remain vague. The setting functions as a mood board rather than a constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.5)
    Over-reliance on repeated adjectives ("amber" appears five times) results in a monochromatic, stage-set atmosphere. The setting lacks tactile specificity, dissolving into purple abstractions like "liquid memory" and "violet sky."

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "kinetic parapet" and "murmuring pavilion" offer a distinct, almost techno-mythic visual texture that grounds the scene. However, these elements remain largely atmospheric; the setting does not constrain the protagonist's choices or force a tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is established via sentimental descriptors ("whispered secrets," "tears fell like dew") rather than concrete sensory details that constrain the character. While the lavender and ruins are present, they function as a passive backdrop rather than an environment that pressures the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established with some atmosphere, but the sensory details often clash logically (e.g., "sonically reflective shards of light"). The environment feels generic (dust, oak, crystal) and serves as a passive backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint that shapes the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.5)
    Atmosphere is vivid and consistent, though the setting functions primarily as a backdrop for mood rather than a source of physical constraint or obstacle that shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.5)
    Spatial orientation is confused; the text places the observatory "above the clouds" with a "forest below" (Earth) yet calls it "lunar" (Moon), while relying on sound waves that wouldn't travel in the implied vacuum. The imagery is vivid but physically incoherent.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting relies on generic, ethereal descriptors ("radiant haven," "gold," "clouds") that create a vague, dreamlike atmosphere rather than a grounded place. The environment mirrors the mood perfectly but fails to provide constraints or sensory friction.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting relies on standard fantasy tropes (floating isle, clockwork, ancient machinery) without unique, tactile specificity that constrains the character's choices. While the visual of the "nocturnal observatory" is functional, the sensory details are list-like rather than immersive. The environment serves as a backdrop rather than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is established with vivid, albeit heavy, sensory details like "midnight perfume" and "moss," creating a consistent atmosphere. However, the descriptions remain somewhat generic to the "secret garden" trope and do not actively constrain the character's movement or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=3.6)
    The setting relies on generic ethereal descriptors ("emerald serpents," "soft breath," "shimmering") rather than tactile, grounding specifics that constrain action. While the atmosphere is consistent, the environment functions as a passive backdrop for the ritual rather than a source of pressure or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.0)
    The "data center turned moss garden" is visually established with some vivid descriptors ("cathedral of rusted racks"), but it functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraints. The interaction between nature and tech is aesthetic rather than physical or causal, lacking tactile grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=3.0)
    The setting is an atmospheric abstraction, relying entirely on visual metaphor ("swirling hush," "pulsing mist") without concrete sensory grounding. The environment functions as a "white room" filled with adjectives, failing to constrain the character's choices or offer tangible resistance. The lack of physical reality prevents any genuine interaction between character and world.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.8)
    Setting descriptions are generic and adjective-heavy ("ancient," "verdant," "sacred," "whimsical") rather than specific or grounding. The environment functions as a passive backdrop that cooperates fully with the protagonist, failing to provide constraint or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting offers some vivid, if conventional, imagery ("frost-kissed roots," "copper sheet"). However, the environment fails to act as a constraint; the "subarctic" cold is mentioned but never impedes the character or forces a tactical trade-off. The setting functions as atmospheric wallpaper rather than an active pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.8)
    The cavern is described with vivid, if slightly purple, imagery ("murmurs of stone," "waning cliffs"), but the setting functions largely as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraint. The environment yields to the protagonist's needs without resistance; the "wounded season" provides atmospheric context but does not force specific tactical trade-offs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, providing the strongest element of the piece, though the specific physical constraints of the grotto are solved immediately by the character's presence rather than by effort.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is established with atmospheric descriptors ("copper roofs," "rain-beaded skylight"), but the environment remains static and decorative rather than pressuring choices. The "old circus alchemists" detail feels like a convenient invention to justify the ending's logic rather than a deeply integrated part of the world. Sensory details are vivid but tilt toward purple prose ("rust-hued peace") rather than concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "kinetic lagoon" and "rusted carousel" provide a vivid, atmospheric backdrop that supports the surreal tone. Sensory details are plentiful but often lean on heavy adjectival strings ("cracked brass," "fractured stillness," "weathered seats") rather than interactive physical constraints. The setting functions more as a static stage for the metaphor than a pressure cooker for the character.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.5)
    Atmospheric details ("dust," "cracked control panel") provide a visual texture, but the setting functions more as a metaphorical construct than a physical space. The interaction between tools and the environment (aligning a sextant to control electricity) breaks physical verisimilitude without establishing a magical realism frame.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the atmosphere is heavily described, it relies on contradictory physics (a "mute" sanctuary that chimes) and abstract labels ("petrichor nostalgia" used as a physical substance) rather than concrete sensory grounding. The setting feels like a collection of adjectives rather than a tangible place where the character must navigate physical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting relies on purple, clichéd imagery ("bruised with violet," "mirror of memory") that distances the reader. While atmospheric, the environment serves as a passive backdrop for philosophical musings rather than a tactile space constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is vivid but operates entirely as an atmospheric backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure. While images like the "golden dock" and "sleeping serpent" rope are visually distinct, the environment acts as a passive canvas for metaphors rather than a physical space the character must navigate with consequence. The sensory details are often abstract ("echo of distant tides") rather than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the garden is described with numerous adjectives ("damp amber," "bruised violet"), the setting remains a passive backdrop that never constrains the protagonist's choices or tactics. The description leans into "purple" ornamentation rather than functional, sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting imagery is vivid and cohesive ("glassy fingers," "silver tears," "basalt niche"), establishing a strong fable-like atmosphere. However, the environment functions primarily as a backdrop and resource supply rather than a source of constraint or pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is described with high sensory density ("obsidian lagoon," "liquid midnight"), but the details remain ornamental rather than constraining. The environment cooperates perfectly with the protagonist’s intent (the water mirrors her pulse, the coin sings) instead of offering resistance or forcing tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy abstractions ("violet dusk," "ancient reluctance") and heavy adjectival stacking rather than specific, tangible constraints. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the ritual rather than a pressure cooker for choice.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.2)
    Atmospheric details are plentiful but ornamental ("frosted with the memory of seasons"), failing to constrain character choice or ground the reader in a tangible physical reality. The setting serves as a passive backdrop rather than an active force.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is vivid but relies heavily on high-fantasy commonplaces ("obsidian ridge," "black tide") that serve as atmospheric backdrops rather than constraints on action. While the clock mechanism is described, the environment does not force specific tactical adjustments or create physical obstacles. The sensory details are consistent but ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=2.5)
    Atmosphere is flattened by mechanical repetition of descriptors ("velveteen gloom," "cobalt silo"). The spatial logic is impossible (large objects in a tiny case), destroying immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy tropes ("obsidian spire," "ancient runes") that provide atmosphere but do not constrain the character’s actions. While visual descriptors like the "blue tip glistening" are present, the environment feels static and disconnected from the predictive modeling plot until the end. The "crystal contraption" is vague, lacking the mechanical specificity needed to ground the "imaginative" aspect of the craft.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "ember alcove" provides a moody backdrop but lacks spatial specificity or constraints that pressure the protagonist's choices. Descriptions tilt toward purple prose ("flickering like fireflies trapped in amber") rather than functional details that ground the reader. The setting acts as a stage set rather than an active force in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting relies heavily on abstract metaphors ("walls stretched... surrender to perspective," "broken hopes") rather than concrete sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting relies on generic post-apocalyptic tropes (bioluminescent algae, sunken marble ruins) that serve as atmospheric wallpaper rather than constraints. The environment does not pressure the character's choices or force a tactile interaction beyond the cog.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=3.9)
    The setting relies heavily on repetitive, abstract descriptors ("velvet library," "velvet shadows," "velvet curtains," "velvet ambience," "velvet shelves") that create a monotone atmosphere without concrete grounding. The environment feels like a dreamscape that offers no physical constraints or resources for the character to navigate.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.1)
    The greenhouse is described with vivid, albeit decorative, imagery ("panes bruised by time," "ruby veins") that establishes a strong mood. However, the setting acts primarily as a passive backdrop for the ritual rather than a source of constraints or resources that the protagonist must cleverly navigate. The environment cooperates fully with the plot rather than pressuring the choices.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting details ("glass rods," "amber veins") establish a consistent steampunk aesthetic but remain ornamental, failing to constrain the protagonist's choices. The tower functions as a passive backdrop rather than a pressure cooker that forces adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.6)
    The setting relies on excessive personification ("streetlights daydream," "houses sigh") that obscures concrete reality. The atmosphere is cloying and ethereal, lacking the specific, grounded details needed to make the environment feel lived-in or constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.5)
    The underwater setting is described with vivid, albeit cloying, sensory detail ("phosphorescent currents," "violet veins"), but it fails to constrain the character's actions. The environment acts as a passive canvas for the magic rather than a source of pressure or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting consists of generic descriptors ("stone," "marble," "glass") and metaphysical assertions ("darkness whispered") without sensory specificity or resource constraints. The "infinite" nature of the staircase is treated as a philosophical backdrop rather than a physical environment that pressures choice or survival.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.8)
    Atmospheric details like the "soot-stained glass" and "saffron quiet" effectively establish a mood of fragility against the city's smog. However, the setting primarily acts as a static backdrop rather than an active force that constrains tactics or forces trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.2)
    Sensory details are frequent but often decorative and abstract ("air tasted of... wilted lilies"), cluttering the prose rather than grounding the scene in physical reality. The setting feels like a static backdrop for the prompt elements rather than a lived-in space that pressures the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established with decent atmospheric density ("jagged teeth," "sea spray"), though it leans heavily on adjectives. While vivid, the environment functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting contains standard horror tropes (funhouse, broken mirrors) that are obscured by repetitive, purple descriptors ("lingering luminance," "rotten lantern"). The atmosphere is stifled by the forced insertion of required phrases, preventing organic sensory immersion or spatial clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.5)
    The surreal setting of the floating orchard is vivid and cohesive, establishing a distinct visual aesthetic. However, the environment yields too easily to the protagonist's will, serving as decoration rather than a source of constraint or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.1)
    The imagery is vivid and imaginative ("molten ribbon," "ancient scarps"), successfully establishing a mythic atmosphere. However, the setting remains largely visual; there is little tactile interaction or environmental resistance beyond the initial premise.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the station is visually established with some evocative details, the setting functions more as a stage for metaphors than a physical reality. The environment's pathetic fallacy—reacting to the protagonist's thoughts—undermines the scene's grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is vividly described but suffers from "purple" overcrowding ("hushed blaze of damp copper," "skeletal fingers"). The overuse of metaphor occasionally obscures spatial geometry, making it difficult to visualize exactly where the waterline interacts with the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting offers some atmospheric visuals ("water-worn marble," "amber glow"), but spatial logic is weak; the transition from a submerged library to a surface council and back is physically disorienting. Description leans heavily on purple adjectives ("mournful sigh") rather than concrete, grounding particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sensory details are vivid and establish a cohesive, dreamlike atmosphere (&quot;dew-slick stone,&quot; &quot;roasted jasmine&quot;). However, the simile &quot;hovers like a starship&quot; in the final paragraph is a jarring register break that clashes with the established archaic/fantasy aesthetic (monks, lanterns, parchment). The setting constrains the action well via the sundial shadow.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.0)
    The "floating observatory" and "violet sky" provide a vivid, consistent backdrop. However, the setting functions largely as ornamentation; the "circuit breakers" and machinery offer texture but do not constrain the protagonist's actions or force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting anchors are established, but the environment fails to constrain choices or offer resources that shape tactics. The atmosphere is severely damaged by the repetitive insertion of the phrase "brilliant dimness" (four times), which breaks immersion and reads as a forced constraint rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is vivid but decorative, described in ornate prose ("slab of sky-blue stone," "night-black water") that sets a mood but rarely constrains the character's tactics. The "cobalt terrace" and "forgotten shore" feel like static backdrops rather than active environments that pressure the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting (parapet, mist, rain) is atmospheric but functions as a generic backdrop rather than a source of constraint. The weather describes the scene but does not force tactical adjustments or alter the exchange mechanism. Sensory details are consistent but lean on clichés ("phantom from the sea mist").

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.2)
    Extensive use of pathetic fallacy ("water... soft applause," "breeze felt merrily melancholic") forces emotional conclusions onto the environment rather than evoking them through sensory specificity. The setting approves of the character too easily, acting as a sentimental backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.6)
    The bioluminescent lake is described with vivid but standard imagery ("cathedral of algae," "phosphorescent"). The setting operates as a surreal backdrop—floating newspapers and talking mirrors—rather than a physical environment that constrains the character's choices or tactics. It feels disconnected from physical laws.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is atmospheric but generic, relying heavily on "luminous," "silver," and "moon" descriptors that create a static backdrop rather than pressuring the character. The environment facilitates the ritual rather than offering resistance or constraining the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.7)
    While the "midnight glade" is visually distinct, the setting relies on generic high-fantasy tropes ("ancient oaks," "moon-silvered grass") without tactile grounding or constraints on movement. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the ritual rather than an active pressure system that shapes the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.1)
    While the atmospheric intent is clear, the setting relies heavily on "purple" abstraction ("time slipped like dust") rather than concrete, tactile grounding. The "recycled" nature of the ship is stated but never utilized to constrain action or provide necessary texture, serving only as a passive backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the setting is visually described, it leans heavily on generic "sublime" imagery ("smoldering amber," "velvet black") rather than specific, grounded details. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the light show rather than a source of pressure or constraint. Spatial choreography is vague; the fisherman appears from "the far edge" solely to deliver exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is descriptively lush ("translucent marble," "glass roses") but functions as static ornamentation rather than a constraining environment. The "blackout" provides atmosphere but does not mechanically obstruct the protagonist or force difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory details are vivid and establish a mythic atmosphere ("violet ribbons," "black basalt"). However, the premise of a world without friction is not consistently dramatized; the sea still "breathes," sprays, and hums, and Selene walks and places stones without the physical difficulties such a constraint would impose.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the atmospheric descriptions ("stormlit," "copper dome") establish a mood, the spatial reality is incoherent. The interaction with the central props—the bus timetable and the timer—lacks tactile grounding, creating a confused image of how these objects physically fit together. The setting serves as a backdrop for pathetic fallacy rather than a constraint on action.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.5)
    The glass atrium and brook provide a cohesive, albeit sterile, atmospheric backdrop. The usage of the sundial and its shadows as a mechanism for the duel is a bright spot of specific interaction, though the "half paints" phrasing detracts slightly from the clarity of the image.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting operates on dream logic that fatally undermines the stakes; a "prison" where guards hand out contraband and travelers visit freely offers no constraint. While atmospheric descriptions ("veins of light") are plentiful, the lack of spatial and logical consistency prevents the environment from pressuring the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=4.2)
    Atmospheric descriptions are vivid ("leaves shimmering like silver rain") but float in a void due to the lack of spatial grounding. The "tidal arbor" and "auditorium of clouds" are pretty concepts, but they feel like painted backdrops rather than a lived-in environment that constrains the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is vividly rendered and functionally integrated into the dream sequence, where the jade vines and orchids become tools for the protagonist's translation. While lush, the description occasionally leans on ornamental lists rather than constraints that force difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the atmosphere is consistent, it is cloying and abstract ("sea of memory," "shimmering with the pale promise"). The setting feels like a watercolor wash rather than a physical place; sensory details are limited to visual clichés ("lace-like clouds," "wind-kissed") that do not constrain the character's choices.

    Abandoned control room functions as micro-setting: meltwater pools guide foot placement, console glow refracts through glass, constraining Mara’s slow choreography. Ice-ceiling drip supplies steady auditory clock; furnace flicker and silica scent thicken immediacy. Spatial anchors hold without drift; only the consoles’ sudden re-light lacks causal seed, a minor glitch.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rusted library stars, groaning shelves, cracked dome, and shifting constellations act as lived environment that guides choice (lever location, star-map name). Seashell and amber vial serve as micro-setting objects that constrain action. Sensory economy favors sound (sigh, groan) and haptic dust, matching claustrophobic aerial terror. Setting directly charges final image when walls glow post-amber, meeting 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fort, storm, and solitary star function as micro-setting: the gale “rattling the battlements” and the final turret perch directly constrain when and how the oracle releases the map. Sensory economy favors salt, iron, amber—selective and POV-filtered rather than catalogic. Spatial choreography stays clean; the booklet is handled, lifted, and finally placed atop the turret in a trackable chain. The star’s disappearance serves as the environmental trigger for the closure beat, passing the 9+ gate test for setting-charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)

Final empty stand reconfigures meaning, meeting 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rain-slick crystal, humming lens-glass, and “dust and old velvet” are tactile and POV-filtered. The forecourt returns as the charged final canvas, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean through the single tracking move to backstage. Weather is not backdrop but medium, mirroring the “thaw” of mistrust.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sensory triage is selective: cracked marbles, breathing hedge, moss voice—each filtered through gardener’s tactile priority. Garden maze functions as body-scale tool; its walls shift proximity and guide next polish, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible positions. A few metaphor piles (“marbles shone like a tiny sun”) momentarily over-decorate without constraining choice, preventing 8-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.0)
    The magnetic nexus and glyph-lever function as micro-setting that literally bends time; their physical presence constrains every tactical move. Sensory hierarchy obeys Lira’s mechanic gaze—she notices turbine hum, steel beams, circuitry arcs—never touristic. Spatial choreography is flawless: turbine core → maintenance hatch → aviary → console. The “icy warmth” reappears at closure, re-charged by the sideways time event, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.3)
    The flooded opera house is not backdrop; its leaking roof literally writes the score Mara must play. Micro-setting (warped program, swollen violin) constrains tactile choice.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Library-as-body is tactile—vine-shelves breathing, phosphorescent thread pulsing—yet spatial choreography stays liminal; exact distances never constrain tactics. The obsidian refuge functions as micro-setting that crystallizes the final stance; its moonlit eye recharges every prior silence. Selective sensory hierarchy (scent of damp parchment, cold river fingers) mirrors the POV’s fading memory without tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sage Ridge is sketched with selective sensory anchors—silver ring of light, dreaming roots—that mirror internal hush without clutter. The harp-as-micro-setting constrains pacing and justifies 9+ gate; environment does not yet alter tactics enough for top band.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Reclaimed silo library is tactile: rusted skin, oak cradle, metallic dust, stone sighing. Micro-setting (tapestry fragment, central stone) constrains the final gesture—axis pivots only when fabric touches glyph—so environment directly charges closure. Sensory hierarchy matches lone historian: smell of soot, vibration “low tide,” bronze quiet glow. Spatial choreography flawless; no postcard tourism. Achieves 9+ gate: setting object (fragment) reconfigures meaning in last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.9)
    The lighthouse, lantern beam, and salt-slick stone are vividly rendered through sensory selection that mirrors the spiral ink motif.

Dusk’s violet bruise and moss-cool shaft are filtered through her chromatic storm-recorder bias. Spatial choreography is flawless—hand-to-balcony-to-shaft track remains unambiguous. The final charged image (cat’s amber eyes) mirrors the earlier “amber sliver of sun,” tying environment to her promise.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    Greenhouse glass, vault ribs, phosphorescent vines, petrified leaves—each tactile detail doubles as emotional prism. Micro-setting (vial-as-moon in palm) constrains the final promise to return. Amber panes catch light like “mute witnesses,” objectifying memory itself; no setting dump stalls momentum. Only 8.7 because iron-roof rain mention floats without prior city scaffolding, a hairline specificity gap.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Micro-setting—the frayed coil itself—functions as compass rose and tether, constraining the final choice; setting also charges the ending image. Terra-cotta walls, mineral glaze, amber veins are selected, tactile, integrated into tracing fingers and rope placement. Spatial choreography clear: bicycle dropped at mouth, spiral descent, final stone core. No static museum tour; sensory hierarchy obeys poet’s “listening to stones,” narrowing to touch during knotting.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Glass greenhouse flickering with embers, ship-timber resonance, and copper bowl glints are selective, POV-filtered, and return to charge the final image.

Micro-setting (the bowl) functions as charged object that alters the sonic field.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    The amber grotto is not backdrop; its static-charged walls literally enable the protagonist’s method and mirror her detachment. The blotter petal functions as micro-setting/object that constrains every tactical move. Sensory detail is selective—taste of old rain, iridescent veins—filtered through Mara’s perfumer lens. One hairline slip: “city lights flickered on” is a touch generic, but the grotto itself is irreplicable.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.1)
    Micro-settings (library crates, pier planks, balcony rail) are tactile and bias-filtered through Mara’s cargo-eye; atlases-as-cargo neatly fuses vocation with moment. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but salt-and-ink scent threads the shards, preventing white-room syndrome. Starlight and wind are used as active agents (scattering light, carrying shine) that charge the final image rather than decorate it. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible object positions across the four quick moves.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    “Crystalline orchard,” “shimmering crater,” “black glass bark” are vivid, selective, and immediately teach the lyric pattern. The obsidian arbor functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: people must gather beneath it, touch it, weave reeds around it; its reflective surface literally refracts their yearning onto the ground. Spatial choreography stays clean across the night walk. The environment’s phosphorescent moss and dew-kissed stems evolve with the pageant of villagers, never repeated statically.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rooftop canal system is not postcard scenery; it actively lifts her skiff, brightens under the pendant’s violet pulse, and ultimately turns silver—environmental state changes that mirror stakes. The infinity pendant functions as micro-setting: its loops climb towers like vines, literally re-sculpting the skyline. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the light-bridge walk and spiral descent. Final image recharges the opening mirrored-ribbons, satisfying the 9+ gate that setting constrains and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Cavern orchard, stalactite-drips, moss, and mosaic stone are tactile, lived-in, and filtered through the conjurer’s selective attention; sound and silver light guide his spatial choreography. The orchard functions as both macro-setting and micro-tool: droplet vibrations literally translate grief into numbers on the stone, constraining his recording action and charging closure. No geographic vagueness or white-room lapses; every descriptor earns its place by advancing the equation motif. Setting could hit 9.0 if one environmental detail backfired or resisted him, adding price.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    Library and outage are sketched with restraint; the marble floor catching dawn light becomes the charged surface on which visibility is traded.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tidal island is rendered through tactile mist-catchers, salt-slick basalt, and candle-flicker studios; environment directly shapes access to water and the means of discovery. The brooch-as-micro-setting charges the final image when hung above the easel, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory selection stays inside Mara’s painterly bias—colors refusing sleep—so every detail doubles as character filter.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.1)
    “Musical crystal cave” is richly sensed: quartz walls sing, floor pulses, shadows move like tides. Details are filtered through Lira’s reverence, anchoring her wonder. Micro-setting—wind-carved pedestal, overlapping shadows—constrains the pearl’s display and later ribbon transformation. Spatial choreography stays coherent; bodies track cleanly from pilgrim’s entrance to child’s cascade. Setting alone nearly carries the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    The harbor’s salt-glass glare, lantern flicker, and gull-clink rigging are filtered through the archivist’s librarian gaze—he notices dates etched on shells, ignores bait barrels. Brass valve as micro-setting constrains every tactic: its hollow absorbs, hums, and finally releases the collective chord that reconfigures meaning. Weather’s after-rain sheen evolves from shattered glass to amber sunrise, mirroring the shift from private grief to shared chorus. One notch down from 9 only because spatial choreography of multiple docks piles fragments without distinct body-to-body distances.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.1)

The environment’s living lattice supplies the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is the containerscape itself: steel corridors that “sway with each tide,” constraining movement and rewriting the map. The poison-label micro-object becomes the perceptual filter that literally re-colors the world sepia, charging the final ghost-mural image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: salt-stink, radio crackle, cold filament on fingertips—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean; the exit path is legible after the tide recedes. Meets 9+ quick test, but the environment does not physically block a final exit, so tops at 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Observatory, cello, and shell function as micro-settings that constrain action: the shell must touch the cello to unlock the ledger, the dome funnels sound seaward. Sensory selection favors sound over sight, matching the acoustic stakes; salt-air taste is implied through gull cries. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible moves from attic to telescope to steps. Weather shift (cloud-part → gold slit) mirrors internal turn without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.1)
    Raft-city carnival is evoked in motion—“hulls creaked in rhythm with the tide”—and constrains logistics: riverbank tourism vs. artisan quarter drives the stall shuffle. Micro-setting object, the foundation stone chip, is handled twice (discovery, then glass-case enshrinement) and charges the closing image. Sensory economy favors lanterns, mist, river steam; no static catalogue. Spatial track clean: banners, walls, pier, waterline remain oriented across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    The moonlit summit is not backdrop but protagonist: powdery basalt shifts under the tripod, the Earth-rise glare forces the inspector to recalibrate his stance, and the chemical plume becomes the final “ghost.” Every sensory pick is filtered through occupational bias—he notes lens pedigree and silver-nitrate timing before he notices his own heartbeat—so the environment actively constraints tactics. This is setting-as-crank: without the razor-thin dawn window, the chemical trigger and emotional stakes collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mist, refracting basin, and carbon-fiber wing function as micro-setting that literally constrains the repair action; without the water-light tool the patch would fail.

Spatial choreography is clean: desk → pane → antenna → doorstep → ice crack, every move tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    The archway, dust, pine-iron scent, and silver lattice of shadow supply tactile, selective detail that constrains the tuner’s ritual: he must wait for the first sunrise to strike the arch “in gold” before the fork can sound. Spatial choreography is clean—the fork touches dust, stones slide toward it, workers later arrive along the same cobblestone line. The setting evolves from ruin to resonate market, mirroring internal renewal without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (the fork as ground-level tuning point) functions as the pivot object, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.8)
    Underwater temple is vividly filtered through diver priorities: kelp-draped pillars, bioluminescent fish spelling glyphs, amber hush outside stained glass.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    The greenhouse, bead, and winter-cracked fields are not backdrop but instruments: the bead’s glow dictates when vines stir, the endless night forces the venom-sigh to become sunlight. Spatial choreography is immaculate; the veil’s ash trail and the bead’s placement on branches track cleanly. The 9+ gate is satisfied—the bead’s final pulse charges the image—so the slight excess of visual over tactile detail caps at 8.9, not 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    The red canyon walls, tide-pool absence, and narrow stone arch anchor spatially; the loom, illustration plate, and glowing yarn function as micro-settings that constrain choice (weaving is physically forbidden here). Sensory selection skews visual/orchid-perfume but stays filtered through weaver’s tide-focused perception. Environment passively mirrors mood; it does not actively complicate tactics except by taboo, keeping the score just below the 9-line where setting must shape the final image under pressure.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade>
    <comment>Dominant stake—restore hope to a desiccated labyrinth—signals early and tightens through each stitched filament; escalation is Accumulative: empty tide-pool silence → luminous yarn veins → guildmasters humbled. Protagonist’s agency is continuous (every dream-step sews), but the visible price (risk of punishment, exhaustion, injury) is implied rather than dramatised, capping entry to the 8-band where cost must be unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.2)
    Catacomb orchard is not backdrop but instrument: roots lift like hands, moonlight strikes the disc, bones become sounding gears—all constrain Mara’s gestures and charge the final altar image.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.9)
    The fog-bound orchard is evoked with selective sensory strokes—mist-softened laughter, trees “trembling like chandeliers”—and the mural’s glow is made legible through reflected light on bark. Spatial anchors remain stable; the fragment’s placement at the “heart of the wall” tracks. Micro-setting qualifies: the glowing pigment on stone directly enables the final image. Only the late invocation of “starlight” drifts from the grounded orchard frame, keeping it under 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sound-wave garden is rendered through kinetic synesthesia—“blossom of air shaped by harmonic currents”—and the nickel’s micro-auroras charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ object-as-setting gate. Spatial choreography stays clean as the coin rolls to the pedestal, anchoring the surreal inside tactile motion. One decimal off 8.8 only because the broader world beyond the garden is never hinted, keeping the locale precious rather than lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.1)
    Greenhouse glass, insect hum, and cracked gourd seed recur as tactile micro-setting; the seed’s drum-like husk charges the final auditory image. Spatial choreography stays locked to Lysander’s hand-level perspective; no floating props. Meets 9+ gate: the seed’s resonance constrains the closing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    The shell’s calcium corridors, moonlit ribbing, and star-pollen accretion function as both canvas and crucible: every poem-layer literally glows back, constraining what the poet can next sing. Reef-shadow joy is rendered through tactile specificity—“moon painted silver veins on the walls,” “pollen settled like stardust on stone”—rather than tourism-catalog. Spatial choreography is dreamlike yet coherent: wind enters cracks, notes drip, stone answers, pollen blooms in sequence. Environment actively charges the final image; without the shell’s nacreous echo the climax has no surface to bloom upon.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    “Glass orchids,” “opal panes,” “suspended vellum” create tactile, luminous micro-setting. Light refracting through cracked bamboo into “translucent organ” is specific and re-used at climax.

    Grotto, reflected light, kelp, tide-echo act as both arena and instrument: the decorated balloons refract off wet stone to teach the pattern. Spatial choreography stays clean; bodies track logically from cavern floor to clifftop launch. The final ribboned coastline is a lived-in extrapolation of the grotto’s math, charging the closing image under the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ivy, mist, and hearth fire are filtered through Lira’s cartographer ear, so every visual detail doubles as acoustic data. The film negative itself acts as micro-setting, constraining how she can “see” echoes and thus shaping her final map stroke. Spatial choreography is flawless; we track hand, flame, stone, and satchel without drift. Weather is causal, not backdrop—the perpetual rain justifies the hush that lets walls dream.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prism parapet, wet tiles, echoing stone, and bruised sky are vividly filtered through the painter’s synesthetic attention; rain-caught light becomes “tiny glass singers” that literally color his brush-strokes, so setting constrains method. Spatial choreography is dreamlike but consistent; the terrace breathes with him, meeting the 9+ gate for environment-as-tool.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    Fire-scent, marble grain, and jasmine arrive through Lira’s selective attention, anchoring body and tool; the terrace’s white stone and circulating stars constrain the ritual timing and tether the treaty to cosmic order. Spatial choreography keeps swords, altar, and clipboard cleanly tracked. The ebony clipboard operates as micro-setting: its dark surface refracts firelight and later hosts the blades, recharging the reconciliation image. A single overripe phrase—“flawed beauty” repeated twice—slips toward symbolic announcement rather than sensory earnedness.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    The salt flat is not backdrop but instrument: its acoustic property (brine amplifier) directly enables the climax, satisfying 9+ gate. Micro-setting object—the quartz case—functions as extension of setting, constraining handling of the egg until the precise resonant moment. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: philanthropist notices “lattice of white fissures” as map, not tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: boots vanish, egg lowered, vibration spirals upward—no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    The silver courtyard, prism, and falling snow are rendered with selective sensory strokes that constrain movement—sound is muffled, distance collapsed, light refracted—so the setting literally shapes how she can approach the sanctuary. Spatial choreography stays clean: she steps, kneels, traces, releases, and the prism’s facets track her progress. The micro-setting of her own pulse-thread body also re-weights the final image, satisfying the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dome’s inward-facing dishes, cracked concrete, and campfire-ember reflections are tactile, selective, and mirrored in the final image; the setting literally “charges” the reversal metaphor. Spatial choreography is flawless—stick at center, dishes in concentric rings, wind-borne pine scent. Environment constrains the only possible epiphany: a reversed reflection of control. Micro-setting qualification met.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cloud-top grotto is anchored with multisensory economy—“vines tightening like fingers,” “scented mist”—and the bioluminescent moss functions as micro-setting that literally powers her signals, constraining the climax once sunrise ends its glow. Spatial choreography remains stable across kneeling, tying, placing the wing. Selective detail privileges internal mood over logistics, permissible under lyric mode. Environment is neither over-described nor generic; it charges the final image directly.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.1)
    Ice, aurora, copper, and sinew are filtered through Mara’s metal-worker eye, giving tactile hierarchy: frost “delicate veins,” copper “inner light.” The sanctum’s cold actively resists and yields—ice softens only after the rope sings—so environment and tool reciprocally constrain action. Spatial choreography is clean; barefoot on frost implies cost yet she never floats. Micro-setting (rope, cylinder) functions as geography, charging the final map of light.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is the story’s engine: the bunker’s moss-soft glyphs, the seal’s mirror-surface, and the phosphorescent trail each constrain or enable the final transcendence. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single scene; storm and spores evolve with action. Sensory hierarchy filters through the POV’s mystical priorities—sound of “precisely playful humming,” light of “phosphorescent spores”—never tourist catalog. Final image of vines stretching outward is charged micro-setting that reconfigures the whole frame.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    The crumbling balcony, dust-laden archives, and wind-chimed arches are filtered through Nabu’s frugal gaze—every stone is a potential tool, every echo a data point. The tile’s etchings and the violet bridge function as micro-setting that literally constrains the final ritual. Sensory hierarchy is tight: taste of dust, sound of prayer, sight of violet light—no cataloging. Palace geography stays coherent; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    The obsidian sanctuary’s sound-absorption and porous-night rule are established quickly and return to charge the final image; environment literally exhales, reweighting the stake. Selective sensory focus (cool lid, pulsing fingertips) keeps the micro-setting tactile without clutter. Spatial tracking is clean across the meditation circle and the wanderer’s entrance; no white-room lapses.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Fog, frost, and broken brass are not backdrop but tools: the orchard’s sighs dictate Arlen’s inhalations, and twilight crystals become the mirror’s new ribs. Sensory hierarchy is biased to touch and breath rather than visual catalog. The micro-setting of the stump-surface sextant constrains posture and focal length, directly enabling the capture beat. Environment evolves with action—fog thins to silver ribbon—so setting charges the final image rather than decorating it.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    The orchard–cathedral mash-up is specific, sensuous, and choice-bearing: cracked stained-glass gold dictates where Lira lays the lenses, turning light into tool. Micro-setting (ribbon, pine bench) constrains the mending choreography. Vocabulary stays vegetal and ecclesiastical—“vaulted grove,” “chorus of deciduous vows”—without catalog excess. Spatial clarity tracks cleanly from rafters to bench to exit hymn.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    Astral orchard is sketched in shimmering whispers and luminous pollen rather than catalogued, giving micro-setting economy. The asteroid’s low-gravity feel is tactile when trees bend and pollen settles on skin; the bathroom tiles reconfigure as cracked-shell mosaic, turning setting into an active oracle that constrains revelation. Environment directly shapes the breakthrough beat—only in that echoing stall does the mosaic pulse—so the gate for 9+ is met.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    The hollowed mountain-bookstore is the star: ivy-locked doors, phosphorescent fungi, mezzanine shadows all constrain movement and supply tools. Sensory triangulation is spare but POV-filtered (“humming an unheard symphony” heard only by scholar’s ear). Spatial choreography is clean; the collapsed floor reveals the next vertical level. Environment directly shapes tactics—vines barter for names—so the 9+ gate is met.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Carnival ship, cracked mirrors, ink-river, and name-flowers are tactile, lived-in, and constrain action (card slot, portal dive). Fog-bay and garden each evolve with plot; no static tour. One cap: the bay’s spatial logic (distances, deck layout) is briefly floated during carousel pirouette, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clock-tower interior is tactile and specific—brass cogs, iron balcony, copper-glinting rope—each object later re-used to constrain action. The “impossible seam” in stone and the frozen final image embed the setting into the closure beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    The harmonic caves function as a living instrument: every fissure sings, the basalt pedestal hums, the sapphire tunnel glows—the environment literally guides fingertips and later pacifies the energy beings. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: sound and touch dominate, color stays secondary. Spatial choreography is flawless (western mouth → hidden panel → central fissure spine). The echo chamber stone itself serves as micro-setting that charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate; only the slightest tourist-catalog cadence in “ripple-mark mapkeeper” keeps it shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Glass pavilion, prism, and star-scratched floor are tactile, wind-vibrated, sound-bent; micro-setting directly supplies the resonance that ignites beacon. Selective sensory triangulation (hum, glass-song, tarnished metal) keeps exposition lean while tethering ritual steps to physical anchors. Final image of amplified pavilion singing charges closure, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stormlit observatory, solid fog, and crystal forecourt are sensuously particular, filter through the archivist’s scholarly gaze, and directly guide his measuring ritual. Spatial choreography is clean; lanterns, obelisk, and balcony anchor each move. The “solid fog” literalization risks physics stretch but is cued early, serves closure, and is accepted as situational rule. Micro-setting success: the crystal’s whispered pitch and the obelisk’s shadow length constrain the conjecture that reconfigures memory into geometry, earning the 9+ gate for constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    Blooming fortress walls actively constrain movement and filter breath; vines curl tighter after each spark, a living aperture that charges the final fresco. Micro-setting (rag knot in pocket, kerosene scent on breeze) doubles as tool and sensory anchor. Selection favors olfactory and tactile over visual, matching fireworks craft. Setting evolution is causal, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Grotto, lantern-starlight, and tidal mirror are rendered with tactile specificity; the pool’s surface literally constrains how she reads the future, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is immaculate—lantern, cicada, water, and distant owl calls track cleanly. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she catalogs ripples before breeze, echoing her training. Only the Leaders’ sudden softness lacks environmental cue, a micro-slip that keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Compressed lyric setting inside a ventilation shaft and swaying trellis taught by 120 words, with selective sensory hierarchy—clouds “like cool silk,” vines “humming.” The xenial trellis acts as a micro-setting that literally supplies the only vantage point for harvesting; without it, no tactic exists, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is flawless: gravity inversion tracked through tactile shifts (“stone seemed to float”). Detail is balanced across senses but prioritizes touch and sound to mirror claustrophobic POV bias.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    The drifting prism terrace functions as micro-setting: its singing stones literally cue Lira’s counter-tones, so environment shapes tactics. Sensory selection is POV-driven—she attends to creaks, amber pulses, star-hum—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single continuous drift. One slip: “the quiet that follows a train whistle’s echo” is summoned three separate times without evolving referent, flattening atmosphere near climax.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment-as-tool gate met: the crystalline stair’s note-resonance literally gates ascent; orchard roots later snake into city code, constraining her new role. Sensory triage is POV-driven—she smells silicon jasmine, not tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography is clean; fissure → corridor → summit track remains coherent. Only micro-slips: “pixelated rain” is vivid but risks cliché, yet it is saved by closing circuitry horizon that reweights it.</question>
    <question>4</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—claim throne before sunrise—is signaled in sentence two and tightened by each flake-pulse. Escalation is accumulative: mural sigil → corridor song → stair resonance → throne fusion; each adds chromatic density, narrowing option to turn back. Agency remains hers; no coincidence rescues. Cost is conceptual—she becomes living interface—but because price is narrated rather than dramatized in a single beat, it stays just shy of 9+ visceral tier.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ashen sanctuary is never a backdrop; its charcoal grit, starlight cracks, and spectral spatial logic constrain every step the keeper takes. Micro-setting triumphs: the doorknocker ring warms, hums, and is finally abandoned—an object that literally charges the final image. Sensory economy is disciplined—cold night breath, iron resonance, pale constellations—each filtered through keeper-bias rather than tour-catalogue. No world-rule inconsistency or spatial drift; the environment silently partners the interior arc, meriting the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.1)
    The violet spore-clouded mushroom farm is sensuous, specific, and tightly filtered through the POV’s wary awe; every sensory notch (glow, hum, pulse) serves the accruing luminescent metaphor. Spatial choreography is pristine—no floating anchors. The submarine bolt functions as micro-setting: its remembered oceanic pressure is the literal pivot that transmutes air to gems. Environment therefore constrains the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate even though the rest of the description remains mid-scale.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sepia room, brass gramophone, and oak slab are tactile, selective, and filtered through Lian’s antiquarian gaze; the “golden shadows” motif recurs to mark pattern shifts. The micro-setting (carved panel) literally channels the sound that unlocks the boards, satisfying the 9+ gate by constraining the final discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    Coppered vines, luminescent moss, rusted control panel are tactile and constrain action: the glyphs must be touched, the moss ingests armor. Greenhouse breathes alchemy, but spatial ground holds; every descriptor feeds the accrual that climaxes in the knight’s dissolution. Micro-setting (armor, script) charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.1)
    The file room is evoked through dust motes, ledger spines, and the button’s metallic glint—tactile, biased to Amelia’s archivist gaze. Spatial choreography remains stable; bodies and objects track cleanly across the single scene. The button qualifies as micro-setting that constrains choice (it must be placed to catch light) and charges the final image. One minor lapse: “oak desk” and “high windows” are stock placeholders that could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.1)
    Auric lagoon and starlit ripples constrain movement (hidden platform) and charge the final silhouette; transmitter antenna pointing “toward the heavens” crystallizes the exit image. Sensory economy favors gold/star coin metaphors that match rebel treasure trope; no clutter, no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prism atrium and fog function as micro-setting: the refracting glass literally enables the erasure tactic. Sensory detail is selective—sound of dew, shimmer of metal—filtering through the saxophonist’s bias. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no white-room syndrome. Tool (sax) and environment together constrain the whisper-method, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.1)
    “Ashen skyborne arbor” is anchored early and tightens choice: the canopy’s ash-filtered light limits visibility, guiding her to underground water; moonstone dust and crystal pool return as micro-setting that charges the final beacon, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.1)
    Phosphorescent algae, ozone-iron mist, and silver leaf-dust are selective, sensory, and filtered through Mara’s tinkerer bias. The greenhouse becomes a working instrument rather than postcard, and the waterfall cavern supplies both spectacle and the brazier prop that powers closure. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible moves behind the water curtain. Environment directly shapes tactics: the leaf swirl is the lab, the algae the lantern, the brazier the key-turn.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    The foundry is not backdrop but tool: the cooling furnace’s residual glow supplies the amber light that guides the gold pour, and the anvil’s steel surface doubles as mirror and altar. Sensory hierarchy obeys the alchemist—temperature before touch, metallic scent before sight—keeping detail profession-specific. Spatial choreography is flawless: coin, anvil, satchel, doorway track without drift. Environment constrains the climax: only here can idle heat meet molten gold in the same breath.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Echo Gorge is rendered through sonic/motion detail—slap of boots, glass-sunrise water, harp string tension—rather than postcard vistas, keeping density high. The gorge’s wall is both altar and resonating chamber, so the micro-setting directly enables the final sonic alchemy. Spatial choreography is clean: tooth pressed to wall → vibrations channel → laughter wraps stone, no impossible positions. Environment never constrains logistics; it supplies the acoustic rule-set that makes the climax plausible, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Forest is built from interactive detail—humming crystal roots supply digits for the equation, bark pulse times her breath. UV light acts as both atmosphere and antagonist, searing skin to earn the next memory-bite. Pewter strap serves as micro-setting that constrains stance and finally reconfigures meaning. Spatial logic holds: every glow and footfall is tethered to Lira’s enhanced proprioception.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rooftop market, rope ladders, canvases as doorways supply spatial pressure; body/tool/fragment converge in hollowed arch where choice is forced. Ozone-rain scent and lantern-eye replication feed final image. Selective hyper-detail (“brass constellations”) occasionally over-glazes, but environment directly constrains translator’s movements and supplies the only path to release. Meets 9+ gate: fragment-as-micro-setting charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ticket-office micro-ecology is tactile: rain-slick glass, sawdust breath, brass coil tremor. Mirrors, ladder, hatch, and ledger act as objects that constrain movement and frame the final glow. Spatial track across counter→ladder→attic keeps bodies and distances exact. Weather and decay directly enable the dust-diagram method, so environment shapes tactics and charges the closing silhouette.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Glass orchard/cloud-sea is more than postcard: the shivering panes, refracting shards, and churning cloud-letters physically rewrite the world, constraining final image. Frost micro-setting doubles as tool and map, directly enabling the spiral press. Sensory economy favors glass/light/ink; no tourism catalogue. The library’s rule-set stays consistent—floating, fragile, refracting—throughout rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    “Baroque asteroid” is no postcard: copper spires, marble arches, and mirrored observatory actively constrain tactics—without the storm-lit mirrors the cultural rewrite fails. Micro-setting is the shard itself, whose refracting edge becomes compass and scalpel for civilization. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, yet the aurora-silver rain and final pocketed fragment anchor tactile reality. The setting’s gilded decay mirrors Lira’s internal corrosion, charging the final frescoes with reciprocal loss.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    Micro-setting—the resonance chamber’s iron vines and gear teeth—functions as both obstacle and tool, constraining every micro-alignment Alder makes. Fog, dusk, and cobblestone lanterns are sketched economically; spatial choreography of Alder circling the gear tracks cleanly. The amber lattice in the final image reweights the covenant and is inseparable from the re-lit town, qualifying for 9+ gate, but the world rule that “truth is a fragile filament” is asserted not dramatized, so the environment does not fully charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Quarry, rusted gate, limestone, bioluminescent algae, and the black-glass lagoon are selectively filtered through Mara’s petrichor-trained attention; every detail serves mood and stakes. Spatial choreography is clean: she slips through gate → tunnel → shore → water-stair, no floating bodies. The compass-on-stone and water-stair act as micro-setting objects that constrain her path and charge the final image. Factory remains off-stage silhouette, but its silence partners the lagoon song, so off-page setting still earns tonal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory selection is biased to Mira’s sculptor eye: salt-smelling palms, wood grain likened to stone, turbine hum as lullaby. The arch-as-throat metaphor is sustained, guiding spatial choreography without contradiction. Weather and turbines integrate into rhythm, mirroring internal state without overt symbolism. While no prop constrains a final tactical choice, the driftwood shards’ “natural scars” subtly charge the closing compass image, satisfying the micro-setting gate for 9-.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Amber light, cracked panes, and phosphorescent petals are sensory and selective, never touristic; the body is present via vibrating stone under soles. The postcard-glass alignment is a micro-setting/tool that literally refracts choice and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Cathedral spatial logic—cavity, lenses, spectrum—remains coherent. Minor slack: “autumn’s amber scent” is a stock synesthesia; still, environment constrains perception throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment constrains tactics throughout: zeppelin brass becomes lamp metal; dunes must be sculpted into readable glyphs; obsidian viscosity determines hand-immersion speed. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mara's archivist bias—she catalogs texture, weight, inscription first, smell last. Spatial choreography is flawless: we track distance from deck to sand, spiral perimeter, ladder rungs, lagoon ledge. Final image—violet glow reflecting on brass hull—recharges the opening “humming prayer” with now-public testimony.</question>
    
    <question>4</question>
    <grade>8.8</grade>
    <comment>Dominant stake—recover silenced civil-rights testimonies—is signaled in line 2 and tightened twice: Qadir’s demand for beach-debris code (failure = no passage) and the diary’s future-memory trap (failure = lost self). Each tightening exacts visible price: sleepless kelp-gathering, burned fingertips on brass lamp, vertigo when crystal pulses. Escalation is accumulative/textural: density of encoded glyphs on water increases until a single dip releases entire rebellion spectrum. No coincidence; final broadcast is earned by prior parley and crystal decryption.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.9)
    Paper-lantern cove, cracked cobblestones, and the sealed amber bottle are tactile, sensory anchors that filter through the alchemist’s biases. The lanterns act as micro-setting: their bobbing glow mirrors the “flickering thoughts” he summons, directly charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean—cove → ghost town → mental rebuild—no impossible jumps. World rules stay internally consistent (bottle sighs, memory ignites lanterns) without exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orchard atop steel is not backdrop but tool: rusted phonograph, pomegranate roots vibrating under Akkadian syllables constrain Harel’s next micro-choice—shaving the cylinder. Sensory hierarchy is language-first, scent-second, reflecting scribe’s vocation. Spatial choreography clean: phonograph → cylinder → vellum → ink drop sequence tracks without drift. Final image of roots humming the city’s future is environment charging closure. No credibility breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is the story’s engine: melting-ice walls that sing seed-lullabies physically enable the vortex andmirror the thaw of frozen time. Object-as-setting (copper basin, acorn cap) constrains every beat—its disappearance triggers the clock-turning rain. Sensory hierarchy follows Mira’s seed-saver gaze: bark texture, soil scent, mist temperature. Spatial choreography stays clean; no geography drifts. The starlight refracting into “ribbons of green hope” is an earned final image that reweights the entire atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    “Driftwood ribs and glass panes” plus wind pressure on skin anchor the aerial sanctuary; the bell tower’s spine as sensor bridge is tactile and specific. Weather readings and adhesive cure time tether abstract atmosphere to bodily stakes. Final image—bell answering only when exact humidity/temperature met—lets environment dictate choice. Micro-setting (silver filament rope) charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    Weathered stone, copper tubes, and cracked floor function as micro-setting that literally reflects star-stories; the lantern acts as portable environment that constrains every move. Sensory hierarchy is janitor-centric—hums, cracks, phosphorescent pulse—never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. Final amber wash across cracks is the image that recharges prior motif, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.7)
    Oasis is sketched through scorched beekeeping debris—cracked hive, withered melon, ash-sigh—each detail double-tasking as memory and tomb. Micro-setting succeeds: the stained glass box literally refracts the ghosts, so environment becomes tool that charges final image. Spatial choreography is minimal yet coherent; no impossible moves. Weather is implied but not exploited for pressure; still, selective sensory economy satisfies short-form density.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    The emerald silo’s metal panes and the hourglass beneath the foundation are tactile, choice-guiding objects that charge the final map-image; environment literally intersects with action (“threads traced a path that intersected with the silo’s emerald walls”). Selective sensory hierarchy—“dust-laden valley,” “ceramic skin chipped”—keeps description lean yet atmospheric. Spatial choreography stays clean as Mara brushes dust and clicks fragment into groove.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lagoon, reeds, mud, feather, amber light are filtered through the poet’s synesthetic bias; every visual note refracts back to “woven dawns.” Micro-setting (feather on lily) literally steadies the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no white-room lapses.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is the antagonist: chlorophyll-bleeding stone pillars that literally breathe and pulse with copper. “Petrified trees” and “conductive tendrices” compress architecture into organism, forcing Mara’s tool choices. Spatial choreography stays clean—wire coil → mica shimmer → chest pressure—so environment steers physiology. The temple orchard functions as micro-setting that charges the final image; remove it and the stakes collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rainwashed tower, ivy-wrapped sculptures, and wet-stone scent are vivid, selective, and filtered through Arin’s chemist-eye. Setting constrains action: the courtyard path funnels the pilgrimage, the slab of cracked marble becomes the lab bench for the amber reveal. Micro-setting (amber vial) charges the final image. One minor over-map: “bronze quiet” is repeated enough to edge toward motif-catalog, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    Jetty, rust-patched cart, and phosphorescent algae are tactile, selective, and return charged in the final glow. The narrow ribbon of timber physically constrains every step, while the reef-death aftermath supplies the moral context. One micro-setting—the seed box—reprises as the ritual object that seeds the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Scrapyard towers, rust grit under paws, and prism-cast spectrum hues give tactile, non-visual weight; every descriptor doubles as action cue (glass rotates, dust sings). The leaf-as-micro-setting constrains the final choice—its copper veins literally pulse, forcing Rook’s renunciation. Spatial choreography is flawless: half-buried kiosk, collapsed door, wax cradle track cleanly. Environment mirrors internal shift: amber wasteland brightens to violet-tinted sky after the leaf is resealed, charging the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    The deck, river of light residue, and violet-ash sky are sketched with economy; every sensory touch is filtered through the narrator’s cartographer gaze. The compass applique doubles as micro-setting—its warming metal and vibrating needle ground spatial/temporal disorientation in a tactile object that charges the final alignment. Environmental details evolve (flicker-out → silent towers → dilated breath), guiding the emotional cadence rather than pausing for backdrop. One minor slip: “glass cradle” and “river of light” risk mixing metaphors, but the imagery coheres under the lyric pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.3)
    Ice, altitude, and twilight are filtered through Lysander’s artisan gaze; every detail (velvet coat, brass lid, melt-water ink) either constrains tactics or charges the final thaw. The spire itself functions as micro-setting—its ledge, gears, and frost dictate pacing and bodily risk. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over postcard vistas. Environment is not backdrop; it is the antagonist that melts at cost.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.1)
    Whispering gallery is sketched with selective sensory strokes—ribbons of light, dust that clings to stone—each filtered through Mira’s quest for erased gestures. The missing-pawn board functions as micro-setting that constrains her method: she must walk its squares to spell words, so the emptiness literally shapes her choreography. Echo and penumbra are used as active environmental agents, inhaling/exhaling, curling protectively; space responds to her inscription. The final image—scroll on dark square beneath traveling shadow—recharges the luminous-absence motif with undeniable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.1)
    The mountain-store is sketched with selective, sense-driven strokes—pine-resin-ink, vellum that pulses like skin—each detail tethered to Lira’s perceptual bias rather than tourist inventory. Micro-setting (the stone, the feather, the mercury-book) functions as tactile terrain: the stone’s grain and the feather’s whisper constrain how she reads and therefore how she moves. Spatial choreography stays coherent: she drifts, finds the corridor, opens the book; no floating impossible shelves. Environment charges the final image—mountain lungs expand only because prior sensory bricks were laid.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.1)
    Time-frozen village, lightning-lull, and platinum corridors create a tight, dream-logic stage that filters every choice. The tapestry’s frayed threads literally gate progress, satisfying the 9+ constraint. Sensory economy is good—sound is "muted," wind "never moved"—but the repeated "woven hush" phrase edges toward motif overuse without new informational weight.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Bone towers, chalk dust, and refracted sunrise shards are tactile and omnipresent; the canyon’s echo literally bends the verses that seal forgiveness. Micro-setting (Mara’s paint-smeared fingertips, the glowing mural) constrains her final gesture, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across the communal circle.

    The acid sea, ticking gears, and pockmarked statue function as micro-setting: every described surface feeds the kintsugi metaphor and mirrors her voids. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered—corrosive mist on skin, gear-pulse underfoot. The workshop’s iron floor and prow-mounted statue constrain her movement and supply the literal canvas for the closing light-seep. Environment is not backdrop; it is the crucible that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Environment is vivid, selective, painterly: weathered boards, brine-scented air, stalactites as “shattered mirror” echo the cracked mirror without overt symbolism. The quay, cave, and oasis each supply distinct sensory palette and constrain movement—tidal exit, narrow tunnel, enclosed pool—so spatial choreography is clean. The painted shell recurs as micro-setting/object that charges the final image, clearing the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Environment is immaculately filtered through Mara: “cool as moonlit water” is her perceptual scale, not tourist gush. The brass lantern, stone balcony, and cracked cork are micro-settings that constrain her reach; the cork’s final glint literally refracts the beam, charging the closure image. Weather (post-heat-wave warmth) hums against skin and steams the jasmine, guiding the scent plume. Spatial choreography is crisp: edge-of-balcony, rudder turn, boat anchoring at cliff foot—all legible.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Signal station as micro-setting is superbly tactile: cracked walls, flickering consoles, reclaimed wiring—every prop alters tactics. The censer foot’s moonlit patina literally guides wiring decisions, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single location; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ravine-orchard is rendered through motion—roots on cliffs, storm-slapped leaves, slick bark under boots—so setting constrains footing and hiding tactics. Sensory hierarchy respects the forager’s gaze: moss caps, truffle shapes, brine on ground. Weather is not backdrop but immediate threat that justifies the moss-seal trick. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the single clearing; no floating bodies.</answer>

    <comment>Dominant stake—can Mara install the eye as communal mirror without being killed or exposed—signalled early. Escalation is one-step: confession → smugglers freeze → she plants eye; no further tightening, but the lens is causal and the moment reweights options. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: loss of secrecy, exposure of greed. A second beat of push-back would have lifted tension into high band.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Opal dock surface, mist, nautical twilight, and Edelweiss construe a micro-setting that literally guides his method (gaps match petal spacing). Sensory economy favors touch/vibration over visual catalog. Weather and tide affect timing of lamp lighting. Final image re-uses dock as memory beacon; environment charges closure directly.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    Moss-clad village, parchment scent, amber-fissure, star-inked maps—details are selective, sensory, and filtered through Elian’s dealer gaze. The cavern and ants ground spatial choreography; creek-rise provides live metronome. Environment does not constrain tactical choice, so 9-band gate fails, but atmosphere is integral to the lyric escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    “Ember grotto / cobalt grotto” twin motif is vivid, senses balanced, and reappears charged in the final image, just squeaking past 9-test. Spatial choreography is dream-logic loose—no floor plan—but given lyric mode, acceptable. Selective detail (“air tasted of iron and old rain”) efficiently sets tone without catalog bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.3)
    “Ember nexus at twilight” is vividly atmospheric; heat-as-memory rule is learned through action. Shell-as-micro-setting constrains the final image: its spiral literally holds the new light. Sensory selectivity is poetically skewed but drifts toward symbol rather than choice-constraint. Meets 9+ gate by charging final image.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pine scent, cracked window, fire-flicker on birch grain: sensory selects serve the POV’s archivist mindset and tighten the cabin into a lived-in tool rather than postcard. The scroll’s fibrous warmth in the final palm-charge literally carries the reconfiguration, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial anchors remain steady; only the snow-grave briefly ghost-loose, but that disorientation is taught early and reclaimed at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.3)
    Brass gears, frost-paned light, and the clamp-screw’s ridges are rendered through Lena’s fingertip cartography, turning the bench into a micro-setting that constrains her movements and charges the final silver line. The shop’s measured drip synchronizes with her breath, anchoring time and supplying the cadence that the ending reconfigures—an exemplary fusion of body, tool, and atmosphere.

    Floating platform, moonstone tea set, and crystallizing quill form a micro-setting that actively constrains the ritual steps; spatial choreography is stable, sensory hierarchy reflects POV bias, and the final mist embrace recharges the opening silver hush.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sheet-music archive and orchard outside act as micro-setting polarity—archive’s sealed silence vs. imminent axe—guiding her decision to externalize apology into open air. Piano lid, stacked scores, blue glow of currents give tactile props that constrain ritual choreography. Sensory hierarchy favors sound/olfactory detail, reflecting exorcist’s professional bias. Final image of archive exhaling chord recharges the setting-as-witness, meeting 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    The temple library is not backdrop but interface: stone aisles breathe, tablets in non-languages press against her fingers, floor dissolves into star-map—each detail alters her gait and final step. Micro-setting (the dictionary’s humming pages) functions as tool and portal, charging the closure vortex. Spatial choreography remains exact as she walks outward while inward, distance measured in heartbeats. No slips; environment directly constrains the ritual and the final disappearance.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hydrau­lic clock station, fjord, and mantle key function as micro-setting: the razor-edged gears and tide-locked horizon physically constrain the ritual and charge the final image. Sensory triangulation (metallic scent, water breath, key chill) is filtered through profession-specific attention. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.5)
    Bioluminescent farm is sensuously anchored—caps "pulsed like soft lanterns," permeable walls "breathe moisture"—and the laser line literally uses the farm’s own palette to map intrusion, so setting actively supplies the solution. Spatial choreography is clean: from greenhouse compartment to rows to lower fields. No body-as-micro-setting, but the recurring light-beam functions as charged object. Meets 9+ gate: environment constrains the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.1)
    The candle-lantern’s mica pane doubles as micro-setting: its prism refraction literally steers her path when “flame kisses mica,” translating abstract probability into bodily move. Rain-washed library smell of “old paper and distant thunder” is selective and POV-biased, anchoring without catalogue. Subway tunnels inherit the library’s paper scent, maintaining sensory continuity across shards.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tunnel’s damp, rusted conduits and the glass disc’s firefly glints are filtered through Mara’s tuned-out attention, making the setting both external landscape and emotional tuning fork. The disc reappears with shifting light at each loop, charging the final image. One minor over-description: “ghostly arpeggios looping back on themselves like a question without answer” repeats the same idea in adjacent clauses.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Jetty, tide, salt-air, and starlight are filtered through archivist perception; each sensory note is selective and stakes the mood. The locket serves as micro-setting that charges the final image—its glass moon-glow anchors the covenant. Spatial track is clean; no environmental detail floats unmoored.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    The station’s swallowed platforms, green curtain of ivy, and cracked comet-imprinted slab are tactile, specific, and steer the ivy-cutting puzzle that unlocks the fragment. Environment doubles as map and antagonist; pruning pattern = key. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound (rusted-hinge laugh, warm pebble) over tourist visuals. The lantern-as-capsule in the final image recharges the setting, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.1)
    Ultrasonic forest is not backdrop but active instrument: trees hum pathways, bark knots emit freeze-tone, ring vibrates in sympathy—each constrains her next step. Micro-setting collapses into the platinum ring and the wounded-oak bark she touches at climax; both objects re-charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys blind POV—sound, touch, magnetic pull—never resorting to visual cheat. Spatial choreography immaculate: she “places her hand on the bark” exactly where the crescendo locks, aligning ring axis and stillpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.1)
    The gravitational anomaly functions as micro-setting: it bends the pen, directs the rewriting, and charges the final soft hum. Sensory selection is POV-filtered—inkless nib glints like comet shard, garden-pruning metaphor mirrors data rows—integrated into action rather than catalogued. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. The lab never becomes white-room because the anomaly keeps squeezing thought and tool.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    The pier, camera, and moonlight function as micro-setting: the camera’s empty frame literally constrains how Arlen can “write” music, while the dock’s wooden plank receives the lens-shaped scar that Lira later decodes. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Arlen notices wind temperature and gull angle because they are notation. Spatial choreography is pristine: camera angle, hand shapes, and water ripples track causally. The harbor never lapses into postcard; every luminous detail is recruited into the score.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.7)
    The sandstone archive, scorched circle, and bronze box are sketched with sensory economy; the tapestry acts as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. The environment constrains choice—only fire can reveal the hidden niche—satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sound-wave garden is never catalogued; instead, details (“crystal leaves,” “bronze stones,” “lily that pulsed”) emerge only as Lira interacts with them, so environment constrains every beat of her drumming. The auric lagoon doubles as micro-setting and reflective tool, its surface literally mirroring forgotten lives and forcing her stance shift. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single platform/pond. Selective sensory economy—fragrance of vibrating blossoms, auroral hues—keeps description tethered to her perceptual bias rather than tourist spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    Container stacks function as micro-setting: the seam-split wall and tunnel are tactile resources that change Milo’s options. Storm static narrows auditory perception to “faint as a moth’s wing,” guiding his next move. Geography remains coherent; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.5)
    Cobalt dock, rain-slick planks, mirrored glare, and dental mirror form a tight micro-setting that actively constrains the choreography of light. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“hush that stretched like fog”). The mirror-as-tool evolves from prop to loom to lens, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no impossible positions or prop drift.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.1)
    Cobalt-library mist, magnetic grotto, and amber window-light are vividly atmosphered; the grotto’s metallic tug literally constrains later communal action (pulls hearts → saplings). Sensory triad (dust motes, pine scent, reflected marble) is selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography stays intact across the single scene. Minor slip: “synchronized window displays across town” is named before we know how one woman could achieve this, a plausibility wobble but not a full break.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    “Sublittoral fringe” and “phosphorescent algae” are not tourism labels; they guide Mara’s footing (slippery dock) and later color the cliff ascension, constraining her path. The whale’s call is rendered as physical vibration in wrist-bone, making environment somatic. Micro-setting (scrimshaw whale-eye) functions as portable horizon that literally unlocks the tower crystal—environment made artifact. Final image of dawn-glistening calm recharges the same sensory palette, now internalized.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Wind-turbine shadows act as living set, rhythmically slicing the floor and forcing Mara to time her strokes; the cedar block literally constrains how thin the baton can go, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she smells decay, hears low hymn, sees only what the blades let through. Micro-setting (cedar, bouquet, cracked porch) repeatedly alters her tactics; no static postcard filler.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cobalt atrium, quartz colonnade, and frozen lake function as a single micro-setting whose evolving hue and resonance directly guide the poet’s stride; the final amber glow is inseparable from the closure image. Sensory hierarchy favors sound and color over spatial exactitude, matching the POV’s synesthetic bias. Selective detail (“lantern-moth hush”) avoids catalog excess; each descriptor re-weights the boundary motif. Environment is active instrument, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    The courtyard’s mirrored shards, furnace breath, and reed’s metallic sigh are filtered through Selene’s synesthetic bias, constraining her color-bartering tactics. Glass surfaces evolve from reflecting sunrise to sprouting new flowers, integrating setting into the final image with causal specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.1)
    The lab is rendered through sonic synaesthesia—copper coils, carbide lens, crystal chimes—each object constraining the next step; the carbide lens literally refracts choice into audible color. Golden shadows act as both lighting and emotional register, charging the final fade-out. Spatial choreography stays clean; no floating props. Micro-setting (lamp, chimes) doubles as setting and tool, directly enabling the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dome, brass lenses, and furnace breathe with selective sensory hierarchy; jeweler’s eye for metal and patina grounds every detail. The origami cranes function as micro-setting-objects that constrain placement and sight-lines; their paper-skin evolves from artifact to constellation. Spatial choreography stays clean: slotting a crane into a telescope, silver thread spooling to the balcony, moonlight as solvent for the rose. Only the city’s “forgotten gardens” remain off-page abstraction; inside the dome, environment is tactile and choice-shaping.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Environment, tool, and weather are one system: the brass tables, rust, and rain song constrain her quiet concentration; the measuring tape’s scarred metal becomes the micro-setting that literally charts the stakes. Spatial choreography is immaculate—kneeling, tracing, journal entry, window—all track. Sensory balance favors haptics and sound over visual catalog. The loft never feels like a postcard because every surface resists or yields to the tape.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archive’s breathing walls, shifting floor echoes, and parchment scent create tactile immediacy; the bronze prism’s light is used as a tool that constrains movement (must avoid patterns) and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is tight across the single corridor scene. The 9+ gate is missed only because the prism’s physical rules remain metaphorical rather than operationally specific.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.0)
    The blooming-above-clouds library is sketched with lush, sensory strokes (“soft perfume of rain-kissed clouds”) and the micro-setting of the river stone pedestal functions as tactile anchor. Spatial choreography is dreamlike but coherent; no anchor contradictions. However, the environment never actively constrains his choices; it merely mirrors mood, so it caps below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    The workshop’s “humming tools,” warm stone, and drifting mist are selectively sketched and filtered through Mara’s tactile priorities. The chameleon’s shifting skin functions as micro-setting that constrains her method—she must match its hue with honesty—charging the final merged color. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. While the hillside beyond is generic, the immediate bench-stone-vial triad carries the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    Tower, tunnel, moss, coffee-mug micro-setting all constrain movement and supply ritual props; hourglass base must match the root’s ring indentation, a spatial hinge that decides success. Frosted glass—>cleared glass tracks environmental state change causally. Sensory economy favors touch and sound (damp breath, meteor hush) over visual catalog. Selective meteor imagery links sky and sand, charging the sunrise closure. No credibility glitches; choreography tight as body curls around root for alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Projection booth, velvet seats, rusted tin box—details are specific, sensory, and POV-filtered (“dust of forgotten reels swirled like slow snow”). The cinema architecture folds into the metaphysical labyrinth, so setting literally constrains the psychic search path. Micro-objects—wax-sealed letters, torn film strip—are handled repeatedly, their evolving state tracked (“celluloid frames melt into liquid light”). No orientational drift; space stays coherent even as it expands into galaxies inside her mind.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.3)
    Setting is micro-scaled to body, archway, instrument—exactly right for 700-word piece. Cold stone, violet/emerald shadows, brass etchings tactilely guide choices (he settles to cool pulse, aligns sighting tube). Aurora-lit archway constrains the only possible theatre and later re-emerges dimmed to ratify cost, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography immaculate; no world-rule dump, all learned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glowing dune, chess clock, and frozen terminal function as micro-settings that physically constrain action: the dune’s lattice must be charmed to unlock the archive, the clock’s frozen hands must be aligned, and the ash-blanketed horizon supplies the only temporal cue. Sensory selection stays urgent—violet petals, amber scar, cold metal pulse—each charging the final image of azure sand learning to breathe.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mechanical rainforest is tactile—pistoned moss, brass trunks—yet never catalogues; every gear-leaf and copper breath constrains movement and charges the closing amber map. Spatial logic is dream-solid: the hollow-bunker, higher branch, and coiled engine occupy legible proximities that shift only during translocation. Micro-setting (the gear) literally pilots the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sea-mist, pebble pier, and lantern weave a hush that is both spatial and sonic; the shoreline lullaby is heard as texture, not soundtrack. Micro-setting (ticket punch in palm, surf-sucked leash) substitutes for wide geography without ever floating the scene. Weather and tide act—moon-shy turning, sunrise gilding—but do not constrain tactical choice. The veiled ridgeway remains evocative more than obstacle; stronger physical impediment would have lifted the 9-gate.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cobalt walls, frost-laced tiles, and the bolt’s dull iron create a micro-setting that constrains choice—cold enforces stillness. Spatial choreography is clean: bolt placed on step → stair glows → bellhop ascends. Sensory hierarchy favors visual chill, mirroring thematic freeze. The fortress-as-body metaphor is sustained without overt symbolic nudging.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Library breathes through parchment scent, melting shelves, stone hymn—details are filtered via the titan’s slowed-time perception and constrain movement. Iron pellet’s etched wavering line turns from prop to truth engine, re-weighted at collapse. Spatial choreography remains exact; bodies/props track. No environment-charged final tactic, so capped at 8.8 per 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    The station’s skeletal hum, steel table, and tide-breath create a micro-setting that literally dictates method (tapping) and final data alignment. Sensory hierarchy is Mara-biased: color-lost coral, salt hush, metronomic steel—every detail filters through her bereaved attention. The atlas fragment evolves from prop to tool to cipher, its tear edge handled twice on-page. Spatial choreography is clean: pier–table–console form one contiguous crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.1)
    The repair bay is rendered with selective, sensory economy—rusted cathedral, cracked concrete, broken hulls—each detail doubling as emotional analogue. The stone circle beneath the concrete is a micro-setting that literally powers the climax; the opera glasses act as tool-setting hybrid, refracting light and glyph. Spatial choreography remains stable; bodies track cleanly from crate to console to window. Environment constrains the final image: sunrise reflected in reclaimed hearts, not distant stars—setting reweights the thematic telescope from cosmic to communal.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Volcanic hot-spring micro-setting is vivid—steam, basalt, geysers—yet never constrains action; characters move unimpeded, no temperature or terrain hazard alters tactics. Kite, moss, amber function as charged objects; kite script mechanics remain abstract, limiting integration. Sensory palette favors geothermal imagery; selective and atmospheric, but spatial choreography stays fuzzy (distance between pool/embryo niche never fixed). Passes 9+ gate for object-as-setting but capped by lack of environmental pressure on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.1)
    Arboretum and body-as-setting constrain movement: wind tugs needles across skin, bench placement dictates pause, cliff edge forces final stance. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she catalogs scent, texture, breath in priority order. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from shaded walk to stone bench to cliff lip. Environment is not a postcard; it supplies the tactile cues that trigger her somatic safety markers.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lighthouse-library is evoked through salt-fogged glass, bowing shelves, algae glow—details that double as psychic mirror for Elian. Micro-setting rule met: the broken box and spiral of cards function as tactile terrain that literally steers his steps toward stairwell. Selective sensorium—ink pots, sea-smell, paper rot—filters through painter’s eye, never tourist catalog. Final phosphorescence on stone walls recharges opening “luminescent ache,” locking image to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Desert wind, stone alcoves, chrome drone, bleached-bone skin—details are selective and POV-filtered. The ink’s vanishing scent in the final line recharges the visual motif, meeting the 9+ gate for setting-as-final-image; still, spatial choreography is vague (where exactly is the spiral released?), keeping it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.1)
    The cryogenic library is sketched with sensory economy—“rows of frozen vellum rose like skeletal trees…low vibrations of dormant networks”—and every detail is filtered through Maren’s archivist eye. Snow, marble conduit, and sigil glow are returned in the final green-shoot image, completing the micro-setting loop. Spatial choreography stays stable; no impossible moves. The environment constrains choice (only the cracked column still pulses, forcing her insertion point) and charges the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Glass dome, amber lantern glow, thorn-guard roses, and half-buried canvas scrap are tactile, lived-in, and POV-filtered (“rough fibers”). Micro-setting rule met: the scrap beside the fountain alters the water’s pulse and is handled in multiple beats. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis—wind tremor, curled thorns—then widens to moon-pattern. No white-room gaps; spatial choreography clean as Lira and boy circle perimeter laying scraps. Slight overripe phrase “sunrise of amber fire” is the only moment that edges purple; still, it mirrors prior “tranquil blaze,” maintaining pattern coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sound-wave garden, rail spike, and moon-tide satisfy micro-setting rule: spike charges the final image and constrains the veil-piercing act.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.9)
    Observatory is sketched with selective, echoing, glass-and-steel detail; telescope pipes “hummed with a low resonance that reminded her of the rustle of newspaper pages” tightly fuses profession to place. Spatial choreography is clean: stair, dome, console, slot remain trackable. Weather (“soft pewter,” “pale clouds”) mirrors theme without overt symbol; the environment does not physically obstruct or resource Mira, so it enriches rather than constrains—hence the 9+ gate for environmental constraint is not tripped, capping at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is the laboratory-body hybrid: cracked floorboards, ash-painted ceiling, antique desk drawers, all filtered through Lyra’s sonic obsession. Micro-objects—amber, recorder, silver needle—function as environment that constrains every tactical move; spatial choreography stays clean as she stitches and slips letters. Sensory economy favors hearing over visual clutter; rustle, hum, hush recur with purpose. Weather is metaphoric but consistent (meteor hush), and no factual errors break plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.1)
    Grotto condensation, echo choreography, and the hovering tile flake create tactile micro-setting that constrains her chalk and mandala geometry; environment literally channels the hush. Selective sensory hierarchy (sound of vowel-hum, lilac hue on mist) mirrors her shifting attention. Spatial tracking stays clean: tile lifts, mist curls, travelers enter later—each change causally tagged to the tile’s release. Setting charges the final image without ever becoming a postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Environment is spare yet charged: soot-gray stones, warm-cold air, chipped tessera—each detail filters through post-fire trauma and frames the plaza as crucible. The mosaic stepping-stone is micro-setting at its best; its uneven surface literally guides the rename act and constraints every pilgrim footfall thereafter. Sky fracture and amber slivers evolve with emotional beats, culminating in the final living diagram. No superfluous tourist catalog; every sensory note earns its place and either enables or mirrors choice.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    The velvet curtains, copper coin, and lantern-apples are tactile, selective, and POV-filtered through the ghost’s synesthetic ears/eyes. Spatial choreography remains airy—no fixed distances—but the translucent stage under the canopy functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Weather is the rising nostalgia itself, a scent-temperature that modulates with each chord. Environment does not constrain tactics, so 8.8 gate is not cleared.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Studio, body, and geode form one micro-setting that constrains every choice; LED arrays and cracked windowpanes return to charge the ending image. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but that is vocation-accurate. Spatial choreography remains coherent as she “traces its internal fractures with light” onto her own skin. Weather analogue (“sun-dappled” vs. “neon ribbons”) mirrors her skeptical-to-wonder arc without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sensory selection is POV-driven and purposeful: scent, pressure, breath recorded by tool; droplets as lanterns; elm veins aligning with mineral filaments—every detail feeds the mapping act. The cave’s breathing gusts and amber shimmer constrain droplet flight and timing, integrating setting into action. Micro-setting (leaf, basin, tool) directly shapes the final beacon image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    The amber walls, buttons, and jar form a micro-setting that actively constrains every beat; button placement literally reshapes the echo’s song. Sensory hierarchy is POV-tight—Mara notices dust weight, sunrise seal, metal warmth—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless: buttons move from floor → map → river pattern → echo discharge, all tracked beat-by-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.5)
    Bluff, mist, snow, and altar are rendered with cinematic specificity; cold breathes, vapors swirl, glyphs vanish—details filter through the agent’s guarded perception and guide his nightly ritual. Environment acts micro-setting: snow as writing surface, mist as concealment, spring thaw as ticking clock—each materially shapes the coding method and descent. Only the valley interior tilts toward generic enchanted grove; nonetheless, the final image of crystal spring reflecting sky charges the renewal beat effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.1)
    Micro-setting triumph: the yarn needle functions as portable river-altar; its fine tip vibrating in palm supplies tactile anchor that outshines wider geography. Fog, mist, spindrift recur as one mobile texture, never catalogued but filtered through Arlen’s craft-eye (“layers like old manuscripts”). Environment constrains only lightly—visibility narrows, yet no tactical fallout—so misses 9+ gate. Still, sensory economy is exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.0)
    Abandoned apiary, salt-crust tiles, phototropic glass, and cactus shade are not backdrop but tactical objects: the salt ridges guide Mara’s foot; the glass must be physically rotated to catch sun-angles; hive walls vibrate under fingertips. Micro-setting (lantern surface, hive lip) constrains the final placement decision. Sensory triangulation (light-heat-hum) mirrors timeline fracture, charging the closure image. Geographic coherence maintained across lantern-carry choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    The moonlit harbor is rendered through POV-filtered selection (oil lanterns that “sputter,” gulls “usually raucous” now stilled), and the fire-escape micro-setting literally constrains every move. Sensory hierarchy is respected: scent of sea-mist is admitted only when Mara “feels the cool mist curl,” tying setting to body. One missed chance: the “old rosebush” is only a visual cue, never tactile or olfactory, so it fails the 9+ tool/body gate. Still, spatial choreography is flawless across the vertical descent and ledge planting.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tidal-above-clouds library is evoked through kelp-shelves, humming marble, and a stone circle that literally vibrates choice into script—setting actively enables the climax. Micro-setting (the brass sundial) is handled in six distinct beats, its mirror-state evolving from passive catch to active beacon that recharges the final sunrise. Sensory hierarchy privileges weightless motion and haptic hum, filtering perception through Mira’s researcher bias. Spatial choreography tracks her ascent onto the mist-stair without drift or contradiction.

Grain-silo geography is sketched through sound propagation rather than mapped distance, but spatial coherence is maintained—sound travels, workers emerge, bridges span. Sensory hierarchy favors aurality over visual, matching the choral premise. The tower’s stained-glass starlight returns in the final image, recharging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.8)
    The canyon is rendered through Aria’s tool-use and body—basalt column as lab bench, fissures as synapses—so micro-setting qualifies and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: engineer-noticed “liquid quartz” moonlight, circuitry wind. Spatial choreography is clean: portable lab, mirror alignment, palm-press, exit silhouette. Environment constrains the tactic: stone hum answers only when the shard-neurons map onto it. Weather is lunar spill that literally powers the reflection, so setting is agent, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.1)
    City Library, serpentine grotto, and the prism of her skin are cleanly tracked; spatial choreography survives the gravity flip without jarring slips. Sensory economy is strong—vapor “glittered like shattered glass” filters through her archivist gaze. The grotto’s upward-swirling water is the one detail that constrains her timing, anchoring the climax; micro-setting succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grove is sensory-rich (“leaves whispered like distant flutes,” “quills glistening like tiny bells”) and every detail is filtered through Auris’s musical ear. Micro-setting—crack within torso, reed bridging porcelain—provides tactile workspace that determines his method. No spatial drift; light, moss, dapple all track cleanly. Weather stays static, but that quietude serves the “intensely quiet” premise rather than feeling omitted.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rust dunes, magnetic pulses, and stone dent are filtered through chess-perceptual bias; every descriptor doubles as board metaphor. Micro-setting (stone in palm) constrains the final rook placement, charging the image. Spatial choreography is ghost-clean—no drift. Meets 9- gate: object charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    Workshop rendered as living instrument—iron ribs, copper-lavender vibrations—filters through pacifist’s synesthetic bias; space breathes with him. Micro-setting (diary clasp) physically transmits memory via frequency, constraining the tuning action. Selective sensory hierarchy (sound over sight) mirrors mission. No spatial drift; stars and fireworks supply coherent temporal anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.3)
    The treetop village is rendered through kinesthetic detail—ancient vines, warm bark, swirling canopy—integrated with Lira’s scent-biased attention. The hollowed birch and dangling terrariums act as micro-settings that constrain her ritual choices. Weather and spatial choreography remain coherent; the final image of the canopy sway in “slow, deliberate dance” recharges the motif. No prop or environmental element distorts physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.1)
    Floating rock arches, upward river, phosphorescent roots—each detail is filtered through pilot attention and later constrains flight path or probe placement. The moss-veined bough and star-metal glint function as micro-settings that decide where the probe lands. Final basin glow re-anchors the arches as the renewal node. Spatial choreography stays clean: craft, river, branch, basin track without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    The container labyrinth is not backdrop but instrument: canyon-walls channel drafts; tarp threads become a wind-tapestry; the compass-rose patch aligns with the emergent vector. Micro-setting (anemometer, rusted control box, red needle) constrains every tactical move. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mara’s professional filter—velocity first, sound second, touch third—keeping description lean. Final image: containers sway, shadows “like hopeful fingers,” environment literally re-tuned by her survey—setting charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ice cavern is not backdrop but instrument: fissures open under literal sonic paint, the bell’s resonance “straightens the very air,” and the amber sheet’s lingering warmth supplies the final image’s charge. Spatial choreography stays clean—aurora bands slip down, echoes travel, the sheet is unwrapped then re-sheathed—so environment, body, and tool jointly constrain every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Thunder-echo range is never exposition-dumped; we learn it through Mara’s attuned ears and the driftwood catching thunder-echoes. Canyon hush is the dominant sensory channel, narrowing perception to vibration and breath; the gilded flute becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image. One minor orient flicker: “stone shelter” is mentioned before we know we’re on a ridge, but the driftwood path quickly rectifies spatial clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.0)
    Topaz dust refracting equations through the fragment is a micro-setting that directly enables the climactic reweighting; the dome’s breathing walls mirror her own press rhythm, tying environment to final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography stays clean in the single-room scene.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orchard planet, floating arches, sapphire fruit, and copper grove are filtered through the smith’s reverent gaze; detail is selective, never tourist list. The mine shaft glyphs glow azure exactly when his palm offers the memory, fusing setting to choice. The forge-under-arch micro-setting returns to charge the final image, its echoing stone a resonant drum for the blade’s first note. One slip: “violet dawns” appears once then vanishes, slightly under-using the chromatic motif that could have threaded pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    The repair bay is never a postcard: rusted hulls whisper, flickering fluorescents bleed, cracked floor embeds the shard—details are filtered through Lira’s cartographer gaze and constrain her movements. Spatial choreography is flawless across the two-reality shift; bodies hover in coherent suspension. The shard itself functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when it dissolves into star-specks.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    The lantern room’s broken panes, cold slab, and iron ribs are tactile and selective; the sea-glass micro-setting literally charges the final image by glowing inside his coat.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.1)
    Emerald lighthouse, basalt steps, phosphorescent algae—details are vivid, selective, and filtered through Mira’s sea-attuned gaze. The green stone “humming with forgotten tides” marries setting to theme without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography stays clean across lantern-lift and beam-redirect. The lighthouse itself does not constrain a late tactical choice, so 9+ gate unmet, but the reef-hidden darkness functions as micro-setting that the beam must steer toward, satisfying the lower-bar test.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Floating rock tea house, amber mist, and crystal-singing garden are sketched with economy and kept tactile: Lira grips cool stone with bare feet, swings dye bottles, sets wing on loom. Each detail either guides access (sun trails) or constrains action (loom threads). The valley rules stay consistent—sun trails are readable only with donor heart—so world logic is learned through use, not exposition. Micro-setting passes 9-gate: the loom’s moonlight threads charge the final image and foreclose paths.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stormlit tower, stone slab, cracked shutters, and the oak’s roots are economically re-used anchors that constrain motion—Eli must climb, balance the sextant, feel brass cold. The moonbeam is both atmosphere and tool: it literally mends glass and metaphorically mends grief, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating props. The micro-setting (sextant, grid filament) doubles as environment that shapes tactics, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    Micro-settings—shattered throne, cracked porcelain, tea steam—are filtered through the noticer’s biased attention and constrain his tactile choices; jasmine-and-oolong scent lingers to charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting-as-tool.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.1)
    The library’s frost exhales actively: cloud-shards pierce the ceiling, spines hum data, marble pedestal drinks light—every surface pressures or enables her measurement ritual. Micro-setting (the quartz-veiled silence) doubles as both atmosphere and instrument, directly constraining the calibration tactic and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating books or impossible balconies. Because the environment literally transduces frequency into glow, it passes the 9+ gate by shaping the closing constellation.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rotting-pier market is evoked through salt-ferment air, driftwood stalls, and the “rumors that tasted like iron,” selective sensory triage under stealth pressure. The lanterns-as-setting constrain the climax: their sudden absence disables the rival crew and reweights the truce. Micro-object—the brass fob—functions as portable setting, charging the final negotiating table image. Spatial choreography stays clean: scout lunges, Lila sidesteps, rope coil is tracked tether-to-throw.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Bluff, aurora, and ring form a micro-setting trio that actively steers the compass; lavender scent as “soft binary code” is a sensory hook that returns in the closing cadence. Spatial choreography stays clean: Arin at edge, carriers gathered, spores drifting, ring pressed to tongue—no floating bodies. The environment constrains the final calibration, satisfying the 9+ gate. One hairline slip: “dying star” skin is never re-anchored to physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Crystal walls glittering “like frozen starlight” is selective, POV-colored, and immediately constrains attention; the mirror–light geometry later reconfigures the lock itself. Spatial choreography is clean: canvas placed, reflection angled, shards tracked without drift. Body-as-micro-setting works: trembling fingers smudge charcoal into stone, literalizing her fusion with cave. Final aurora is environment-as-consequence, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    Greenhouse glass, crystal cavern, and the postal plate all constrain tactical choices (she must speak truth to keep the fragment lit; she must enter the cavern to retrieve lost voices). The toxic sky is not just backdrop—it actively tightens lungs and forces the final vent act. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she notices ink shimmer and vine scent before civic slogans. Spatial choreography holds: the workshop, hidden doorway, vent exit track cleanly without impossible geography.

    “Whispering bluff above the clouds” is atmospherically anchored and filtered through the tuner’s artisanal eye; wind, sunrise angle, and copper glare constrain when he oils joints. The iceberg fragment functions as micro-setting/object that charges the final image—its glint becomes the visual note of wonder. Spatial choreography is clean; gulls, neighbors, shadows trace one continuous terrace. Slight over-milked “glisten” iterations risk purple tinge but never stall motion.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    The desert-rose dome is rendered through heat-throbbed glass, magnetic flicker, and reflected fire that “mosaics molten sky,” all filtering through Vira’s sensor priorities. The breathing wood box functions as micro-setting: its pulsing grain constrains her code-whispering tactic and later physically merges with the vine. Spatial choreography is clean—no floating bodies or impossible reaches. One nit: “evening wind whispered” is generic; a sharper desert-specific detail would seal 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.0)
    Courtyard dawn is more than postcard: the wet-stone incense air, lantern flicker, and puddle-reflected sky filter Mara’s selective attention and set the pitch for communal quiet. The locket’s “pulse” and the mailbox’s rust act as micro-settings that constrain her choices—she must listen, not pry. Spatial choreography stays clean; no floating bodies or impossible props.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sunken lab, copper braid, kelp-ink, hangman’s dice—each object is tactile and kinesthetic; dice function as micro-setting that constrains her dance steps and final compartment release. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: dice on altar → spun in air → clatter → compartment → crystal → journal pocket. Sensory hierarchy favors sound (singing braid, clatter, Selene’s song) and bioluminescent sight, matching code-breaker occupation. Atmosphere of “mysterious familiarity” is sustained without generic water tropes; rusted steel and coral tiles are specific.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dock, tide-breath crystals, gravity pockets, and lantern brass are filtered through Mara’s professional attention; each detail later constrains action (boots dragged, wildflower pressed into spiral lock). Salt chamber micro-setting doubles as body-tool hybrid that charges the final image. No white-room gaps; spatial choreography clean from pier to fissure. Meets 9+ gate: lantern-tool recurs and reweights the closing glow.

    The brook-as-mirror, stone-as-launchpad, and wing-as-conduit physically constrain ritual placement; environment is not backdrop but instrumentation. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: pine scent and “moon’s pale grin” filter through a night-ritualist attuned to reflection and shimmer. Spatial choreography is flawless: wing-tip aligned to water, pulses travel outward, golden spill lands on stone then water. Micro-setting objects (stone, wing) charge the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rooftop garden as micro-setting is tactile—rusted rail, mossy bench, hummingbird feeder—each object brushed or traded, so environment constrains the only allowable intimacy. Meteor shower is not postcard spectacle; its intermittent strobe dictates the rhythm of disclosure and literally lights the sigil. The seal functions as portable architecture: its wax imprint lets brick grammar travel, charging the final image when Liora presses it to the air. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies track around the rosemary bush and neighbor balcony without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.5)
    The velvet garden is rendered with synesthetic richness (color as fabric, scent as sound) and stays consistently filtered through Lira’s attention. Micro-setting is the cracked seashell, whose broken glow is revisited at closure; however, it never physically constrains her movements or choices—she could still leave without it—so it charges the image symbolically, not tactically. Spatial choreography is clear in a single continuous scene. Weather/light shift from violet dusk to amber dawn is tracked cleanly and mirrors internal shift, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marble, aurora, and drip form a micro-setting that actively meters Liora’s strokes; the cold stone’s pulse is the metronome that calibrates her treason.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    Subarctic crater orchard is more than backdrop: the frost-kissed roots force slow motion, the ash mound supplies contrast for copper flare, dead branches become the parchment onto which light-veins are drawn. Every discarded shard’s position is tactile, spatial, and consequential—glass, wire, vellum are placed, not catalogued. Weather (the night’s held breath) functions as shared suspense with the world outside. Micro-setting = plate and ash pile—constrain her exact gestures and timing; the final inhale/exhale of trees recharges the initial frozen stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    The marble cavern is not backdrop but instrument: its veins, fissures, and domed architecture determine where Corin places plates, when the sun brushes the dome, and how echoes are funneled into the jar. Micro-setting (the crystal gear, the pedestal jar) constrains the final action; environment literally charges the last image as starlight dances across the crystal. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible positions. Selective sensory hierarchy (cool walls, low hum, luminous sound) mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sensory detail is textured and selective (mineral smoke, amber flame, constellation of tiny whales) but the grotto’s spatial logic stays floating: entrance, walls, floor, and crystal are re-shuffled without trackable positions. The lamp and calcifying droplets serve as micro-setting that charges the final sunrise glow, satisfying the 9+ gate, yet choreography remains impressionistic rather than choice-constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    Skylight loft, copper roofs, rain beads, and iron gouge are vivid, selective, and filtered through Mara’s circus-widow gaze; none feel touristy. The micro-setting of the carving blank and kettle steams serve as manipulable props that literally constrain her gesture and charge the final lantern image. Spatial choreography is clean—window, table, hearth track logically. Missing 9-band gate because no environmental detail forces a tactical trade-off under pressure.

    The kinetic lagoon’s metallic ripples and cracked brass platform constrain footing and mirror Mara's eroded drive; the camera wheel’s cracked barrel becomes the ritual conduit. Sensory triage is POV-driven—she notices rust, mist-whispers, not tourist vistas. Spatial choreography is clean: she stands, kneels, places the wheel, exits. The carousel’s golden-memory payoff recharges the early rust description, earning the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    Spatial anchors (dusty hull, cracked panel, main conduit) are vivid and guide her rerouting moves, satisfying the micro-setting gate. The sextant’s brass glint is returned in the final light, charging the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; no world-rule inconsistency. Penalty cap from Q2 keeps score ≤7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    The crystal slab literally guides inscription angle and catches first light to dictate when work begins; the sanctuary’s muteness enforces his preference for soundless craft. Micro-setting (quill, sliver of crystal, stone floor) constrains every gesture. Weather-petrichor is not backdrop but stimulus that re-activates attic memories. Final image of amber sunrise on clock face could not occur in any other place.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.7)
    The twilight canal, rusted lock, and brass sundial function as micro-setting: the lock’s frozen hinge literally blocks progress, the sundial’s shadow is the key, and the water’s surge erodes the false spires. Sensory triangulation—violet sky bruise, cool water song, warmed brass—anchors POV bias. Spatial choreography is flawless; we track barge, lock, gears, body in one tight cone of attention. The “Liar’s Cathedral” remains a off-page abstraction; because its rules are never tested in-scene, the environment-constraint gate for 9+ is barely missed.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    The golden dock, snow, and fog function as micro-setting that constrains visibility and pacing; the rope acts as tactile map, charging the final image when the spiral mirrors the seed constellation. Sensory selection stays biased to the collector’s tide-ear, no white-room syndrome. Fulgurite and kelp-chest are handled with consistent physical logic, anchoring the lyric flights.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    The garden as micro-setting constrains every tactic: the traveler must kneel on leaves, trace cracked statues, and project onto wilted blooms; the weft-thread functions as portable setting that re-lights the rose. Sensory economy is rigorous—damp amber air, bruised-violet sky—each filtering through the POV’s obituary lens. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.0)
    “Glassy fingers” stalactites and gear-cradle beneath a silver water thread are tactile, specific, and directly enable the egg’s incubation. Palace-stalactite geometry guides lighting and reverberation, charging the phoenix eruption. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible positions. Setting passes the 9+ gate by constraining the cradle placement and final image, but description occasionally overdrives into lyric surplus (“living sunrise”) that nicks clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    “Obsidian lagoon”/“black sand harvested from a volcanic beach” is specific, tactile, governs footing and memory. Tool/object-as-setting: coin-pier-sand junction constrains ritual and final sound propagation. Spatial choreography clean across shallow water walk, kneel, thread-pull. Sensory hierarchy favors heat/cold, shimmer/pulse—mirrors internal burn-to-calm without overt symbolism. Weather/cloud migration is causal, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    Setting is micro-specific: cracked basin, petrichor, moss-draped alley; each fountain stone is touched, not catalogued. The violet dusk and migrating geese function as clock and compass, directly constraining when/where Mara acts. Final image—constellation reflected in sky—recharges the cracked marble arch, proving environment can shift from ruin to mirror. One nip: “realistically imaginative spirit” is asserted of symbols rather than shown through Mara’s filtering senses.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is the story: nebula-garden, petals-as-lanterns, crystalline walls, pulsar axis. Sensory triage favors hush, slow drift, ribbon-light—all braided into action (gear placed, sonar released). The gear itself functions as micro-setting, constraining alignment and payoff; garden mist answers sonar, charging the final glow. Spatial choreography stays dream-coherent; no props teleport.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    Greenhouse glass, humidity, stone table, and shifting dusk light are tactile and filter through Eliam’s carver gaze; cracked panes and jasmine/metal scent anchor every beat. Spatial tracking stays coherent as butterflies converge at the arch and stones spiral outward. The ribbon river finale charges the central image, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting-object that constrains final form.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal obsidian ridge is more than backdrop: its black waves supply the salt that splits the rake, the ink-light that makes the inscriptions visible, and the cymbal-crash that amplifies the final cadence. Micro-setting inside the tower is equally tactile: bronze skin of the bob, iron cradle, spiral stairs that force Mara's breath to sync with gears. Sensory selection stays POV-filtered—she notices polish of metal, not tourist vistas—so environment guides motion and later glows with molten rose payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cobalt silo, sovereign case, and tapestry function as micro-settings that constrain handling (compartments reshape for parchment). Velveteen gloom is sustained through tactile diction (“soft darkness that wrapped each stone”). Starlight-to-drumbeat transmutation charges the final image. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.9)
    Obsidian spire, frozen lake, aurora, copper plates—details are sensory, selective, and tied to action. The lake surface as “mirror for the unknown” and the barley “reflecting the spire’s obsidian sheen” charge the final image. Micro-setting (kingfisher quill, copper mirrors) constrains tactics directly. A single anachronistic phrase—“solar collector”—lightly jars but is cued early enough.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.1)
    The ember alcove, mist, and radio dial function as micro-setting: the dial’s glow literally enables Mara’s night work and finally beams a public signal from the window, charging the last image. Dust particles evolve from inert to sonic storytellers, a lived-in tactile shift that alters environmental possibility. Sensory economy favors amber light, crackling static, and thistled texture—each returned at closure to echo the new audible dust. Spatial choreography is flawless: rooftop windows catch the broadcast, proving scale without white-room drift.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gallery’s forced-perspective architecture (“every step a slow surrender to perspective”) functions as an active constraint, bending the protagonist’s gait and attention; the shattered-porcelain mask is a micro-setting that refracts final light onto the walls, literally painting the closure image. Sensory selection is POV-driven—she notices “faint markings” and “creaking as if breathing” because they are ritual data. Spatial choreography is immaculate: she enters, centers, sprinkles, kneels, exits; no floating props. The setting evolves from mirage of safety to honest light, charging the Conceptual Repicing at exit.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sewer arches, bioluminescent algae, brass teeth of the cog—details are selective, filtered through the philosopher’s taxonomic gaze. The sunken city remains off-stage but is kept legible through dripping acoustics and sediment samples; micro-setting (cog-as-tool) constrains the final choice by dictating the cipher rhythm. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. One anachronism risk: “aqueducts” revived after total submersion—plausible under rule of controlled flooding, but not explicitly cued, a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.3)
    Velvet library, zither rosette, and autumn leaves form a single micro-setting that physically shapes the method—“subtracting noise” from the air. Rosette glimmer and leaf shadows are returned in the final image, charging the Charged Poise. Spatial choreography is light but coherent: podium, desk, curtains track cleanly. Weather is kept off-stage, appropriate to an interior crucible; sensory hierarchy favors hearing and sight, matching musical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    The greenhouse is handled as a tactile tool: copper kettle on solar fire, vines that respond to voice, rusted ribs that become ruby veins—environment literally constrains the synaptic rewiring. Sensory selection is biased by chef-perception (taste first, scent second, sight last) and evolves with urgency. Spatial choreography is clean: kettle → broth → seed → spores → canopy. The final image reuses the cracked dome, now glowing amber, charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lightning tower as micro-setting is tactile—rusted shelf, glass rods, velvet nest—each object handled under pressure. The lacquer box’s oily sheen and the matchbox hum give a sensory signature that charges the reveal. Spatial choreography is clean: Mara → office → tower core; drone hover anchors vertical scale. Weather is used (dusk melting into night) but only as tonal wash; it doesn’t constrain choices. Environment shapes final image—amber veins dripping like honey—meeting the 9+ gate by recharging the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bay, cottages, and pier are filtered through a synesthetic palette (“amber halos,” “salted lullaby”) that teaches the reader to read atmosphere as character. The orris shard functions as micro-setting: its milky speckles become a “tiny moon” that later irradiates the whole town, so environment literally constrains perception. Spatial choreography is clean—bench, cup, flower, windows—each object stays tagged and gains echo. No world-rule inconsistency; sensory hierarchy favors the narrator’s scent-oriented bias, fitting the perfumer lens.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.9)
    Phosphorescent currents, kelp arches, foxglight-veined ampoule—each sensory hook is filtered through the statue’s alien, mineral perception, giving the garden body-as-setting. Spatial choreography stays crisp: filament through crack → hidden chamber → bioluminescent mortar; the cracked arch constrains every later move. Environment is not backdrop but tool and antagonist, forcing the statue to repair stone with living light. The final mosaic wall is the setting reconfigured by the conflict, so the garden itself becomes the earned image.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    The staircase is no backdrop; its breathing marble and shifting incline physically constrain every tactic. Micro-setting rule met: the bronze frame / glass disc act as tools that alter probability and thereby motion. Sensory economy is tight—dim light, stone sigh—filtered through Aric’s mathematic-poetic gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    The greenhouse glass, moon-silver on leaves, and soot-stained city skyline filter every beat through sensory hierarchy; the moon-tipped brush functions as micro-setting that constrains Mara’s ritual and charges the courier’s finale. Selective detail—rain-collected rinse water, saffron hush—anchors mood without catalogue bloat. Spatial choreography is lean but clean; bodies track. Needed one more body-under-glass constraint to breach 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Grotto/waterfall functions as textured pressure: mist seeps into stone, dictates scent palette, and physically gates the hidden amphitheatre. Specificity is high—“emerald light refracted into the mist”—but spatial choreography is soft; crowd and stage positions blur. Sensory hierarchy favors smell over visual precision, matching refugee social priorities. Tool (lens) and micro-setting (bread initials) constrain final ritual, satisfying 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Environment is never backdrop: tide exhale dictates arrival window, cliff teeth shape shadow that swallows the lantern floor, salt spray corrodes the yoyo’s copper string. The lighthouse itself is handled—floor cracked, iron teeth grinding, beam cut—so the setting directly enables/constrains each engineering beat. Micro-setting (yoyo, stone, rope-brass key) doubles as tool and tactile geography. Final image of “pulling clouds apart” recharges the rocky-cliff opening with reversed light, satisfying the 9+ gate that setting charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Carnival funhouse is vividly textured—copper air, viscous syrup light, ink-spray dissolution—each sensory layer filtered through Mara’s diseased perception. Mirrors and carousel horse act as micro-setting that literally constrain movement and charge the final image. Selective detail (silver clasp on cracked bridle) is economical and purposeful. No credibility breaks; world rules stay consistent even as they tilt into nightmare logic.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.1)
    Floating orchard and blue-hour light are luxuriously sensory, selective, and mirrored in the looping prose rhythm. Driftwood ring, xylophone mallet, and swaying trees act as micro-setting that literally guides the prophet’s percussion choices; environment constrains technique. Spatial layout (trees, roots, waves) stays coherent and affects choreography of sound. Detail never stalls; it is woven into each fractal echo, though some phrasing edges toward purple (“restless euphony” twice).

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Setting is no postcard: the shell-terraces constrain movement (she must trace ridges to read), the cracked mosaic literally funnels her to the tunnel, and the watchers’ cliff-top perch supplies the final visual cost. Sensory hierarchy follows cartographer bias—line, curve, resonance—so detail is filtered, not touristic. Weather (sun at zenith) is the causal trigger that opens the tunnel, integrating atmosphere into plot. Micro-setting (reed whistle, ink vial) likewise constrains tactics and charges the final image when she tucks the whistle away, accepting perpetual risk.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cracked mailbox, rusted hinge, and ivy-as-cathedral-nave are not backdrop but tools that constrain access and metaphorically cage truth. The mailbox’s broken jaw literally withholds the letter until Arlen’s micro-choice with the steel rod; the ivy’s retreat under light is the environment changing state in response to revelation. Spatial choreography is flawless—distances from platform to mailbox to pedestal track cleanly. The final beam of sunlight striking the letter is a setting detail that becomes the decisive image, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    The submerged pavilion’s marble fingers and algae scent are filtered through Mara’s surveyor eye, constraining her footing and dictating where notes can be wedged. The inkwell’s brass body acts as micro-setting, its warmth a portable hearth against cold water. Final image—moonlight catching brass—recharges the pavilion’s interlaced absence, proving environment charges closure. One minor bob: “amber glow” appears twice without re-coloring.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sunken-library atmosphere is immersive: water-worn marble, rising parchment scent, lantern-amber dapples. Micro-setting—the stamp’s brass lattice—literally guides Mara to the vault, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial tracking is clean; no impossible moves. The surface council chamber, by contrast, is a white-room shrug; one sentence of civic décor would anchor the power shift.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Floating tea garden is sketched with jasmine steam, dew-slick stone, and bamboo arches—economy of sense details that stays inside the maker’s artisan eye. Glass basilica functions as both setting and tool, its refracting panes literally steering the closure ascent; this dual use satisfies the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean as the maker polishes, folds, and releases cranes across the same ledge. Weather and scent evolve (roasted jasmine at dusk) to mark the cycle’s end, keeping the locale alive rather than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Floating observatory rotors, magnetic cradle, and bruised-violet sky are selective, POV-filtered, and guide access to the crack. The geode itself acts as micro-setting that constrains the final hand-thrust. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Weather color shifts from mourning violet to indifferent canvas, mirroring internal arc without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    “Brilliant dimness” is not decorative: it literally enables the drone’s visual navigation and charges the final image when the aurora ripples across stone. The observatory’s marble star trails are tactile map, constraining Lira’s foot and drone path; mis-reading would abort the ritual. Sensory hierarchy obeys her pilot gaze—prisms shimmer like “sunrise trapped inside stone”—a perceptual signature consistent with sharp-eyed trait. Micro-setting qualifies: the chip pedestal’s copper veins become heart-metaphor that powers closure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.1)
    The cobalt terrace and the watch hand both constrain choice and charge the final image; their return in the last paragraph reweights earlier dusk light as a moral mirror. Selective sensory layering (“sieved hush,” “wood sang”) keeps description lean while anchoring spatial logic on the sand.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    The parapet’s salt-slick stone, the drawer pull warming in palm, and the thinning mist all constrain stance and timing; the micro-setting directly shapes the handshake release at dawn. Weather moves from roar to approving sigh, mirroring the internal thaw without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is immaculate: box, rope, and two bodies track cleanly across the ledge. While broader geopolitical context is wisely withheld, the sensory hierarchy is POV-true and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.1)
    Setting is selective and POV-filtered: damp planks, rusted utility-pole arms, liquid-glass bay. The astronomical compass functions as micro-setting/tool that constrains choice; its final steady tick charges the closing image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. Weather and light evolve with the emotional arc, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orchard is rendered through selective sensory triage: violet glow on jars, moonlight painting leaves silver, scent curling like starlight. These details double as pressure tools—spice jars hum, moonlight dictates ritual timing—so environment actively enables the transformation rather than merely decorating it.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.9)
    The midnight glade above clouds is immediately sensory—mist, humming oaks, moon-silvered grass—and every descriptor is filtered through the cartomancer’s esoteric priorities. The tea-set saucer functions as micro-setting: its crack is mapped, handled, and finally exchanged for crystal, literally guiding her hand movements. Spatial choreography stays intact as she kneels, releases, rises, and climbs the vapor staircase. No environment-driven constraint tightens her tactical choices, so the 9+ gate is not cleared, but atmosphere is integral, not ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ship-body as micro-setting constrains every move—rusted corridor gravity, hull sigh, vacuum silence—culminating in the garden that reconfigures the palette. Sensory triage filters through Nara’s pacifist attention: photons as “mournful fireflies,” wind carrying “scent of untouched forests.”

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Black-sand beach, warm grit, volcanic breeze, and glowing jar form a micro-setting that literally guides the final release; the volcano’s heartbeat is felt underfoot. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Mara notices heat, salt-ash taste, insect light—never catalog. The “luminous carpet” charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate. One hairline slip: “distant star cracked open” drifts toward grand abstract without tactile cue.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    The fort’s phosphorescent marble, glass roses, and mirrored shards are tactile tools: the roses refract faint light for stealth, the shards amplify the sundial code.

Environment literally illuminates the rebellion’s path, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Black basalt, violet aurora, salt-air, and receding tidal pools are filtered through Selene’s kelp-sheened senses; each sensory pick is urgent and never touristic. The Fibonacci stones function as micro-setting that literally steers the cosmic dust, satisfying the 9-plus gate. Spatial choreography is flawless: tide-edge, rock-ledges, flame-path trace a legible arc. The only restraint from 9 is that the environment does not physically push back (cold, wind, slipperiness) to tax her body further.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stormlit observatory is no backdrop; the narrowing dome-eye and ozone scent pressure the poet’s breathing and timing. The copper dome, brass console, and timetable hollow are tactile tools that constrain how the vigil can be performed. Spatial choreography is clean: climb → set timer → slot envelope → collect fragments → descend. Weather evolves from hammering rain to blessing drizzle, mirroring internal rarefaction without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.1)
    Glass atrium + brook function as micro-setting: reflective surfaces literalize the story’s mirror-of-purpose motif and constrain the duel to a contained echo-chamber. Half-painted sundial is re-used tactilely—angles traced, shadow aligned, needles pinned—so environment directly shapes final image. Sensory economy favors sound (babble, metallic hum) over visual clutter, matching “hidden overture” acoustics. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating bodies or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rusted library under stars is evoked with vivid sensory triangulation: “rusted iron into veins of light,” “broken panes like whispered applause,” “cracks between the stone floor” hosting wildflowers. Micro-setting (the coffee tin’s false bottom, the lantern-salvaged metal) constrains tactics by hiding then revealing seed packets that literally sprout the rebellion. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single annex; no impossible body shifts. The environment’s transformation from ruin to glowing garden mirrors the thematic repricing; final image is inseparable from setting.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.1)
    The broken anniversary clock is micro-setting perfection: its jammed gears whisper rhythm that steers his pedal timing, then becomes the silent metronome for the encore, directly charging the final image. Cloud-stair and tidal arbor are handled tactually—he “climbed,” “set his battered piano upon a floating platform”—so environment constrains every tactical move. Sensory hierarchy is POV-tight: only silver leaves and monochrome film matter to a pianist who thinks in glints and frames. No credibility slips; even vapor-roots obey dream-logic taught from line one.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ridge in bloom functions as micro-setting that constrains the ritual: jade vines = river map, orchid pulse = festival rhythm, petals = lost names—each detail is re-used to translate dream into anchor, directly enabling the sprout. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven (citrus-rain air, phosphorescent lanterns). Final image—amber blossom exhaling old stories—charges the closure. No spatial drift. Gate met: environment shapes tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Petrichor-scented wind, brass compass glints, bonsai leaves rustle—selective sensory triad anchors micro-setting. Knoll, stone, moss form coherent spatial triangle; choreography minimal but clean. Weather (post-rain breeze) directly enables “diffusion” action. Environment does not constrain tutor’s choices; compass hue could arise anywhere, so setting never charges final image—caps entry below 8.8.

The environment charges the final image: scarred yet breathing, mirroring her internal recalibration. Every atmospheric element serves the Accumulative lens and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    The canyon functions as more than backdrop—it actively shapes Elya’s journey: its glass-like walls mirror her art, basalt floors hold frost paths, and wind carries “drifting resonance” that echoes her inner state. The kiln, ashes, and mine are tactile and purposeful, not decorative. However, while setting charges the final image (walls reflecting colored light), it doesn’t *constrain* a pivotal choice—Elya could follow the ledger elsewhere. Still, specificity and sensory integration are masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.3)
    The winterglass conservatory functions as a charged micro-setting: its frozen cathedral aesthetic mirrors Mara’s internal stasis, while its glass walls amplify and reflect sound, enabling the climax. The tuning fork, marble bench, and velvet-lined case are tactile, recurring, and causally active—not backdrop but crucible. Sensory detail is selective (frost-hum, silk flutter, copper filaments) and filtered through Mara’s sea-tuned perception. The setting directly enables the final act: without resonant glass, the tone wouldn’t echo redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.4)
    The underwater library isn’t backdrop but active crucible: water pressure opposes light, marble tablets respond to illumination, and floating ink dictates movement. The broken lens functions as micro-setting—its shards constrain Marlow’s tactics (reassembly on ceiling, pedestal three meters up). Final image charges the setting: the library “breathes with a quiet pulse,” transforming environment into living sanctuary. Every spatial detail serves theme and closure without white-room vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    The terra-cotta arbor functions as micro-setting: it anchors donations, declarations, and legacy, directly constraining choice (e.g., hollow for packages). Sensory detail is selective—“dulled silver bell,” “flickering lanterns like fireflies”—filtered through Mara’s urgency. The ridge’s “silent spine” mirrors communal resilience without overt symbolism. Final image (bell catching moonlight) charges closure by tying environment to enduring hope.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    The twilight viaduct functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: its arches hum, jasmine vines bloom, silver pollen exhales, and the cracked tile hides the tear. Every atmospheric detail serves the ritual—stone breathes, fog thickens responsively, blossoms glow post-healing. The camera obscura and Kwan Yin’s tear are tactile tools that charge the final image. Environment is inseparable from action and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    The living bridge garden functions as both macro- and micro-setting, actively constraining and enabling choice—vines pulse with curiosity, mist carries disintegrating photographs, leaves shift with heartbeat. Every sensory detail serves the theme: scent of rain-kissed earth blends with forgotten songs, light refracts through hyperbolic corridors, roots form a breathing walkway. The setting charges the final image—the new arch shimmering with residual glow—and evolves causally as the maze “quakes” in response to presence. This environment is irreplaceable; remove it, and the entire conceit collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.3)
    The abandoned carnival prize center functions as both setting and micro-setting: its broken mirrors, token dispensers, and repurposed piano bench directly constrain and enable Mara’s actions. The phosphorescent fungi-lit descent and iron door inscription deepen atmosphere while advancing plot. Crucially, the environment charges the final image—the falling wall and emerging shoot—making setting indispensable to closure. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Mara’s urgent yet reverent perception.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    The sunken greenhouse functions as both setting and micro-setting, constraining choice (Mara must work underwater amid shipwrecks) and charging closure (device left among roots). Sensory detail is exquisitely selective—kelp-laden glass, rusted mast’s amber hum—and filtered through Mara’s synesthetic POV. The ashen forge and aurora evolve causally (sparks dissolve, light shifts), never static. Crucially, the environment directly enables the core action: only here can absences be imprinted, making it indispensable to stakes and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    The emerald station, moonlight, and golden-hour sunset form a vivid, cohesive atmosphere where light itself acts as both setting and constraint. The jar of moonbeams and jade door charge the final image, and spatial choreography (hall → tunnel → library) remains coherent. However, the environment rarely *constrains* choice—it enables wonder without imposing limits, missing the 9+ gate requiring setting to shape tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.3)
    The abandoned control room functions as a micro-setting that actively charges the closure: meltwater pools like “liquid glass,” consoles reflect furnace flicker, and spatial details (steel table, cooling tray) constrain Mara’s actions. The environment evolves causally—ice thaws, water pools, panels flicker—and the recurring glass sphere/bookmark duo physically embodies the thematic stakes. Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and woven into action (e.g., “frayed like the cracked surface of a newly blown sphere”). This setting doesn’t just reflect mood—it enables the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rusted library functions as a charged micro-setting: its groaning shelves, cracked dome, and dust-laden specters pressure choice and mirror internal decay. The seashell and child’s cast are tactile, recurring objects that constrain action (decoding via stunt moves) and culminate in the amber vial. However, the setting doesn’t *force* a tactical shift—it enables rather than obstructs. Still, the final luminescence ties environment to transformation, satisfying the 9+ gate narrowly.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)
    The storm-tossed ridge fort functions as a charged micro-setting: its groaning stones and wind-rattled battlements directly enable the oracle’s work by isolating him in a “marbled hush” where silence can be “summarized.” The flaking gold leaf booklet—a tool-as-setting—constrains his method and appears in three distinct beats (listening, mapping, placing on turret), culminating in its placement where “night’s last ember could still be seen,” directly charging the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful (salt-and-amber scent, rain-kissed iron) and filtered through the oracle’s obsessions, avoiding tourist cataloging. The environment doesn’t just reflect mood—it makes the central action possible.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    The frozen courtyard functions as micro-setting: frost on chassis, slick stone, twilight shadows—all constrain movement and mood. The ice violin is tactilely rendered and evolves (melts, vibrates, vanishes), charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective (sound of hums, glint of droplets) and filtered through the robot’s sensors. However, the setting never actively *alters* tactics—only reflects internal states—missing the 9+ gate for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.4)
    The crystal forecourt, rain-kissed puddles, and abandoned cinema lens function as micro-settings that actively constrain and charge the narrative. Puddles reflect confessions; the lens transforms doodles into maps; backstage dust and velvet contextualize the microphone’s sentience. Every sensory detail serves the theme—light, shadow, resonance—and evolves causally (puddles glimmer → project truths → fade at dawn). The environment directly enables the climax and final image, satisfying the 9+ gate with irreplaceable specificity.

    The garden maze functions as micro-setting: hedges pulse, vines crown, moss speaks—all constraining and rewarding the dresser’s actions. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through his gardener’s attention (e.g., “cold edges like a reminder,” “tentative bloom”). The recurring marbles and oak root charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Yet the “luck gauge” feels tacked-on; its mechanics don’t shape tactics, slightly diluting environmental integration.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    The xenobiology station functions as a living micro-setting—the turbines, vines, aviary, and control panels all constrain or enable action. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., “mechanically warm” hands vs. “icy glow” panels). The lever and magnetic nexus charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate, but the environment doesn’t actively foreclose options—it enhances rather than pressures. Still, tactile specificity grounds every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    The flooded opera house isn’t backdrop—it actively shapes tactics: swollen violin wood, water-etched symbols, lantern light guiding perception.

Sensory detail is selective (amber lights like “hesitant thoughts,” heater’s “mournful hiss”) and filtered through fever-broken perception. Environment directly enables the climax: glass conductivity, humidity, pressure—all shape the oracle’s method.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tunnel, valve wheel, and ghost shift hum form a micro-setting that charges every beat. The beaded wheel constrains the climax—it must be appraised, not removed—and the final image (“emerged into predawn light”) reweights the industrial hellscape as sacred archive. Sensory detail (rust, crackle, chill) is selective and POV-filtered. However, the train tunnel setting itself exerts little unique pressure beyond generic gloom.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.3)
    The overgrown library functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: shelves “grow like vines,” stone softens underfoot, air “heals broken thoughts.” Sensory detail is selective (damp parchment, phosphorescent thread, cold river fingers) and filtered through the keeper’s perception. The obsidian refuge charges the final image, its “moonlit eye” pulsing like a heartbeat. Environment directly shapes tactics—the origami swan guides descent through breathing stone—and the final line ties external setting to internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sage Ridge is evoked through selective, purposeful detail—the ancient oaks, soil-humming roots, silver ring of light—that mirrors Liora’s thematic arc. The locket and harp function as micro-settings that constrain and charge choices: tuning to wind, placing curl near pulse. Final image of saplings shifting toward light ties environment to hope, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Minor deduction for slight over-reliance on visual lyricism at expense of other senses during peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.4)
    The silo functions as micro-setting: its concrete walls, fire pit, and stairwell constrain movement and amplify sensory detail (soot smell, bronze quiet glow). The tapestry’s gilt threads and glyphs directly charge the climax—their physical properties enable the resonance that validates the historian’s theory. Every atmospheric detail serves the Accumulative lens, culminating in the chamber’s shiver that reweights the entire premise. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains precise throughout descent and return.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lighthouse functions as a charged micro-setting: its beam, oil, copper coils, and spiral staircase actively shape tactics and culminate in the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—the scent of dough, rattle of glass, hum of telegraph—all serve the narrative’s texture. The environment doesn’t just reflect mood; it enables the method (“directing flow of scented oil”) and binds secret to sea rhythm. This integration earns high marks despite minor overwriting in storm description.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.3)
    The cathedral functions as a dynamic micro-setting: its silence decorates, its arches absorb sound, and its walls “inhale” during climax—each trait constraining and enabling the priest’s ritual. The dimensional anchor beneath the altar pressures every choice, and the indigo hue charges the final image with irreplaceable specificity. Sensory detail is purposeful (echoes, droplets as notes, muffled clarity) and filtered through the priest’s synesthetic perception. The environment doesn’t just reflect theme—it actively unravels and rebuilds reality.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.3)
    The glass spire and frozen lake aren’t backdrop but active constraints: frost becomes Lian’s score, ice transforms into a vibrating membrane, and the mirrored horizon amplifies sound. The nautilus shell functions as micro-setting—its spiral physically guides alignment and metaphorically maps memory. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure (early mist → breath-held frost lines → resonant cracks), all filtered through Lian’s synesthetic perception. Final image of rippling lake notes fulfills the 9+ gate: environment charges closure by making the invisible symphony visible.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glowing viaduct functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image: its phosphorescent rainwater “thrums” in sync with the protagonist’s breath, and its shift to “somber sunrise” mirrors his internal resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.3)
    The amber grotto isn’t backdrop—it’s an active micro-setting that constrains and enables: its static charges the petal, its glow seals the vial, its walls “breathe” in resonance. Sensory detail is filtered through Mara’s professional bias (she tastes static as “old rain,” sees hues as “fragments of story”). The recurring object—the petal—evolves from inert to saturated, charging the final image. Every atmospheric element serves the dominant stake: harvesting half-truths from ambient emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is vividly specific—the breezy library under stars, brine-scented pier, lighthouse balcony—and filters through Mara’s professional gaze (“cargo ledger,” “freight”). The locket and library function as micro-settings that charge the final image, though the library’s role in tactics is passive (a venue, not a constraint). Sensory detail serves atmosphere but rarely pressures choice.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.4)
    The crystalline orchard, shimmering crater, and obsidian arbor are not backdrop but active agents: the arbor’s fractured light “stitches the ground into webs of kinship,” directly shaping the story’s central metaphor and Arlen’s method. Every sensory detail serves texture and theme—dew-kissed stems crack like whispers, phosphorescent moss turns sky into canvas—without stalling momentum. The setting constrains no physical choice but charges every emotional and symbolic turn, especially the final image where the orchard’s “luminescent ache” softens into communal glow. This environment is irreplaceable; remove it, and the story collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.3)
    The rooftop canal system functions as both macro-setting and micro-setting—it channels action, reflects light, carries sound, and ultimately becomes the medium through which time is sculpted. Every detail (stone ribs, mirrored ribbons, singing cavern walls) is filtered through Mira’s illustrator’s eye and serves thematic pressure. The pendant and water interact causally: pressing it into the canal creates a staircase; the setting constrains and enables every key turn. Final image—silver water, humming giant—is charged by prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.3)
    The cavern orchard functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and charges the narrative: stalactite drips provide silver notes that translate loss into numerical patterns, moss muffles sound to heighten intimacy, and the mosaic stone’s fissures physically encode memory.

    The prismatic escondite functions as micro-setting: its color shifts mirror emotional transformation and constrain perception (“sapphire to amber”). Magnetic fields and ozone scent are woven into action, not backdrop. The setting charges the final image—the cavern fades as witness—but doesn’t actively foreclose options; it reflects rather than pressures. Still, sensory specificity (violet walls, hushed thunder) earns high marks.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.3)
    The funeral home prep room functions as micro-setting: lilies, incense, oak walls, and mourners’ sighs create atmospheric pressure that directly enables the ink’s activation. The ink pot—a recurring object—constrains choice (Mara must wait for grief-fog to thicken) and charges the final image (its clink echoes as “twin vessels for change”). Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: early visual/tactile details (dulled brass, swirling ink) narrow to thermal/light perception (glowing symbols) during climax. Every detail serves theme or action; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: rusted towers, metallic dust, cracked pavement all constrain perception and movement. The phonograph cylinder and wax-sealed leaf are tactile anchors that evolve from object to vessel of meaning. However, the scrapyard remains atmospheric rather than tactical—no spatial choreography alters Rook’s choices. Final image gains charge from setting, but environment doesn’t actively shape decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.3)
    The time dilation observation deck functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: its “temporally stretched” air allows the vision of the past, directly shaping the protagonist’s choice to continue sketching. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—violet-ash sky, charcoal on glass, humming quantum echo—filtered through grief and ritual. The gilded compass rose, worn on the lapel, charges the final image when it “pulses softly,” linking body, object, and environment. Every atmospheric element serves the closure’s thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.3)
    The icebound spire isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and responds: frost seals knowledge, softens with each secret, cracks only when the final exchange occurs. The pocket sundial lid functions as micro-setting—its chime triggers change, its gears sing lullabies, its warmth counters chill. Sensory detail is selective (violet aurora, glittering meltwater) and filtered through Lysander’s wonder-trained perception. The setting charges the final image: ice becomes water, spire yields knowledge, all tied to object and environment.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.3)
    The whispering gallery isn’t backdrop—it actively shapes choice: echoes amplify footsteps, marble reflects absence, and acoustics reward Mira’s patterns with vocal resonance. The chessboard’s missing pawns charge the space with thematic weight, and the penumbra interacts physically with light/shadow. Every sensory detail (ribbons of light, rustle of shoes) serves pressure or closure. Final image of Mira stepping out carries the gallery’s echo as a “secret script,” proving setting constrains and enables the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.3)
    The mountain-bookstore is not backdrop but active crucible: its stone ribs expand like lungs, its corridors reconfigure in response to Lira’s insight. The recurring objects—the feather, the stone, the mercury-glass book—constrain and enable action: the feather’s texture is the only viable method of reading, making it irreplaceable. Sensory detail (pine, ink, thunder-pulsed vellum) is filtered through Lira’s longing, never touristy. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: the mountain inhales as Lira exhales memory, binding environment and epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    The platinum labyrinth functions as micro-setting—it constrains entry (decoding threads) and pressures choice (corridors force confrontation). The “woven hush” tapestry evolves from mute object to active agent (threads whisper memories), charging the final image when it becomes a “banner of peace.” Sensory detail is purposeful: thundercloud reflections, stone coldness, thread tension—all filtered through the tutor’s chess-trained perception. Environment directly shapes tactics and closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    The canyon, bone towers, and pale spire aren’t backdrop—they constrain and charge every action.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.3)
    The floating workshop, acid sea, and statue function as micro-setting that actively constrains and charges the closure: the corrosive environment pressures urgency, the statue’s voids demand kintsugi-like repair, and the charm’s alignment with fissures ties object to place. Sensory detail is selective (bubbling acid, iron-clad floor, humming gears) and filtered through the alchemist’s desperate focus. The setting evolves causally—the sea calms only after the story is told—and culminates in the sunrise reflection that validates the tale’s reach.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting operates as micro-setting: the quay, cave, and oasis are vividly rendered through brine, stone, and light, but more crucially, the painted seashell and studio chest function as constrained tools that shape choice. The cavern’s golden shafts and reflective pool directly charge the climax, and the quay’s weathered boards return as emotional anchors. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., “colors deeper than any pigment I could mix”), avoiding tourist cataloguing. However, the cave network doesn’t actively pressure decisions—it’s a passive conduit—so it narrowly misses the 9+ gate requiring environmental constraint.

The setting evolves causally (transmitter crackles → hum traces sky rivers) and culminates in sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    The hanging orchard functions as micro-setting: slick bark, hollow trunks, and storm pressure directly shape Mara’s tactics (moss seal, trekking). Weather and brine constrain movement and concealment; the ravine’s verticality echoes emotional exposure. Final image (“storm-kissed silence”) charges closure by merging environment with thematic shift. Only slight overreliance on visual lyricism (“broken cathedral of fruit”) slightly dulls tactile immersion during high-stakes moments.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    The opal dock, mist, lavender sea, and nautical twilight are not backdrop but active micro-setting: the dock’s reflective surface mirrors Marlowe’s isolation, the tide’s pauses dictate his method, and the mist frames the liminal space where memory surfaces. Sensory detail is selective (salt spray, brittle petals, low moan of wind) and filtered through Marlowe’s longing. Crucially, the environment constrains his action—he reads the stranger’s path only through tidal gaps—and charges the final image: the lamp’s beam tracing those same gaps into “ribbons of gold.” This integration of setting-as-agent earns the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.1)
    The blooming cavern functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: its glimmer guides discovery, the rising creek marks time, and the amber fissure pulses with decision-energy.

    The disused railway station isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting: ivy forms cathedral arches that echo archival halls, steel sleepers become “green veins,” and broken glass crunches underfoot to ground emotion in sensation. Crucially, the setting constrains choice (mailbox rusted shut, requiring a salvaged tool) and charges closure—the beam of sunlight striking the letter only emerges after ivy loosens. Sensory detail is selective (moonlit ink, glass shards dancing) and filtered through Arlen’s historian POV. This environment is indispensable to the story’s logic and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is masterfully integrated: the submerged pavilion functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (wading through cold water, placing notes in cracks) and charges the final image (glimmering amber stones, river as mirror). Sensory detail—slick moss, damp copper air, algae’s scent—is filtered through Mara’s professional and emotional lens. The antique inkwell and drawbridge are purposeful anchors, not backdrop. Environment actively shapes tactics and thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    The forgotten library functions as a potent micro-setting: water-seep alters ink, cracks frame decay, and corridors demand spatial mapping. The antique stamp, lantern, and vellum are tactile tools that constrain action—Mara must align gears, press stamps, trace ciphers. The sunken city’s flooded streets and blackout deepen atmosphere while shaping tactics (e.g., buoys powered by drowning currents). Final image ties setting to theme: illumination reborn from the very force that buried knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.4)
    The floating island tea garden functions as micro-setting that actively pressures choice: jasmine steam “coaxes the ether closer,” enabling dream capture; bamboo arches host cranes that “whisper recorded dreams back to the clouds.” The glass basilica constrains tactics—it must be polished at the shadow’s detachment—and charges the final image as it turns “translucent gold.” Sensory detail (roasted jasmine, sandalwood) reflects emotional duality without cliché. Every environmental element ties to ritual, stakes, or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.1)
    The floating observatory functions as a charged micro-setting: its humming instruments, magnetic cradle, and leaking foundation directly enable and constrain the protagonist’s actions. The geode crystal—a recurring object—shapes perception, guides calibration, and fractures to scatter shards that become the story’s closing constellation. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“air feel heavier than stone”), avoiding white-room syndrome. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: the hovering shards literalize hope grasped, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observatory functions as active micro-setting: star trails guide movement, marble transmits resonance, prisms refract auroras tied to the frequency. “Brilliant dimness” evolves from mood to charged final image, embodying the story’s paradox. Every sensory detail serves theme—copper veins pulse like hearts, rotors whisper against dim air—without tourist cataloging. The setting constrains the method (tracing trails) and charges closure (walls pulse with decoded song).

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cobalt terrace and driftwood shore function as micro-settings that charge the closure: the terrace frames the moral return, while the shore’s carvings constrain the search for truth. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (“night-black water,” “pulse faintly”), filtered through the genealogist’s guilt. The watch hand and driftwood act as environmental tools that shape tactics. No static description; every image serves pressure or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    The parapet functions as micro-setting: stones slick with rain, mist-shrouded, scarred yet steadfast—mirroring the negotiator’s psyche. The antique drawer pull and rope are tactile anchors that constrain choice (handling the box, releasing the rope). Weather and moon phase actively shape timing and mood. Final image of mist dissolving as stones “bare but no longer hostile” charges closure with environmental transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    The coastal kayak launch functions effectively as micro-setting: damp planks, utility poles, sea breeze—all tactile and filtered through the narrator’s melancholic hope. The astronomical compass and utility poles serve as environmental constraints that shape navigation method. However, the setting doesn’t actively pressure choices beyond mood; it reflects rather than compels. Vivid specificity earns high marks, but it falls just short of constraining a pivotal decision or charging the final image with physical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.3)
    The underground bioluminescent lake functions as both setting and micro-setting, constraining choices (reading floating headlines, navigating kelp clusters) and charging the final image—the water’s phosphorescence pulses “in rhythm with my heartbeat.” Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and POV-filtered (“ghostly headlines,” “phosphor-scaled fish”), avoiding tourist cataloguing. The recurring baseball and mirror are tactile extensions of environment, and the cavern walls etched with “silhouettes of past decisions” merge physical space with psychological stakes. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.3)
    The fairy-tale orchard under permanent moonlight isn’t backdrop—it’s active crucible. Moonlight enables the ritual; hidden alcoves yield spices; silvered mist births Arion. The setting constrains and enables: without permanent moonlight, the metamorphosis fails. Final image—fruits glowing, moon wrapping all in embrace—charges closure with environmental resonance. Sensory detail (violet glow, filament of starlight) is selective, purposeful, and woven into action.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.3)
    The midnight glade above clouds functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: mist curls around oaks, moonlight glimmers on fissures, and the shattered tea set becomes a map of sorrow. Every sensory detail—charcoal-dusted sleeves, porcelain shards singing like wind-chimes—filters through the cartomancer’s ritual perception. The setting culminates in the crystal blossom and star-rain, directly charging the closure with tactile, visual, and auditory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    The recycled spaceship functions as micro-setting: rusted corridors, humming panels, and sighing hull directly constrain and reflect Nara’s actions. Kwan Yin’s tear and faded photographs are tactile tools that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (ghostly resolve in metal, pale wind’s scent) and filtered through Nara’s grief-honed attention. The luminous garden’s nameless colors reweight the setting’s purpose—from museum of memory to cradle of possibility—fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    The black sand beach, volcanic grit, and celestial dance are rendered with sensory specificity that filters through Mara’s perception—warm sand, salt-ash wind, glowing grains. Crucially, the setting constrains choice: the jar trembles *because* of the volcanic breeze, triggering the release. The final image of luminous sand pulses with planetary rhythm, charging closure. Yet the volcano remains backdrop, not active pressure—its rumble signals theme, not tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.1)
    The luminous fort is not backdrop but active agent: its phosphorescent walls “listen,” glass roses “sculpt darkness into beauty,” and translucent marble enables Kael’s mirror shards to amplify the sundial’s code. These details constrain tactics (mirrors repurpose architecture) and charge the final image—the cradle’s pulse echoing through “fort’s veins.” Every sensory cue serves theme or action, avoiding white-room syndrome or tourist cataloging. The setting earns its lyricism by enabling the revolution’s mechanics and metaphysics.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal bluff under aurora functions as micro-setting that actively shapes tactics—the basalt ledge holds the sequence, the tide’s breath times the ritual, and the aurora’s light validates the promise. Sensory detail (salt, kelp sheen, powdered iron dust) is vivid and selective, filtered through Selene’s mythic perception. However, the setting never *constrains* choice—it enables without resistance, missing a 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    The stormlit observatory isn’t backdrop—it pressures every move: rain hammers, lightning mirrors censored lines, ozone floods the chamber. The darkroom timer and bus timetable function as micro-settings that constrain ritual and charge the climax. Weather evolves causally (storm → drizzle → thinning clouds), and spatial choreography (spiral stair, dome, console, balcony) remains precise. The setting actively shapes the poet’s tactics and final revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glass atrium, brook, and sundial function as micro-setting: the stilling brook times the duel, the glass frames reflection, and the half-painted sundial directly guides blade angles. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—glinting needles, metallic hum, rustling leaves—all filtered through the duel’s conceptual stakes. The environment charges the final image when the needle card aligns with coded angles, transforming setting into map.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)
    The rusted library functions as micro-setting: its broken panes admit moonlight that “turns rusted iron into veins of light,” directly charging the final image. Stone cracks host wildflowers, transforming decay into growth—environment constrains and enables the resistance. Every sensory detail (stale biscuits, humming metal, green mosaic) serves thematic pressure without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the tidal arbor, film reel, and cloud auditorium aren’t backdrop but active constraints shaping choice (e.g., climbing cloud-steps, splicing reels). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—keys “gleaming like frost,” leaves “shimmering like silver rain”—filtered through the pianist’s longing. The environment charges the final image: the silent auditorium of clouds makes his solitude and resolve palpable. Only minor deduction: some descriptions verge on ornamental without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ancient ridge isn’t backdrop but active crucible: jade vines and pulsing orchids supply the very symbols Mara must interpret, directly enabling her ritual. The setting constrains time (pre-monsoon) and supplies sensory cues (citrus air, phosphorescent lanterns) that filter through Mara’s perception. The final image—blossom petals as repositories of chants—charges the environment with thematic weight. Every detail serves the empirical-whimsical tone without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    The breezy islet after rain functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image—the moss, stone, and cerulean sky all constrain mood and meaning. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (petrichor, brass glints, rustling leaves), filtered through the tutor’s contemplative perception. However, the setting never actively pressures choice—it reflects rather than shapes—missing the 9+ gate for environmental constraint on tactics.
