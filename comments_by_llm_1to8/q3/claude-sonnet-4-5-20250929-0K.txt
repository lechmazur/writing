  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.1)
    The canyon setting is vivid and purposeful: morning frost as diagnostic tool, hidden cave, rockfall camouflage. Spatial choreography is clean (workshop three miles behind, narrow gorge, cave mouth). The frost patterns constrain Vera's discovery method and the kiln bookends the piece with thematic charge. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her artist's lens, grounding the world without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    The winterglass conservatory as damaged refuge charges every beat: fractured prisms, frozen fountain, warped floorboards become surfaces for thermal touch. The tuning fork case—velvet-lined, unharmed amid destruction—functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and returns in the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Mara's new silence: she feels vibration, watches color bloom on screens, experiences the conservatory's cold. Spatial choreography (entrance, path of panels, stations) remains coherent throughout the installation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    The underwater library is vividly rendered with purposeful impossible geometry: "corridors that bent through time, reading rooms existing in multiple depths simultaneously." Sensory details are selective and atmospheric—brine and decay, bioluminescent light, coral-crusted shelves—and the broken lens returns charged in the climax, transforming the dome into "a cathedral of refracted illumination." The funeral parlor and boat function as transit; the library itself constrains Marcel's work and charges the final image. Spatial choreography of the descent and threshold passage is clean, though the diving bell's mechanics remain vague.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.1)
    The terra-cotta arbor recurs across the opening, middle, and closure, grounding the declaration scene and charging the final image with historical weight (three generations, crumbling clay, morning light). The silver bell's inscriptions and border-crossing history anchor it in lived experience. Sensory economy is strong—"dirt roads lay empty under stars," "headlights cutting tunnels"—without catalog sprawl. The arbor's physical state (crumbling, repaired by hand) subtly mirrors the community's fragility and persistence, meeting the micro-setting test for choice constraint at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.1)
    The viaduct and wisteria are vividly particular, and the camera obscura's inverted image charges the reveal. Sensory detail is rich and purposeful (perfume, phosphorescent sparks, refracted blooms). The jade tear functions as micro-setting, constraining Mei's mission and charging the closure when she leaves it on the vine, altering her relationship to the past-life memory.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The living bridge garden is anchored early with vivid, purposeful detail: moss-slick spans, roots woven into geometric patterns, a ravine choked with flowering vines. The halo fragment embedded in the railing and the photographs spread across the bridge's surface create a micro-setting that directly enables the key transformation. At closure, the bridge itself responds by reorganizing its roots into hyperbolic configurations, charging the final image with environmental agency. The setting constrains Lyra's choice to this specific location and moment, and the botanical architecture mirrors her maze designs throughout, creating a coherent thematic echo that supports rather than decorates.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.1)
    The abandoned carnival setting is vivid and purposeful: decaying stuffed animals, crooked prize wheel, boarded windows create atmosphere while the piano bench and prize wheel constrain her search pattern. The setting actively shapes Mira's movements through the space (keys point toward stage, ticket booth, wheel). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The final wasteland with "cracked" soil waiting charges the closure image with tactile specificity that makes the planting decision concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse and forge function as micro-setting that constrains Mira's work and charges the final image. The crystalline matrix suspended above the forge is a recurring object handled across multiple beats (placement, heating, the decision to drop it) and its fall into "the forge's ashen heart" delivers the closure image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Mira's synesthesia ("burgundy crackle of oxidizing copper, the silver whisper of cooling steel"). The aurora and shipwrecked environment are woven through action rather than catalogued. The forge itself becomes indispensable to the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.1)
    The emerald-tiled station glowing under sunset/moonlight is vivid and consistent. Spatial choreography (ticket booth, platform seven, bench, rails) tracks cleanly. The jar as micro-object constrains the handoff beat and charges the ending decision. Sensory details (amber light, silvered rails, liquid shadows) are filtered through the moment's urgency. The setting enables the choice to leave the jar and walk toward a new identity, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint/closure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    The control room's frozen dials, eastern windows, and concrete shell supply concrete spatial grounding and mirror Marcus's emotional state. The pontil rod, molten glass, and cracked bookmark function as micro-setting elements that constrain his on-page choices—he must maintain rotation, check the gather, decide when to pocket the bookmark. The river ice breaking serves as both soundscape and thematic doubling. Setting details are filtered through Marcus's glassblowing priorities (flame, rotation, balance) rather than tourist description, and the final image of repurposing the control room charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    The rusted library is vividly established (corroded beams, dust, headlamp cutting through decades) and the cast functions as a charged object, but neither constrains a choice or alters tactics—Maya studies it and photographs it without the environment pressing a decision. The seashell half appears only as a found talisman, not as a tool that shapes the outcome. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, but the setting remains backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.1)
    The storm-tossed ridge fort, sodden robes, and flaking booklet anchor place and texture early. The fort's "ambered hush" and "marbled quiet" recur to establish tone, but the setting does not constrain a tactical choice or alter the oracle's options. The final darkness is atmospheric rather than a lived spatial pressure that forces adaptation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frozen courtyard functions as more than backdrop: the perpetual twilight mirrors consciousness-in-process, and the ice violin's fragility constrains J-7's approach across loops (shattering in loop three). Marble benches, frost, and amber-gray light are filtered through J-7's maintenance perspective ("whispering against stone"). The body-as-setting (gripper attachments feeling warmth) charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting shapes the violin interaction directly, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    The crystal forecourt is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (rain-slicked crystals, prismatic shadows, acoustic whispers) and constrains action—Mira stops listening, the eavesdropping is involuntary due to the forecourt's acoustics. The lens as micro-setting object returns with reweighted meaning at closure. Spatial choreography (desk, archives, projection booth) is clear. The environment charges the final image and enables the pivotal eavesdropping beat, meeting the 9+ gate test for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    The maze functions as active constraint: its "walls of hornbeam and yew forming passages that shifted with the seasons" and the path that "opened before her like water parting for a stone" at closure. Impossible blooming (lavender in November, spring crocuses through autumn mulch) charges the final image by making the garden's knowledge concrete. The marbles on velvet, fountain with crimped pipes, and potting shed anchor the vine dresser's lived-in relationship. Spatial choreography holds (maze heart, scattered marbles, paths). The simultaneous seasons are filtered through Marcus's witness-POV and escalate from atmospheric to proof.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.1)
    The xenobiology station, gas giant's twilight, and mechanically warm nexus housing provide vivid, specific anchors. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (condensation on the nexus, breath clouds in icy warmth). The "icy warmth" contradiction functions as both atmosphere and thematic mirror. However, spatial choreography between observation deck and nexus bay remains slightly vague, and the Ephemera's fifty-meter wings and bioelectric interference are described but don't materially constrain Kael's choices at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    The flooded opera house supplies vivid, purpose-driven detail: water at chest-deep alters acoustics ("deeper and more resonant"), lanterns flicker in dialogue, the program warps under flood damage to create new symbols. Spatial choreography is clear (pit to stage climb, water streaming from clothes). The micro-setting of water and program constrains Marta's decoding method and charges the final image when she lays the program center stage. Sensory selection reflects her musician's focus (C string note, E flat response). Minor slip: "third rung of her chair" is spatially vague (chairs don't have rungs), and the seventy-year backstory of Constance and Moretti is efficient but borders on exposition without immediate grounding cues.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mountain weather station provides spatial coherence (observation deck, console, windows with frost patterns) and pressures the premise: the oracle's function depends on this isolated setting where prediction failures are lethal. The botanical illustration returns at closure as a charged object (nightshade's beauty vs. poison = knowledge requiring context) that reweights the premise. Sensory detail is selective (frost patterns, sunrise shades, clouds gathering) and filtered through Mira's post-fever perception. No occupational systems beyond the oracle interface are shown, which is acceptable at this length since the conflict hinges on the redesign itself rather than procedural depth.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.1)
    The abandoned mill and tunnel are vividly anchored with sensory specifics—ceramic beads worn smooth, dripping darkness, rotting railroad ties, water hammering in pipes. The beaded valve wheels recur and charge the final understanding, constraining Marcus's path and supplying the documentary trail he seeks. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, the shift from observation to supernatural payoff (shadows pausing, workers "clocking out") lacks grounding in the physical mechanics established earlier, creating a slight tonal leap rather than an inevitable environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    The obsidian refuge, overgrown library, and subterranean chamber are rendered with strong sensory detail (moss against black stone, vines through shelves, mineral script on columns) and the setting evolution from surface to depths structurally mirrors the thematic descent. The "stalactites and stalagmites grown together into columns covered in mineral script" charges the final image by making the archive literally geological. However, the environment does not constrain a tactical choice; the chronicle keeper moves through spaces without friction, and the burrowing happens off-page ("she began to burrow… clearing away centuries of sediment") rather than as embodied struggle with tools, stamina, or access.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sage Ridge, the garden, and eclipse glasses provide concrete setting anchors. The eclipse itself constrains the timing and creates the liminal sensory environment (cooling air, strange light, bird silence) that enables Thomas's breakthrough—environment actively shapes the climactic choice. The wooden box appears twice, framing the session, and the guitar functions as a therapeutic tool. However, spatial choreography during the eclipse scene (cushions, Mara's sight lines, Thomas's positioning) remains somewhat vague, and the clinic interior is barely sketched beyond "small wooden box on her desk."

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    The silo library is vividly rendered with spiraling shelves, bronze light, and dust motes; sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. The tapestry's dragon claw becomes a tactile anchor that constrains Miren's final gesture (she presses her hand where Catherine did). The setting functions as both archive and sanctuary, and the "reclaimed space" motif charges the ending image. Micro-setting use (the tapestry fragment, the cushion for sorting) supports choices without overwhelming the frame.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse and lamp room anchor the setting with purpose—the beam's rhythm keeps time, the rocky island witnesses signals, and the spiral stairs provide spatial grounding at closure. Micro-setting succeeds: the microdot taped under a barstool, rice paste mixed with UV-reactive compound, and the lamp room as workspace all constrain method. The evening walk through town and the supply boat departure supply logistical realism. The final image of waves crashing against century-old rocks charges the closure with continuity, though the setting itself does not force a tactical choice in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dimensional anchor chamber is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: "reality folded into itself like origami made of light," "crystalline space," silence as décor. The loop pedal functions as both tool and constraint, its cables "snaking up his leg like technological rosary beads" grounding the priest's method in tactile reality. The single-color palette becomes a metaphysical marking tool, and the blue marks "hung suspended, marking harmonic points" directly shape the exorcism's geometry. Setting pressure is clear—Marcus suspended in overlap, the chamber's properties enabling the priest's technique—and the final image of "natural quietude" charges the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glass spire and frozen lake are anchored early and sensory detail is selective and purposeful (pre-dawn light through crystalline walls, ice groaning with temperature shift, mirrored horizon dissolving). The nautilus shell functions as micro-setting, constraining her realization when she presses it against glass and sees its chambers as "a score, a visual symphony." The environment charges the final image—"upturned hush" and "surrounded by spirals and mirrors and light"—though the spire itself does not block or enable a tactical choice during the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    The viaduct's amber glow, wet stone, and shifting states (moss-covered, pristine, fractured by veins of light) provide vivid micro-setting that charges the seventeen retraces. The tablet as recurring object constrains her final choice: pressing the rune shatters the bridge into memory-shards, then reforms it singular and solid. Spatial choreography stays coherent (apex, cornerstone, bridge). The final image—rain-slicked bridge, wet stone underfoot—anchors the closure and reweights the premise with tactile specificity. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven, modulating with her condition (temporal uncertainty versus singular solidity).

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cavern is anchored early with autumn/stone/goatskin detail and recurs with seasonal markers (autumn to winter). The broken needle and oscilloscope function as micro-setting objects that enable discovery. Spatial choreography is clean (workbench, entrance, lamplight). The cavern's acoustics subtly guide the backward-recording choice, and the final image links the needle's shadow to a frozen sound wave, charging the closure. Sensory detail skews visual-auditory appropriate to the POV but could layer tactile or temperature cues more densely in high-pressure beats to reach 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    The courtyard setting constrains choice (quiet sanctuary enables the clandestine meeting) and the evening sky's shimmer charges the final image when Marianne sees the zone distortion anew. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (fountain as "data, as rhythm, as pattern"). The message tube is handled twice with evolving significance. Minor: occupational systems (atmospheric science) remain abstract rather than tactile in the mapping moment.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    Terra-cotta grotto, starlight as visible threads, and the rope's wear patterns are vivid and purposeful. The rope functions as micro-setting, its seventeen temporal layers discovered through touch, and it constrains Marcus's reading ritual. The mandala arranges itself across clay floor, shaping the witness act and charging the final shrine image. Sensory detail—candlelight, warm clay walls, rust-red formations—filters through Marcus's poet lens without catalog bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    The sunken greenhouse with sideways apple trees and shipwreck ribs is vividly specific and pressures the gathering—water depth, fractured glass, and ash-laden wind are sensory anchors throughout. The platform, water, and acoustic properties constrain Maya's performance choices and charge the final image (fruit dropping into water). The chronic hush functions as atmospheric constraint that retreats only within the greenhouse pocket, tightening the sanctuary's fragility. Setting details are filtered through Maya's acoustic perception and integrated into action rather than catalogued.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    The amber grotto functions as more than backdrop: its resinous walls and static electricity constrain Mara's method, and the fossilized insects provide the metaphoric frame for transformation-through-time that charges her final choice. Sensory details (dusk light, resinous walls, electric whisper) filter through Mara's professional perception. The micro-setting (grotto interior vs. exterior where Therese waits) spatially encodes the choice between isolation and engagement. One minor slip: "ancient joy, prehistoric fear, millennia-old contentment" reads as catalog rather than POV-specific selection.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory library under stars is vivid and purposeful: the glass dome, breeze through vents, salt-sweet harbor scent anchor the scene early and consistently. The reading table "where starlight pooled like spilled milk" charges the space, and the display entrance under the dome returns at closure, making setting an active frame. The locket photo is handled across beats (opening exchange, Chen touching it, worn daily at the end), shifting from envelope to embodied presence, which lifts object integration and extends setting's role as witness.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.1)
    The crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, and marsh reeds are vividly rendered with purposeful specificity ("bark that felt like frozen starlight"). The marsh constrains Kael's work and provides the material for her integration gesture, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. However, the setting functions more as atmospheric backdrop than as a force that dynamically constrains mid-story choices; the reeds enable the solution but don't pressure tactics during the search itself.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rooftop canals, bronze towers, and the giant's breath provide vivid sensory anchors filtered through Vera's naturalist lens. The architecture constrains her search: "narrow gap between two aqueducts" is where the echo is born, making setting essential to discovery. Micro-setting (the pendant, specimen jars, canals) charges the final image when she descends "before the giant woke." Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the giant's breathing functions as both atmosphere and pressure device.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cavern orchard is vividly anchored: limestone ceiling cracks, stalactite drips, mineral-rich pools, apple trees with glowing fruit. Sensory hierarchy is strong—moonlight angles, rhythmic dripping as metronome, warmth of the glass eyes. The mosaic stepping stone at the orchard's center constrains Elara's ritual positioning and the shadow-formed primes tie setting to her mathematical obsession. The environment charges the final image ("perpetual twilight," "patient as stone, alive as grief") and the stalactites' drip rhythm punctuates her conjuring, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint and closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    The library's shadowed stacks, pipe chases, and crawl spaces are vivid and purposeful, shaping Miriam's movements and discoveries. The "sapphire hush" recurs with atmospheric consistency. The tape reels' smell (iron oxide, aged acetate) triggers memory and constrains her choice to surface them. Spatial choreography through maintenance access and mechanical rooms remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mossy trellis functions as micro-setting: it holds moisture, creates microclimates, and becomes her thinking space, directly shaping her decision to leave the moss and observe rather than control. The linden leaf is handled multiple times with texture ("delicate structure against her heart"), and storm season provides recurring environmental pressure that tests her structures and beliefs. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maya's evolving POV (moss, dripping water, rainwater-heavy leaves), and the setting transitions from threat to conversation by the end, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    Tidal causeway, limestone caves, ochre handprints, and the twice-daily flood cycle supply concrete spatial anchors and constrain the painter's nocturnal following. The brooch's glow and the still pool mirror charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and apt—rain-slick rocks, weak morning light, the causeway swallowed by tide—without postcard excess. The island's isolation and reclamation station ground survival stakes in the post-war setting.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    The crystalline cave is not mere backdrop: its acoustic web maps prophecy, overlapping shadows become "doors," the exploding pearl scatters stolen futures, and the cave "sang her into something new" at closure. Sensory hierarchy fits the clairvoyant POV (she tastes frequencies, reads formations). Spatial choreography remains clear across meditation alcove and Singing Chamber. The cave's music shifting into "unfamiliar patterns" constrains Mara's certainty and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion for Q3, but minor ornamental passages (bioluminescent moss) prevent full elevation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Ivory Harbor's rain-darkened planks steaming in returning sun and white stones gleaming anchor the setting with sensory specificity and filtered through Marina's archivist attention. The valve—"wedged between cobblestones"—functions as micro-setting that constraints her final choice: she kept it because it mattered, and offering it to Thomas becomes the bridge. The archive building itself charges the final image as the door opens and "seventeen years of careful attention spilled out into the light." Spatial choreography (pier, crowd, walking up from harbor) tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    The station vault, mist, orange security lights as constellations, and pavement cracks as arrows are vivid and selective. The "starlit vault" returns in the final line, charging closure. Spatial choreography through the tunnel is coherent, and the fortress chamber's walls of suppressed confessions constrain Mara's final choice to map rather than merely observe. The micro-setting (notebook, cracks) functions as tool and guide.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    The roofless tower is vividly established early and constrains the action (she presses the tile against the stone floor, feels vibration). The Pacific setting, whale breach, and whale songs create sensory pressure tied to the dominant stake. The tile as micro-object charges the closure by returning with reweighted meaning (not just numbers but "coordinates, frequencies, dates"). Spatial choreography is clean. Minor slip: the tower's function as "cupped hands toward the heavens" reads slightly ornamental in the opening but is paid off structurally by the inherited-memory reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prismatic escondite, magnetic fields as visible serpents, and auroras warping into "impossible geometries" create vivid, POV-filtered sensory anchors. The fragment on the obsidian desk and the storm's crescendo constrain the ritual's timing and Cassius's ability to intervene. Spatial choreography is clean: Naia moves from doorway to window, fragment sinks into her sternum, dimensions tear. The environment charges the final image—storm passes, escondite stands empty—reinforcing Cassius's isolation. Minor: the escondite's interior layout (desk, doorway, window relation) could be slightly sharper in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prep room's "deathly vitality" and formaldehyde-and-flowers scent ground the confrontation in a space that enforces honesty—"everything false gets removed until only what's real remains." The ink pot's mother-of-pearl inlay and chrome instruments provide tactile anchors. Spatial choreography is clear (embalming table, second table with covered body, doorway). The setting charges the closure by making Vincent's breakdown occur in a room defined by final truth. Does not fully constrain a mid-scene choice, preventing higher band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    The blooming bonsai labyrinth functions as micro-setting throughout: disproportionate cherry blossoms and exposed maple roots both constrain her observations and charge the final choice at the proportional oak. Fluorescent lamps are handled concretely (hum frequencies, flickering tubes decades old) and their sensory hierarchy—minor third = compression, perfect fifth = expansion—directly shapes her charting practice. The mountaintop silence contrasts with the town's homogeneous quiet below, making the labyrinth's differentiated temporal zones essential to her purpose. Spatial choreography remains clean across her movement deeper into the maze. The setting qualifies for the 9-band gate (environment constrains choice and charges the final image), but sensory selection occasionally tilts decorative (e.g., "pink luminescence refracting through fluorescent tubes") without immediately altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The container labyrinth is rendered through specific, purposeful detail: "rust streaks," "spray-painted numbers," "blue container on the eastern stack," "high tide sometimes reached." The setting actively constrains Maya's world (she "drifted to the forgotten edge") and the rising tide in the final scene provides environmental pressure that paces the revelation. The poison label wedged "between two containers in the lower tier, where high tide sometimes reached" uses micro-setting to charge a key object. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the containers function thematically as "monuments to replacement" without becoming merely symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    The observatory setting—cracked dome, rusted telescopes, peeling star charts—establishes decay and abandonment vividly. The cello and painted shell function as micro-setting anchors that constrain the final choice: Mira leaves the cello "standing vigil" and takes the shell, a spatial and symbolic choreography that charges the closure. The ocean's resonant hum outside bookends the interior hums, linking environment to theme. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Mira's professional skepticism turning toward wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    The raft city is rendered through calliope music, fried dough, painted faces, interconnected platforms that bob and sway—sensory detail filtered through Marina's familiarity. The foundation stone chip constrains her final stance, a tangible reminder of what happens when motion stops. Spatial choreography is clear (platforms, edges, speedboats cutting wakes), and the carnival's physicality pressures the gentrification conflict throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    The moonlit summit, honeycomb mountain, and moonflowers are vivid and purposeful. The chemical vials and camera setup provide tactile grounding that constrains Chen's choices (timing, positioning). The space-age context is established but remains backdrop rather than pressure. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The flowers and crater charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting participation.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mist-coated rail depot is vividly anchored with copper pipes, water features, and high windows that create acoustic geography. Sensory detail is filtered through Mara's blindness: she reads vibrations, temperature shifts, and sound echoes rather than sight. The water basin is micro-setting that constrains and enables the repair—it's not decorative but functional, translating refraction patterns into tactile feedback. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting charges the final image: Mara surrounded by "railway bones and running water" embodies her rebuilt life and ongoing mission.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.1)
    The frozen lake, rusted outpost, and condensation on glass create vivid atmosphere. The ice constrains Mira's timeline ("finally thin enough") and the outpost's decay signals isolation. Sensory detail is selective (ice crystals on falcon wings, breath patterns, rust-streaked walls). However, the setting primarily frames rather than pressures choice; Mira's departure feels scheduled rather than forced by environment. The final image of "ice older than cartography" charges the ending but the micro-setting does not alter tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    Ashwood is anchored clearly: ancient archway, cobblestones, hollow-eyed buildings, the tower bell. Sensory detail is present but generic ("amber light," "wild hush," "wind through empty spaces") and rarely filtered through POV urgency. The cobblestones and archway recur, and the bell tuner's footsteps on stone function as micro-setting that charges the final image when the bell seals. Spatial choreography is legible; the tuner walks the square, climbs the tower, exits through the archway. However, setting description often stalls momentum rather than interweaving with action, and the "wild hush" tone is invoked more than embodied through lived sensory hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    The temple's limestone pillars, kelp shrouds, and altar ground the rescue choreography. The vial's physical properties (thumb-sized, shifting surface, warm against thigh) recur and constrain Mara's attention. Sensory hierarchy fits urgency: flashing oxygen gauge and comm link dominate crisis beats, while the gathered hush returns in the reflective exit moment. The submersible's emergency oxygen supply functions as a concrete resource that enables the ascent. Minor: no occupation-specific diving detail beyond oxygen gauge, but at this length the choice reads economical rather than thin.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, and impossible nested rooms create vivid spatial specificity. Copperlight as a recurring sensory anchor charges the final image effectively. The lattice panel returns with reweighted meaning at closure. However, the chapel and hidden passage remain tour-guide legible without constraining Matthias's choices or forcing navigational trade-offs; he walks through without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    The alchemical greenhouse is vividly anchored with sensory specificity: fogged panes, mercury and rose petals, silver apples, dark soil. The setting constrains Marcus's choice—he must plant the bead "beneath the oldest tree"—and the endless night literalizes the stalled transmutation, charging the final image when dawn breaks. Spatial choreography is clear (door, quince trees, oldest tree), and the micro-setting (soil, bead, tree) directly enables the closure act. The winter-cracked fields frame the piece but remain backdrop; the greenhouse interior does the causal work.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    The red canyon labyrinth is vividly rendered with vermillion walls, crumbling corridors, and silk threads catching dawn light. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, filtered through the weaver's craft idiom (knots, bridges of thread, "grammar of possibility"). The illustration plate anchors her work spatially, and the environment supplies material constraint (crevices, stone, distances). The setting charges the final image (rose gold sunrise), meeting the 9+ gate, but micro-setting pressure on individual choices remains light—threads mark paths retroactively rather than altering tactics in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    The orchard-catacomb fusion is vivid and specific: roots coiling around skulls, bronze inscription, apple trees above graves. Spatial choreography is clear across surface and underground. The sundial pedestal and the intertwined roots constrain Miriam's clearing work and charge the final image of light filtering through "roots and bones above." The setting participates in closure and enables the central metaphor, meeting the 9+ gate test for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    The golden arcade is vivid and selective: brass columns, amber glass ceiling, worn marble floor, and the mail slot's cool brass edges ground the single scene. The chalk drawings function as micro-setting, constraining Iris's choice (she waits for the "safe" codes before mailing) and charging the final image when dawn light makes them glow before erasure. Smog-thick sky and "2247, New Manila" establish futuristic locale without catalog. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The arcade's historical weight (two centuries old, "permanence of physical spaces") mirrors Iris's thematic stakes without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt observatory, copper dome, bronze candle housing, and autumn wind establish vivid atmosphere. The eternal flame constrains Mirelle's decoding work and times military movements, participating in closure when it "brightened again as dawn passed." Spatial choreography (workstation, southern window, courtyard, library) tracks cleanly. However, much setting detail (tarnished dome, velvet, bronze housing) decorates without altering tactics. The observatory's professional systems (astronomical work, military occupation) remain generic; we never see how the space's actual function pressures her choices beyond providing cover.

    The mangrove houseboat, singing spirits, and moonlight filtering through the canopy create a vivid, specific locale that anchors the ritual atmosphere. The gargoyle shard as a handled object and the condensation on the window provide tactile micro-setting details. The environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure, but it charges the final image and integrates smoothly with tone and action.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting provides functional constraint: the mist-filled atrium frames the anesthetic haze and isolation, while the former-hotel-now-hospital signals the makeshift infrastructure of conflict zones. The coral fragment as micro-setting object recurs with shifting weight and charges the final image directly. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (throbbing arm, medication bloom, mist texture). Minor gap: the bombed school and village geography remain somewhat abstract, serving as backstory anchor rather than spatial pressure on present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ruined orchard district, perpetual fog, and phosphorescent pigments anchor setting vividly and filter through Mara's professional priorities. The fragment propped against the wall becomes a spatial anchor that constrains her perception and shapes the studio mural choice. Sensory hierarchy is strong: "thick fog," "columns" of light, "ghost-shapes of apple blossoms." The studio wall as micro-setting charges the closure when it "blazed" and seemed to move, directly enabling the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sound wave garden is vividly rendered with specific mechanics (parabolic dishes, bronze chimes, curved walls bouncing footsteps) and directly constrains Lena's choice—she hears her own voice reflected impossibly, drawing her back to the mural with new conviction. The hobo nickel as micro-setting object charges the final image, sitting on the workbench pointing "always downward, always toward the next layer." Spatial choreography is clean (scaffolding, garden, wall). The vibration she feels through stone and brush is filtered through her professional attention and becomes a tactile anchor for the nested-awakening premise.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.2)
    The greenhouse is vividly rendered with chrysanthemums, elephant ear leaves, cork boards, and Morpho butterflies, and the humid atmosphere charges several beats. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics at closure—the convergence proceeds without spatial friction. The butterflies' swirling vortex is described but does not impose a cost or resource limit that shapes the final "begin." Solid sensory grounding and purposeful detail, but the setting remains backdrop rather than active pressure at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.1)
    The gargantuan shell is vividly established with spiral chambers, nacre, and reef-shadows; sensory details are filtered through the poet's 300-year residence and photosynthesis metaphor. The shell constrains her existence (cave/cathedral both) and recurs in the final image with reef-shadows across poem-covered walls. However, the environment does not materially alter a choice or tactic on the page; it anchors atmosphere without forcing a trade-off. Micro-setting participation earns mid-7s but not higher.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    The opal library, glass orchids, and clouds create a vivid micro-setting that constrains Miren's work (dawn watering, prismatic light timing) and charges the final image (opal walls as prism of memories). The cracked bamboo chime functions as a tactile object that Miren handles across multiple beats, its physical properties (cool, light, fractured tone) shaping her choice. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Miren's professional attention. The setting's specificity (above the clouds, climate-controlled vaults below) grounds the conceptual museum without excessive exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive's dust, obsidian desk, iron stairs, and crystalline ink well create a tactile subterranean world. The Varesh minerals and extinct-civilization caverns ground the magical ink in geography. The ink well constrains and enables the pivotal action—without its special properties, the truth-forcing mechanism fails—and returns in the final image refracting light, charging closure. Spatial choreography (Mira at desk, Marcus descending stairs, parchment passed, hands meeting beside the ink well) tracks cleanly. Sensory hierarchy favors the visual (lamplight, prismatic refractions) with minimal non-visual detail; the "smell of dust and possibility" opens but doesn't recur under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.1)
    The amphitheater and volcano setting are vivid and purposeful: the "breathing" stones, basalt ribs, geothermal channels, and frescoes all ground the scene and supply the physical constraint that Mira must solve. The surveyor's chain functions as micro-setting (body/tool) and is handled across multiple beats, warm from her body heat, stretching across grooves, gleaming at her hip. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's professional lens—pressure channels, mineral deposits, temperature gradients. The frescoes' gestures of community subtly mirror the thematic question. The environment constrains her choice and charges the final image when the amphitheater "breathes with her" and the mountain "had been waiting for someone to harmonize its contradictions."

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    The attic is vividly anchored (leather bindings, decades of stillness, towers of manuscripts, single skylight) and the meteorite chip, phonograph cylinders, and dust motes all constrain or charge Clara's attention. The skylight beam creates a micro-setting that Clara uses to map air currents, directly linking to her pigeon-trainer past and present cataloging choice. The bookshop below and Marcus's movement provide spatial layering. The meteorite placed on the windowsill charges the final image by anchoring her present self.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "drifting prism terrace" functions as micro-setting, providing tactile constraint through the wooden rail whose grain Mara reads for clues. The terrace's "impossible surface" and "crystalline edges refracting nothing into everything" establish atmospheric coherence without overwhelming the scene. The oak rail's growth rings anchor multiple beats and charge the final choice to honor thresholds. Spatial choreography is clear (boundary, rail, Thomas approaching), and the gray expanse pressures direction-finding without conventional space.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    The underwater research facility is vividly realized: observation dome, curved water, pressurized warren, sleep pods. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric (ozone and salt scent, bioluminescent creatures, spires pulsing). The burnt feather drifting through water and the translucent thumb-sized creatures provide tactile, scale-specific anchors. The setting constrains choice (pressure suits required, submersible arrival at sunrise) and charges the final image of descent preparation. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    The iridescent cave is vividly rendered with shifting rainbows and crater glass, and it charges the closure image. The geode's crystalline walls function as both setting and discovery mechanism, constraining Marina's window (three hours before tide) and supplying the pool that reveals unmade paths. Spatial choreography is clear: descent, kneeling at the pool, climbing toward daylight. The cave's light and the pool's glassy surface anchor her transliteration work and the final image of "a million unmade moments" waiting in the mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tidal arcade is not mere backdrop—its twice-daily emergence and four-hour window create urgency and frame Mara's liminal performance space. Kelp-dripping columns, constellation LEDs, and the turning tide all constrain her timing and charge the final image ("saltwater would cover these stones again, erasing tonight's careful choreography"). The chess set on driftwood, the bishop in her pocket, and the acoustic properties she's mapped function as micro-setting that shapes her choices. Sensory detail (violinist's melody drifting, juggler's pins flashing with waves) is filtered through Mara's orchestration lens and supports the serendipity theme without catalog listing.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    The twilight garden's crystalline petals, gravity generators, and pale stones provide vivid anchors and recurring micro-setting detail. The flowers turning toward Kaleth in paragraph eight and the final sunrise frame constrain perception and charge the closure image with a shift from starlit motion to still dawn. Spatial choreography (rows, path, final pose) remains coherent. The garden functions as both stage and responsive element, elevating it above postcard description, though the tool (moonstone) does more causal work than the setting itself.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pearl Bay at dawn is rendered with purposeful sensory specificity: mist clinging "like breath on glass," noctilucent clouds catching pre-dawn light, the sunken pond formed by rain. The prism atrium functions as micro-setting, its broken ceiling and geometric panels creating interference patterns that directly prime the thematic insight. Spatial choreography (Martin at pond's edge, pillars reflected in water, rings spreading outward) remains coherent and the dawn progression tracks cleanly. The stone from his pocket and the pond's still surface constrain his exploratory gesture and charge the final turn, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting/object constrain choice or charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    The moonlit ridge, charred stumps, and regenerating aspens provide vivid, selective detail filtered through Marcus's firefighter lens. The cracked porcelain box is handled twice (carried, then opened) and its physical presence anchors the ending image. Sensory hierarchy is appropriate: silvered aspens, burn scars catching moonlight. However, the celestial dance motif (Jupiter, Mars, the moon) reads as ornamental rather than constraining any choice or charging the final image with spatial or temporal pressure. The valley overlook functions as a contemplation stage, not as micro-setting that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tide-polished grotto is vividly rendered with bioluminescent algae, calcite formations, and tidal surges that mark time and pressure. The altitude gauge functions as a recurring object that shifts from frozen memorial to active instrument, directly charging the final image when Mira places it at the pattern's center. Spatial choreography (shells, glass, gauge placement) is clear and purposeful. The grotto's translucent walls at the climax constrain perception and signal the timeline merge, elevating the setting beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Setting is vivid and specific: ivy with "roots that cracked stone like paper," "half-burned diaries," marble fireplace. The ivy-veiled passage returns at the end with reweighted meaning ("already dreaming of her return"), charging the final image. However, the environment doesn't constrain a choice during the story; it functions primarily as atmosphere and symbol rather than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prism parapet functions as micro-setting: it catches and multiplies mirages, scatters reflections into puddles, and the wet stone terrace provides tactile grounding (footsteps, shallow puddles, breaking light). The bell timeframe tightens decisions (Vesper paints faster as the window closes). Sensory hierarchy is consistent—visual detail dominates but is filtered through Vesper's mirage-painter priorities. The environment constrains the work window and the parapet's refractive properties enable the dispersal, charging the closure when children's voices rise from balconies below.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    The terrace's "scorch marks from bombardments and blood from ancient sacrifices" layers history into setting without catalog. Midsummer heat "pressed down like divine attention" during the ritual, and the clipboard's tactile presence (dark wood absorbing light, pages fluttering) charges multiple beats. The object constrains choice by creating ritual gravity that pulls negotiators back twice. Minor gap: the valleys where harvests burned remain abstract; no sensory detail grounds the immediate negotiation space beyond the terrace stone.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    The salt flat, fissures, alkaline dust, and storm are vivid and selective. The footprint pattern constrains Marcus's final choice—he kneels at "this exact coordinates" because the cracks converge there. The setting charges the closure: rain dissolves the map he engineered, salt under his feet liquefies. Minor gap: the helicopter's quarter-mile distance and the pilot's later questions are mentioned but not woven into spatial choreography during the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.1)
    The silver courtyard and prism sanctuary are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail ("each flake catching starlight like scattered diamonds," "faceted walls revealing the web's true nature"). The crystalline pavilion constrains Celestine's action—she must work within its geometry—and the snow swirls in patterns matching her heartbeat, linking environment to internal state. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting charges the final image (guards finding her in the courtyard conducting an invisible orchestra), meeting the 9+ gate criterion of environment shaping the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dome is well-chosen and purposeful: "designed once to track objects hurtling through space, to provide warning and protection. Now it tracked nothing, protected no one" mirrors Marcus's emptied method and charges the reversal. The "meteor hush" and "uncommonly serene silence" anchor tone throughout. Spatial choreography is clear (portable stage in center, radar operators' seats, high windows). The setting does not constrain a choice with visible friction, which limits the score, but it effectively mirrors internal state and supports the final image of walking toward the exit with new intent.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto's impossible altitude and verdant specificity (moss, ferns, spring "from nowhere") constrain the entire action and charge the premise with wonder. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Mira's architectural attention: bamboo joints, hemp rope, silk dissolution, "blushing stillness" at sunset. The moth wing in glass and the monarchs clustering on her tower create tactile, purpose-driven anchors. The grotto's transient legend (appearing/vanishing across decades) mirrors and supports the thematic commitment to impermanence, satisfying the 9+ gate by directly charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound sanctum, aurora, and ceremonial rope constrain Mira's choices: she must use the rope's history and the punched card's holes to encode memory, and the setting's isolation frames the stakes. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("breath forming crystals," "green fire," "hissed and sang"), filtered through her caster's attention to material and form. The micro-setting (rope, tools, mold) charges the final image when the bells are hung where monks prayed, creating a spatial echo that amplifies the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.2)
    The vine-draped bunker and rewilded forest are evocatively rendered with strong sensory selection (chlorophyll thickness, rust and rain yet to fall, amber twilight). However, the environment remains scenic backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or charge the final image in a way that alters her options. The wafer seals are handled twice (entrance seal, then the archive wall), which provides concrete detail, but spatial choreography inside the bunker is loose and the storm's proximity does not materially pressure her movements.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.1)
    The palace observatory, dusky lighting, and desert coordinates are vivid and purposeful. Shadow-angle revelation of hidden symbols is a strong micro-setting constraint that drives the middle turn. The final excavation sequence grounds the closure in tactile action (digging with hands, resonating ground). Sensory hierarchy reflects the astronomer's professional focus throughout, and the "dusky harmony" motif recurs with reweighted meaning at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Sanctuary's soundless vault and light-text communication are vivid and consistent, pressuring dialogue into visual form. The music box functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when the pin materializes. Spatial choreography is clean (table, robes, box). However, "cellular memory" and "shifting grace" remain conceptual rather than anchored in sensory or environmental constraint—no texture of how memories manifest bodily or how the walls "becoming transparent" alters Kale's immediate choices beyond passive viewing.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ruined orchard, calcified apple trees, frost patterns, and fog with breath-like rhythm create a vivid, coherent micro-setting. Spatial choreography is clean: workshop interior, windows, doorstep, fog beyond. The frost that "wouldn't melt" becomes a material ingredient, directly constraining Aria's technique. The setting charges the final image when "fog settled peacefully around the workshop, no longer erasing boundaries but illuminating them." Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Aria's craft-focused attention. The "glass-mountain fog" tone integrates with the mirror-maker's perceptual bias.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cathedral-orchard fusion is vivid and purposeful: "apple trees grew wild through the nave, their branches threading between ancient rafters" establishes both visual specificity and thematic ground. The grinding stone (micro-setting object) constrains the final teaching choice and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean: broken window → orchard undergrowth → ladder → platforms → final shared workspace. The setting subtly mirrors internal states (abandoned consecrated space finding new life) without overt symbolism, and sensory detail stays selective rather than catalog-like.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    The astral orchard is vividly rendered with selective detail: peach trees drinking starlight through crystalline substrate, pistachio shells as micro-etchings, a mirror showing three-second-delayed reflections. The bathroom functions as micro-setting, constraining her breakthrough moment and tying to her established pattern. The spiral arrangement of trees guides her to the central pistachio, shaping the discovery beat. The setting charges the final image—phosphorescent twilight and impossible fruit frame her acceptance—meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bookstore's labyrinthine geometry, spiral shelves, and "unheard symphony" are vividly rendered and perceptually specific. The botanical diary functions as a micro-setting object that recurs and charges the final image (blank pages filling). However, the environment does not constrain a choice during the descent; Marin's careful resource management (battery, water, markers) is mentioned but never forces a tactical trade-off. The setting's sensory signature (frequencies in bone and blood, dust in meaningful configurations) is memorable and filtered through Marin's arcane-linguist lens.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The carnival ship is rendered with purposeful specificity—salt-crusted portholes, rusted hull, corroded bumper cars, funhouse mirrors—and the fog operates as both atmosphere and metaphor for memory's fluidity. The ship's listing and the carousel restarting are tied to Mira's choice, grounding closure in spatial change. The emerald card functions as micro-setting object, guiding movement and constraining perception. Minor gap: the "fleet of abandoned vessels" arrives only in the final image without prior spatial priming, slightly reducing anchoring at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mechanism room is vividly rendered with concrete details (brass gears, iron wheels, geometric moonlight shadows, workbenches) that create atmosphere. The ceremonial rope functions as both setting anchor and tool, constraining Maren's choices through its physical presence and the time required to rebraid it. The room's responsive reconfiguration ("shadows shifted without the moon moving") charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the braiding sequence, and the clock tower's verticality bookends the piece with her descent.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    The harmonic caves constrain Kael's path (he follows mental maps, reads ice fractals to avoid dead ends) and the echo chamber stone charges the final image by glowing and spreading silence. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "ripple marks like waves frozen mid-crash," bioluminescent algae-light, the low-frequency thrumming felt rather than heard. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through three chambers to the alcove. The setting reads as micro-environment rather than postcard; it actively shapes the resolution by amplifying the counter-frequency through "stone channels toward the surface."

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.1)
    The glass pavilion's "song" recurs and is vivid, but functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining Esme's choices. Spatial grounding is coherent (tower, beacon chamber, ruins below), and the star charts overlay onto the collapsed city creates a purposeful detail. The three locations (Temple of Echoes, Whispering Gallery, Silence Archive) are named but not visited on the page, reducing their pressure. The "shard of hush" concept is intriguing but remains abstract; no tactile interaction or sensory limit shapes the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stormlit observatory, fog-as-architecture, and crystal formations are vivid and purposeful. The central crystal's shadow loop constrains Elden's final interpretive choice, and the setting charges the ending image (quill tumbling through clouds, fog holding firm). Sensory detail is selective and tied to POV priorities (droplets refracting lightning, whispering voices). The micro-setting (crystal surfaces, shadow angles) functions as the constraint that drives the plot turn.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Evening primrose, spiral path, courtyard mosaics, and the blooming fortress itself all anchor spatially and filter through Kael's professional lens (he reads instructions in tile as technique). The kerosene knot functions as micro-setting, constraining his muscle memory and enabling the final turn. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "pale petals catching amber light," "hush of a night with no stars." The fortress charges the closure image by holding the community's collective practice. No major slips; the setting does more than backdrop work.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto under stars is anchored early with vivid, purposeful detail (mineral deposits resembling constellations, tidal pools as discrete worlds, salt-thick air). Sensory selection reflects Chen's professional priorities (water level rising a centimeter, hermit crab retreating) and the setting's cyclical transformation mirrors the thematic question. The environment subtly guides the conversation's resolution—Chen kneels by a pool, Mira joins him—grounding the epiphany in tactile observation. The micro-setting (tidal pools) constrains and charges the final image of patience and returning tides.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    The trellis setting constrains choice throughout: cloudvines enable her upward swing during inversion, and the three-mile height literalizes her claustrophobia's inverse (sky that stretches and contracts). The inverted gravity functions as both temporal pressure and spatial reconfiguration. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (the "devastating" frequency of her mother's sighs, the porcelain hand's touch). The final image of cloudvines "reaching against expectation" charges closure by mirroring Mira's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    The drifting prism terrace suspended on cables with refracted light cascading in sheets is vivid and purpose-driven; Marco's motor reduction and drift through the geometric heart directly enable the therapeutic moment. The storm glass vial recurs across beats, its crystal formations acting as both teaching tool and atmospheric anchor. Micro-setting (gondola console, vial, cable creak, river murmur) filters through Marco's professional attention and constrains his choices (speed, course adjustments), charging the final image when Elena touches the vial and sees fern patterns before peaceful weather.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard's circuit-bark and fiber-optic waterfall constrain Kaida's path and charge the final throne-room choice. Smart-stone walls shifting through programmed seasons anchor the futuristic setting with purpose. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from chapel to rail-bike to ruins to orchard to throne room. The glass-floor peeling and descending stairway serve as micro-setting that alters the closure image decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sanctuary's charcoal pillars, ash underfoot, and silent doorknocker create vivid texture and anchor the tone. Spatial choreography is coherent: Mara seated among pews, the girl at the entrance, then inside without stepping forward. The setting charges the final image (stars watching, pillars as witness) but does not materially constrain a middle choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure on decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vivid and specific, casting "seventeen different directions" of shadow. The submarine bolt materializes with tactile weight. However, the breach itself is visually vague ("wound in reality"), and spatial choreography during the sealing is unclear—how does she turn the bolt, where does she stand? The quantum diamonds appear but lack physical grounding (size, heft, texture). The farm does constrain her path to the breach but does not force a tactical trade-off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sepia reading room is anchored early with sensory detail (vanilla, dust, amber light, mahogany shelves, parquet floor). The gramophone and crank handle are handled concretely and constrain the sequence of discovery. The setting supports atmosphere and the mechanical specificity (standing waves, acoustic measurement instruments) grounds the plot turn. However, the environment does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters Cassian's final decision—he uses the space as a stage for discovery rather than navigating it under constraint. The "golden shadows" motif recurs but remains decorative rather than shaping tactics or the closure image with concrete cost.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    The alchemical greenhouse is vivid and functional: endless night, reality shifts, fruit that hums/sings, branches forming an amphitheater all constrain and enable the knight's final pattern work. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (trees reorganize, armor falls, strings attach). The environment charges the closure image when the fruit "blazed with light that pushed back the endless night," directly reweighting the prior darkness motif. Meets the 9+ gate test (environment shapes the final image), but sensory selection leans visual/auditory without embodied urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    The file room is vividly rendered (paper decay, metal shelves, afternoon light, dust patterns as "accidental archives") and constrains Miriam's discovery through physical proximity and archival taxonomy. The dust patterns function as micro-setting that drives the inciting search. The 1867–1875 post-emancipation county placement center adds historical texture without slowing momentum. The button, letters, and adoption papers are handled on the page and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting as constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    The auric lagoon is vivid and purposeful: mineral content enables the puddle-map, the hatch beneath the rocky edge provides escape, and the searchlight sweeping golden water charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective—starlight, lapping water, darkness—and filtered through Mira's operational priorities. The phone booth key and the vault function as micro-setting elements that constrain and enable tactics. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto's prism atrium constrains Marcus's method (sound amplification through quartz columns) and the mist/dewdrops recur with reweighted meaning in the final paragraph. Micro-setting details (condensation forming on stone, water dripping) respond to the music and charge the closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects Marcus's professional focus on acoustics ("frequencies that didn't echo but absorbed"). The spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single-location scene.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly rendered with selective detail (pale branches, silver leaves, copper light through canopy) and guides Miren's actions throughout—she charts leaves, touches bark, arranges seeds in the arbor's heart. Spatial choreography remains clear across the floating structure. The setting constrains her choices (vault cataloging, leaf-pattern observation) and charges the final image of branches reaching toward reconciliation, satisfying the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.1)
    The subterranean waterfall and workshop anchor setting vividly with concrete sensory detail (mist keeping rust at bay, moss on tool racks). The waterfall's mist directly affects Marcus's work and its "purposeful" roar charges the final realization. The greenhouse and swirling leaves function as micro-setting, guiding Marcus to the hidden chamber and serving as a threshold that reflects his acceptance of chaos—elevating this above decoration to constraint and closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    The foundry's steam, firelight, rain, and tin roof create tactile atmosphere. The zodiac coin itself functions as micro-setting, constraining Mara's choice (she must use gold, heat, precision) and charging the final handoff. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from workbench to crucible to magistrate's door. The candlelit window in the final beat serves as environmental reconfiguration that mirrors the internal shift, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment shaping the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    The gorge functions as active setting: its echoes layer guilt, and the narrow point forces confrontation. The crocodile's tooth and warped harp are handled on the page and constrain her method. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("pale threads," "scorch marks—old pain, burned deep"). The limestone switchbacks and outcropping provide clear spatial choreography. The setting charges the final image when the gorge falls silent, marking the soul's release.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ultraviolet forest is vividly specific—bioluminescent veins, pewter masks, geometric tree arrangements—and directly constrains Sera's choices by soothing her nervous system through harmonic ratios. The clearing's "equal angles, perfect ratios" function as micro-setting that alters her stance. Sensory detail (violet glow, bark texture, electromagnetic signatures) filters through her enhanced perception. The forest charges the final image: planting in "calculated mercy grown in soil" transforms the setting from dump site to sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.9)
    The alchemist's market is rendered with vivid, repurposed detail (tenement floors, factory-loom cables) and Mira's use of the lens fragment transforms her perception on the page, fulfilling the micro-setting standard. Spatial choreography is clear across market visit, studio work, and final exhibition; the lighthouse fragment constrains her method and charges the closure image by splitting sunset into "colors that named all the spaces between." Sensory selection (curved glass, impossible colors, open-air platforms) reflects urgency and integrates with action. The setting actively guides choice and amplifies the thematic resonance without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is vivid and purposeful: warped counter, curling posters, water-stained tiles. The ceiling itself constrains Marcus's discovery—he must drag a rickety chair, press gently, lift the box down—micro-setting choices that alter tactics. Dust accumulation patterns (his trained eye) guide the find. The setting pressures his professional task (assess the elevator) against the ghost's urgency, and the final turn to "the broken elevator" bookends the space with purpose. Sensory hierarchy reflects his expertise: he notices "disturbance" in dust before anything decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glass orchard library and cloud sea anchor the piece with vivid, purposeful detail—glass fruit chiming, frost forming, the structure rotating. The environment directly constrains Marina's choice: the library's equilibrium depends on her maintenance, and its destabilization forces her to grab a branch and reckon with motion. Sensory hierarchy shifts appropriately as tension rises (silent conservatory → rustling pages → reading rainbows). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    The baroque architecture constrains Kasimir's interpretive choice—the spirals "echoing fractured edges" provide the evidence against Vhen's merchant theory. Time-light threads function as micro-setting, recurring across beats to mark philosophical shifts and charging the final image ("moments, like vases, were fragile things"). Sensory detail is filtered through a cataloguer's attention: "gilt edges catching amber light," "prismatic ghosts." The asteroid as ruin-site shapes his revolutionary repositioning from destroyer to preserver.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    The resonance chamber functions as micro-setting that enables the repair: "sound accumulated and amplified, notes building upon themselves until they achieved a kind of physical weight." Sensory detail is purposeful (lantern light on mahogany, shimmer of interference patterns) and filtered through Aldric's professional attention. The forget-me-not and the tools (meteoric tuning fork, dawn-oils) constrain his method and charge the final transformation. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single-location scene. The chamber's acoustic properties directly enable the solution, meeting the 9+ gate criterion.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.1)
    The subterranean lagoon is rendered with purposeful sensory specificity: phosphorescent limestone, "resonant hush," petrichor "magnified a thousandfold." Spatial choreography is clear through the two-hour descent and Mara's wade to chest-depth. The water constrains her final choice—she must remove boots, the coolness is "inevitable"—and charges the closure image when she dives. Micro-setting works effectively: the compass, vials, and her body in water function as setting elements that alter tactics and meaning. The factory closure frames temporal context without occupying excessive real estate.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.1)
    The archway functions as micro-setting that constrains movement ("half-choked with kelp and debris") and charges the threshold metaphor at closure. Sensory detail is purposeful: "wind sang through cracks with a low, mechanical hum" filters through Maya's artist perception. The lantern slide as object-setting provides tactile discovery ("corroded brass frame," scratched inscriptions) that alters her artistic stance. The root-ball's "twisted chambers catching water and light" is specific enough to pre-visualize the sculpture, grounding the conceptual turn in physical material. Spatial choreography remains clean across the brief journey.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    The amber pavilion constrains action spatially (hexagonal table, spreading postcards, emptying of visitors creates dawning hush) and the glass panels provide a recurring sensory anchor that modulates with time of day ("deepened to copper, then bronze"). The cathedral windows function as micro-setting through Father Benedict's explanation, which directly charges the closure image by teaching Mara how to see layered transparency. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's artist priorities (luminous faded ink, backlit outline, spidery handwriting). However, the autumn-versus-winter timeline creates a small inconsistency (opening says "melting of winter's last snow" suggesting spring, ending says "autumn evening"), preventing entry to the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    The zeppelin library, copper clouds, and obsidian lagoon create a vivid, specific world. The lagoon's unrippled surface and Sarai's beach-debris messages anchor the setting with purposeful sensory detail. Spatial choreography is clean—descent, dune crossing, lagoon edge—and the zeppelin's waiting engines frame the final image. The obsidian waters constrain and charge the closure (Malik kneels, looks, cannot look away), pushing the score toward the 9+ gate. However, the Khamsin Trials and Obsidian Wastes remain generic placeholders without lived-in texture or POV filtering, and the floating library itself provides no material constraint or resource during the story's central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cove's skeleton—paper lanterns, rusted hooks, wish-house echoes, dock grooves—supplies Miranda's raw material for reconstruction. Sensory detail (torn rice paper "like the breathing of something long dead") is vivid and filtered through her alchemical lens. The bottle's amber surface and swirling patterns anchor repeated beats. However, spatial choreography during the revival phase is vague; we see no tactile interaction with rebuilt structures or lanterns being lit on the page, only summary.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.7)
    The ancient orchard atop Meridian Tower is vivid and specific, and the crystalline pavilion anchors key beats. However, the setting functions primarily as atmosphere rather than constraint; neither the forty-story height nor the ancient trees pressure Marcus's choices. The wax shavings "moving like living things" in response to warmth is the strongest micro-setting moment, charging the first closure beat, but the adult return reuses the same garden without spatial evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound atrium under starlight is vividly anchored early and the ice's retreat tracks causally across the arc. The acorn cap functions as micro-setting: it measures seeds, presses against ice, and plants the final seed, constraining Mara's ritual and charging the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (glass dome distorting stars, frost retreating, wet earth). The vault and its seeds supply concrete resources that affect outcome. One small gap: the probability hatchling "with wings and purpose" arrives as description rather than a dramatized constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    The windblown sanctuary, hemp rope texture, altitude ("two miles above"), and cathedral architecture ground the setting early. The rope itself functions as micro-setting: its vibration constrains Mara's choice (she overrides the digital system because the rope "knew"). Sensory detail is filtered through her expertise (barometric pressure, atmospheric rivers, "solstice hush"). The final image—rope settling into stillness—charges closure by embodying her patient vigilance. Environment actively shapes the climactic decision.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    The yellow lantern glass, telescope, viewport, and mop function as micro-setting that charges the ritualistic atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "amber warmth," "cosmic particles," "polished brass." The station's emptiness and automated payments are economically sketched. The lantern glass appears in three beats (morning polish, tonight's lighting, final flicker) and its golden glow merging with meteor streaks creates the story's central image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the void-edge dust anchors the cleaning action in tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The scorched wasteland, bleached hives, and lone eucalyptus create a vivid, purposeful frame. The stained glass box functions as micro-setting, charged with meaning and handled across beats. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric ("copper sun," "crumbled at her touch," "light like captured honey"). The oasis geography is coherent, and the ghosts' nightly gathering at the spring constrains Mara's timing and staging of the ritual. The setting directly enables the closure moment, charging the final image with place-specific resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    The emerald silo is vividly anchored early and its transparent panels frame the ending star-gaze, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective: "green glass panels catching light," "gold lettering," "emerald tower." The micro-setting of Mira's collection arranged in "careful sequences" subtly guides the ritual scene. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the gathering. The silo's symbolic and physical presence constrains Mira's solitary work and shapes the group's convergence, meeting the 9+ threshold for setting as crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt lagoon after rain supplies vivid sensory anchors ("rain-smoothed surface," "cattails," "driftwood writing table") and the drake's emergence creates a tactile micro-event that charges the feather. The post-rain clearing wind and beaded jacket ground the temporal window. The setting constrains Maren's action (she must wade in, shoes growing heavy) and the lagoon's mirror-stillness at closure visually reinforces thematic resolution. Micro-setting (body, feather, water) functions effectively as constraint and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    The temple orchard and living limestone pillars function as more than backdrop: the porous stone constrains Maren's remodeling choices (she must open sealed channels, maintain porosity for mycorrhizal networks) and the setting charges the final image where stone, wood, and flesh speak together. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (iron reds and copper greens blooming, pillars humming with insect activity). The micro-setting elements (copper wire, fungi fruiting bodies in connecting lines) constrain specific actions and participate in the closure beat. Spatial choreography remains clear across the orchard's sectors. The body-as-tool filter (Maren's weakening in the final week) shapes her final choice to sit and write rather than continue physical work.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tower, sculpture garden, muddy footprints, spring rain, and amber function as micro-settings that constrain Elara's reflective choices and charge the closure. Rain washing her footprints in the final paragraph directly images the erasure/layering paradox central to her realization. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her academic-turned-experiential lens ("wet stone and new leaves," "bronze bells," "bronze-gray morning"). The overgrown sculptures provide spatial grounding and thematic resonance without postcard excess.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.1)
    Twilight jetty is vividly rendered—ash and violet horizon, salt-crusted boards, dew-slick wood—and the submerged freshwater springs create a concrete constraint (the "concord" determines which seeds go where). Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through the coachman's practiced eye. The narrow jetty stretching into "vastness of darkening water" delivers the required tonal contradiction. The environment directly shapes his planting choices: southern corner needs salt-resistant pods, western posts get climbing vines, middle gets forget-me-nots reaching the spring layer.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.1)
    The scrapyard settlement is vivid ("iron cancer, breathing steam and rust") and the "wild hush" establishes a coherent sensory world. The preserved leaf and cylinder reader anchor Calder's workspace with purposeful detail. The wasteland's cracked earth and half-buried bunker supply the discovery that drives the plot. Spatial choreography is clean: Mercy leads three miles out, they return, Calder decodes at his bench, the settlement wakes. The leaf's veins "like roads connecting" charges the final image when Calder clips it to his pack, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    The observation deck's temporal zones are vivid and specific: titanium beams warped by gravitational flux, sound bouncing through temporal gradients, the compass rose's distorted geometry. Sensory hierarchy reflects Maya's professional astronomer lens (tracking supernovae, galaxy drift). The compass rose returns at the center and charges the final image by anchoring her stance. Spatial choreography is clear across zones, and the setting constrains her existence (adaptation to flux would prove fatal in normal spacetime), meeting the 9+ gate for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.4)
    The icebound spire, crystalline chamber, and brass sky are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Kael's awe and the guardian's ancient presence. Spatial choreography is clean: ascent, summit chamber, chess table, descent. The sundial lid functions as a micro-setting element that charges the final image by completing the broken object. However, the environment does not visibly constrain a mid-scene choice; it stages rather than pressures. Sensory detail is selective (crystals tinkling, frost-sparkled furs) but leans decorative in the middle beats rather than shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    The whispering gallery is vivid and purposeful: "stone ear," dusty skylights, and the chessboard's "luminous absence" anchor Mira's ritual spatially. The parliament's game room and the gallery's perimeter create a micro-setting that constrains her walking-word method. The setting charges the final image (dust, light, the board between them) and the gallery's acoustic design subtly mirrors the story's concern with carrying and preserving secrets. Minor: the "nomadic penumbra" zones are described but never shown pressuring a specific choice in a named district.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.6)
    The labyrinthine bookstore is vividly rendered with selective detail (candlelight spirals, Philosophy wing three levels down, passages opening where walls stood) and functions as both physical constraint and symbolic pressure. The mercury-glass body is handled tactilely (stone warming against palms, sinking into reflective surface) and constrains perception throughout. The mountain setting evolves causally—books rearrange after the stone embeds—and the final window with dawn light charges the closure image by grounding the abstract transformation in a concrete spatial anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    The time-frozen village, suspended rain, and tapestry are vivid and purposeful. The frayed border becomes a constraint that shapes Petrov's method and the closure image (imperfection as wisdom). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through his chess-tutor lens. The platinum labyrinth beneath remains abstract; it never constrains a choice or supplies a resource, serving more as thematic backdrop than setting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bone towers and mist-filled canyon are vividly rendered and actively shape the story: the echoes refract Mara's words, creating both her crime's revelation and her defense. The pale spire functions as both setting anchor and stakes object (she must climb it). Spatial choreography is clear (base of towers, elder descending, hand on bone surface), and sensory detail—fog coiling "like breath," surfaces "smooth and yellowed"—grounds the reader in this specific place that constrains and enables her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    The acid sea, grinding gears, sulfur air, and dissolving workshops create visceral constraint that narrows Maya's window to thirty-second intervals. The statue's pockmarks function as micro-setting, physically guiding her search and later supplying the map. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: burning lungs dominate during submersion, golden light and memory-quilting emerge at the trigger. The porthole glimpse of dissolved rigging charges the stakes without catalog detail. The workshop tilts with wave impacts, affecting her grip—environment actively pressures choice and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coastal cave network is vividly rendered with specific sensory anchors: "impossible turquoise," "cathedral of stone," "barnacled stones," tidal rhythms. The setting constrains her approach—she cannot capture the whole, leading directly to the shell fragmentation idea. The quay as familiar cage versus cave as hidden sanctuary provides spatial pressure that drives the thematic turn. Micro-setting (flat rock platform, crevices for shell placement) shapes tactical choices at closure. The cave's tidal impermanence directly charges the "temporary eternity" concept and the final image of distributed shells.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cobalt lighthouse, salt air, dawn light, and harbor are rendered with specific sensory detail (chipped paint, "rose and gold"). The vial of night-garden soil functions as micro-setting that charges the final beat, and the lantern room's windows serve as tactical anchor points. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting constrains Mira's method (she must work within the lighthouse's physical structure) and the breaking heat wave creates atmospheric shift, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain choice or charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dead station with broken dome, observation deck, and abandoned technology functions as micro-setting that supplies the gyroscopes and magnetic cores essential to Mara's device. The bronze censer foot serves as both object and conceptual anchor, its patina shifting constraining her interpretive choices. Sensory detail (starlight through broken dome, patina colors) is selective and tied to discovery moments. The coastal temple, repair shop, and valley below provide spatial coherence for the reverse migration without catalog bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.1)
    The hanging orchard in a storm-ravaged ravine supplies vivid setting and constrains access (hemp ladder, rope bridges). The glass eye's physical weight and "impossible green swirled through with gold" anchor tactile detail. Spatial choreography remains clear across the market and orchard scenes. The orchard directly enables the closure—people come *because* it's "a world apart"—so setting participates in the ending, meeting the 9+ gate requirement partially. Truffles and fungal networks recur with thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    The opal dock and mist supply vivid, purposeful texture ("mist pressed against him with softly persistent damp fingers") and the nautical-twilight frame constrains Magnus's investigation window. The Edelweiss and the key function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (dock, bollards, planks). Minor: the Alpine bloom surviving in salt air is noted but never exploited as a constraint or clue beyond symbol, and the lighthouse beam—central to the dead man's reach—remains metaphor rather than functional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    The blooming underground cavern is vivid and purposeful: luminescent fungi, midnight-blue orchids, star-white jasmine, wild roses at the entrance. The impossible garden signals otherworldliness and directly enables Martin's quest—the ants carry glowing fungus, the flowered vines drip with creek water, the limestone carving waits in this specific ecology. The creek-rising timeframe tightens the window and the rain at closure washes away "old tracks," charging the final image with seasonal impermanence. Spatial choreography is clean: entrance → cavern floor → ant trail → carved wall → translucent vision → exit. The setting constrains and enables the core choice.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt grotto is vividly rendered with bleeding starlight, phosphorescent trails, and the abyss; sensory detail (copper air, cold burn, geological breath) is purposeful and POV-filtered. The grotto constrains the queen's movement (she follows trails, stands at a drop) and charges the final image (she carries starlight down). Spatial choreography is coherent throughout, and the impossible fireflies at altitude anchor the turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ember nexus, nautilus shell, and workbench tools anchor the scene with selective sensory detail (copper light, pearlescent interior, glowing apparatus). The shell's columella curl functions as both measurement standard and thematic bridge, constraining Solène's technique ("each chamber a precise measurement"). The twilight setting charges the final image ("twilight's particular melancholy and promise"), meeting the 9+ gate criteria. Spatial choreography is clean (Mira's shadow falls across notes, sphere pressed into palm). Minor issue: "scientifically romantic" drifts toward label rather than lived-in occupational texture, but the core setting work is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mountain cabin, birch bark scroll, and recurring objects (cedar box, deer sinew) constrain her choices: she isolates to manage temporal displacement, uses YouTube from the future to make ink, and the scroll's physical durability matters ("outlast her confusion"). The canyon where ashes were scattered charges the final dream image. Sensory hierarchy reflects her priorities (ink-making detail, owl call, rough-hewn table texture). However, the cabin itself remains somewhat generic—"mountain ranger cabin" and "pine forests" could anchor anywhere in temperate highlands without dialect or occupational specificity shaping a tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    The water clock shop is vividly anchored with copper mechanisms, jade chambers, and occluded windows that create the hair-thin crack reveal—micro-setting that enables the diagnostic turn. The screw's tactile weight and patina are embodied and drive Elena's interpretation. Morning fog bookends the piece, modulating from enclosure to lifting, which charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: worktable, window, door positions track without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating platform constrains choice (Mira must stabilize her hands or fail), and sensory details—chains "turned silver with enchantment," tea as writing medium—are filtered through her scholarly lens. The environment evolves: pre-storm hush → rain → thunder, mirroring her internal shift. The crow quill and stone table recur with reweighted meaning at closure, charging the final image. Spatial choreography (kneeling, tracing, standing, walking toward chain-path) tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sheet music archive supplies tactile constraint (dust, manuscript pages scattering, perfume scent) and the orchard's "impossible blossoms" charge the final image with specificity. Sensory detail is selective—jasmine, rustling paper, cold draft—and filtered through Margot's professional lens (exorcist vocabulary, metaphor habit). Spatial choreography is clean (music stand, shelves, pages landing at feet). The "converted barn" and orchard setting frame the time pressure but remain slightly generic; more particularAnnotation or local idiom would lift this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    The temple library's "helical patterns" and the Arbitration Chamber's concentric spirals constrain Kael's approach—she must walk to unify, and the dictionary is placed "at the spiral's center" as a ritual anchor. Sensory detail is selective: "resounding hush," "air held a resounding hush," and "footsteps echoed both forward and backward" charge the atmosphere. The micro-setting (spiral, dictionary, ancient stones) recurs and shapes the final image when "the dictionary's pages turned themselves," but the environment could be more tactile—Kael's body and the physical act of walking are described metaphorically rather than through grounded sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    The horizon measurement station functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the hydraulic clocks, mercury tubes, and measurement scope are essential to Maren's discovery. The mantle clock with its brass key and "razor edges" charges the final act. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (hammered steel fjord, no birds, no wind). The recurring horizon image—first "so precise it could cut," then rippling "like silk," finally settling to "razor-straight certainty"—reweights meaning at closure. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rainwashed library, candle lantern with clouded mica pane, and condensation-traced window all constrain Maya's perception and enable the key discovery (negative space revealed through the warped lens). The setting is filtered through her probability-professor lens ("yellow light in a sea of grey June water") and the mica's amber distortion directly shapes the pivotal turn. Rain stopping as she leaves provides atmospheric closure without being heavy-handed. The subway seats as micro-setting recur purposefully across the narrative, grounding her obsession in a concrete, repeating place.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tunnel setting is specific and constrains action: condensation on pipes wets Sarah's fingers for the disc performance, and the "hum of streetlamps filtering down through ventilation shafts" charges the timeframe. Spatial choreography is clean (booth wedged between pipes and conduits). The glass harmonica disc functions as micro-setting, constraining the pivotal performance choice and charging the final image when it "sang differently—less haunted, more hopeful." Minor: the Department of Disconnected Services feels more whimsical than grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Blooming jetty, walnut ink, and twilight are vivid and selective. The locket is handled twice (arrival, examination) and the jasmine scent returns at closure to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; the coastal road and jetty-end positions track coherently. The jetty's recurring blooms constrain the covenant's meaning, elevating this past postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    The disused railway station with ivy-covered platforms and moss-covered benches is vivid and anchors the setting early. The station functions as meeting-point and later "anchor point," but it does not constrain a middle choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—Mara could coordinate from any ruin. The moon rocks rest "on a shared table" in the final paragraph, charging the image mildly, and the ivy recurs in the closing sentence, creating a purposeful frame. Spatial choreography is clean (ticket office, doorway, platforms), and the "abandoned places where infrastructure failed but nature persists" motif is consistent, but the environment remains atmospheric rather than pressure-generating.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ultrasonic forest is rendered through specific sensory vocabulary (chiropteran frequencies, moth-wing percussion) filtered consistently through Sera's skin-absorption ability. The dowsing rods and platinum ring function as micro-setting elements that constrain choices (following their pull) and charge the final beat (ring pulsing hot, rods falling still). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single-scene progression. The forest's "unmappable" grove directly shapes the climactic discovery and the final gesture of pressing palms to earth.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    The gravitational anomaly functions as active setting: coffee cups drift sideways, inner-ear tugs, and the "margin between drafts" metaphor charges the station's spatial identity. The pen's question-mark nib is handled across multiple beats (worry stone, unbending attempt, finally filled with ink) and its physical transformation mirrors Mara's psychological shift. The observatory tower's height and the window view of paradoxical stars provide spatial grounding. Scope-appropriate detail; the anomaly constrains Mara's interpretive reality and charges the final image of stars blinking in impossible patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.1)
    The harbor setting is vivid and filtered through Marina's visual focus ("waters catching light like scattered diamonds," "profile illuminated by screen-glow and moonlight"). The laptop and motion-capture device function as micro-setting tools that enable the climax. However, the physical choreography of the performance—where speakers are positioned, how the crowd gathers—remains vague, and the harbor itself does not constrain Marina's choices; it serves primarily as atmospheric backdrop. The final camera gesture charges the closure image, lifting the score, but the environment itself remains largely ornamental rather than a tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.1)
    The limestone cave system and Tethyan frescoes are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (ochre pigments, woven threads, harsh sunlight at exit). The tapestry fragment and wall frescoes function as micro-setting that charges the final revelation. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, the cave itself does not constrain Mara's choices—she encounters no physical or social obstacles—limiting its role to backdrop rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sound wave garden is vividly rendered with specific sensory details: frequencies as "trembling ribbons of light," silence as "liquid shadow," trees with "bark that hummed in minor keys." The auric lagoon functions as micro-setting, reflecting their neural patterns and responding to their drumming, thus constraining and charging the final choice. Spatial choreography remains clear (edge of lagoon, railing, perching). The setting directly participates in the closure image when the waters rise in "impossible spirals of light."

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.1)
    The shipping container labyrinth is vividly rendered through corrugated metal walls, hydraulic groans, and the storm's green light, with spatial choreography remaining clear throughout. The setting actively constrains Marcus's choices—the storm triggers the hydraulic shifts, forcing him to rely on sound rather than static maps, and the container keyhole becomes the physical gate to his goal. The "steel canyons" echo effect and the way whispers bend around corners integrate atmosphere with plot mechanics. Minor deduction for the inner room of folded maps, which feels more symbolic set-dressing than a space that shapes the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cobalt dock, rain-washed planks, arched bridge, and canal shutters anchor the scene with vivid, purposeful detail. The dental mirror constrains Marina's method (light-signaling) and the shutters become the communication medium, so objects pressure choice. Spatial choreography (dock, bridge, warehouse cluster) tracks cleanly. Enters 7-band because environment and tool directly enable the climactic pattern-weaving, though the final image is more thematic resonance than physical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cobalt library, mist, and blue-tinted windows establish mood and anchor place early. The chessboard functions as micro-setting, touched in multiple beats (arranging pieces, moving pawn, final queen move) and charging the closure image. However, the library itself does not constrain choice—it serves as backdrop rather than shaping Danny's or Miss Chen's tactics. Sensory detail (evening mist, cold window, thickening fog) is filtered through POV and modulates with the scene's reflective rhythm, but spatial choreography is minimal (two characters at a table, then at a window). The "rigid geometry" of the town and "magnetic grotto under the bridge" are told, not shown through lived-in action.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sublittoral fringe is vivid ("dawn painted... in shades of copper and pearl") and returns at the ending to anchor the choice spatially. Mira's calloused hands and the scrimshaw's grooves supply tactile detail that charges key beats. The dock's physical labor shapes Mira's identity and the weight she must shed. The whale's call vibrates "through the dock pilings and into their bones," integrating sound into spatial pressure. Minor slip: "sublittoral fringe" is ecologically specific (the zone between high and low tide) but the text uses it more as atmospheric label than constraint—no tidal mechanics affect the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    The farmhouse under turbines, the dried flowers, and the whittling knife all function as micro-setting that constrains and charges. The turbines' "seventeen point three megawatts of renewable indifference" and the flowers' gray brittleness anchor the post-mandate void without catalog. Spatial choreography (table, stove, Marcus crossing to Emma) is coherent. The flowers return in the ending to charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for setting involvement, but sensory detail leans heavily visual; other senses (sound of wood curls, texture of brittle stems) are present but could deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt atrium, quartz colonnade, and frozen lake are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (blue shadows, humming frequencies, wind-drawn patterns). The quartz pillars constrain Meris's interaction—she must approach with reverence, place her palm, compose through intention—and the final image is charged by the atrium's patient hum. Micro-setting is effectively deployed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.1)
    The courtyard is vividly anchored with scorched planters, glass wind chimes, and the fountain, and the eastern arch/corner positions guide Maya's movement and signal danger through plant placement. The bent reed tongue functions as micro-setting, handled twice (palette mixing, final inspection) and charging the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (crunching scorched earth, glinting brass). The glassblower's workshop and music repair shop add texture but spatial choreography between them is slightly vague—no clear distance or layout cues. The phoenix's presence shapes atmosphere but its mechanics (why drowsiness, how the smoke works) remain abstract, preventing the setting from fully constraining choices.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.1)
    The carbide lamp lens, crystalline vertebrae, and acoustic archaeologist setting provide vivid, purpose-driven detail. The lamp's dual function (illumination and emotional safety via golden glow) constrains Maren's choice to use it tonight, and the laboratory's sonic environment charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean (workstation, wall of recordings, laboratory door, standing together). Minor penalty: the mining museum salvage and the "vast warehouse" scale are sketched but not leveraged in later action; the volunteer's movement from door to standing-position lacks micro-geography.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory functions as more than backdrop: its "existed outside time itself" quality charges the healing arc, and the telescope becomes Mara's ritual anchor. The workbench with scattered cranes and the brass instruments create tactile specificity. The setting constrains choice (Mara climbs daily, uses the dome for vigil) and the final telescope scene charges closure by literalizing the "stars still burning" motif with cost—she must share this sanctuary.

    The rain-beaded skylight, lacquered table, and onyx-ink cards establish vivid sensory anchors early. The measuring tape becomes a tactile tool that bridges card spreads and circuit diagrams, constraining Vesper's method across multiple beats. Spatial choreography is clean (table, photocopies, cards, tape) and the loft setting filters details through Vesper's professional priorities. The skylight's shift from rain to mist at dawn provides a purposeful atmospheric arc that mirrors the intellectual clarification, charging the final image with environmental cost (a night's work, fatigue implied but not shown).

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bronze prism pagoda's surface patterns and interior impossible geometry constrain entry and guide exploration effectively. Sensory details are vivid and filtered through the historian's awe (light fracturing into unnamed colors, warm-and-cool bronze). The crystals function as micro-setting, dissolving into her skin and shaping each absorption beat. The final image charges the pagoda as holder of "secrets and warnings," and her choice to honor both ties setting to closure. Spatial choreography inside the archive (spiraling shelves, directions that shouldn't exist) is evocative but remains abstract—no tactile navigation or physical constraint alters her path through the crystals.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    The blooming library's glass petals and cloud-height setting charge the atmosphere and recur purposefully at closure. The river stone constrains Sera's hand across three beats and anchors the grandmother's memory, charging the final console placement. Spatial choreography through the stacks is clear. The archive's verticality and the dusk clouds mirror internal states without overt symbolism, and the comparison console serves as micro-setting that enables the key discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    The workshop setting—mist, lantern light, mountain altitude—filters through Elena's scientific attention and constrains her isolation. The chameleon enclosure and terrarium fragments function as micro-setting that charges the reconstruction motif. Sensory hierarchy is consistent: she notices the shed skin, the tail's texture, and these details anchor her decision to document properly. The final image of "stars wheeled through ancient patterns" and "mountain mist...obscuring and revealing" directly supports the thematic work of truth reconstruction.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tower's stone walls, climbing roses, wooden table, and frosted hourglass all constrain choices and charge the closure—Mara learns by touching objects with root-knowledge, and the hourglass becomes the vessel for her blood oath. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "Coffee rings overlapped on the wooden table like sedimentary layers." Spatial choreography is clean (tower room, workspace, windows). The meteor's fifty-mile radius creates a coherent constraint (no electronics, telepathy with plants) that shapes every tactic on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    The projection booth is vividly rendered—brass rail, dust motes, shafts of light, the bolted metal box—and its spatial particulars (narrow stairs, small window overlooking the empty theater) ground Celeste's movements throughout. The booth functions as micro-setting that constrains her search and supplies the archive, directly enabling the map revelation and final decision. The recurring thunder and rain modulate atmosphere in step with her discovery, and the vintage theater's 1967 closure date anchors temporal texture without becoming expository weight.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    The aurora-lit archway constrains the encounter spatially and charges the final image when Celestine walks away; the tundra-sky edge and frozen ground anchor her rest. The astrolabe's warmth-to-cold arc tracks causally and reweights at closure. Sensory detail (green/violet ribbons, frozen fingers, wind-through-cathedrals voice) is vivid and filtered through her perception. The archway stands silent behind her at the end—micro-setting shifts with the resolution. No occupational depth issues; the wandering astronomers and "unwritten calendar" enrich without cluttering.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glowing dune constrains Maren's approach (eyes half-closed to preserve multiplicity) and charges the closure image (blooming in all occasional locations). Spatial choreography is clean: guardhouse, observation platform, cargo doors, dune crest. The world rules (superposition, divergent archive, frozen chess clock) remain internally consistent and are discovered through action. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("bioluminescent flowers," "currents of pure potential"), filtered through Maren's professional lens.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mechanical rainforest is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (brass canopy, aluminum fronds, pneumatic vines, titanium bamboo). Micro-setting qualifies: the trees' sounds guide his navigation and the clearing's pedestal constrains the mechanism-completion action. These details shape one key choice (placing gears) and charge the final image (trees unravel, hologram projects). Spatial choreography is clean. However, the philosopher's body and tool-handling remain abstract—no tactile resistance, no fatigue, no material friction.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    The veiled ridgeway, mist-meeting-fog, and "hour between dog and wolf" anchor atmosphere and constrain movement (they lead her upward, not down to beaches). The ticket punch becomes micro-setting: she presses it to leaves, bark, sky—each use a small ritual that alters her perception. The broken leash remains warm and present, a tactile anchor. The final image charges both punch and ridgeway with the decision to run forward, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraint and closure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt fortress, snow, arrow-slitted windows, and broken piano bench bolt all ground the scene with concrete, selective detail. The piano bench bolt constrains a choice: its wobble is felt when Rielle sits, reminding her of damage and persistence. Spatial choreography remains clear (staircase → landing → eastern corridor → music room). Deduction for "seraphically mundane precision" in the Silent-Choir introduction—elevated diction clashes slightly with the POV's urgency and reads ornamental rather than perception-driven in that beat.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.1)
    The library's fold-between-moments framing is vivid and purposeful: "dust motes hung suspended," "windows opening onto skies that belonged to no particular age." The setting directly enables Ossian's work—volumes recording "histories yet unwritten" allow him to inscribe corrective runes. Spatial choreography (basin, shelves, quill, tome) remains clear. The final image of starlight-water evaporating into constellations charges the closure, grounding the conceptual repricing in concrete sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    The monitoring station, atlas page, and bleached reef are vivid and purposeful. The station's tethered-but-drifting state constrains Mara's existence and charges the final image of being "moored but drifting." Sensory detail is selective: salt air yellowing paper, groaning cables, bone-white coral. The radio exchange and console tapping ground the technical milieu. Minor slip: "thirty meters down, heading northwest" reads plausible but the story does not show Mara using instruments in tactile ways that shape a choice; the reef is seen through a window but does not alter her present action.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.1)
    The spaceport repair bay is vividly rendered (cold metal grating, rusted scaffolding, glass crunching underfoot) and the stone circle's hum provides a recurring sensory anchor. The setting constrains Kess's movement (barefoot across debris) and the circle's spatial arrangement drives her discovery. The opera glasses function as a micro-setting tool, refracting her search and aligning the symbols at closure, which charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    The volcanic hot springs constrain choice—Naja soaks there for meditation, finds the kite in mineral-crusted rocks, and descends to the off-limits cavern at dawn to avoid crews. Bioluminescent fungi, iron-tasting air, and amber "grown rather than mined" layer specific, non-generic textures. The cavern's "unstable geology" restriction adds pressure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (springs → rocks → cavern heart → emergence). The hot springs return in the final image ("steamed around her as she emerged"), charging the closure by framing her new role within the geography that enabled discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.4)
    The arboretum setting is vivid and purposeful: salt-kissed air, bromeliads, Japanese maple, night-blooming cereus all anchor Mira's work and constrain her daily choices. The seaside cliff and defunct lighthouse operate as thematic mirrors rather than tactical constraints. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (greenhouse, gravel paths, glass conservatory). The setting charges the final image—seedlings waiting for transplant—but doesn't narrow a pivotal choice within the scene itself, keeping it just below the 8.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    The circular lighthouse library with contracting walls functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the room physically compresses as she works, creating spatial urgency that charges the card-laying sequence. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (salt-crusted windows, beam rotation, book spines forming impossible geometry) and filtered through the artist's perception. The spiral card pattern on the dusty table becomes a spatial anchor for the climax, and the beam "carving through" the completed mandala charges the final image with light/shadow interplay that mirrors the thematic negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    The wind-carved encampment, meditation caves, and spilled ink constrain Kael's tracking method—he must read landscape and ephemeral trails rather than follow digital data. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "punished his albino skin like a judgment," "wind-carved elaborate patterns," "ink bottles arranged in careful circles." The hummingbird drone functions as a micro-setting element (tech in badlands) and its presence in the final cave beat constrains Kael's choice to halt it. The ink patterns on stone in the ending charge the final image, making environment essential to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cryogenic archive is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: frost webbing the visor, nitrogen-frosted glass, the peculiar absence of sound from snow-muffled depth. The vault's control panel and cryogenic systems provide concrete objects that Maren manipulates at the climax. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting constrains her choice (she must be physically present at the vault) and the "echoing library under snow" charges the final image of networks crackling through "reinforced walls and endless snow."

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.9)
    The glass dome, ballast scraps, compass fragments, and the roses themselves constrain Mira's method and charge the closure (the "eastern panels" callback). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "cordite and exhaustion," "sand-scratched glass." Spatial choreography is clean (eastern quarter, western beds, eastern airlock, eastern panels). The micro-setting (soil, canvas, seedlings) directly shapes Mira's choices and the final image of light through glass.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sound wave garden is micro-setting done right: acoustic flowers, compressed air pools, frequency nodes constrain Mara's tactics (where to cast, when to hold still). The rail spike grounds her against relocating gravity—a tool that matters. Sensory detail is POV-filtered (frequencies "sharp enough to draw blood," ferns manifesting joy as arpeggios) and the sleepwalking constellations charge the final image when they halt and drift back. The garden's physicality (zigzag spirals, feral lullaby hum) pressures every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    The observatory is vividly rendered (copper instruments, echoing dome, telescope pointed downward) and it constrains her approach—she thinks in celestial terms, uses astronomical tools for journalistic work. The rosewood nib and sextants weight the documents physically. The clouds-below framing recurs purposefully at open and close, and the echo motif threads through multiple beats, charging her solitary voice. Micro-setting (pen, instruments, observation table) functions as tactile anchor. Minor slip: "vaulted chamber where starlight bounced off copper instruments, creating whispers that multiplied into conversations with themselves" verges on ornamental; the mechanism isn't explained and doesn't recur.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    The laboratory of lost sounds is vivid and purposeful: glass cabinets of preserved cries, the pipe-organ supercomputer, chambers of thunder. Sensory selection is strong—"moth wings and rust," "meteor hush"—and filtered through Vera's academic lens. The amber as micro-setting object constrains her central choice: she must press it to the machine's port to bridge past and present. Spatial choreography is clean across moves. Setting contributes materially to closure when the amber empties, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto's cupped-palm acoustics and dark pool create spatial grounding; the limestone floor becomes a functional canvas that constrains Moth's medium. The mist's lilac cast evolves from "unease" to "almost sacred," tracking emotional progression. The tile flake functions as micro-setting, pressed to her temple to sense memory-shapes, then warming at closure to charge the final moment. Thewhispering gallery fragment's acoustic properties directly enable her perceptive gift and shape the climactic collective attention.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ancient plaza beneath the fractured sky is anchored early and the tessera fragments function as micro-setting, constraining Layla's action (she must gather, arrange, read the patterns). The mosaic stepping stone is handled across multiple beats and charges the final image when the last blue fragment is pressed into place. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling, gathering, placing). The shattered sky recurs purposefully as both atmospheric anchor and metaphor that tightens at closure without being forced.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mystic orchard and hedge maze are rendered with purposeful detail: apple trees "bloomed and withered simultaneously," the maze "turned visitors around until they emerged dizzy," and the garden's "ancient magic" amplifies Margaux's echoes. The tarot coin resting on moss-covered stone and the glowing maze constrain her final performance, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the temporal layering, and sensory hierarchy reflects Margaux's synesthetic POV without catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    The light painting studio functions as micro-setting throughout: the camera rig, long-exposure technique, and "careful darkness" enable Mara's mapping work and constrain her method (she must move through space to trace patterns). The muscovite pendant recurs with shifting charge (shield → sympathy with traced light → warmth at closure), and the studio's residual electricity grounds the inciting shock. The convergence image ("branching structures, fractally precise") uses the studio's visual vocabulary to make the abstract pathways legible, charging the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.1)
    The coastal cave network is vividly rendered with serpentine channels, limestone warmth gradients, and tidal rhythm. The elm leaf fossil anchors micro-setting by recurring across discovery, meditation, and the final communion. The cave's physical features—cold pockets, high grottos, stalactites—are described atmospherically but do not constrain a specific choice; Maren moves through the space without tactical friction. The sensory hierarchy (temperature, light, emotional resonance) is consistent with her professional focus and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    The amber warehouse is vivid and purposeful: honey-colored light, cavernous space, and the archive's spatial organization ground the premise. The canyon echo jar constrains the final turn—Mara uses it as a tool to demonstrate connection—charging the closure image. Micro-setting details (button archive, chronometers, deep corners) shape Mara's movement and discovery. Minor slip: the cliffs above remain abstract; we never see or feel them as a spatial presence that pressures choice, only as a source of the echo.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bluff, mist, and melting snow patterns create atmospheric specificity and the seasonal clock constrains tactics (three days to document). The pillbox is handled across beats and its worn surface reflects Marcus's anxiety. However, spatial choreography between bluff, valley, and village remains impressionistic; Emma's "cluttered desk" is the only interior anchor. The setting guides choice through the melt-clock but doesn't constrain the final image—Marcus simply descends with purpose restored.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    Fog functions as both spatial pressure (obscures the path, strips passengers down) and metaphor without becoming decorative. The river crossing constrains the conversation's duration and isolates the characters. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "mist thick as wool," "spindrift serenity," "skeletal trees" glimpsed and swallowed. The rain gutters' ticking operates as both atmospheric anchor and timeframe marker. The horses and carriage are handled tactilely (water lapping at wheels, weight redistribution). The far bank's stars "scattered like punctuation marks" charge the closure image by signaling clarity after fog.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    The beekeeping oasis is vividly anchored with hives, crumbling cottage, and dust motes suspended mid-fall; the faded lantern glass functions as a micro-setting object that refracts timelines and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—steaming kettle on cold stove, burnt orange sky—filtered through the potter's observational bias. The scorched wasteland supplies contrast and the oasis constrains perception (she sees through the glass), meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting that charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    The luminous harbor, fire escape, and mirror system create vivid micro-setting that constrains Mira's tactics (angles, reflected moonlight) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "papery lightness of ending," "quivering hush," the harbor's "ancient conversation with the moon." Spatial choreography across multiple fire escapes remains clear. The gauge tooth functions as object-as-setting, returning with reweighted meaning in the final beat, meeting the 9+ gate partially but the broader setting does not alter a closure choice directly.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal library is vivid and purposeful: crystalline foundations, atmospheric currents, books materializing with pressure changes. The brass sundial—useless above clouds, then reinterpreted as measuring "light received"—constrains Mira's understanding and charges the final image with metaphoric weight. Sensory detail (verdigris, amber light, cloud-ocean) is selective and voice-filtered. The Chronology Wing and Acoustic Archives add texture without cluttering spatial choreography, and the sundial's reappearance supplies the micro-setting anchor that elevates the score into the 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.1)
    The lotus temple's physical architecture (circular chamber, carved apertures, prismatic light) pressures the revelation by directing perception inward toward the nest. The installation's spiral structure—thousands of objects on silk threads—functions as micro-setting that constrains Margot's choice: she must physically tie her letter into the existing constellation. Storm-slick marble and steam rising from heated stone anchor the post-rain timeframe through tactile detail. The nest at center charges the final image, its "sacred geometry" enabling the closure's conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.1)
    The radio station setting is purposefully chosen: the transmitter is handled ("pressed her palm"), the broadcast capabilities are the tricksters' target, and the tower becomes the convergence point that triggers Mara's intervention. The subsonic hum and station lights constrain her choices and charge the closure moment. Sensory detail is selective (subsonic vibrations, aching fillings, blurred vision) and filtered through Mara's expertise. The micro-setting (desk, headphones, transmitter) functions as constraint and resource, meeting the 9+ gate criterion.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.1)
    The shadowed nexus, starlight shafts, and bronze disc are vivid and purposeful. The organ's reverberation functions as both atmosphere and constraint, rotating the disc to reveal hidden layers. Spatial choreography is coherent (descent, western passage, chamber, ascent). However, the setting primarily stages discovery rather than forcing a trade-off; Mara photographs freely without environmental resistance. The compass and disc constrain perception but do not narrow her final choice, keeping this strong but shy of the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    The quarry functions as both literal site and atmospheric anchor—mist, limestone walls, "shadowed walls swallowing what little light"—and recurs as a mental metaphor in the final paragraph ("the shadowed quarry of her mind"). The setting constrains Elena's work spatially (she descends, arranges materials at the bottom) and charges the closure image when the interior quarry metaphor reweights her method. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered (mist "clung to the limestone walls like memory itself"), though the piece leans more heavily on metaphor than on tactile grounding that alters tactics in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    The experimental weather station and its impossible atmospheric phenomena (violet clouds, upward snow, sub-zero temperatures) are vivid and voice-filtered through Mira's professional lens. The copper nail is handled twice and carries symbolic weight, but it doesn't constrain a tactical choice or alter the final move. Spatial choreography is clean—desk, window, airlock progression—and the "broken weather" motif charges the setting's strangeness, supporting the wound-door premise without becoming mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.9)
    The mountain pullout and its features (mist, retaining wall, scaffold wrap, valley light) are rendered with specificity and the glass flake functions as a tactile anchor. The scaffold wrap's flutter pattern directly enables Mara's translation into melody, constraining her method. However, the setting does not evolve or impose cost during the climax; the figures appear "at the edge of visibility" without spatial choreography, and the environment becomes a passive backdrop for the violin performance rather than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.1)
    The circus train is vivid and purposeful, its "faded paint still proclaiming wonders that would never tour again" mirroring the father's abandoned legitimacy. The motion sensors and forest preserve create spatial pressure that shelters Marco and keeps intruders at bay. The bills on the curved walls and the observation platform anchor key beats. However, the train's physical details (rusted carriages, tilted siding, overgrown rail) do not constrain a mid-scene choice—they remain backdrop until the final platform conversation, which could occur anywhere private.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory dome, brass telescope, and variable star catalogs ground the scene with purposeful detail. The telegram with pressed daylily functions as a charged object across beats. Spatial choreography (dome, tablet, shared workspace) remains clear. The stars themselves constrain the intellectual puzzle and charge the final image through their pulsing patterns. Sensory details (steaming tea, yellowed telegram, night sky) are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.1)
    The swirling orchard vortex is vivid and purposeful: "impossible spirals," "perpetual cyclone of white blossoms and rotting fruit," "roots drinking black water." The mirror-bright pools suspend the apprentice, and the black water threatens his fall—setting shapes choreography and danger. Maren's staff-planting and the expanding-circle method use spatial structure to organize the search. The dark seeds "at the water's edge" provide a concrete clue that shifts Maren's tactic from comfort to war-song. However, the vortex itself remains largely atmospheric; its mechanics (why it resists, how it "satisfies" after release) are asserted rather than shown through micro-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt glade's spiraling grass and bruised-purple dusk establish vivid atmosphere, and the setting's "responsive pulse" to merged consciousness shows environmental reaction. However, the glade functions primarily as backdrop—no spatial choice is constrained by proximity, access, or terrain. The topiary clipping and mirror shard are handled objects but don't impose physical limits on action. Micro-setting (scars, hands) appears but doesn't alter tactics at the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.1)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly realized—"apple trees grew from the ribcages of saints," "roots coiled lovingly around femurs and skulls," "pear tree whose branches grew through the eye sockets of a stone martyr"—and the setting constrains the Oracle's teaching: "This isn't a place for bargaining. It's a place for accepting." The half-lit corridors and bone-threaded roots recur in the final image, charging the ending when the burned card is left "on the martyr's stone palm." Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling beneath the tree, walking together through corridors) and sensory detail is filtered through the Oracle's professional perspective. The orchard functions as both literal space and thematic mirror, with the trees' understanding ("nothing grows without death threaded through it") directly shaping the closure message.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    The quarry trailer—aluminum, drafty, dust-settled machinery outside—supplies concrete constraint and mirrors isolation. The grille cloth functions as micro-setting (tactile anchor, charged reprise in the final image). Spatial choreography is clean (desk, lamp, crate, door). The trailer's metal space amplifies Sarah's voice "valley-deep," a subtle sensory choice. Setting pressures the choice: Marcus is physically isolated in a failed operation, no escape from his own judgment. Entering 7+ because the trailer and cloth together constrain tone and charge the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    The magnetic arbor is vividly anchored (three thousand meters, magnetic fields, rust-brown railing, luminous vines at altitude) and subtly mirrors the transition theme: matter suspended by invisible forces, transformed by relationship to gravity. The seed's interaction with mineral-rich soil and the electromagnetic taste of the fruit are concrete, sensory, and purposeful. The environment directly enables the closure—the arbor itself becomes the charged final image of "touching distance." Spatial choreography is clean (railing, pathways, central planter). The body and recurring object (seed/fruit) constrain and charge the ending, satisfying the 9+ gate for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tidal atrium is vividly realized: glass ceiling, catwalks over seawater channels, geothermal forge, and titan-gear mechanisms all constrain Maris's work and charge the closure (moonlight silvering water, mobile turning). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maris's priorities (gear clicks, molten metal, scroll texture). The mobile of metal fish functions as micro-setting, recurring in the visitor's mesmerized gaze and the final image where it "swam its ancient, ever-new pattern," directly supporting the migrating-identities theme and the ending's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The crystal caves constrain choice physically (alcove where crystals grow densest houses the shrine) and charge the final image (facets transforming solitary light into radiance that touches every surface). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "faceted walls," "constellations of light," pearl's "inner glow," shell's "minute script." The caves respond to confession ("facets beginning to pulse"), creating environmental pressure that validates Marcus's decision. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (main chamber, alcove, shrine, surrounding artifacts).

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ivy-claimed railway station is richly specific (rusted benches, shattered windows, crumbling bathroom, station master's office) and filters through Maya's hydrologist lens. The river's current physically tests her on day twenty-nine, water rushing past her thighs while she holds the journal high—micro-setting constrains the wading choice. The accordion's taped bellows return in the final third to charge the ending image (repairs as unapologetic persistence). Spatial choreography stays clean across platform, bathroom, office, and river's edge.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glowing library in mist is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (cardamom, breathing shelves, propagation delays). The propagation-delay mechanic provides a concrete constraint that the protagonist maps and navigates, shaping her path through the space. The watch and journal function as micro-setting tools that enable her documentation strategy. However, the environment does not force a trade-off or materially narrow her options at closure—she leaves with books and new pathways, encountering no spatial resistance that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.1)
    The velvet observatory is anchored early with sensory specificity (honeysuckle, old starlight, domed ceiling, ferns, brass table) and the midsummer heat contrasts purposefully with the never-melting ice. The transparent violin constrains her choice—its imminent melt at dawn drives urgency—and returns charged in the final image ("already beginning to weep"). Plants (ferns, pothos, mulberry) recur with thematic weight and the mulberry's perennial staining of marble subtly mirrors Elena's guerrilla truth-seeding. The setting's luxurious imperial architecture (velvet, brass, marble) ironically houses the artifact that will indict the Empire.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    The skyborne grotto is no postcard: steam vents maintain "that precise temperature where water neither froze nor fully melted," a constraint that governs Lyra's entire practice and appears in micro-setting detail ("too much warmth and the features would slacken"). The aurora functions as both atmosphere and active element—its pulsing rhythm shapes Lyra's read of the girl's interrupted youth and charges the mirrors' reflection in the final image. Sensory filtering is purposeful: warmth between palms, silver dust shimmer, the oils' texture all anchor the POV in tactile work rather than tourist description. The setting constrains the ritual and charges closure when "the girl lay in a pool of green-gold light."

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    The umbral grotto is vividly realized ("shadowed mouth breathing mist") and the cedar-top impossibility anchors the magical-realist frame. The hairpin—lacquered red, phoenix rising—constrains the woman's identity and charges the final image when transferred. Sensory hierarchy is consistent (clouds forming/reforming, mist, stone) and filtered through Keiko's contemplative lens. The fishermen's scalloping detail grounds her epiphany without digression. Minor: the grotto's spatial choreography (woman always cross-legged on stone) could have been re-engaged in the reveal beat to deepen immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lighthouse gallery with twelve wind chime sets provides sensory specificity (brass, ceramic, copper, bamboo, glass) and the dawn light refracting through the hollow mirror shard directly charges the closure image. The salt breeze, weathered wood, and tidal shift are filtered through Mara's search for meaning. Spatial choreography (spiral stairs, gallery deck, descent) tracks cleanly and the chimes function as both atmosphere and constraint—the keeper uses them to model the decision-making Mara needs.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.9)
    The floating platform, magnetic grotto, and pond basin create vivid spatial grounding with purpose-driven sensory detail (blue-black minerals, celestial resonance, iron-rich stones). The platform's magnetic drift and grotto's starlight amplification constrain the session's timing and charge the atmosphere. Micro-setting (the stone thrown, the pond below) functions actively in the teaching moment. However, these elements remain illustrative backdrops; no environmental constraint narrows a tactical choice or charges the final image beyond mood-setting, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bone towers, canyon acoustics, and arrowhead as object-setting all constrain Kael's perceptual method and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects his professional filter (harmonic signatures, bird geometry, stone pulse). The third tower's fracture becomes the spatial anchor for closure. Micro-setting (the arrowhead in his palm) functions as both tool and constraint throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    The icebound spire, thin air, and "brilliant dimness" light establish vivid atmosphere. The keystone becomes micro-setting, handled twice (unpacking, placement) and charged at closure. Frost patterns, translucent ice walls, and the cold numbing Maren's body all constrain her endurance. The spire's patient vigil in the final line charges the closure image. One slip: "twilit, neither bright nor dark but suspended between states" is abstract; showing how the light hurts to look at without demonstrating a specific visual effect slightly reduces specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    The pier, wetsuit, underwater breach, and bioluminescent bottles supply vivid, purposeful detail filtered through Mara's professional and memorial focus. The sunken library's physical layout (gash, swollen door, makeshift shelves) constrains her path and discovery. Spatial choreography remains clear through the descent and return. The lanterns above function as both setting accent and thematic mirror, charging the final image when she surfaces and sees them "not memorials for the lost, but her grandfather's theory proven correct." Micro-setting (body in wetsuit, waterproof lamp) and recurring object (bottles, key tag) drive choices and charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    The amber-lit observatory deck, crystalline dome, and collapsing cosmos create vivid, purposeful atmosphere. The brass bowl and coins are handled across multiple beats, and the static-burst headset constrains Mira's method. The amber light deepening to white at closure charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear, and sensory detail supports rather than stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.1)
    The observatory's scattered light through the cracked telescope lens charges both the sea-monster page and the final image, functioning as micro-setting that reweights meaning. Spatial anchors (observation platform, brass tubes, domed ceiling, stone floor) remain stable and the prism detail returns at closure. The atlas page as tactile object (traced, held to light, tucked next to heart) constrains Mira's attention and charges the ending. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her grief without catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sapphire viaduct is vivid and specific (crystalline surface, refracted light, dripping rhythms), anchoring the scene throughout. The dripping water and the bell as micro-setting elements constrain Emris's choices (he must understand the rates, position the bell). Sensory details—condensation forming, water reversing, mist sparkling—are filtered through Emris's focused observation. The viaduct's center span becomes integral to the final action, charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ridgeway, emerging rooftops, and church steps provide spatial grounding and pressure Marcus toward the past. The sapphire liqueur label, wind chime, and photographs function as micro-setting that constrains perception and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (algae-slick stone, "cold through his uniform") and filtered through Marcus's professional and emotional priorities. The town-as-palimpsest conceit integrates setting with theme without becoming a postcard catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.1)
    The orchard setting is vivid and purposeful: simultaneous seasons, frozen dew at the intersection of morning/midnight, singing trees. The kaleidoscopic waterfall anchors entry and return, charging the final image. Sensory details (prismatic cascade, glass-bell song, blue flame) are filtered through Lyra's alchemical lens and constrain her work (she must set up her laboratory on a flat stone). The environment actively shapes the climactic beat when the orchard shudders and starlings materialize to guide her.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    The nocturnal arbor is vivid and purposeful: bioluminescent trails, glass dome observatory, clouds as "silver sea" create a coherent sensory world. The parachute buckle's tactile weight and the notepad's muscle-memory use ground the micro-setting effectively. The arbor's indifference—"constant in its ancient rhythms"—charges the final image by contrasting human doubt with natural certainty. Spatial choreography is clean throughout (platform above clouds, trees through troposphere).

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    The floating dojo, obsidian platform, transparent floor over quantum foam, and labeled jar are vivid and purposeful; the setting's untethered physics mirrors Kira's fragmented identity. The jar recurs as a spatial anchor across three beats (opening, Kira's lifting it, final flanking). However, the dojo does not constrain a choice—Kira could deliver the same argument anywhere—and the quantum-foam timestream rewrites remain scenery rather than pressing tactics. Sensory hierarchy is clean (obsidian, glass, child's laughter), but the space functions more as thematic mirror than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.9)
    The tunnel functions as active constraint: its acoustic properties (holding sound twice, braiding voices) directly enable the ritual and charge the closure image. Sensory detail is purposeful—dust motes as "frozen stars," the engine's bass notes—and filtered through Martin's grief-POV. Spatial choreography remains clear (basement entrance, descent, movement through tunnel). The house above provides atmospheric contrast but remains somewhat generic; more specificity in the upstairs rooms' "terrible quiet" would strengthen the setting's pressure on Martin's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    The frozen garden supplies vivid, purpose-driven images—statues rimed with frost, mist thick as wool—and the pendant's cold burns Maris's hand at the climax, constraining the final action. Spatial choreography is clean (crouching, moving forward, reaching). The dream-realm setting directly enables the plot: she can hunt without the daylight collar here. No occupation-level detail is required at this length, and the sensory hierarchy reflects urgency appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ember nexus functions as more than backdrop: it's a convergence of fire and water that mirrors Cassia's alchemical work and charges the final image when it "pulsed brighter" during transformation. Micro-setting details (crucibles, beakers, workshop stains) ground the space and constrain choice—she uses what's present. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional lens (feeling "dormant pulse," tasting disappointment). The twilight deepening at closure reweights the opening rust-colored shadows, creating coherent atmospheric arc. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single-location scene.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    The suspended city, gorge, and transmission hub are vividly rendered with purpose-driven detail (dust motes, broken windows, debris-strewn floor). Spatial choreography is clean as Mira moves across the hub following silence. The fragment itself—crystalline, dark, veins of frozen light—charges the final image by reweighting the towers and gorge from graveyard/throat to chrysalis/potential. Lunar perigee anchors time and the "serenely electric" hum integrates environment with her array, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    Grotto imagery (starlight, crystalline walls, impossible angles) is vivid and recurs purposefully; the hourglass etchings reveal a map at the confluence, directly shaping Mateo's navigation choice. Sensory selection is atmospheric but leans visual; ferry deck choreography (stern rail, bow, wheelhouse) remains coherent. The spectral grotto constrains the climactic turn, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but the world rules (what "pattern collision" and "timeline merge" physically entail) stay abstract, limiting full immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The optical illusion gallery is vividly realized with specific spatial impossibilities (corridors that end after ten paces yet stretch infinitely, staircases climbing while descending) that mirror Marina's therapeutic work. The sinew thread becomes a micro-setting element—its warmth, translucence, and pulsing constrain her weaving method and charge the final image when the pattern "pulsed once, brilliantly." The hundreds of hooks embedded in walls guide her choices physically, and the room's dimensional folding elevates the climactic moment. Sensory detail remains selective and purposeful throughout, filtered through Marina's professional expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    The benthic city's pressure, luminescence, and architectural boundaries are vividly rendered and purposeful: "architecture gave way to raw geology" charges the teaching moment where impossible starlight becomes visible. The chain link constrains the final image by anchoring Carta's past navigation methods against the new edge geometry, and sensory hierarchy—bioluminescence versus starlight-memory—guides her perceptual shift. Spatial choreography remains clear as Carta moves from pressure locks to teaching chamber to city's edge. Micro-setting detail (the metal glowing, holding shape against pressure) directly informs the thematic lesson and charges the closure beat, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mist-clad atrium at twilight is established early and sustained through sensory details (spilled ink, skeletal ferns, spiderweb shadows, ventilation mist). The setting charges the final image: "in the mist-clad atrium, two women stood together beneath the watchful ferns" anchors the moment of protection. The hearing aid as a recurring object constrains Mira's method and participates in closure when it "fell silent at last, its message delivered." Spatial choreography is clear (iron table, door, standing positions). However, the atrium itself does not materially constrain a choice or tactic—it functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active pressure, limiting the score's ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    The facility's physicality is vivid and purposeful: saltwater seams, narrow corridor, murky observation glass, and the cable junction chamber all ground the descent and charge the final image of re-flooding. The tidal rhythm functions as both setting constraint and thematic pulse. Spatial choreography is clear (descent to Lab Three, observation window, climb to surface), and the "cracked seams" and "compression" mirror Mara's interior state without overt symbolism. The cables themselves—degraded casings, sealed portals—supply the infrastructure that the beings maintain, directly shaping the story's conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    The observatory under snow provides strong atmosphere and is integrated into action (climbing steps, warmth inside, snow dampening sound to "cathedral silence"). The porcelain shard, inkwell, and desk function as micro-setting that constrains the recovery method. Sensory detail is selective and mood-appropriate. The opalescent dome and dawn light charge the final image. Minor slip: "ancient servers" and "three monitors" lack the specificity that would make the technical environment as vivid as the snowscape.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bone towers constrain her translation method—she reads their texture to generate sound—and the canyon's endless echoes function as amplifier and archive, directly enabling closure. Sensory detail (rough marrow, smooth polish, sharp calcium edges) is specific and filtered through her tactile focus. The diamond's interaction with light and bone charges the final perpetual-song image. Spatial choreography remains clear across her nocturnal work.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    The underground garden constrains choice: bioluminescent mushrooms, ghost orchids, herbs glowing with moonlight create a coherent reality where natural law bends. The arrowhead's gravitational playfulness (tugs upward) directly charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear (stairs, phone on wall, moss), and the setting's defiance of sunlight mirrors Maya's shift from skepticism. No occupation-level herbalism detail is needed at this length; the garden's impossible biology suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sky-bridge setting is vivid and functional, suspending Mira "between earth and clouds" in a way that mirrors her thematic position. The enchanted orchard supplies the golden apple and locust shell, directly enabling the climactic choice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "clockwork engines below," "gray branches creaked," "liquid gold" from weeping statues. The locust shell as micro-object charges the final image, qualifying under the micro-setting allowance. Spatial choreography remains clear across two locations with one transition.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt arcade is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (vaulted ceiling, shuttered games, skeletal carousel) and the null-field device functions as a micro-setting constraint that enables Maren's tactics. The arcade's abandoned status on drone maps is purposeful and charges the closure by housing the dead-drop. Spatial choreography is clean, and the twilight timeframe modulates atmosphere effectively. The thunderstorm bottle—handled twice (adjusted in the sack, placed in the dead-drop)—recurs with reweighted meaning at the end, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    The train setting is vivid and purposeful: broken carousel horses, salvaged bearings, wind bells, and the brass fragment all supply concrete resources that the carpenter uses to construct the crown. Spatial choreography is clean (interior car, center column, hanging elements), and sensory detail (misting hush, chiming bells, light patterns) is filtered through the carpenter's attention. The halo fragment constrains the design choice (it "fit perfectly where he'd left a gap"), meeting the 9+ gate criterion, but the setting otherwise provides material without forcing difficult trade-offs or altering the outcome. The oasis and cottonwood grove anchor the scene but remain descriptive rather than pressuring choices.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    The library's hyperbolic architecture (1889, Lobachevsky-and-Poe architect, corridors that double back) is established early and constrains Cordelia's theory. The scarf functions as micro-setting object: she trails it as "measuring line in curved space," it grows warm at closure, anchoring the final beat. Sensory detail is selective (lavender, paper dust, lamplight pooling in impossible corners) and filtered through Cordelia's scholarly POV. Spatial choreography is coherent; the three patrons remain placed in atrium, reading corner, and topology textbook positions. The architecture charges the ending by enabling the "reawakening."

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archipelago is rendered through purposeful, POV-filtered detail: fog-thick passages, sea stacks aligning with sunrise, cave geometry that reveals images only at precise angles. The watercolor palette and camera function as micro-setting elements that constrain Mara's choices—she must match Theo's hues and coordinates exactly, racing between islands at dawn. The cave's light-dependent gallery charges the final image by making Theo visible only through the viewfinder at sunrise, demonstrating how environment enables the closure beat. Sensory selection reflects Mara's urgency (luminous absence, overlapping expositions) without tourist cataloging, and the whispering archipelago's secrecy operates as both atmosphere and tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.1)
    The nexus, twilight star, cobblestones-as-water, and the underground room of doors provide vivid micro-settings. The ribbon constrains Mara's path (coordinates guide her steps), satisfying the 9+ gate requirement. However, sensory selection leans visual-only ("indigo sky," "dark water," "charcoal gray"), and the disorientation is asserted ("up became sideways") without tactile or proprioceptive grounding. The "room made of doors" arrives late and functions as a reveal rather than a lived-in constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    The sunken orchard with iron ribs, shipwrecks in constellation pattern, and glowing fairy ring create vivid, purposeful setting. Spatial details constrain choice (thirty feet underwater, sediment work, mesh bag ascent). The greenhouse skeleton and apple trees function as charged micro-settings that anchor memory. Sensory work is strong (luminescent spores, purple dusk) and filtered through Vera's professional lens. The shipwrecks as "sleeping guardians" charges the final image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.1)
    The forgotten library is anchored early with dust, broken windows, annotation table, and copper kettle. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (Finn's perch, the archivist's movements). The shard-mirror and tea leaves function as micro-setting objects that enable the teaching beat. The closing sensory image of wind through cracked windows and playground-swing silence effectively mirrors the dual exile motif, charging the final moment without needing breadth.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.1)
    The verdant parapet, waterfall mist, and cliff-face orchards are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("mist beading on her silver hair"). The setting constrains the opening ritual (thin boundary at dawn) and the final planting, satisfying the micro-setting allowance. However, the dream realm itself—"galleries of color"—remains generic and untethered; no spatial choreography or environmental resistance shapes Mara's gathering of wonder-light, reducing the setting's causal pressure at the story's emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prism sanctuary's function (refracting names into visible light, holding them as starlight) directly charges the final image and constrains the ritual's purpose. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "crystalline stone," "net...black with age and salt," "air itself felt heavy." Spatial choreography is clear (net draped on altar, Maren begins at the edge). The sanctuary's open sky and prisms return at closure to transform silence into light, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain choice or charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rain-scoured vault is vividly anchored with selective, purposeful detail (curved ceiling, echoing drops, faded fresco, southern wall collapse). The fresco and its shifted stone constrain Maren's choices and charge the final image—she must physically return to the henge gap. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities (ochre, ash, fresco quadrants, fine cracks). Micro-setting qualifies: the vault's architecture and the fresco itself function as both object and setting, driving discovery and the closure decision. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sunken library as micro-setting constrains choices throughout: the skeletal librarian, the snow globe on the reading table, the radio room all pressure Elena's collection impulse and force her final renunciation. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (mahogany shelves swaying with current, verdigris blooming like underwater flowers). The snow globe itself functions as setting-scale object that charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across the wreck's geography.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.1)
    The misty courtyard above the clouds is vivid and specific, anchoring the piece early with sensory detail (fog, stone, vapor). The flower press bolt plate and graffiti tools are handled in multiple beats, shaping Moth's actions. The courtyard constrains the encounter (forgotten space, networked nodes) and charges the final image when lights flicker in response. Spatial choreography is clear throughout; the setting functions as more than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.1)
    The icebound spire, crystalline walls, and frosted grating create vivid sensory anchors throughout. The elevator's ten-floor ascent structures the entire piece and constrains the decision window, qualifying as micro-setting that pressures choice. Spatial choreography is clean (elevator cage, frozen world below, upper chamber). The goggles' prismatic light refraction through ice is a purposeful detail that enables the diary decryption, directly shaping the turning point and charging the final image of "scattered light."

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    The gondola as micro-setting constrains choice (she's suspended, can only observe) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "brass telescope," "copper rays," "ice crystals catching starlight like scattered grief." The telescope recurs with reweighted meaning (grandfather's deathbed to present proof). Spatial choreography is clean (basket, observation ports, rotating gondola). The environment—Antarctic sky—directly enables her unauthorized categorization work and the virga observation that crystallizes her proof.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tree trunk library is vividly particular: hollowed chambers, heartwood rooms, open crown where branches were sawn away, spine-carved book-safe doors. The coin functions as micro-setting—its faint relief, warmth from handling, and tactile story constrain the artist's method and charge the final image when she mirrors the sky (visible through the broken crown) in the founder's eyes. The setting supplies both resource (the coin) and time pressure (demolition crew). Stars "fractaling into infinity" through the open crown directly enable the closure move, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    The airship *Meridian* is vividly anchored (brass hull, porthole, cargo hold, magnetic tethers) and the navigation chamber setting constrains Celeste's movements and discoveries. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (starlings, chalk dust in planking lines, rolled pencil). The hopscotch board—micro-setting object—directly enables the key discovery and charges the final image when Celeste erases it. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. Minor: the luminance field below is noted but does not constrain any on-page choice or return with altered meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.1)
    The frozen library, spiral stairs, and Hall of Mirrors constrain movement and frame choices (Miren must descend, work between mirrors). The toolkit—meteor gears, heated pick—functions as micro-setting that enables the repair. Sensory specificity (ice reflecting ice, orange rust, brass clasp click) is selective and POV-filtered. The final image of ocean waves "like gear teeth meshing with the sky" charges closure by extending the repair motif into the world. No occupation-depth penalty at this length; "lunar-eclipse locksmith" and "temporal mechanic" are plausible within the established fantasy frame.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    The floating rock arches and orchard twilight establish a distinct setting early, and the deserted sidewalks from a prior failed colony add texture. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop; the arches frame views but do not constrain choices. The chalk on packed earth vs. crumbling pavement is a nice detail, yet spatial choreography across the settlement remains vague. The butterfly garden bell recurs purposefully, charging the ending, which lifts the score slightly. The orchard blight is declared but not sensorially rendered during key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lighthouse lamp room is sketched with brass-and-crystal mechanism, salt-stained windows, and fractal ocean waves. The puppet head recurs as a talisman and witness, but it does not constrain a tactical choice or alter her approach to the adjustment. The setting provides atmospheric grounding—spiral stairs, darkening ocean, automatic lighthouse beam—yet remains largely a backdrop for reflection rather than a space that pressures decisions. The mechanism's presence is declared essential but its physical properties (dials, instruments, "pane of hush") remain abstract and do not force a micro-choice or tradeoff on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cliffside labyrinth orchard is vividly rendered—twisted trees on stone corridors, bronze birds patrolling at dusk, frost forming as a lethal constraint. The setting actively pressures choices: Maren follows shadows and tree angles to navigate, the maze's defiance of nature (branches as compass needles, roots forming arrows) is both atmospheric and functional, and the time-of-day progression (sun bleeding orange, dying light, last light died) drives urgency. The couple's useless map underscores the orchard's hostility to conventional navigation. The final detail of the birds settling into night watch charges the ending with the world's persistent threat, anchoring Maren's acceptance of her role in concrete environmental stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.1)
    The braided ravine functions as more than setting—its five divergent channels constrain and enable Maya's central choice, making the scattering method specific and irreplaceable. Sensory detail is filtered through her scientific training (foam patterns, polymerization metaphors) and symphonic perception. The chrysalis and foam are handled objects that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout; the environment shapes the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glass orchard and cloud-sea are vividly rendered and consistently maintained; the transparent fruit refracting light and the library's upward-downward drift create a coherent spatial logic. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop—none of the environmental details constrain Vera's choice or the customer's departure. The "reading grove on the third tier" and "glass roots" are named late without prior anchoring, and the bottled moonlight's physical handling (uncorking, drop, blade, re-bottling) is the only tactile sequence that matters. The setting charges atmosphere but does not alter tactics or outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fortress walls, tidal pools, and coral pavilion are rendered with vivid, purpose-driven detail that reflects Maron's chef's eye for chemistry and pattern. The rain-revealed salt pools function as both setting and constraint, requiring analysis before descent. The impossible ice in the pavilion creates atmospheric pressure and the melting coral charges the closure image. Sensory hierarchy is strong—bitter almonds, spoiled milk, metallic tang—filtered through his synesthetic gift. The environment actively shapes his choices throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    The astronomical clock tower is vividly anchored (brass gears, glass dome, spiral stairs, meteor-iron weight), and the grain elevators' ventilation shafts and different pitches (wheat alto, corn bass, rye soprano) create a micro-setting that directly enables Mara's solution. The cuckoo weight's physical heft and pendulum function constrain her choice—she must carry it down and attach it to regulate airflow—charging the final image of the valley singing. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (choral training makes footsteps rhythmic), and the tower/silo geography remains coherent across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    The canyon setting constrains Elena's choice to come here and provides the alcove/moonlight geometry that enables the climax. Sensory detail is selective (silver light, helical fracture, sandstone) and the periscope mirror functions as both tool and thematic object. However, much description remains postcard-picturesque ("moonlit cathedral of sandstone") without POV-filtered urgency. The micro-setting (broken mirror, fiber-optic cable, neural crown) does charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate material but falling short on consistent POV modulation throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    The serpentine grotto, mist, and the doodle-carved stone are vivid and purposeful. The grotto's coiling passages mirror the manuscript spiral and constrain Lyra's path during inversion; the stone at the heart charges the final beat. Sensory detail—dust rising, mist becoming "clandestinely luminous," gravity's lurch—is filtered through urgency and supports the climactic moment. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the grotto's spiral structure is indispensable to the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    The alder grove and the workshop tree supply vivid, purposeful anchors: the hollow core laboratory, copper wires at varying heights, and porcelain insulators with "hairline fractures" all ground the craft in tactile specificity. The setting constrains Maren's method—she must work within the grove's silence and the insulators' damaged geography—and the final image charges when siskins return to the branches. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maren's professional attention: "bark ridges that others saw as mere wood but she recognized as frozen symphonies" establishes perceptual hierarchy without excess. The piece meets the Q3 9+ test: environment and recurring object (insulators) constrain choices and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    The magnetic nexus is vivid and functional: the hum intensifies under Kavir's palms, the iron-rich cliffs turn violet at twilight, and the convergence point's psychic amplification enables the silence-listening method. The worry stone's "familiar dent" and the act of setting it down to press palms anchor micro-setting choices. The ridge above and the temple's sanctified borders track spatial choreography clearly. Environment directly enables the pivotal discovery and the final image charges the cliffs' hum with approval, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraint and closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.1)
    The workshop with skeletal rafters and visible stars recurs and charges the final moment ("she looked up through the broken roof"), constraining the scene's metaphorical weight. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("amber hum of childhood summers," "burgundy resonance"). Spatial choreography is clean (workbench, microphone, diary clasp, fireworks outside). The body and tool (radio transmitter) are integral to the central action, shaping Marlow's method and the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Veyla's treetop village is established with purposeful detail: canopy bridges, suspended pots, constant sway, lavender sachets tied to beams. The setting meaningfully constrains Mira's herbalism—the "never standing on solid ground" creates the psychological need her work addresses. The corpse flower's suspended pot that "would sway with the trees but protect the delicate root system" demonstrates setting-integrated problem-solving. The windows opening at the bloom charges the final image with spatial consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard planet's floating arches, upward-falling rain, and luminous water flows create a vivid, physics-defying environment filtered through Mara's professional attention. The water convergence point constrains her final choice and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography remains coherent through the Inversion's disorientation. The silverleaf trees' dual root systems and temporal sphere are purposeful details that support the thematic mechanism rather than touristic decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    The container labyrinth functions as spatial constraint throughout, with rust-streaked walls, fog channeling, and wind circuit geometry shaping Mara's survey path and discovery sequence. The chemical residue streaks and spiral configuration in Block Seven provide tactile specificity that grounds the atmospheric engine concept. Sensory detail is purposeful—amplified footfalls, amber fog at sunset—and filtered through investigator priorities. The port's architecture directly constrains movement and enables the central discovery, satisfying the micro-setting requirement for high-band consideration.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ice cavern is vividly rendered with organ-pipe columns and aurora refraction through impossible angles, creating a distinct sensory signature. The amber music sheet and ice column constrain Mira's approach: she must position the sheet to channel light and touch the column with her bell-ringer's hammer. The sculpted hush as "negative space" and "geometric voids" is conceptually ambitious but remains abstract; the physical environment shapes one key turn (the column-striking) and charges the final image of bells scattering aurora-colored notes.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Thunder-Echo Range as a "thin point where worlds pressed close" directly enables the climactic choice. Driftwood markers, the canyon's "avalanchingly quiet" hush, and the gilded flute's light-scattering properties all constrain or charge key beats. Spatial choreography remains clear (canyon mouth, kneeling at pattern center). The "avalanchingly quiet" descriptor recurs purposefully, modulating from oppressive to broken at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.2)
    The topaz workshop with bioluminescent walls and the letterpress are vivid and POV-filtered ("patterns she could never quite replicate"). Spatial choreography is coherent across moves (halo fragment beside lead types, press descending, paper lifted). However, the workshop does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as atmospheric backdrop. The vanishing stars above recur but remain decorative, not a clock that pressures decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway provides vivid atmospheric grounding with purposeful sensory detail (greens and violets, geometric proofs of beauty). The dragonfly-wing materials recur across pendant, flute, and thematic resonance. However, spatial choreography becomes vague during encounters—the merchant "beside the path" and shepherd's approach lack concrete staging. The Keeper's cottage materializes "where myth had promised" without earned geography. The pendant constrains Kael's movement (compulsive reach, vibration) and charges the final image, satisfying the micro-setting test, but the ridgeway itself functions more as backdrop than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.4)
    The quartz arbor is vivid and recurrs (dawn mist, crystalline branches, wind-song at close), and the frost patterns on the windshield supply crucial visual evidence. Spatial choreography is clear (arbor, car, windshield), and sensory detail (cold breath, refracted light) anchors the present. However, the environment remains largely scenic; neither the arbor nor the car constrains a tactical choice. The prism enables perception but does not force a trade-off. Micro-setting is present but does not charge the final decision.

    The forgotten orchard, bamboo stalks, and jigsaw frame on the ground create a coherent micro-setting. The loom and puzzle pieces constrain Mariko's approach and charge the final crossing. Sensory details—morning mist, cold numbing her fingers, the amber bead warming—are filtered through her focused attention. Spatial choreography remains clear: loom, frame on the ground, threshold crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating arches, mine shafts, and crystallized sap veins create vivid setting anchors that recur and constrain Mira's plan. The lantern illuminating amber veins is a strong sensory moment. Spatial choreography is clear (workshop above, mines below, surface orchards). The forge and mine function as micro-settings that enable tactics, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, though the final image (arches "no longer casting shadows but framing hope") leans toward overt symbolism rather than charging through constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.1)
    The repair bay is anchored early with rust, ozone, metal ribs, and emergency lighting. The shard constrains the narrative by enabling perception of parallel worlds, and the eastern airlock serves as the charged site of Mira's disappearance. Sensory hierarchy reflects Kael's gift—she notices temperature gradients and molecular taste—creating a distinct perceptual filter. The workbench and shard's physical handling ground abstract concepts in tactile action.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lighthouse, lantern room, Fresnel lens "like a frozen chrysanthemum," stone cairns, and sea glass all constrain or charge choices. The setting filters through Vera's professional attention: "massive Fresnel lens loomed," "iron stairs," "fuel line had cracked, fixable but not tonight." The lantern room's "strange" presence and Marcus's stone-message system deepen the isolation stakes. The sea glass becomes micro-setting that charges the final act: she holds it to fading light, sees the ocean's transformation of sharp edges, and tucks it into the bundle as talisman. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, matching the POV's urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Emerald Lighthouse is vividly rendered—green glass walls, Fresnel lens, copper filaments—and its physical mechanics (total internal reflection) constrain Kael's ritual choices. The obsidian sea, storm clouds, and lightning fork contribute atmosphere that modulates with pressure. The lighthouse's green light functions as micro-setting, shaping the final image where light "bends backward through time" and tints the dawn. Spatial choreography inside the lighthouse is clear (spiral stairs, lens positioning), and the environment charges the closure. This lifts the score into mid-7s despite the broader world (post-print society) remaining sketched rather than inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating tea house, tether chains, morpho wings on the lightbox, and valley mist are vivid and purposeful; the swaying platform subtly pressures Mira's grip on the table edge. The morpho-wing mechanics (structure versus pigment) constrain Chen's teaching method and charge the "iridescent caution" motif. Spatial choreography is clear, and the environment's verticality and lightbox setup directly enable Chen's "sun trails" observation. One small slip: "rice-paper walls" and "lightbox" feel slightly anachronistic together without a signal of deliberate tech/tradition fusion, but it does not break the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stormlit tower, moonlight breaking through clouds, and the northwestern maze provide vivid sensory grounding. The broken sextant functions as micro-setting/tool, constraining Mara's method (she cannot measure stars, only dreams). The moonlight actively transforms the extracted dreams, charging the closure image where "dreams dissolved into water that would nourish new seedlings." Spatial choreography (tower exterior stairs, maze entry, fountain) remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly rendered with glowing fruit, copper basin, and the mica window's amber ghosts. The endless night pressures her work by framing scarcity (no natural dawn) and the oak's dual-world existence becomes the anchor for her final binding. Sensory details—warm fruit skins despite darkness, the hum of borrowed memories—are filtered through Elora's alchemical focus. The micro-setting (basin, window, tree) constrains her method and charges the final image when ribbons unfurl through greenhouse walls.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    The impossible library—shelves curving into themselves, light from nowhere—provides vivid spatial constraint and charges the closure when Iris takes the blank-covered book. The laundromat fluorescence and coffee-shop reflection ground the opening sensorily. The "Storage" door and descending staircase supply purposeful micro-setting that alters Iris's access to the society. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    The overgrown palace courtyard with wisteria and greenhouse-glass tea house grounds the scene vividly and selectively. Sensory details (jasmine scent in November, impossible goldfinches, warm bread six weeks old) signal magical realism and filter through Mira's noticing. The guerrilla gardens constrain the woman's method and charge the closure when Mira commits to planting sunflowers. Spatial choreography is clean; the courtyard's wildness mirrors the city's forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    The frozen library constrains Maren's work (thick wool, fingerless gloves, dangerous tears) and charges the final image (cold library becoming "briefly, impossibly golden"). Sensory detail is purposeful: quartz hush, misting breath, crack of expanding ice. The measuring device and temperature-controlled cases ground the setting in lived practice. Spatial choreography tracks clearly through the stacks, and the elevation detail (three miles above cloudline) isolates Maren in ways that matter to her choice of solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rotting pier, market's nocturnal commerce, lantern-light through gaps, and water lapping create vivid sensory grounding filtered through Nelle's urgency. The fob's brass gleam and the recorder as "new technology, barely legal" anchor micro-setting in her hand. Spatial choreography is clean: Crenshaw emerges from crates, his people reposition in shadows, Nelle walks back through the market and climbs toward morning. The setting pressures choice—"everyone was watching" constrains both parties—and the dawn timeframe tightens the window, meeting the 9+ environment-constraint gate with modest strength.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bluff setting constrains the encounter spatially and the lavender releases scent in waves that Mira tastes, anchoring sensory perception to place. The aurora responds to Kael's presence ("charged particles responding to whatever strange field he generated"), making setting an active participant. Micro-setting details—fox-fire lichens, sideways lavender bent by wind—are filtered through Mira's observational lens. The compass ring functions as object-as-setting, constraining Mira's methodology and charging the final image when it points toward the converging valley.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vividly rendered with auroral refractions and cathedral-like spires, and it directly charges the final image: crystals amplify Elena's work, transforming the cavern into a gallery. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (quartz catching light, limestone walls, glowing pigments). The after-hours timeframe and the grotto's spatial layout guide Elena's discovery and her choice to draw on the walls. Minor gap: the mechanics of mounting an easel in a closed tourist cave and the pigments' glow are asserted without grounding in the world's physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.1)
    The greenhouse city under toxic skies is vivid and specific ("skies the color of spoiled milk," "crystalline domes"). The postal plate fragment functions as a recurring object that guides action across beats (discovery, assembly, descent, recognition of grandmother's hand). The lower-level descent and reservoir setting provide spatial coherence. The gilded leaves Mira crafts and the glass vessels in the Archive create a charged parallel that supports the closure image. Micro-setting (her worktable, the maintenance corridors) shapes choices and the final Archive space alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bluff, clouds, and kinetic sculpture are vividly established with purposeful sensory detail (morning sun, glistening ice, wind-driven choreography). The ice fragment functions as micro-setting, constraining the sculpture's voice and charging the final image when "now half its original size" it continues to gleam. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Setting details reflect Mira's professional priorities (calibration, tuning, pivot mechanisms) without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    The glass dome and mutating roses function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the ending: roses "strangely organic," "crystalline petals soft as flesh" establish wrongness-as-beauty that M4-RY mirrors. The burial among roots is spatially specific and metaphorically coherent. The magnetic shift, thermal vents, and irrigation filters are integrated into action (the controlled burn plan, daily sensor chime). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through M4-RY's nurturing lens. The dome's environmental malfunction enables the rose mutations that become thematically load-bearing at closure, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.1)
    The courtyard with "amber and gold," "tangled bougainvillea," and "worn brick arches" establishes locale and tone. The mailroom and Mrs. Chen's mailbox provide functional micro-setting that enables the discovery. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—it remains vivid backdrop rather than tactical element. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the gathering and movement to the mailroom.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sunken laboratory anchors the opening effectively with bioluminescent algae, tidal generators, and waterproof cases that evoke a distinct atmosphere. Spatial choreography is coherent (descent, chamber navigation, ascent) and the underwater setting provides sensory specificity. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice or charge the final image—it functions as vivid backdrop rather than active participant in escalation or closure. Micro-setting allowance met (wetsuit, regulator, sealed journal), but the ending pivots to abstract future outcomes rather than a moment where setting pressures decision.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    The salt crystal chambers function as micro-setting that constrains choice: shifting gravity forces Maris to press against walls, the brine pool she must wade through, the heart's physical presence she cuts into. Sensory details are selective and purposeful—"gasoline-slick with dissolved minerals," "gleaming silence"—and filtered through her lantern-lighter's attention to light and texture. The whale's heart anchors the final image and enables the closure act.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    The nocturnal brook setting is vividly anchored—"moonlight silvered the brook's surface," night-blooming jasmine—and functions as a ritual ground that frames the climactic whisper. The origami wing and brook function as micro-setting elements that constrain the summoner's action: she must kneel beside water to map silence. Sensory detail is purposeful (starflowers, candle stillness, jasmine scent) and filtered through the protagonist's craft vocabulary. The setting charges the final image when she returns to her cottage to tend silence like a garden, closing the threshold motif.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rooftop garden supplies recurring sensory grounding (string lights, potted herbs, amber tea) and the meteor shower functions as both atmospheric charge and a recurring image that punctuates key beats ("meteors continued their ancient trajectories," "meteor blazed directly overhead," "meteors fell like punctuation marks"). The desk seal as physical object constrains Elena's final choice—its weight and history charge the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear (fire escape ascent, usual chair, seal pressed into palm) and the Latin inscriptions on the building below anchor the central stake throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    The velvet garden is anchored early with sensory specificity (moonflowers, tragically radiant blooms, twilight-to-dawn progression) and the space constrains Mira's final choice: she places the shell at the center, marking the buried half, which charges the closure image. The recurring shell and flowers function as micro-setting, reweighted at the end. Spatial choreography is coherent (rows, beds, garden center) and the dawn shift tracks cleanly. Details filter through Mira's bias (flowers as vessels, beauty inseparable from loss), and the garden's response to her actions (flowers turning toward her) integrates world logic into her perception without overt exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sanctuary's marble columns, stalactite drip rhythm, and aurora charge multiple beats and the closure image effectively. Spatial choreography remains clear (altar, columns, shadows, high windows, exterior rose). The stalactites' "patient rhythms" constrain time perception and mask Mei's careful footsteps—a micro-setting detail that affects tactics. The heritage rose returns at the end with evolved meaning, its thorns "gleaming like promises kept," and the aurora intensifies to punctuate the Magistrate's revelation. Pearl twilight filters through the sanctuary and modulates with pressure shifts, anchoring tone to setting throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.4)
    The serpentine nexus, canyon acoustics, and starlight filtering through cracks create vivid sensory grounding. Petroglyphs and the seashell provide tactile anchors. However, setting functions more as atmospheric backdrop than constraint—Mara's choices are not narrowed by access, proximity, or environmental pressure. The canyon does not force her hand; it facilitates discovery without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glacier shrine is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: "ancient ice," "candles flickering," "carved over winter months, one careful cut at a time." Spatial choreography is clear (Maya kneels, places globe, ghost drifts toward it) and the shrine functions as a threshold space that enables the summoning. The melted snow globe receives concrete handling across beats (pulled from wreck, placed among offerings, wrapped in cloth) and its warped glass/clouded water charge the final image. The shrine's breathing walls and frost spreading during Katherine's anguish tie environment to pressure, though the effect remains atmospheric rather than constraining a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    The whispering parapet after rain is sensorially vivid and purposeful: wet stone, fireflies, harbor gleam, rain-sweet air. The bamboo whisk and tangled net function as micro-setting objects that constrain choices—the whisk's "one hundred spirals" becomes the teaching frame, the net's structure dictates Kenji's curved untangling path. Spatial choreography is clear (two figures, one net, whisk between palms). The setting charges the final image without becoming a postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    The wasteland orchard is vivid and purposeful: "luminous fruit against gray sky," radioactive dust, Geiger counter clicks. The setting directly enables the mystery (trees thriving in poison) and the diamond's burial here is causally motivated. The soil looseness and the steel container are concrete anchors. Minor gap: the orchard's spatial layout and Vera's movement through it remain somewhat abstract—we don't feel the roots, the distance between trees, or how the "oldest tree" is identified beyond assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt glass portico is handled across multiple beats—filtering light, reflecting her face, framing the storm—and charges the final sanctuary image with tangible atmosphere. The stormlit observatory supplies sensory constraint (lightning, clouds, isolation) that pressures her choice toward the shadows. Spatial choreography is clean: equipment, glass, microphone, and her position remain coherent. Minor: the "sea of clouds that churned with perpetual lightning" reads slightly ornamental in the opener but is paid off through recurring storm imagery that mirrors escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    The feral loft is vividly anchored with "salt and wild roses threading through the floorboards" and "hundreds of glass jars lined the loft's walls," constraining Cosima's poverty and shaping her salvage practice. The music box discovery "where the dunes met the old boardwalk" grounds the inciting action in spatial logic. The setting charges the final image: descending "back toward her loft beneath the dunes" with "coins enough for bread" crystallizes her marginal survival and chosen purpose. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her poet's eye.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered with sensory specificity: the "groaning" ice, "cutting wind," and "golden sunset" that pierces chamber windows all ground the reader in a harsh, resonant environment. The lighthouse's resonance chamber—with its tuning fork and acoustic baffles—provides both the setting for the climax and the tool that enables Meris's solution, constraining her tactical options (she can't destroy the key, only retune it). Spatial choreography across the climb and chamber work is coherent. The marina's vibrational properties are woven into character perception and plot logic, charging the final image where "the ice sang its acceptance."

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct form a coherent spatial triangle that recurs across beats and charges the closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Ren's professional lens: ice contracting "like the earth itself was speaking," rain-silvered iron. The theodolite constrains her nightly practice, and the sanctuary's stillness enables her transformation. The viaduct's magnetic interference after rain is a specific constraint that shapes her calculations. Micro-setting (body at theodolite, numb fingers) reinforces the cost of patient work.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    The flooded tunnel, brass lantern, and hidden chamber constrain Elena's physical investigation and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven: corroded brass, muddy runoff, cold clean water. The Underground Railroad chamber's historical specificity and the nineteenth-century brick behind concrete supply meaningful constraint. Minor slip: "eighteen inches of muddy runoff" and spatial choreography of squeezing through gaps could be sharper, but the lantern as micro-setting object that enables the closure qualifies for high scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    The music box shop is purposefully textured—"symphony of ticking, whirring, crystalline chime," tools and mechanisms crowd the workbench—and the magnifying loupe becomes a micro-setting object constraining Eliana's vision and revealing her shift in perspective. Storm clouds clearing and light streaming through the window track emotional progression and charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean (doorway, counter, workbench, window), and the shop's "vibrant hush" modulates with pressure. The heart's design details (weak points, pressure releases) function as discovered setting elements that alter understanding and tactics in the final third, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating workshop, acid sea, and salvaged gears anchor vividly and recur across beats; the kaleidoscope and arrow tip function as micro-setting, constraining Mal's method and charging the final image. Sensory selection is strong—"acid spray hissed," "oil lamp," prismatic rays—and filtered through Mal's scavenger/engineer perspective. The workshop tilts on a wave during the final adjustment, integrating environment into the choice moment and elevating spatial coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive room is vividly realized with "ghost-light of a billion dead profiles," holographic timelines, and cascading backups that function as both atmosphere and plot device. The recurring 1408 motif and the locked directory create a concrete investigative landscape. The patch materializing in Elena's palm charges the final image, making the object-as-setting earn closure participation. Minor limitation: the archive's physicality could better constrain Elena's choices during investigation; most obstacles are digital rather than spatial.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse orchard above ice floes is vivid and specific, and the vintage store mirrors constrain Maren's breakthrough—she must enter this room she's avoided to unlock the new method. Micro-setting (mirrors, fragment, apple trees) charges the final image when blossoms reflect "two families remembering how to choose." Spatial choreography inside the lighthouse is coherent, and the ice-crack below threads through as atmospheric grounding. The mirrors cross the 9+ gate by enabling the core choice and charging closure, but the orchard itself remains largely postcard backdrop after the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    The drift-ice marina is specific and purposeful: "slabs of drift ice that never quite melted" and the frozen channel supply the journey that delivers key dialogue with Dr. Henriksen. The parasol functions as micro-setting, its ivory tip used to test floorboards in backstory and worn smooth by present grip, constraining her search for "hollow spaces." Sensory economy is strong—salt, diesel, polar dusk—filtered through Vera's changed perception. The three villages visited accumulate the hum motif without postcard drift.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    The amber pavilion, skeletal vines, and fog create vivid atmosphere filtered through Marcus's perspective. The vineyard's "wrong soil" functions as micro-setting that charges the closure metaphor, and autumn's stripping action mirrors the emotional denudement. Spatial choreography (pavilion entrance, bench, pavilion's edge, descent) remains clear. The setting constraints shape their conversation's tone and isolation, meeting the 9+ gate test for setting-as-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.1)
    The kinetic parapet "hummed under her feet, its ancient mechanisms still responding to footfalls, still shifting its metal lattices" provides immediate tactile grounding and recurs as Senna uses sand and iron filings from it as physical anchors for the consecration. The murmuring pavilion functions as both setting and object of preservation, its "fabric walls breathing with the voices" creating sensory pressure. Micro-setting (the stone, the circle of mixture) constrains the ritual and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent across descent, pavilion interior, and exit.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lavender field and rusted factory ruins create a vivid, specific setting that directly shapes the gathering—vines climbing walls throughout the afternoon visibly mark time and mirror reclamation, charging the final image. Sensory detail (fragrance mixing with metallic tang, purple sea, weathered door repurposed as table) is selective and purposeful, filtered through the event's needs. The factory beams forming unintentional arches tie setting to the photographs' motif, and the space functions as a crucible for the collective act. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; the work proceeds unimpeded, making the setting more atmospheric frame than pressure lever.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.1)
    The library's sonic architecture constrains her method—she uses the tuning-fork walls and resonator, not arbitrary tools. The crystal's warmth and the dawn's amber radiance charge the final image of standing "in between." Spatial choreography (stacks, reading desk, entrance) remains clear throughout. Sensory detail is purposeful (dust motes, humming crystal, whispers in walls) and filtered through her scholarly attention, though the "shadowed library at dawn" setting could apply pressure more directly to aChoice rather than serving primarily as thematic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    The fog sculpture garden constrains the prophet's project (mist as both canvas and erasure agent) and charges the final image: "the fog was lifting… he could see what he had built." The driftwood compass, chalk on stone, and beach/highway/ocean soundscape are integrated through action and perception. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (salt-heavy fog, susurrus of mixed sounds) without catalog padding. The micro-setting (stone beneath him, chalk crumbling, tide as clock) shapes the closure by literalizing impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory setting pressures Kenji's choice by literalizing the foundation-shaking (tremors force urgency) and the telescope provides the discovery vehicle. The spinning clock hand, disassembled chronometer, and orrery gears become micro-setting that Kenji manipulates to redirect energy rather than suppress it—tools constrain and enable his solution. Sensory detail is selective (thin alpine light, silver glow, foundation tremors through bones) and filtered through his repair-trained attention. The moon's visual intensification charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.1)
    The hospice floats "three thousand feet above the valley" with "clouds drifting through open courtyards," establishing a distinct spatial frame. Micro-setting qualifies: the shoebox of memories, the jagged vinyl piece, and the cello case are handled across beats and constrain Mr. Chen's choices (he clutches the fragment, later produces its mate). The "scent…green and beginning" in Room 408 charges the reconciliation moment. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the recurring motif of floating/radiance ties setting to tone without becoming ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    The nocturnal observatory and floating isle are vividly established with the brass telescope, orrery mechanism, and perpetual darkness. The clockwork key's keyhole discovery and the orrery's frozen state create spatial constraints that directly enable the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (key's warmth, hum of potential, dawn bleeding into darkness), and the micro-setting—the orrery at the observatory's base—charges the final image when the isle drifts into restored daylight.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    The secret garden and hedge maze create purposeful constraint: only those "who had learned to doubt their doubts" can enter, directly pressuring Marianne's skeptic-to-believer arc. The November/impossible-bloom contrast and "copper and honey" air establish wrongness efficiently. The stone table and tooth anchor the key choice moment. Spatial choreography is clean throughout (maze → garden center → stone table). The tooth as micro-object charges the closure when it "pulsed once against Marianne's palm, warm as a star being born," providing tactile proof that reconfigures her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.1)
    The serpentine grotto's slick walls, mist, and filtered light constrain Maren's work and charge the final image: the colored shadows cast across stone fulfill Elena's wish. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (mist that "never quite settled," amber glass held to "filtered light penetrating the mist"). Spatial choreography is clean (eastern shelf for dawn strike, flat stone table, tideline below). The grotto's "breath" and shifting atmosphere in the penultimate paragraph lean slightly toward personification, but the setting clearly enables the gem-polishing method and the light-scattering effect central to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    The abandoned data center as moss-garden cathedral is vivid and consistent, with luminous moss, thawing icicles, and concrete floor creating a coherent micro-environment. The setting constrains Maya's choices (she returns daily to document patterns) and charges the final image ("green cathedral"). Dr. Chen's navigation of the moss-carpeted pathway shows spatial coherence. The drip-pattern documentation and the amber pendant function as micro-setting elements that anchor reflection. No major lapses in spatial logic or tone-setting drift.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    The feral nexus, mist, and lighthouse ruins anchor spatially and create a liminal atmosphere that mirrors the novelist's between-state. The shell fragment recurs with purpose: pressed to temple, slipped into pocket, its broken chambers echoing interrupted growth. Micro-setting (body and small object) constrains the novelist's ritual practice and charges the final image when she "turned toward home, ready at last to write." Sensory selection is strong—"mist rolled in from the sea like breath against glass"—and filtered through the novelist's seeking stance.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.1)
    The verdant arbor is established early with strong sensory anchors (harvest moon, brass framework, copper wire between oaks, sacred spring). The vine's physical transformation—golden leaf unfurling, geometric wrapping, fruit ripening—constrains the proof Cassian seeks and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the mechanical operation. The setting functions as both laboratory and sacred space, integral to the ritual's success.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.1)
    The subarctic crater orchard is vividly rendered with frost-silvered trees, aurora light, and twilight atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "breath crystallizing," "gnarled branch," "shattered pieces of ice." The environment constrains Vera's work (cold, fragile materials, the timing of aurora light) and the pattern she creates on frozen ground becomes the functional workspace. The copper plate, flash-paper, and tree hollow all serve as micro-setting elements that enable the ritual. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    The marble cavern is vivid and functional: moonlight through fissures creates the repeating patterns Marcus maps, polished stone acts as a temporal mirror, and the geometric center where six passages converge becomes the mechanism's final placement. The timer itself—brass gears, corroded springs—constrains Marcus's reconstruction work across multiple beats. Sensory detail is selective and tied to Marcus's locksmith attention ("calcite deposits," "hairspring").

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bronze grotto functions as micro-setting: its walls match the lamp burner's oxidized brass "as if the grotto had been waiting," the starlight shafts provide the necessary angles for calcification, and the acoustic stillness ("shingled hush") anchors the reflective mode. The burner itself acts as a compass point that calls burdens and orients their transformation, directly constraining the ritual's geometry. The transition from first to second snowmelt tracks time and charges the final image with seasonal cost. Sensory detail is purposeful—"rivulets carved fresh channels," "condensation," "amber-colored crystal"—and filtered through the weaver's professional perception.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rain-beaded skylight functions as micro-setting that charges atmosphere and the final image ("Through the translucent ash wood, she could see the shadow of her own palm"). The loft, whips, scarred chairs, and ash blank anchor who/where early. The kettle's progression (whisper, murmur, scream) tracks time and pressure. Wood grain and tool constrain her carving choices (grain dictates form, knife reveals layers). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Margot's circus-trained priorities. Minor cap consideration: while vivid, the setting does not force a tactical choice as strongly as in the highest band, but the recurring rain and skylight image do charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    The kinetic lagoon—water spiraling upward, droplets suspended, columns touching clouds—constrains Mira's position on the crystal platform and charges the final moment when it "stills its spinning" as she accepts the ghost. The carousel's absence as causal anchor for broken physics is specific and purposeful. Sensory detail is filtered through Mira's disoriented perception (cloud-mist, fractured stillness, light from everywhere/nowhere) and integrated into her collecting behavior. The camera wheel as micro-object returns with reweighted meaning at closure, functioning as setting-extension.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    The terminal's architecture—dome, concourse, kiosks, drainage conduits—constrains Lena's redesign and charges the final image: "green where there was only gray" gains specificity from prior gate-areas-as-gardens and crystalline windows. Sensory detail is selective and job-filtered (thermal scans, mineral deposits, cotton-candy stains). The sextant piece and water stains function as micro-setting, recurring with reweighted meaning. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the atrium, upper concourse, and bookstore.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vivid, purposeful sensory detail: "crystal whispering forecourt," "petrichor nostalgia," "water droplets clung… like suspended time." The courtyard functions as both setting and symbolic frame, and the crystals' hum responds to her confession, applying light pressure. The sketchbook and satchel serve as micro-setting objects that constrain her opening and closing moves. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The sanctuary's "soundless" quality modulates believably as dawn breaks and birds begin. No gate penalty; environment charges the final image via the crystals and the "hidden sunrise" she walks back toward.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    The twilight canal setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "murky surface," "crystalline blue," and the sundial's warmth establishing atmosphere. The canal's glowing water and the sundial's role in revealing hidden blueprints give the environment a clear causal role. However, the setting's constraint on choice is mild—Mira observes more than she struggles against spatial or temporal pressure. The micro-setting (sundial, water, twilight angle) charges the final image adequately, lifting the score into the mid-7s, but the barge deck itself remains somewhat static as a platform for revelation rather than a crucible that forces tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    The golden dock, snow, and fog are vivid and purposeful, grounding Mira's work in a specific sensory envelope ("golden planks," "gray cotton"). The rope functions as micro-setting—its knots constrain her method and pace. However, environment does not force a choice or alter outcome; the setting supports atmosphere but remains postcard-descriptive in peak beats. Spatial choreography is clear, and the oceanic hush recurs to charge the final image, though without constraining agency.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    The shadowed garden and eastern-wing chamber are established early with sensory specificity (rust/gold leaves, bitter chrysanthemum perfume, skeletal roses). The crimson thread functions as micro-setting, anchoring past (the carpet's pre-war map) to present and charging the final image as "a route home." The garden's role in the Duchess's mourning constrains her choices (she tends by projection, not presence) and the setting's autumn decay mirrors the stake. Spatial choreography is clean across garden and chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.1)
    The suspended palace is vivid and the stalactite anchors create a memorable spatial signature. Sensory detail—light spilling from the egg, the phoenix's song resonating through chains—is selective and purposeful. The mechanical kingdom below is referenced but remains abstract; excavation machines "press in" without affecting lab access or choices. The laboratory itself defaults to generic assembly-table staging; no tool or spatial constraint alters Cael's assembly tactics during the crucial incubation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The obsidian lagoon is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (cool dark water, black sand drifting "like reverse stars") and the volcanic setting charges the metaphor network. The lagoon functions as more than backdrop: wading into it enacts the metaphor of suspension and survival. However, spatial choreography at the water's edge and the transition from shore to waist-deep could be sharper; we lose track of Elena's body for a beat. The setting constrains no choice—Maya and Elena move freely—so it stops short of the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.1)
    The city of forgotten fountains supplies vivid, purposeful detail: dry basins, crumbling streets, buildings "leaning together as if sharing secrets." The seven-fountain constellation and stained glass box are concretely rendered and constrain Mira's sequence of actions (pressing panels in pattern). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting charges the final image as fountains begin to flow, meeting the micro-setting standard for this length and rewarding selective, pressure-driven detail over breadth.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    The nebula garden functions as active setting: stellar dust provides the luminescence that solves the life-support crisis, and the viewport frames the thematic scale. Spatial choreography (pod interior, Keeper materializing, translucent palm revealing gardens) remains clear. The brass gear returns as a tactile object that charges the final image. The "flowers that bloom for a thousand years" and ionized-gas petals supply textural specificity that reflects the Keeper's timescale and constrains the encounter's urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    The greenhouse functions as micro-setting: cracked planters, amber/green glass, overgrown herbs anchor the scene and constrain the encounter to a liminal space. The monarchs' migration provides a recurring image (opening, dusk pools of light, final departure) that charges the ending by mirroring collective grief patterns. Spatial choreography is clear (potting bench, glass panels, Marcus materializing between herbs) and the dusk timeframe tightens the tutorial window, forcing closure when "the last butterfly departed weeks later" and Marcus fades.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    The obsidian ridge and tower constrain Maren's daily life (seventeen years winding) and charge the closure: she walks toward the sea after releasing the pendulum, the tidal rhythm mirroring her slow emergence of truth. The brass pendulum and rake handle function as micro-setting, both handled across multiple beats and evolving in state. Spatial choreography (stairs, tower heart, descent) is clean. Sensory detail is selective—volcanic glass, cold water, dusty light—and filtered through duty rather than catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt silo is vividly anchored ("blue paint peeling in spirals," "velveteen" darkness, broken roof revealing stars) and functions as more than backdrop—it provides a private workspace for Marta's decoding effort. The cemetery and its iron gates, the tapestry's tactile presence on concrete, and the camping lantern all ground the scene in specific sensory detail. The silo's interior constraints (darkness, floor space) shape the unfolding investigation. Minor gap: the transition from car to silo interior is compressed; we don't see her enter or set up, slightly weakening spatial choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.7)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vivid and consistently detailed throughout. The geothermal vents, spiral staircase, and glyphs create a tactile world. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; it does not constrain Maren's choices or materially shape the outcome. The kingfisher quill's microsensors and crystalline circuitry are mentioned but never pressure her writing in a way that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ember alcove, mist-pressed window, shortwave radio glow, and luminous dust particles create a coherent sensory environment filtered through Elena's professional focus. The mist beginning to glow and dust particles vibrating to the broadcast frequency constrain her discovery action. However, spatial choreography within the alcove remains generic—"held her breath," "stood, moving closer," "returned to her desk"—without tactile detail of how she navigates the space under pressure. The recurring ember/glow motif charges the final image of "dust dancing luminous around her head," elevating the score despite minimal room choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.1)
    The gallery's fog-edged architecture, perpetually rocking chair, and meditation garden constrain Elena's movements and charge the ending (mask placement, ash scattering). The mask's kintsugi construction (gold lacquer, sharp edges) is handled tactilely across multiple beats. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "fog," "charcoal," "particles," "stones." However, the "vanishing point" metaphor leans toward symbolic overlay rather than spatial choreography that alters tactics mid-scene. The garden and chair anchor closure, satisfying the 9+ gate test (environment charges the final image), but the gallery interior remains slightly generic beyond "walls lined with works."

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    The flooded ruins are vivid and selective: "sedimentary layers of civilization's collapse," storm-drain home, waterproof containers, candles. Spatial choreography is clear (descent, platform, Karin wading closer). The chronometer cog and rising water constrain the final choice and charge the closure image. Minor slip: "two levels down" and the general layering are described but not used tactically mid-scene, though they frame the thematic stakes well.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.1)
    The velvet library is vividly rendered with sound-dampening walls, amber light, and autumn leaves; these details support the thematic work of creating sanctuary. The rosette itself functions as micro-setting, constraining the teaching moment and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rusted greenhouse is vividly realized (corroded glass, rust-flaked soil, panels painted gold at sunrise) and recurs across beats to constrain and charge action. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's professional palate (tasting fear, desperation). The celestial alignment and the fruit's purple glow anchor the speculative logic. Spatial choreography remains clear. The greenhouse's transformation from neglect to beauty directly supports the thematic closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate's requirement that setting charge the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lightning collection tower is vividly anchored—copper coils, spiral stairs, amber generator glow, observation deck—and the vertical farms depending on drone pollination ground the world logic. The "nectar and gold" dusk light recurs purposefully, charging the final image. The lacquer box with gold-leaf bees and the dead drones are tactile, handled objects that constrain Chen's exposition and Mira's understanding. Spatial choreography (stairs, deck, generator housing as work surface) remains clear throughout, and the setting's dual function (energy collection + drone recharge hub) drives the failure's mechanics and the ending's symbolic readiness.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bay, tideline, and Kettering house are vivid and purposeful. Sensory detail is selective: "violets and earth," windows catching light differently, weeds in deliberate patterns. The orris root functions as micro-setting, constraining Mara's ritual and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (porch steps, windowsill, door frame). The streetlight frame anchors time and mirrors Mara's liminal awareness. However, the setting does not constrain a choice with visible cost; it supports rather than forces the turn, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    The underwater garden is vividly particular (animate stone fish, foxglove-stained ampoule, marble children as sentinels, anemone-dressed scales) and filtered through Marina's professional diver lens. The ampoule—a micro-setting object—constrains her choice by serving as material evidence and charging the final ascent image. Spatial choreography is clean: Marina floats, the statue is on a pedestal, bubbles spiral upward toward the salvage ship. The setting's transformation from tragedy-site to moral reckoning-site charges the closure without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.1)
    The infinite staircase is vivid and its "sourceless light" and defiance of Euclidean geometry are specific; the setting directly embodies perpetual motion and constrains Mara's choices (climb, descend, or step sideways). The dice rolling upward is a sharp sensory detail that signals altered physics. The office anchor at the end (laptop, desk) grounds the return. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the staircase charges the final realization. The setting fulfills the micro-setting/object-as-setting path and elevates the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rooftop greenhouse is concretely rendered (humidity, glass panels, orchids, smog-filtered moonlight) and constrains the action to a single pressurized space. Sensory details—saffron paint, persimmon-skin orange, toxic amber smog—are filtered through Mara's priorities and serve both atmosphere and thematic weight. The moon-tipped brush and canvas become micro-setting anchors that charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto setting and frozen waterfall constrain movement and supply the central obstacle. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: mist penetrating artifacts, ice-slicked streets, the emerald tint transforming blue-white to "something softer, almost hopeful." The cliff-face hives, pigment gardens, and glassblower kilns establish an ecosystem of interdependent crafts whose collapse is viscerally tied to the freeze. Spatial choreography remains clear across the museum corridors, kitchen, and artisans' quarter. The emerald lens functions as micro-setting, charging the final image by revealing hairline fractures. Minor slip: the exact mechanism of how the beekeeper's death caused the waterfall to freeze is asserted rather than explained, introducing a slight fairy-tale logic that isn't fully grounded in the world's rules.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lighthouse, spiral stairs, hunger stone, and rocky shore are vivid and purposeful. The hunger stone's inscription and its emergence at low tide create urgency and anchor the threshold moment. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The yoyo's tactile handling—"tangled in kelp," "weighted halves," "floating axle"—grounds the artifact. The setting directly charges the final image: the stone cracks, the tide inhales, and the yoyo falls into the surf, satisfying the 9+ test for constraint or closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.9)
    The funhouse setting is vivid and purposeful: warped mirrors multiply reflections, the space enables the reveal of fear as separate entity. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (hall of mirrors, twisted corridors). The opera cloak clasp functions as micro-setting object, warming and pulsing to guide Margot's realization. However, the abandoned carnival itself remains more atmospheric backdrop than active constraint on choice; the mirrors enable the climax but don't force difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.1)
    The floating orchard, copper-wrapped trees, and driftwood platform are vividly particular and integrated into action throughout. The blue hour frames perception and urgency. The leeward current and fractal clouds constrain Maren's choices and charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear—Maren moves between trees, Deren mobilizes crews, the orchard tilts. Sensory detail is filtered through Maren's professional focus. The xylophone mallet and copper wire function as micro-setting tools that enable her method, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    The turtle-shell micro-setting is indispensable: the crack constrains Maren's timeline, the spirals supply the language she decodes, and the outermost shell positions her to see the watchers. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("sunwashed air," "bleached turtle bone," "relentless brightness"). The environment charges the final image—the turtle's shift is both setting-event and closure beat. The "sunwashed dread" atmosphere intentionally tensions the visual clarity with existential threat, avoiding postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ivy-wrapped station is vividly rendered and atmospherically consistent. The rosebush's final petal functions as a temporal anchor and returns at the end with modest charge. However, the setting does not meaningfully constrain Elena's approach or Hawthorne's decision; it provides backdrop rather than pressure. Spatial choreography (waiting room, corridors, office) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    The submerged pavilion is vividly realized through selective, purposeful detail: "Fish darted through doorways where dancers had once spun. Seaweed draped over the marble columns like mourning veils." Sensory selection reflects Marcus's dual professional and elegiac attention. The foundation cracks function as more than setting—they enable his ritual and drive the discovery. The spatial choreography (stone steps, eastern corner, western wall, musicians' alcove) remains coherent throughout. The pavilion directly shapes the closure: the box is "unsealed by his movements," making the environment causally active in the discovery that reweights his understanding of absence.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sunken library is vividly realized: "five stories of learning now compressed by ocean weight into three floors," marble table listing from tidal pressure, mineral deposits on floors, water dripping as metronome. Spatial choreography is clear (catalog drawer → marble table → Section K → back to table) and the blackout constraint forces analog methodology, shaping Mira's investigative approach. The antique stamp functions as micro-setting object, handled across multiple beats and charging the final image. Environment detail (waterlogged spines, brass stamp, wax-preserved ink pad) reflects professional priorities and subtly mirrors the theme of preservation versus erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.1)
    The floating island with inverted camellia roots, glass basilica, and lanterns that trap/release sunlight are vivid and purposeful. The tea garden edge becomes a literal launch point for the cranes, constraining Mei's ritual. The lanterns' glow as "luminous torment" charges the final image, and the basilica's transparent spires provide both spatial anchor and thematic weight. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    The floating observatory pressures choice: Mira adjusts thrusters in response to magnetosphere data, and the frost-rimed window anchors her perception. The geode on her workstation recurs with shifting meaning (millennia in darkness → unrealized potential → light refraction). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "circuit breakers clicked and hissed, cooling," "auroras writhe like wedding veils catching fire." The micro-setting (workstation, instruments, desk lamp) charges the final image when she rotates the geode and continues searching.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.1)
    The observatory dome and twilight ("brilliant dimness") are vivid and purposeful, but setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Mara's drones launch regardless of location. Spatial choreography is clean (control platform, stone steps, open dome). The chip and navigation system function as micro-setting objects that enable the mission but do not impose trade-offs or charge the final image with physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cobalt terrace and forgotten shore are anchored early with vivid, purpose-driven detail ("driftwood accumulated like broken promises," "sand mixed with salt and sorrow"). The driftwood functions as both setting and ritual object, constraining Mara's nightly penance and charging the final image when she holds wood and watch hand together. Spatial choreography (terrace steps, twenty-foot distance) is clear. The setting pressures her isolation and frames her reckoning, meeting the 9+ gate requirement of constraint or charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    The storm-worn parapet is vividly rendered in the opening ("stone ribbon fraying at the edges, storm-worn and slick with mist") and returns at closure as Katrin remains alone, anchoring the neutral-ground concept. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: mist swirling, wind whistling through battlements, moon silvering the scene. The spatial choreography is clean (eastern/western stairwells, ten paces, center point). The parapet constrains the choreography and charges the final image when Katrin stands solitary, waiting for the next exchange. Environment directly shapes the synchronization ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    The coastal setting and compass constrain Marina's key choice: she clips the compass to her vest and checks it on the water, while the utility poles (her safety crutch) vanish as she commits. The dawn colors, swells, and wind angle are filtered through Marina's navigator priorities rather than tourist description. Spatial choreography remains clear across the launch sequence. The kayak launch functions as micro-setting that forces the decision into physical consequence. Strong enough to enter the 7-band but lacks the irreplaceability of environment at closure that would push toward 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    The underground lake with bioluminescent algae is vividly rendered and anchored early. The setting creates atmosphere ("blue-green shadows," "phosphorescent expanse") and the description of light thriving in darkness mirrors the thematic work. However, the environment doesn't constrain Marcus's choices or alter his tactics; he arrives, receives wisdom, and leaves. The baseball is handled but doesn't function as a tool that shapes action. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    The silver orchard, luminescent fruit, and permanent moonlight create vivid atmosphere. The spices (cinnamon that burns cold, saffron glowing) function as both setting texture and ritual tool, constraining the transformation method. The orchard's dual-reality (living/ghostly) directly enables the closure image where siblings walk "between" states. Spatial choreography remains clear across the spectral boundary, and sensory details (scent, translucence) charge the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.1)
    The midnight glade is rendered with concrete, PPV-specific sensory detail—moonlight like mercury, star-flowers that burn her throat, luminous sap weeping from the cracked saucer—and the setting constrains choice by making lost time visible as ghostly objects. The birthday tablecloth functions as micro-setting, grounding her decision to trace repeated hands. Spatial choreography is clean: cloud layers, glade, descent, nursery window. The phrase "choking beauty… gorgeous and unforgiving" modulates the tone and charges the final descent, satisfying the 9+ gate for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.1)
    The recycled spaceship's seventeen rebuilds and four-century history supply atmosphere and reflect the story's theme of accumulated pain. The observation deck, workshop, and magnetic field ground key beats. Mei's floating centimeter above deck and her fingertips grazing walls integrate body-as-micro-setting. The Tear's "impossible colors" and the shimmer on photographs constrain her research method and charge the final image when light refracts through the resonance chamber. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mei's scholarly focus.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    Black sand, volcano's heat, celestial alignment, and the ocean's rhythm are vivid and specific. The warm sand and volcanic exhalation constrain Mara's choices minimally—she sits, releases bugs—but the environment charges the final image effectively. Sensory detail is filtered through Mara's reflective stance. Spatial choreography is clean (beach, volcanic path, monitoring station direction). The setting functions more as symbolic backdrop than tactical constraint, but the micro-setting (warm sand, jar-opening) does appear in the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.1)
    The luminous fort, blackened corridors, and workshop are grounded early. The phosphorescent paint (harvested from the cradle of sparks) constrains the method and charges the final image—messages glow only in darkness, tying setting to tactics. Spatial choreography is clean (Maren moves through corridors, Voss steps into the workshop). Minor deduction: the "cradle of sparks" grove is introduced mid-story as exposition rather than discovered through action, briefly stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal bluff, aurora, frictionless water, and painted rocks create a vivid, physics-altered world. The collapsed star dust functions as both tool and micro-setting constraint, creating gravity wells that guide the eels. The final stone placement occurs under intensified aurora, charging the closure image. Sensory detail is filtered through Korin's attention (eels "neither swimming nor flying but existing in the space between"), and the frictionless physics consistently shape movement throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    The observatory perched above the cloudline—copper dome, lightning, thin air—constrains Mara's choices by enabling clarity and isolation. The darkroom timer is handled twice (salvaged artifact, wound repeatedly) and charges the closure rhythm. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "electrical veins split the sky," "storm-kissed wonder," air "too pure to corrupt." The micro-setting (timer, sealed envelope, notebook) functions as world enough for this single-scene vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass atrium, brook's murmur, and mechanical arm's crystalline panels create vivid sensory anchors filtered through academic urgency. The sundial's geometric shadows and painted numerals supply concrete workspace detail. The brook functions as atmospheric recurrence but doesn't constrain a choice or alter the ending image—it remains ambient rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.1)
    The rusted library with its "corrugated metal roof peeled back like a sardine can" functions as micro-setting that charges the closure: the broken roof admits moonlight for planting, the warped table becomes a seed-staging area, dust drifts supply soil. Sensory detail is selective—moon "bright and merciless," "liquid silver" light—and filtered through September's sharpness. The prison complex's geography (north fence, cell block D, warden's office) remains coherent across references. The setting constrains tactics (dust must be deep enough for roots) and the final image of blooming ruins under stars directly depends on the fractured roof.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tidal arbor suspended above clouds with glass floor, flickering compasses, and perpetual twilight creates a vivid, purposeful setting that shapes atmosphere and constrains the world's logic. Spatial choreography is clear (piano, projector, terminal doors). The setting charges the final image (stars reflected in glass floor, compasses steadying) and the clouds' violent churning mid-performance ties environment to escalation. Minor: occupational detail (projectionist lore, dirigible routes) enriches texture but doesn't constrain a key choice.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    The crimson ridge functions as a seasonal calendar and frames urgency (monsoon arrival). The seed's physical weight ("like a tiny sun") and the soil's texture during planting ground the key choice. The ridge "hums" at closure, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (standing among blooms, settling on stone, kneeling). Minor limitation: the mainland and its pull on the young remain abstract, reducing the setting's constraint on present choice.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    The islet setting grounds the piece with vivid, selective detail: wet sand, twisted pine, driftwood table, post-storm breeze, cerulean horizon. The bonsai tools and lace constrain Mira's actions in the tutorial sequence, and the compass sits between them as a charged object. The setting's "rhythmically placid" quality reinforces tone and supports the closure image of patient tending. The environment does not force a tactical choice but charges the final image, qualifying for solid integration without reaching indispensability.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse, shattered glass, waterlogged plants, and later the open sky with identifiable pulsars create a vivid, coherent physical and conceptual environment. Details are filtered through Helena’s dual lenses of science and caretaking, so microscopes, slides, and wing scales feel lived-in rather than touristic. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices beyond providing what can be salvaged, but it decisively charges the final image of scales “like stars,” binding space and earth. Weather and flood damage meaningfully color tone and stakes without bogging down in description.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    The canyon, stars, rock face, and especially the morning frost are vivid and strongly filtered through a glass artist’s eye, giving the setting a tactile, lived specificity. Environment directly shapes action: the frost’s disrupted patterns reveal tracks that lead to the cave, and the hidden inventory space is plausible within this landscape. The final image of the kiln roaring as frost melts on her windows nicely reweights earlier environmental details into thematic closure. A slightly stronger sense of the broader town’s physical presence would deepen the world, but at this length the focus feels appropriately tight.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    The winterglass conservatory, frozen bay, shattered instruments, and heat-sensitive panels are vivid, textured, and tightly integrated with mood and theme. The environment isn’t just backdrop; the cold, damage, and glass surfaces literally shape tactics (where she can press the tuning fork, how the installation works) and charge the final images.

A touch more evolution of the space under public pressure might push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is a major strength: the oilcloth, brine, diving bell, and impossible underwater library are vivid and tightly integrated with premise and theme. The architecture’s impossibilities (entrance at three depths, card catalogs into centuries) are not mere ornament; they embody liminality and justify the library’s rules. The broken lens installed in the dome charges the final image both visually and conceptually. A touch more tactile immediacy during the on-site work could raise this to the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    The terra-cotta arbor, ridge, and sanctions-stripped settlement are vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail that feels lived-in rather than touristic. Setting and objects (especially the bell and the crumbling clay) filter strongly through Mara’s exile consciousness and charge the final image of “midnight runs and morning declarations.” The arbor functions as more than a backdrop: it’s a historical locus for protest and now continuity, though it doesn’t materially constrain tactics so much as symbolically frame them.

The external ice melt mirrors his internal thaw without feeling like a mere cliché due to the concrete soundscape (“theatrical cracks”). Atmosphere, tool, and place are all working hard without over-description.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rusted library under the stars is vividly and efficiently evoked (“corroded iron beams groaning like the ribs of some dying beast”) and returns at the end as a charged backdrop (“releasing its ghosts”). Setting mirrors the thematic decay of institutional care and weaponized knowledge, giving the final image weight. However, the environment rarely constrains action or tactics; the story’s events could mostly occur in another abandoned site without structural change, which limits its integral role.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    The storm-tossed ridge fort, drowned roads, collapsed passes, and single dimming star create a vivid, coherent world whose physical conditions (isolation, darkness) meaningfully charge the premise. Setting details are selective and filtered through mood—“volume itself had become an enemy,” “ambered hush”—and the last star’s extinction directly shapes the final image. The environment constrains options (no roads, no light) though we don’t see specific tactical moves within the fort beyond the map room. Overall, atmosphere and world-building are strong and tightly bound to theme.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    The frozen courtyard and perpetual twilight are vivid and specific, and they set an immediately legible mood that supports the story’s liminal, contemplative concerns. The ice crystal violin functions as both object and environmental anchor, returning in multiple loops and charging the final image. Weather and cold are felt (frost, breath clouds, shattering), though they mainly serve atmosphere rather than constraining action. Overall, setting is economically rendered but deeply integrated into tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    The crystal forecourt is vivid and functionally integrated: acoustics justify the inciting eavesdropping, and the rain-slick crystals recur in the final image, charging the emotional resolution. The concert-hall night-shift ambience and the small work details (ticket rolls, lost-and-found, projection booth) feel specific rather than generic. The projector lens mediates both setting and symbol, tying environment to character choice. A slight expansion of how the physical space shapes her walk to the booth could intensify the pressure, but what’s present is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    The garden maze is vivid and integral: shifting passages, impossible seasonal simultaneity, and plant behavior all externalize the emotional and thematic stakes. World rules (the maze opening for her, closing to strangers) are consistent within the piece’s magical realism and directly charge the final image of her walking into the maze. Details like the lavender blooming in November and poisoned hedges regrowing back tie the environment to history and character. Setting is not backdrop but the core arena where deception, disorientation, and eventual recognition play out.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Kael’s professional eye: “perpetual twilight,” “icy warmth,” the gas giant’s shadow, and the Ephemera all feel integrated and not decorative. Environmental conditions (twilight alignment, the hush of Ephemera wings, station tremors) matter to when and how the experiment can occur. The recurring motifs of warmth/ice and twilight/time nicely charge the final image of the drifting Ephemera. World rules remain coherent and are learned through action rather than info-dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    The flooded opera house with dark chandelier and lantern-lit balconies is vivid, specific, and continuously integrated into action—water affects acoustics, delivers the program, and literally shapes the ghost’s messages. The environment constrains and enables choice (she sits in water, wades chest-deep, must protect the phone, reads water-reshaped ink), and the recurring lantern and water imagery strongly charge the final image. Sensory balance (sound of the cello, movement of water, light flicker) is excellent and always filtered through Marta’s musical eye. The only minor limit is that physical danger of the flood is largely atmospheric rather than a true pressure on her decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    The mountain weather station is vivid and purposeful: frost “like botanical illustrations,” clouds below, and the brief rose-gold dawn all mirror the theme of fragile, transient clarity. The environment is not just backdrop; it created the avalanche that haunts them and makes the oracle’s performance consequential, and the closing image of gathering clouds recharges the stakes. Technical/weather details are light but convincing enough for this length. A single tactile interaction with the harsher aspects of the station (e.g., equipment, cold) during her coding would have deepened the sense that the setting constrains her choices, not just her memories.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mill, tunnel, rotting ties, and especially the beaded valve wheels create a vivid, tactile environment that feels lived-in and thematically charged, with water, beads, and machinery echoing confession, prayer, and pressure. The setting meaningfully constrains and motivates choices (he must navigate the tunnel, follow the valves, listen in the dark) and charges the final image of water rushing and workers clocking out.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is outstanding: the overgrown library, catacombs, and obsidian refuge are sensorial, specific, and thematically fused with decay and renewal (“mushrooms bloomed from leather bindings,” “books became soil”). The environment genuinely shapes meaning: the refuge’s silence alters her practice, the catacombs’ depth mirrors her descent, and mineral script/stalagmites charge the final image with geological time. Details are filtered through her archivist sensibility, so the world never feels like a neutral backdrop. The only reason this doesn’t break into the 9s is that constraints remain conceptual rather than concretely limiting her choices in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the clinic on Sage Ridge, dense pines, sage scent, and eerie eclipse light create an atmosphere that mirrors the liminal emotional stakes. Environmental details are filtered through Mara’s sensibility as a music therapist, so sensory focus on sound and “subtle frequencies” feels character-driven. The sage garden and forest “holding its breath” reinforce the sense of held tension and possible transformation. The recurring small setting elements (the wooden box, the garden cushions, the cooling air) effectively charge the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.0)
    The reclaimed silo library, climbing vines, “bronze quiet,” spiral shelves, and specific objects create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s strongly filtered through Miren’s archivist sensibility. The environment meaningfully charges the premise—a vertical, salvaged space for salvaged stories—but doesn’t quite constrain concrete choices beyond mood. The tapestry, diaries, and other architectural fragments serve nicely as micro-settings and thematic carriers. Overall, setting feels lived-in and integral rather than postcard-like.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse on a rocky island, creeping fog, harbor pub, and global dim sum circuit are vividly and efficiently sketched, always filtered through Maya’s professional gaze. Setting is not mere backdrop: the lamp beam is both literal navigation and coded signal, and her isolation plus the supply boat rhythms concretely shape tactics. The final image—beam, rocks, scattered fortunes—beautifully ties environment to meaning. A slightly more embodied use of weather or cramped interior space during the planning would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dimensional anchor chamber, loop pedal, and floating blue marks create a vivid, specific environment that feels integral rather than decorative. The setting’s rules—overlapping dimensions, metaphysical marks in air—directly enable Calloway’s tactic and charge the final image when the room returns to “natural quietude.” Sensory detail is selective yet rich, with strong visual and aural elements braided together. The environment constrains and empowers choice, meeting the high-band test.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, and mirrored horizon are vivid, tactile, and central to both mood and meaning. Setting details—ice groaning, crystalline walls, dawn light doubling sky and lake—are filtered through Mira’s sensibility and echo the thematic symmetry. The environment meaningfully shapes the story: without the observatory vantage and the mirror effect, her realization would lose its physical anchor. It doesn’t heavily constrain logistics or tactics, but it decisively charges the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glowing, rain-slick viaduct is a strong, continuous setting anchor, and weather and texture (“wet stone,” “rain still beaded”) are tactile and purposeful. The viaduct’s shifting states across retraces effectively mirror and externalize the temporal instability. At the end, its reformation into something “solid and singular” and the feel of gravity on her body charge the final image. The only limitation is that the environment constrains symbolism and mood more than on-page tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cavern-as-workshop and former recording studio is richly and economically evoked, with details like cracks admitting autumn air, stretched goatskin, and the oscilloscope tying environment to vocation. The acoustics and enclosed space are meaningfully linked to the experiments with “filaments of hush” and the sense of a sanctuary where sound/silence architecture can be explored. The broken needle mounted above the bench and its final shadow-image effectively use object-as-setting to charge the ending. Setting could constrain physical choices a bit more, but it already does substantive thematic and atmospheric work.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    The courtyard at dusk, fountain, and faint shimmer of the barrier create a strong atmospheric frame that feels lived-in and specific without overdescription, and they’re filtered through a meteorologist’s sensibility. The environment matters thematically: the “quiet sanctuary” becomes charged as a layered, data-rich site, and the final image of her hearing the fountain as pattern is a clear setting-inflected closure. World rules around zones, pigeons, and old communication tech feel coherent and integrated into the scene. The setting doesn’t quite constrain tactics in a concrete way, but it deeply charges tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse, glass cases, and midnight orchid are rendered with vivid, economical specificity that supports tone and theme (extinction of scent, preservation, sterility). Details like “leaves pressing against transparent walls like prisoners” and “geometric panels above” are filtered through Maren’s sensibility and grief. The environment tangibly charges the final image—the preserved plants “holding their silent secrets” mirror her newly visible but intangible memories. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, but it deeply informs the mood and conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: Route 9, terra-cotta grotto, and starlight threads all feel tactile and specific, and the environment is filtered through Marcus’s poetic sensibility. The grotto and clay floor tangibly shape action by enabling the rope mandala/shrine, and the altered sky charges the final image (“stars…like questions”). World rules about the energy beings and matter’s “narrative resonance” stay consistent and are shown through how objects behave, not just told. This integration of cosmic alteration with small, grounded details is a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse, chest-deep water, sideways apple trees, and shipwreck ribs are not just decorative; they directly shape acoustics, movement, and the final image. Details like glass panels humming, water transmitting vibration to roots, and ship hulls “singing” are tightly filtered through Maya’s ear and repeatedly used. The environment constrains choices (wading, platform, bowl placement) and charges the ending when a single fruit dropping into water becomes the story’s clearest sound. World rules (floods, fires, persistent shipwrecks) are consistent and specific, giving the setting a lived-in strangeness.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    The amber grotto is vivid and sensorial, with light, texture, and static all tightly integrated into Mara’s perception. Crucially, the environment is not decorative: its deep time and the way it subsumes life into amber directly catalyze her reframing of authenticity and transformation. The setting returns at closure as conceptual scaffolding for her decision, charging the final image. Detail is economical yet rich, with no white-room moments.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory library with its glass dome, harbor scent, and starlight “pooled like spilled milk” is vivid and integrated, not just postcard detail. Maritime specifics (harbor, rope-makers, lighthouse keeper) filter naturally through Marianne’s professional lens. While the environment doesn’t strictly constrain choices, it thematically charges the final image—stars as witnesses to “cycles of compassion.” A touch more use of physical constraints or logistics in key moments could push this into the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.5)
    The crystalline orchard, shimmering crater, marsh, and obsidian arbor are vividly rendered with purposeful, non-generic detail that supports the lyrical tone. Setting is consistently filtered through Kael’s sensibility (bark like frozen starlight, fruit singing beyond language), which deepens both atmosphere and theme. The twin arbors at the end charge the final image by making the environment a visible embodiment of reconfigured belonging. While the terrain doesn’t much constrain tactics, it does meaningfully frame and weight the story’s choices and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rooftop canal system, bronze towers, aqueduct gaps, and the giant’s breathing create a vivid, coherent environment that does real work—channeling sound, shaping where the echo-pocket can exist, and providing the precarious paths Vera must traverse. World rules (water slowing, time borrowing) are shown through interaction rather than dumped, and the environment literally generates the core phenomenon she studies. The setting also charges the final image (echoes rippling across rooftops as the giant stirs), making it integral rather than postcard-like.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cavern orchard is richly specific and tightly integrated: dripping stalactites as metronome and water source, moonlight as both literal and mystical constraint, the mosaic stone as a functional ritual site. Environmental elements do more than decorate; they shape what is possible (vision only under moonlight, primes only at certain angles) and charge the final image of her continuing work in twilight. Sensory detail stays purposeful and POV-filtered rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    The library, crawl spaces, and mechanical room are vividly and economically rendered, with tactile and olfactory detail (“iron oxide and aged acetate”) that feels lived-in rather than touristic. The setting informs character and action—her ability to move unseen, cache items, and discover forgotten archives all depend on this architecture. The “sapphire hush” of dawn and the flickering power create a consistent, charged atmosphere that supports the theme of liminal visibility. Environment isn’t just backdrop; it meaningfully shapes what she can and cannot do, which justifies the high score.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    The nursery, mossy trellis, storms, and specific plants are vivid and functional, not just decorative; the trellis and moss literally shape microclimates and figuratively frame her thinking. Weather and season matter—storms test structures and catalyze her shift from fear to dialogue with the environment. The recurring linden, moss, and rain details culminate in the final image of the leaf spiraling down to rest among the moss, charging the closure. Sensory balance and POV-filtered noticing feel appropriate for a plant professional.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tidal island is vividly realized—causeway, mudflats, caves, altered tides—and consistently shapes what’s possible (isolation when the tide returns, twice-daily flooding, rain trails as guides). Details are filtered through her painter’s eye, so environment and perception are tightly braided. The brooch, rain trails, and caves recur as charged micro-settings that culminate in the still pool mirroring stars, which strongly charges the final realization. The only ceiling is that the environment doesn’t quite force a hard choice; it conditions experience more than constrains tactics in a concrete way.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    The crystal cave is richly imagined and tightly integrated with the story’s mechanics: sound, light, and mineral formations are not just decorative but the medium of prophecy and its disruption. Specifics like “cave pearl,” “bioluminescent moss,” and shadows forming “doors” evolve with the pressure and directly charge the climax. The environment constrains what’s possible—Mara’s entire gift is cave-bound—and the final image of the cave “singing her into something new” ties setting to transformation. It stops just short of 9+ because the rules of the cave’s magic are evocative rather than fully sharpened into concrete constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.3)
    Ivory Harbor after rain is vivid without excess—steaming planks, ocean spray, white stones “gleaming like promises kept” all support the mood of charged return. Details are filtered through Marina’s sensibility as an archivist, so the environment feels observed with curatorial precision rather than touristic listing. The harbor and archive building meaningfully frame beginning and end, charging the final image. The setting stops just short of actively constraining choices, which keeps this from the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    The station at 4–5 a.m., the mist-turned-constellations, and the impossible tunnel-fortress built from silence are richly specific and strongly filtered through Mara’s cartographic gaze. Environment and objects (cracks, lights, headlamp, notebook) meaningfully shape action by literally guiding her into the tunnel and framing her methods. The “starlit vault” and clock recur to charge the final image with thematic resonance about liminal hours and transition. Description is dense but controlled, never collapsing into a tourist catalog or white-room vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    The open-roof tower, Pacific horizon, and whale-borne vibrations create a strong, coherent atmosphere that feels necessary to the story’s premise. Setting is not decorative: the tower’s architecture and its connection to stone and water are directly tied to how the memories are stored and triggered. Sensory detail is selective but effective (vibration through the foundation, glow of the tile, dawn over the ocean), with a clear POV filter. A touch more tactile interaction with the environment under stress could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prismatic escondite, auroras, magnetic fields, and solar storm are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Cassius’s perception (“magnetic fields writhe like serpents through the stone”). Environment is not mere backdrop: the storm’s intensity and the dimensional distortions it triggers are the enabling constraint for Naia’s plan and the charged canvas of the final image. The rules of this strange setting are sketched through action rather than exposition, and the recurring prismatic imagery meaningfully charges tears, walls, and Naia’s dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    The funeral home prep room is vivid and specific (“formaledehyde and flowers,” chrome instruments, covered body) and thematically loaded without being over-explained. It constrains the scene plausibly—private, clinical, associated with honesty about death, in contrast to the performative parlors upstairs. The recurring presence of the ink pot on the embalming table as a focal object ties setting to conflict and closure. The environment clearly charges the final image of Vincent crying amid “tools of final honesty.”

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and original: bonsai labyrinth, humming fluorescent tubes, oversized blossoms and roots, and the mountaintop vs. silent town contrast all feel strongly imagined and sensorial. Details are filtered through her professional/time-collector lens, which gives them purpose beyond ornament. The environment mainly charges meaning rather than constraining physical choice, but the transition from distorted groves to the proportionate oak at the center powerfully underwrites the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.3)
    The port’s container labyrinth is vividly and economically drawn, with rust, spray-painted numbers, tide-lines, and stacked metal forming a coherent lived-in space. The environment is more than backdrop: it encodes erased histories and enables the discovery of misrouted goods and the label. While the setting strongly charges the thematic frame, it constrains choices only softly (e.g., high-tide reach, forgotten edge of the city). The final image leans more on the poison/roses motif than on the physical port, slightly limiting setting’s role in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory, cliff, cello, and shell are vividly realized and tightly integrated with theme and action rather than serving as backdrop. The setting of a decayed site of measurement and inquiry subtly mirrors Mira’s crisis about what counts as knowable. Environmental details (dust, cracked dome, ocean hum) recur and meaningfully charge the final image of the unfinished cello “standing vigil.” The space constrains options—there is nothing here but these instruments and the sea—so her choice to leave the cello in situ while taking the shell feels spatially and symbolically inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    The raft-city carnival is richly and economically realized: calliope music, brackish water, fried dough, interconnected platforms, speedboats and boutiques all create a specific, lived-in environment. Setting isn’t just decorative; being afloat versus “solid ground” is thematically and practically central, especially in the final image with the foundation stone chip. The world’s rules (drifting platforms, privatization threat, tourism) remain consistent, and details are filtered through Marina’s priorities. The only thing keeping this just under the very top band is that the environment constrains choices more conceptually than in concrete, moment-to-moment action.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is vivid and specific—“honeycomb shell” mountain, “condemned cathedral of stone,” crater with moonflowers—and consistently filtered through Chen’s gaze. Environmental facts (no birds, silence, mining scars, safe zone) deepen mood and help frame his choices, even if they don’t tightly constrain physical tactics. Recurring objects (crater, flowers, summit, grain) clearly charge the final image and embody the conflict between extraction and reverence. A few images verge on familiar, but the overall atmosphere is rich, coherent, and thematically integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    The misty, abandoned rail depot with water features is vivid, atmospheric, and tightly filtered through Mara’s non-visual perception. The environment directly shapes her tactics (using water, pipes, and acoustics in place of sight) and charges the final image of her fingers in the flowing water. Details like “cathedral silence” and “railway bones” deepen tone without feeling like a catalog. Setting and objects (water, pipes, depot, mist) all participate in the thematic and practical logic of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is a major strength: the rusted outpost, frozen lake, falcon at dawn, and condensation on the glass are vivid, tactile, and tightly bound to the premise. The environment constrains options (waiting for ice to thin, needing to drill, isolation of the station) and explicitly charges the final image of Mira stepping onto “ice older than cartography itself.” Details are filtered through her occupational perspective—tributary maps, atlases, watershed patterns—so specificity feels earned rather than touristic. This is publishable-level atmospheric work that directly shapes the story’s stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific—ancient archway, hollow-eyed buildings, cobblestones, the silent bell—and all are filtered through a consistent ghost-town atmosphere. Details like the cobblestones and bell are not just decorative; they become functional tools in the restoration and charge the final image. World rules (resonance, rhythm, hope as “frequency”) are implicit but consistent and learned through action rather than exposition. This is nearly publish-ready on atmosphere, with only minor room to deepen how environment tactically constrains choices.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    The underwater temple is vividly sketched—“limestone pillars draped in kelp like funeral shrouds,” “gathered hush of the deep”—and the environment sustains the elegiac tone. The setting constrains action via depth and oxygen limits, though tactics rarely depend on specific spatial features of the temple itself beyond its remoteness and age. The vial as a recurring object-as-setting is strong, especially in the final pocket image. There’s room for more tactile interaction with the physical space under time pressure to fully integrate setting with choice.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse prison on a jagged reef, the salt and rust, the skeletal chapel, and the copperlit impossible corridors are vivid and integrated with the action. The thinness of reality at this specific reef is not just atmosphere but the engine of the plot and transformation. Spatial oddities (“rooms nested inside rooms too small to contain them”) are clear enough to be evocative rather than confusing. The environment meaningfully constrains and enables choices, and it charges the final image of hovering with place-specific resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.6)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse and its endless night are strikingly specific and atmospheric, with the silver apples, mercury-and-rose scent, and winter-cracked fields giving a strong sense of place. Setting is not mere backdrop: the endless night, the half-completed transmutations, and the bead planted under the oldest tree all meaningfully charge the final transformation and dawn. Details remain tightly filtered through Marcus’ experience rather than turning into a catalog. A touch more interaction with the physical environment under pressure (e.g., his body navigating cold, glass, branches as obstacles) could push this toward top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    The canyon labyrinth and wharf world are sharply evoked through selective, purposeful detail—vermillion walls, tide pools, silk catching dawn, red dust on her fingers. Setting genuinely constrains and charges the action: the abandoned, rule-bound labyrinth makes her threading tactic necessary and meaningful, and the final image of threads turning stone to rose gold is deeply place-dependent. Environmental logic is consistent across time jumps, and the spatial sense of corridors and intersections underpins the metaphor without becoming abstract. This is richly atmospheric without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    The orchard-on-catacombs setting is vivid and thematically integrated—roots coiling around skulls, light filtering through bones, petals falling as she returns above. Environment shapes action: the roots and confined tunnel dictate careful excavation and preservation, and the orchard’s layout mirrors the cemetery below. The recurring objects (trees, bones, sundial) charge the final image, giving the setting real narrative weight rather than postcard ambience.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)
    The golden arcade, smog-thick New Manila sky, and chalk-covered marble floor are vivid and specific, with details filtered through Iris’s sensibility and profession. Setting is not ornamental: the physicality of the mail slot, the archaic building, and the ephemeral chalk directly embody the analog-vs-digital tension and charge the ending image of chalk glowing before erasure. World rules (near-obsolete surface mail maintained by romantics) are integrated smoothly into the scene. The environment subtly constrains the action—the choice must be enacted physically here, now.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt observatory, tarnished dome, autumn wind, and the eternal candle create a vivid, specific atmosphere that feels lived-in rather than touristic. Setting details are filtered through Mirelle’s occupational lens—embroidery frames as star charts, the flame as a signal, the Archive Vault as the true battleground of cosmology. The environment meaningfully constrains and shapes events: the observatory hierarchy explains her cover, and the flame’s traditional navigational role is weaponized as a covert channel. The autumn storm pressing on the walls and the brightening flame at the end both charge the closing image with more than decorative mood.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.0)
    The mangrove labyrinth, houseboat, singing spirits, and condensation on the window create a vivid, atmospheric setting that feels specific rather than generic. Environmental details are woven into action—the spirits’ song crescendos with the ritual; the moonlight and humidity enable the shard and condensation messages. The shard functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. Still, the mangrove labyrinth itself remains more mood than constraint; it doesn’t significantly alter tactics beyond ambiance.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the repurposed hotel atrium, mountain mist, and hospital beds feel specific and lived in, not generic. The mist and anesthetic blur together in a way that reflects and pressures her dwindling consciousness, directly affecting how much she can do now. The brain coral as micro-setting/object is beautifully handled, charging the final image and tying environment to theme and choice. A slight ceiling comes from the environment not materially constraining options beyond consciousness itself—there’s no spatial or social obstacle tested here—but for this length, that’s acceptable.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ruined orchard district and perpetual fog are vivid, sensorially grounded, and consistently filtered through an artist who notices light phenomena. The setting is not just backdrop: low light pressures her to “paint with light,” and the fog’s grayness is thematically reconfigured at the end as the very medium of joy. Details like “silver shimmer of fog droplets” and “ruined trees at dawn” do real atmospheric and thematic work. A small on-page interaction with the physical outdoors would make the constraint even more tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: the Cathedral Quarter frescoes, scaffolding, tools, and especially the sound wave garden create a tangible, unusual environment. Details are filtered through Lena’s professional eye and curiosity, and the world’s rules (sound reflecting, penetrating stone) are taught by action rather than exposition. Crucially, the environment constrains and enables choices—the garden’s acoustics trigger the investigation, and its “song” charges the final image—so setting is not mere backdrop but an active agent. This is near publish-ready in atmosphere and specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    The greenhouse is vivid and specific—humid air, elephant ear leaves, chrysanthemums, morpho butterflies; the entomologist’s legacy is smartly folded into both plot and atmosphere. The setting meaningfully shapes tactics: community gardens as recruitment, plant rows as codes, butterflies as an alternative communication channel. The environment’s textures (humidity, swirling iridescent wings, coded rows) support the tone of covert fertility and defiance. A slightly stronger sense of the outside world pressing in (e.g., physical surveillance, proximity of auditors) would deepen the setting’s constraining role.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    The shell setting is vivid, specific, and deeply integrated: cave/cathedral, nacre-lined chambers, and wind tunnels all mirror and amplify her work. Environmental details (shell acoustics, reef-shadows, the world’s scents and sounds at the lip) are consistently filtered through her sensibility. The shell and its relation to the absent sea charge the final image and thematic core, even if they don’t overtly constrain tactical choices. Sensory texture is strong across sight, sound, and smell without feeling like a tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    The opal library above the clouds, glass orchids, and the museum of extinct feelings are vividly rendered and deeply integrated into mood and meaning. Environmental specifics (dawn light refracted safely, artificial breeze, clouds pressing like questions) are not just pretty; they frame Miren’s choices and charge the final images. The cracked bamboo chime and orchids function as recurring, environment-bound objects that shape what she can do and how she understands loss. Setting is both atmosphere and concept without reading as a tour.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archive and its artefacts feel tactile and particular—the dust, leather codices, subterranean vault, and obsidian desk all filtered through Mira’s professional eye. The Varesh ink and language rules are integrated into action rather than dumped as lore, and the environment plausibly enables her unique tactic. The crystalline ink well and lamplight recur and meaningfully charge the final image where their hands meet beside it. While the broader world remains offstage, the micro-setting is vivid and functionally entangled with the story’s choice and ending.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    The crumbling amphitheater within a dormant volcano is vivid, tactile, and consistently filtered through Mira’s technical eye—“basalt ribs,” “porous rock,” and carved channels that double as both setting and mechanism. Environment actively constrains choices: the geothermal system, mineral deposits, and physical channels make her redesign feel grounded rather than abstract. The surveyor’s chain and the mountain’s “breathing” recur and meaningfully charge the final image. A slight tendency toward lush description over interaction at times keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    The attic setting is vivid and tonally integrated: the smell of leather bindings, shafts of light, dust motes, and phonograph cylinders all feel essential rather than decorative. Clara’s professional past filters what she notices (air currents, dust patterns) in a way that makes the environment inseparable from her inner life. The attic directly enables the core actions—cataloging cylinders, placing the meteorite in the skylight—and the dust and light charge the final images. It’s hard to imagine this story working in any other setting without major conceptual loss.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    The drifting prism terrace and gray void are vivid and specific, and the wooden rail as a micro-setting is excellent: tactile, history-bearing, and crucial to Mara’s method of reading. The surreal objects (chairs in three states, tables touching absent floors) reinforce the broken-causality world without devolving into catalog. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, the terrace as liminal edge and the rail as recurring object charge the final image. World rules (probability wake, refugees intuiting direction) are sketched efficiently and stay consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underwater facility and drowned city are vividly realized through selective, profession-filtered details (curved water of the dome, spires brightening with celestial alignments, bioluminescent thumb-sized creatures). The environment isn’t just decorative; the depth, isolation, and star-filtered water directly shape what can happen and what Senna can perceive, and the final image of the city “singing to stars” charges the thematic closure. Worldbuilding feels internally consistent at this length, with technical notes (pressure, observation domes, submersible) integrated smoothly into the prose. The feather as recurring object is atmospheric more than constraining, so it slightly underperforms its symbolic potential.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    The iridescent cave, crystalline walls, crater glass, and the incoming tide are all sensorially rich and strongly filtered through Marina’s sensibility (“cheerful gloom”). Setting is not postcard: the cave’s properties (refracting light, crater glass as interface) are crucial to how she discovers the truth, and the narrow sea path plus tide provide a concrete frame. The final image of the cave “puls[ing] with the light of a million unmade moments” charges both world and theme, making the environment central to the story’s resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tidal arcade is vividly particular—Victorian columns, kelp, LEDs, tides reclaiming the stones—and the four-hour window under moon-affected tides shapes the temporal frame of her work. Details are consistently filtered through Mara’s professional eye (tourist flows, acoustics), which keeps the setting tied to her goals rather than feeling like a catalog. The closing image of the tide erasing her “careful choreography” charges the theme of ephemerality versus control. The only thing holding this just shy of 9+ is that the environment, while atmospherically strong and temporally constraining, doesn’t materially pinch her final decision with Rebecca beyond tone and timing.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    The twilight orbital garden, crystalline flowers, and gravity generators are vividly rendered and tightly fused to the premise of nostalgic amnesia and artificial tides. Details like the flowers turning toward her and the “spontaneously anchored” habitat subtly mirror the theme of constructed belonging. The environment frames and amplifies the climax rather than constraining tactics, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    The harbor, prism atrium, mist, and noctilucent clouds are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through a glazier’s eye for light and glass. The environment is not decorative: pond, glass, and light actively shape how his realization manifests and what images closure can use. The final image of the atrium as “a temple to clear complexity” pays off the setting as more than backdrop. This is high-level atmospheric work that meaningfully charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.0)
    The moonlit ridge, charred stumps, and regenerating valley are vividly drawn and thematically resonant, mirroring Marcus’s own scarred yet regenerating life. The fire tower nights and celestial motions deepen his worldview in a character-specific way. The porcelain box functions as a powerful micro-setting object, charging the final image. The environment shapes mood more than concrete options, keeping this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tide-polished grotto, bioluminescent algae, and calcite formations are vivid and integrated, not backdrop; they frame her ritualistic work and echo the polishing/weaving theme. Environmental elements (tide surge, algae pulsing) are synchronized with the narrative escalation and the timelines’ breathing-together. The altitude gauge functions as a micro-setting object that anchors space and meaning and directly charges the final image. A slight bias toward the visual aside, the setting feels purposeful and tonally apt.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the drowning city, climate-altered ivy, and abandoned university library all feel tactile and particular. Acoustic perception (“corridor echo cartographer,” buildings’ “slow, ancient respiration”) filters details through Maya’s expertise, sharpening atmosphere. The ivy’s evolution into a “nervous system” that links structures and the passage’s final “exhale” both charge the closing image and theme. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain her tactical choices, it meaningfully shapes the story’s logic and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is lush, specific, and functional: the echoing terrace, wet stone, puddles, and prism parapet all interact with her mirages and songs to carry the concept into the world. Details are filtered through the story’s liminal, reflective mood, supporting both tone and theme without slipping into cataloguing. Environment and time of day shape tactics (she must work at dawn, using the parapet and rain to multiply images). The closing image of the city below singing from balconies and streets feels charged by the earlier spatial and atmospheric groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    The terrace, scorch marks, blood-stained stone, and “midsummer sun” create a vivid, thematically loaded environment that mirrors the war’s sedimented history. The clipboard functions almost as a micro-setting: a tool invested with ritual power that charges the final image. The celestial bodies’ “slow waltz” and the heat pressing down accent tone, though they don’t strongly constrain options. The piece could push the terrace from symbolic backdrop to a more active constraint on behavior to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    The salt flat, dried riverbed, helicopter, and encroaching storm are vividly rendered and tightly bound to character and stakes: this isn’t postcard scenery but the physical consequence of his business. The cracked earth as bird-footprint map and the salt dissolving beneath his feet in the rain are excellent examples of environment charging and constraining choice. Weather is not generic: thunder and withheld rain are woven into his tactics (eighteen months of preventing rainfall) and the final undoing of his map. Setting, object, and weather cohere into a charged, indispensable backdrop for the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the silver courtyard, fresh snow, and crystalline pavilion all echo the palace’s “beautiful corpse” serenity. The prism sanctuary’s winter-solstice appearance and the golden threads are not just decorative; they embody the mechanism of control she must undo. Environmental details like snow swirling to her heartbeat and starlight refracting into “impossible colors” reinforce tone and emotional state. The world’s rules for this magical architecture are consistent enough for the length and help charge the final image of shards and freed voices.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.7)
    The decommissioned radar dome is vivid, specific, and thematically apt (“designed once to track objects hurtling through space, to provide warning and protection”), echoing Marcus’s past misuse of narrative as a warning/bludgeon. The “meteor hush” and dawn light help modulate mood and anchor time without clutter. However, the environment rarely constrains his actions; it’s more metaphorical mirror than practical pressure. Still, the setting meaningfully charges the final image of him leaving with a new approach.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto above the clouds, the bamboo and silk tower, and the cloud layer below create an immediately vivid, specific world. Environmental impossibility and transience (wandering garden, altitude-defying spring) are tightly braided with the theme of fragile, vanishing routes. Recurring objects—the moth wing, the bamboo tower—charge the final image when she touches the wing in benediction. The setting mostly shapes meaning and tone rather than constraining physical options, which is the only thing holding this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    The icebound sanctum and aurora are richly, specifically rendered and consistently filtered through Mira’s emotional state. The environment actively charges the action: the cold, the aurora “listening,” the ancient rope and monk-built chapel, and finally the cracks in the ice that will let wind ring the bells. Details like “breath forming crystals” and colors faded to “whispers of crimson, saffron, indigo” ground the lyricism. The setting both mirrors and constrains the thematic thaw, though one more concrete way the harsh environment complicates the ritual could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rewilded forest and vine-draped bunker are vividly rendered with strong sensory texture (“drowning in chlorophyll,” rust and rain yet to fall) and integrate well with the post-collapse world. Setting is consistently filtered through her perception and thematically aligned with reclamation and hidden archives. The environment provides some functional pressure (storm, shelter, physical journey), but mostly serves as symbolic and atmospheric scaffolding rather than a hard constraint on options. That keeps it just shy of the highest band, though the specificity is publication-grade.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ancient Babylonian palace-turned-museum and the desert site are vividly sketched and consistently filtered through a professional stargazer’s eye, with dusk and twilight doing concrete work (lighting shifts revealing shadows on the tile). Setting meaningfully constrains choices: she must work around guards and specific light conditions, and the between-regimes austerity justifies both the palace’s partial reconstruction and her guerrilla methods. The “dusky harmony” motif ties atmosphere to theme and returns in the final image. A slightly deeper integration of physical hardship in the desert (cold, wind, fatigue) could have pushed this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    The soundless Sanctuary, text written in light, and cellular-memory vistas create a distinct, coherent atmosphere that’s tightly integrated with the story’s mechanics. The setting constrains communication (no sound, only written light) and enables the core action (memory projection), so it’s far from a white room. The music box functions as a micro-setting/object that charges the final image and concretizes abstraction. A bit more tactile or embodied detail could deepen immersion, but what’s here is economical and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ruined orchard and glass-like fog are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Aria’s craft-focused perception, giving the piece a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting directly constrains choices—the fog’s rhythms dictate timing, its erasing quality defines the core danger, and frost/mirrors/sextant form an integrated tool-environment system. World rules around the fog and frozen orchard stay consistent and are revealed through action rather than exposition. The final image of the fog “illuminating” boundaries leverages these established environmental specifics to charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    The orchard-in-the-cathedral is vivid, specific, and thematically charged, with branches through rafters and blossoms falling on their hands. Setting is filtered through Marta’s purpose (searching, climbing, working) rather than as static postcard description. The environment doesn’t exactly constrain tactical options, but it deeply charges meaning: “where prayers became fruit” and the trees’ persistence mirror the vows and craft. The recurring physicality of blossoms and rafters enriches the final image and helps elevate the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and particular: “astral orchard,” luminous fruit, starlight-drinking roots, and the cottage with the three-second-delayed mirror all feel integrated and purposeful. Environmental features are not just backdrop; the spiral pattern of trees, the central pistachio, and the mirror actively shape understanding and the final choice. World rules (nonlinear inheritance, the pocket of breathable atmosphere) are internally coherent within the piece’s surreal logic. A bit more tactile interaction with the impossible environment under stress could elevate this to top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mountain-spanning, neural-pathway bookstore and its unheard symphony are vividly realized and strongly integrated into plot and theme. Environmental details (spiraling shelves, humming corridors, reorganizing stacks) don’t just decorate; they constrain movement, direct discovery, and charge the final image of the shelves rearranging themselves. The living-library worldbuilding is consistent and learned through Marin’s movement rather than static exposition. A touch more tactile or bodily interaction with the environment under duress could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned carnival ship and foggy bay are vividly rendered and tightly thematized as a liminal, threshold environment (“trapped between bay and ocean, past and present, truth and revision”). Specifics like the salt-crusted porthole, peeling paint, funhouse mirrors, and rusted carousel all mirror the fragmented memories and ghosted joy. The setting meaningfully charges the ending image of a fleet of such vessels as a “garden” of forgotten names. While the environment shapes mood and metaphor more than concrete tactics, its integration is exceptionally strong for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    The clock tower mechanism room is vivid and integral: the humming gears, moonlit windows, and the ceremonial rope create a strong, specific atmosphere. Setting is tightly bound to concept—the architecture literally reconfigures in response to her work, and the rope functions as both text and control mechanism. The ticking clock’s rhythms layering and the shifting shadows give the environment an active presence that carries into the ending image. This is one of the piece’s strongest dimensions and meaningfully charges the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    The harmonic caves, ripple-marked stone, ice fractals, and bioluminescent lantern are vivid and tightly integrated into action and meaning. Setting is not postcard-like; it actively shapes tactics (following ripple marks and cracks, leveraging acoustics) and enables the solution via natural harmonics. The environment also charges the final image—the caves “sing a new song” and the silence rising from depths reframes the whole world above. A minor ceiling is that the surface village remains more sketched than embodied, keeping the setting’s emotional radius a bit narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the glass humming pavilion, etched panels, and vine-choked ruins all filter through Esme’s priorities, especially the star charts overlaid on the fallen city. Environment actively shapes meaning—the prism, stars, and tower aren’t just backdrop but the mechanism by which she discovers the map and her task. The sensory choices (sound of the pavilion, sight of the ruins and stars) are selective and purposeful. The final image of her descending from the tower along “star paths etched in crystal” shows the setting charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly imagined and precise—fog as architecture, a stormlit observatory, crystalline memory formations—and consistently filtered through Elden’s professional and emotional gaze. Environmental details aren’t postcard-static: lightning underfoot, rain on facets, and the solid fog all interact with her work and the story’s logic of time-as-sculpture. The central crystal and the observatory’s altitude charge the climax and final image (storm settling into “patient contemplation”). While the environment shapes the conceptual choice more than physically constraining tactics, its integration with premise and closure is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    The blooming fortress, mosaics, lanterns, and primrose are vivid, selective, and POV-filtered through a pyrotechnician’s eye for light and pattern. Setting isn’t mere backdrop: the mosaics convey technique and the summoning note, the fortress houses a specific community, and the primrose/lantern contrast charges the final image. The body-tool micro-setting of the kerosene knot further grounds tactile reality. A clearer way the architecture physically constrains his movement would push this even higher, but as is it strongly supports atmosphere and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grotto/tidal pool environment is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Chen’s professional gaze, giving it both mood and plausibility. Crucially, the setting is not just backdrop: the rising tide, the hermit crab, and the anemone’s cyclical exposure explicitly inform Chen’s metaphors and tactics and charge the final image of the “returning tide.” The jade cicada and mineral “constellations” enrich the sense of deep time and transition without feeling like pasted symbolism. Environment and recurring object clearly constrain his language and shape the thematic closure, meeting the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    The xenial trellis, cloudvines, sky three miles up, and inverted gravity are vivid and conceptually integrated with Mira’s fear of enclosed spaces. The environment directly shapes tactics (swinging on vines, bottles tumbling “up,” clouds that can shatter glass) and charges the final image of sprouting like the vines. World rules feel consistent and are learned via action rather than dry exposition. Some atmospheric flourishes risk over-ornamentation, but they mostly deepen rather than blur the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    The drifting prism terrace, storm glass, and atmospheric quiet are vividly realized and filtered through Marco’s professional eye, giving the world a concrete, memorable texture. Light and sound (or their absence) are integrated into action—the slowed motor, the swaying terrace, the fog and prisms all mirror and support the internal work. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain options, but it does function as a purposeful liminal space crucial to the story’s mechanism. The recurring storm glass charged in the final image strengthens the setting’s contribution to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is a major strength: the smart-stone palace, orbital mirrors, fiber-optic waterfall, and bioluminescent orchard are vivid, specific, and filtered through Kaida’s professional lens. World rules feel coherent enough for this length, and the environment directly shapes options (hidden mural, secret orchard, palace rearranging to guide her). The recurring physicality of surfaces peeling/parting (paint, light, glass floor) meaningfully echoes the thematic excavation. The final descent through the shifting glass floor clearly depends on this well-established environment.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sanctuary of ash, charcoal pillars, and soundless metal is vividly rendered and tightly integrated with theme: it is both the physical site and metaphorical residue of burned relationships. Details like the doorknocker made of melted wedding bands and chains are specific and charged, reappearing conceptually in the threshold scene and final image. The environment doesn’t physically constrain tactical options so much as define the emotional and symbolic stakes, but it clearly charges the closing moment where “the charcoal pillars stood witness.” Setting, atmosphere, and tone feel inseparable here.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vivid, strange, and tightly integrated with the story’s logic: the “quantum hum,” responsive glow, and placement of the breach between clusters all make the environment an active participant rather than backdrop. The mushrooms’ reactions (intensifying light, “symphonic brilliance,” humming approval) help locate turning points and effectively charge the final image of the diamond. World rules around concepts becoming physical are consistently implied through setting rather than explained. This atmosphere strongly supports both tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sepia reading room, amber/violet light, vanilla-and-dust smell, and the gramophone as a central object create a vivid, coherent atmosphere. Details are well-filtered through Cassian’s scholarly, guilty sensibility, and the room’s antiquity mirrors the age of the buried crimes. The gramophone as a tool/setting element meaningfully charges the final image (“a sound like time itself being measured and held accountable”), even if the broader environment doesn’t strongly constrain his choices. World rules and spatial layout are consistent and never confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    The greenhouse and alchemical orchard are strikingly rendered, with specific, sensorial details (golden humming apples, silver-dripping fruit that “sang in harmonics”) that feel filtered through his trained, disillusioned eye. The environment not only decorates but transforms into an amphitheater, then a stage, and finally is repriced as the true function of the greenhouse. Endless night and the factually mystical fruit both charge the final image where light pushes back the dark. Setting rules stay consistent and enrich theme without bogging in exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    The file room is vividly sensory—“paper decay,” “thin column” of dust—and always filtered through Miriam’s archivist eye. Environment and objects (shelves, files, dust, button) are integrated into action rather than pasted on, and the dust literally guides the discovery. The setting meaningfully charges the ending: this particular bureaucratic space is both the site of the original harm (misfiling) and the location of a partial redress (cross-referenced file). The atmosphere of neglect and quiet care underpins the theme without overt symbol-pushing.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    The auric lagoon, altered stars, and submerged telecom vault are vividly drawn and tightly integrated with action and stakes: the water’s properties enable the map, the vault provides literal refuge, and both are products of the regime’s erasures. Details feel selective and purposeful (golden water, cordons that “don’t draw attention,” smooth brass key), and they constrain choice—Mira’s tactics depend on this exact place. The final image of “starlight on golden water” directly charges the thematic tension between manipulated sky and stubborn truth. This is strong enough to enter high band, with setting doing real narrative work rather than just atmospheric decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and tightly integrated: the radiant grotto, mist, prism atrium, and dewdrops are all sensorially rich and consistently filtered through Marcus’s musical focus. Crucially, the grotto is not postcard-only; its acoustic and refractive properties enable the magical mechanics of “negative space” music and visibly respond to his actions (“Colors shifted in the prism atrium…”), charging both the climax and final image. Environmental detail evolves with events (light stabilizing, mist sighing), reinforcing emotional shifts. This is high-level setting work that supports both atmosphere and function.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ashen skyborne arbor is vivid, specific, and deeply integrated: its elevation, silver leaves, and bark all matter to how Miren works and what’s at stake. The environment doesn’t just decorate; it provides the mechanism of message (leaf-fall) and the locus of transformation (moonstone in the oldest branch), and the final image of branches reaching toward reconciliation is thematically charged. Details like “three hundred feet above the forsaken valley” and “pale branches spreading like veins” build a strong atmospheric and conceptual frame. The only limit to pushing higher is that the setting constrains choices more symbolically than through concrete physical obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    The subterranean workshop, waterfall, mossy tools, skeletal greenhouse, and swirling leaves are richly realized and strongly filtered through Marcus’s tinkerer gaze. Environment and recurring objects don’t just decorate; the waterfall’s mist prevents rust and provides water, the greenhouse window becomes a directional anchor, and the leaves physically and symbolically part to reveal the hidden door. The admiral’s chamber of charts extends the world coherently and charges the thematic stakes around time and navigation. Setting is both vivid and functional, and the recurring spaces charge the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    The foundry, storm, and rain-washed streets are vividly realized and tightly filtered through Mara’s working focus, giving a strong, lived-in sense of place. The coin and its golden seam function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image and embody the story’s emotional logic. Environmental details (bellows, crucible, rain, candle in the window) support tone and theme without becoming ornamental. While the setting more enables and mirrors action than constrains choices, its integration into the alchemical work and closure image is exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gorge is vividly realized—the limestone switchbacks, fog, hush, and especially the echoing of words and laughter. Setting is not postcard-only: the gorge’s acoustics and “stone’s memory” directly shape how confessions and healing work. The crocodile’s tooth and warped harp function as micro-setting tools anchoring her craft. Environment could constrain tactical choices even more, but it already feels integral and tonally apt.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ultraviolet forest is vividly rendered and constantly filtered through Sera’s altered perception—bioluminescent veins, Fibonacci spirals, fractal branching—so atmosphere and character are inseparable. The clearing’s engineered geometry actively constrains options by soothing her nervous system, enabling a conversation and choice that likely couldn’t happen elsewhere. World rules (UV light as non-triggering, patterned planting as therapy) feel internally consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition dumps. The final image of rooting in this specific violet environment powerfully charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.8)
    The alchemist’s market, suspended platforms, repurposed tenement floors, and factory-loom bridges create a striking, coherent world that reflects the story’s concern with reuse and layered histories. Setting is filtered through Mira’s translator sensibility (seeing how everything “had been something else first”), which keeps it character-specific rather than touristic. The lighthouse lens as object-setting charges both the studio sequence and the final exhibition image, satisfying the closure-constraint gate. A slight limitation is that the environment rarely imposes practical constraints on action; it’s more thematic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.1)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly realized with warped wood, curling posters, musty air, and failing fluorescents, all filtered through Marcus’s practical gaze. The environment is not just decorative: the ceiling tiles, crawlspace, and rickety chair shape his search and literally contain the secret. Occupational and atmospheric details (the elevator shaft, freight elevator call, demolition) deepen tone without bogging things down. The setting subtly charges the final image by juxtaposing what can be salvaged (the barrel, his promise) with what’s slated to be destroyed (the elevator, the circus itself).

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glass orchard above the cloud sea is vividly realized and functionally embedded: its floating/falling equilibrium is the core system under threat, and its rotation/spin embodies the awakening. Environmental specifics—the branches that are also shelves, frost on impossible glass, the cloud sea’s shifting perspectives—are consistently filtered through Marina’s relationship to stasis and motion. The final image of the library spinning through the cloud sea, casting “reading rainbows,” charges both the world and Marina’s new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    The baroque asteroid corridors, time-light, and embedded shard are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through Kasimir’s sensibility. The environment isn’t just decorative—it shapes his interpretive choices and literally provides the evidence for his thematic realization. The final image of the corridors “gleamed with burnished sorrow and stubborn hope” shows the setting reweighted by his internal shift. The only reason this doesn’t reach 9+ is that the setting constrains meaning more than it constrains physical options or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    The resonance chamber beneath the opera house, the satchel’s tiny “singing” parts, and the forget-me-not create a textured, integrated environment that feels both physical and arcane. Crucially, the chamber’s acoustics and accumulated sound are not just décor but the enabling mechanism for the solution. World rules around sound, transmutation, and joy-as-light are coherent and consistently applied. Setting and objects also charge the closing image of lingering echoes, giving the place thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: abandoned quarry levels, “mineral breath,” and the phosphorescent lagoon all feel tactile and charged. Environmental details are filtered through Mara’s sensibilities (smell of rain on stone, acoustic oddities), which reinforces both character and theme. The lagoon’s architecture—its hush, light, and depth—directly frames and constrains the final choice. A slight further use of physical constraint (e.g., access, danger) could push it into the very highest band, but as-is it’s atmospherically strong and functionally integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    The coastal road, storm, archway, and driftwood field are vividly realized and tightly filtered through Maya’s artist’s eye, with sensory detail doing real work rather than serving as backdrop. The archway literally and figuratively functions as a threshold where her worldview shifts, and the environment (blocked road, rain, cliffs) shapes her tactics. The root-ball’s physical qualities (twisted chambers catching water and light) directly inform the envisioned sculpture and final image. Setting is both atmospheric and structurally active, charging the ending’s sense of layered time.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    The amber pavilion, cathedral windows, and autumn dusk are vividly evoked with precise, sensuous detail that’s filtered through Mara’s visual artist sensibility. Light, glass, and seasonal transition all echo the thematic concern with changing illumination without feeling like a mere tour of scenery. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, it does meaningfully charge the final images (stars, night-blooming flowers, “different glass to understand the light”). Overall, atmosphere and specificity are a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    The imagery of copper clouds, the zeppelin library, desert dunes, and the obsidian lagoon is vivid and thematically resonant without becoming cluttered. The lagoon in particular is not just backdrop but a rule-bound environment that constrains choice and charges the final image. The zeppelin and Wastes are slightly more atmospheric than functional, but they still frame the stakes of leaving vs. remaining.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is richly particular—paper lanterns on rusted hooks, the skeletal wish-house, enchanted shells—and consistently filtered through Miranda’s sensibility as an alchemist and skeptic. The sealed amber bottle and the lanterns both function as charged recurring objects: the bottle constrains action (cannot be opened) and dictates tactics, while the lanterns’ final, non-magical glow recharges the opening image with thematic weight. World rules about wish-magic and its exhaustion are clear without over-explaining. The only minor gap is that the physical environment rarely exerts immediate, practical constraint; its influence is more symbolic and conceptual than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    The orchard atop the Meridian Tower, the harbor foghorn, and the crystalline pavilion are vivid, distinctive, and consistently re-used rather than ornamental. Environmental conditions (altitude, ancient trees in modern city, the foghorn’s silence) are integral to how prophecy functions and to the final passing-of-the-torch scene. The apple blossoms falling “despite there being no wind” is an excellent atmospheric pivot that charges the supernatural turn. Setting and mood are tightly fused to the story’s premise.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    The icebound atrium and distorted starlight are vividly rendered and immediately anchor place and mood, with the thawing environment evolving in step with Mara’s actions. The environment meaningfully constrains choices (frozen soil, sealed dome) and its transformation (melting ice, wet earth) charges the closure image. Details like the weeping dome and tears of glass feel specific and connected to the emotional arc rather than touristic description. A touch more tactile interaction with the environment underfoot and overhead during the climax could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mountaintop sanctuary above the clouds, carved into Kelspar’s face, is vivid and specific, and the air’s strange behavior is both atmospheric and plot-relevant. The bell rope functions as a tool bound to the place, and the altitude/microclimate directly constrain what Mara can sense and how fast the storm hits. Details like “perpetual sunlight,” “solstice hush,” and the cracking buttresses evolve with the action rather than sitting as static backdrop. The setting clearly charges the final image of the rope settling into stillness, reweighted by what it has just survived.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Belt station, brass fixtures, and vacuum-leaking dust create a strong, specific sense of place that feels lived-in rather than touristic. The yellow lantern glass in particular functions as object-as-setting, bathing the deck in amber and directly charging the final image. Environmental details (cosmic dust, meteors, forgotten corporate payments) mirror the thematic preoccupation with overlooked remnants and quiet endurance. Setting isn’t just backdrop; it shapes her way of living and perceiving, and the last paragraph depends on the station’s materiality to land.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    The beehives, scorched oasis, and eucalyptus above a hidden spring are vivid and unified, with precise images like “wooden frames bleached white” and the gathered ghosts at dusk grounding the mood. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the dead hives, drought, and ghost-haunted oasis all embody the theme of silenced, withered communication, and the eucalyptus roots become the stage for the final ritual. The stained-glass box as an object-in-setting is effectively charged in the last image, where it catalyzes Mara’s new vocation. A touch more tactile interaction with the harsh environment (heat, thirst, physical discomfort) could heighten stakes, but the atmospheric and thematic integration is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.3)
    The emerald silo and its green glass panels, the hollow core lined with time-fragments, and the post-Shift sky are vivid and tonally apt. The world rule—numbers and calendars losing their meaning—feels coherent and is gracefully woven in through objects (watches, appointment books, birthday cards) rather than pure exposition. The environment strongly charges the final image (urn shard held up in the emerald tower) but rarely constrains tactics or choices in a concrete way. Overall, setting and atmosphere are a major strength, though they lean more poetic than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cobalt lagoon after rain is vivid and specific; weather, water, reeds, and reflections all interact with action (kite over water, drake eruption, Maren wading, mirror-stillness at the end). The environment shapes possibilities—there is a feather to retrieve only because of this exact place and moment—and the final reflection on the lagoon “harmonizing discord” charges the last image. Details feel filtered through a poet’s eye without devolving into a scenery catalog. It stops just shy of 9+ because setting mostly supports emotional stakes rather than sharply constraining a decisive choice.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    The temple orchard, living limestone pillars, mycorrhizal networks, and copper-veined branches form a vivid, original setting that’s tightly integrated with action and theme. Environmental specifics are not postcard decoration: the porosity of stone, fungal networks, and wired trees directly shape what Maren can do and charge the final image of “stone and wood and flesh all speaking the same language.” A slight tendency to explain the system rather than always embody it in on-the-spot choices keeps this just short of the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and purpose-driven: wet stone, overgrown sculptures, muddy stairs, and spring rain all echo the themes of erosion, repetition, and partial erasure. Details are consistently filtered through Elara’s attention (footprints, moss, amber in light), giving the environment a lived-in, professional feel. Weather and architecture don’t just decorate—they shape the central metaphor (converging/vanishing footprints) and charge the final image of rain washing away her tracks. The micro-setting of the tower room and window seat is economical yet atmospheric, supporting the reflective tone.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the blooming jetty, dead reef, barnacled posts, salt content, and freshwater springs all directly constrain where and what he can plant. Environmental specifics (southern corner needing salt-resistant pods, western posts for sunset vines, the concord layer for forget-me-nots) drive choices rather than sit as backdrop. The tone of ruin-into-possibility is inseparable from this place, and the final image of seeds reclaiming the jetty is charged by everything we’ve learned about the reef beneath. This is setting operating as both constraint and thematic engine.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    The scrapyard settlement and cracked wasteland are vividly realized—“iron cancer,” “metal bones,” and the whispered community feel lived-in and tonally coherent. Environmental facts (scarcity, walking distance, rusted metal sheets) meaningfully shape how hope spreads and what’s logistically possible. The preserved leaf as a quasi-micro-setting object returns at the end to charge the final image and theme. This is one of the story’s most publication-ready elements.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    The time-dilated observation deck is vividly and economically rendered, with strong, specific images (titanium beams warped, temporal strata, sound arriving out of sync) that feel integral rather than decorative. World rules about temporal gradients and their perceptual effects are consistent and learned through her lived navigation, not infodump. The compass rose and the warped architecture both charge the final image and metaphorize her condition. Environment and physical rules clearly constrain what is possible for her, satisfying the “object-as-setting” and constraint criteria.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    The icebound spire above brass-colored clouds is vividly rendered and tonally aligned with the story’s numinous mood (“breath forming crystals,” “crystalline chamber”). The setting is consistently filtered through Kael’s sensory experience and supports the sense of liminal altitude where reality is thin. While it doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, it does charge the final image of him descending “into the wrongness” and underwrites the scale of the thematic question. Detail is economical and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    The whispering gallery, abandoned parliament, and interregnum city are vividly evoked and tightly thematized around echo, absence, and potential. The chessboard as a micro-setting object charges the atmosphere and the final image; details like dust, skylight, and footsteps in dust feel particular and lived-in. The environment shapes meaning more than tactics, but it is deeply fused to the story’s mood and premise. Spatial orientation is clear despite the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mountain-sized labyrinthine bookstore is vivid, sensorial, and thematically charged: “mountains that breathed paper and ink,” dust that tastes of forgotten civilizations, corridors that thunder. Setting is not postcard; it defines her hiding strategy and then physically reconfigures at closure, directly mirroring her internal shift. The final refracted dawn over the valley uses environment to charge the last image. It could press her tactically a bit more (e.g., concrete constraints of the maze), but at this length the integration is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    The frozen village, suspended rain, and guild hall with the tapestry are vividly concrete and filtered through Petrov’s sensibility. The time-freeze and thunder are not just backdrop; they define the story’s tempo and charge the idea of “fierce repose,” especially when the first raindrop breaks the spell. World rules around the freeze and labyrinth feel internally consistent and are conveyed through image rather than exposition dumps. The setting strongly shapes tone and theme, though it constrains mood more than literal tactical choices, which keeps this just under the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    The canyon of bone towers and endless echoes is vivid, specific, and constantly filtered through Mara’s perception. Setting is not decorative: acoustics shape the entire logic of confession and resistance, and the bone spire anchors both ritual and closure. Environmental rules (echoes transforming words) are consistent and creatively exploited in dialogue and theme. The final image of her hand on the humming bone surface meaningfully charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    The acid sea, floating workshop, and corroded statue are vivid and tightly integrated: the environment constrains action (breath limits, rocking workshop, dissolving rigs) and informs every choice. Sensory detail (sulfur reek, burning lungs, bones of other workshops) is specific and filtered through Maya’s priorities as an alchemist on a deadline. The recurring objects-as-setting—the statue and charm—charge the final image and are physically navigated, not just described. World rules (acid eats suits, work in held-breath intervals) feel consistent and lived-in at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Harbor, path, and especially the cave network are vividly rendered through selective visual and tactile detail (“barnacled stones,” “shafts of light,” “pillars over millennia”). The environment is not mere backdrop: the cave’s changing light and tides embody the “temporary eternity” concept and shape her tactics (painting fast, switching to shells, leaving the easel). Setting and objects recur and charge the final image of the hidden oasis and scattered shells. The atmosphere tightly supports both tone and theme without slipping into aimless cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lighthouse and surrounding environment are vividly specific and consistently filtered through Mira’s perceptions (salt-worn paint, iron railing humming with intent, night breeze carrying garden scent). Setting actively shapes tactics: the lantern room windows, the beam interval, and the horn vs. light debate all depend on this physical place and its tools. The cobalt lighthouse and dawn light recur to charge the final image with continuity and warmth rather than serving as mere backdrop. Sensory detail, especially smell and touch, is economical yet rich, strongly supporting atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    The station, dead antenna, and salvage field are sharply specific and consistently filtered through a navigator’s eye, giving the piece a strong, lived-in atmosphere. The patchwork jacket of charts and the bronze censer foot work as recurring, charged objects that frame both her past and final purpose. The environment subtly constrains options—she’s marooned with dead tech, forced to improvise a new kind of compass from obsolete remnants. This setting materially charges the final image of her building on inoperative infrastructure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    The hanging orchard and storm-battered ravine are vivid, tactile, and emotionally keyed to the story’s isolation-vs-connection concerns, and the final image of the glass eye on the post powerfully uses setting as charged backdrop. Details like rope bridges, wind, and truffle networks feel specific to Mira’s lived world rather than generic fantasy scenery. The environment shapes tone more than it constrains immediate choices, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse, opal dock, mist, and “nautical twilight” are vividly and economically drawn, with details consistently filtered through Magnus’s long familiarity. Setting is not mere backdrop—it meaningfully constrains options (the coordinates off the dock, the need to wait for low tide) and thematically mirrors liminality and secrecy. Weather and sea texture the atmosphere and support the idea of the ocean hoarding truths. The final image of him returning to the lighthouse through deepening twilight is strongly charged by the established environment.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cavern—with impossible midsummer roses, luminescent fungi, and dripping limestone—is vivid and sensorially rich, with details filtered through a map dealer’s attention to representation and symbol. The setting isn’t just postcard: it houses the carved map and physically enables the ants/doorway mechanism, and the rising creek and rain frame the theme of impermanence. Environmental rules (underground blooming, glowing fungus) are consistently uncanny rather than opportunistically shifting. It stops just short of 9-band because the environment rarely constrains his tactical options; it mostly serves as charged atmosphere and vessel for the central device.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific—“cobalt stone drinking the twilight,” starlight literally bleeding, impossible fireflies rising from an abyss—and is consistently filtered through her perception. The grotto’s environment shapes the encounter (thin air, altitude, darkness, and light dynamics) and charges the final image when she carries the grotto’s starlight inside her. World rules are fantastical but internally consistent and learned through action rather than exposition. The place is memorable and inseparable from the story’s emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ember nexus, twilight, workshop clutter, and nautilus shell are vividly rendered and tightly bound to the story’s logic of presence and memory. The shell, in particular, functions as a micro-setting object that structures method and charges the final image (“measuring out the mathematics of memory”). Environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, but it does meaningfully color and intensify the conceptual stakes. The setting is lived-in, not a backdrop, and it coheres with the scientific-mystical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mountain ranger cabin, birch bark scrolls, cedar box, and surrounding wilderness create a textured, coherent atmosphere that matches her isolation and temporal dislocation. Specifics like the owl call and the canyon of her grandmother’s ashes deepen mood without bloating. The birch bark scroll functions as a recurring object-as-setting that charges the opening and final images. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain actions, but it does meaningfully frame her retreat and the quiet, ritualistic stakes of her work.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    The water clock shop, foggy morning light, and semi-opaque jade chambers are vivid and tightly integrated with mood and meaning. The environment isn’t just decorative: the occluded windows and barely visible crack in the reservoir literalize the theme of “seeing what’s hidden” and directly enable Elena’s diagnosis. The brass screw as handled object and later as pendant functions as a micro-setting/tool that charges the final image. Detail level is economical and filtered through Elena’s priorities rather than touristic cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating rock tea platform, silvered chains, and incoming storm are vivid, memorable, and filtered through Mira’s ritual consciousness. Setting details (tea as ink, storm as “breath between storms,” the chasm echo) are tightly woven into action and theme rather than feeling touristic. The environment charges the final image—thunder rolling as she crosses the chain-path—underscoring her new relationship to storms. While the platform doesn’t heavily constrain tactics, it does function as a charged ritual space that shapes what is possible.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.1)
    The sheet music archive and the orchard are richly specific and inseparable from the conflict: Vivienne manifests through paper and annotations, and the looming destruction of the trees frames the emotional stakes. Details like the mixed Brahms/Billie Holiday vortex and out-of-season blossoms both advance action and echo the theme of “imperfect miracles.” The recurring micro-setting of the perfume bottle and annotated scores tangibly shape how Margot senses and engages the ghost. The final image of the orchard “singing” and petals like forgiveness recharges the entire environment with earned meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.4)
    The temple library is richly and specifically imagined—helical shelves, probability-shadow manuscripts, Arbitration Chamber—and consistently filters through Kael’s altered perception of time. Setting is not just backdrop: the spiral chamber and its ritual directly structure the central act that leads to closure. The atmosphere of suspended, almost sacred stillness (“air held a resounding hush”) is sustained and supports theme. A slightly greater sense of physical constraint or risk in navigating the space could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    The horizon station, fjord, hydraulic apparatus, and “edge of the world” are vividly evoked and tightly filtered through Maren’s technical gaze. Setting is not just backdrop: the horizon’s curvature is literally what she measures, then sees “rippl[ing] like silk,” and it returns as a “seam” in the final image, charging the closure. The micro-setting of clocks, mercury, and key effectively substitutes for a broader world while still implying institutional context (Cartographic Service, stations network). A slight further interplay between weather/physical constraints and her risk might push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vivid, sensorial, and filtered through Mara’s pattern-seeing mind, avoiding generic SF imagery. The environment is not just a backdrop: mycelial permeability explicitly informs her reframing of networks and emotional boundaries, and the luminous beds charge the final image of “breathing light through permeable barriers.” Spatial choreography (observation deck, stairs, railing, beds below) is clear and consistent. The micro-setting of the railing as the place she leaves the button further grounds the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rainwashed library, partial power-outage, and old mica lantern are vivid, selective, and strongly filtered through Maya’s sensibility. Environment is not mere backdrop: the storm justifies the lantern, and the lantern’s distortion literally widens her view and unlocks the hidden message. The atmosphere of an island of light in grey water mirrors her intellectual isolation without feeling forced. A slight limitation is that the hospital destination is sketched only abstractly, so the physical stakes remain confined to the library.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    The subway utility tunnel is vividly and economically rendered—pipes, conduits, hum of streetlamps, distant trains—and the environment isn’t decorative: it shapes the disc’s resonance via humidity and enforces Sarah’s physical and emotional isolation. The recurring object-as-setting (the glass harmonica disc) is tightly integrated with place, and its final “less haunted, more hopeful” song charges the last image. The quasi-bureaucratic undercity (Tunnel 47, Department of Disconnected Services) feels coherent and plausibly lived-in at this length. Overall, the setting meaningfully inflects mood, action, and theme without bogging the scene down.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    The harbor, blooming jetty, twilight, jasmine scent, and the tactile detail of walnut ink give the piece a rich, coherent atmosphere. Setting is consistently filtered through Maren’s archivist sensibility, especially the ink that makes new documents look ancient. The jetty and jasmine recur to charge the final image—“The blooming jetty held them all”—even if they don’t materially constrain choices. This is vivid, economical scene-building that supports tone and theme effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    The station and ivy are strongly realized and thematically apt—failed infrastructure overrun by nature mirroring forgotten disaster zones and organic mutual aid. Details like moss-covered benches repurposed for crates, the old ticket office, and “where trains no longer ran” integrate setting into action and stakes. The station’s properties (abandoned, off-grid, overgrown) justify it as a covert headquarters and symbolically charge the closure image when it becomes their “anchor point.” The environment pressures choices more symbolically than practically, but the recurrence is tight and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ultrasonic forest is vivid, sensorially inventive, and tightly filtered through Sera’s non-visual perception, avoiding generic woodland imagery. Environmental details (bat-song, moth-wing percussion, ancient grove “syntax”) aren’t postcard decoration; they’re the very medium of navigation and revelation. The platinum ring and rods function as tools that interact with this environment and charge the final stillpoint moment. A slight tendency toward stacked abstractions keeps it just shy of fully exemplary, but the setting is still a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kepler Station’s anomaly and the high observatory tower are sharply evoked and consistently filter Mara’s perceptions—the sideways tug, flickering screens, and drifting coffee cups all feel lived-in. The setting isn’t mere backdrop; the anomaly is redefined as a “bookmark” and directly charges the final premise that the station sits “in the margin between drafts of reality.” The fountain pen doubles as a micro-setting object that constrains gesture and thought. World rules around the anomaly and signals stay coherent at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    The harbor and moonlight are not just backdrop; they are the literal data source for the “music,” and the luminous water patterns shape both the method and the final image. Details like the glowing windows and people emerging onto decks concretize the setting’s social and emotional impact. The recurring harbor image—first as private observatory, then as public concert hall, finally as the subject of the last empty “click”—charges the ending. A slightly wider sensory palette beyond the visual could deepen the atmosphere further, but within this length the setting work is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.2)
    The limestone caves, ochre frescoes, and tapestry fragment create a vivid, coherent archeological setting tied tightly to Mara’s vocation and emotional drive. Details are selective and purposeful (predators having abandoned the caves, pigments still vibrant) and filtered through her scholar-thief gaze. The archive functions more as charged backdrop than as a concrete constraint on tactics, but it strongly inflects tone and theme. The final walk back to civilization with the fragment at her heart effectively recharges the environment’s significance in the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sound wave garden and auric lagoon are vividly imagined, with specific, synesthetic details that feel integral rather than decorative (“trees with bark that hummed in minor keys,” “flowers that chimed”). Setting is tightly bound to action: the environment responds to their emotional and relational state, going discordant in conflict and blooming in harmony. The lagoon’s function as a visualizer of their “intertwined neural patterns” and as the site of the final image directly charges the ending. This is a distinctive, well-integrated environment that meaningfully shapes the story’s texture and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.0)
    The container labyrinth, geomagnetic storm, and sound-bending corridors are vivid and coherent, with details filtered through Marcus’s professional familiarity (“his boots knew these paths better than his eyes”). The environment meaningfully shapes perception and tactics, especially the emphasis on acoustics over sight. However, the setting rarely constrains him in a way that creates true obstacles; the storm and shifting walls feel evocative more than dangerous. The final image of the aurora through the open door nicely recharges the worldbuilding in thematic terms.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.5)
    The canal district, cobalt dock, rain, stone bridge, and shutters are vividly rendered and constantly intertwined with action (mirror reflections, symbols on water, the moving shutters themselves). The environment is not backdrop: surfaces, light, and architecture literally make the secret communication possible and charge the final image of patterned shadows. The recurring object-as-setting of the dental mirror and the water’s reflective surface both constrain tactics and reappear at the end. World rules feel consistent and economical for the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt library, evening mist, and blue-tinted windows create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that suits the story’s quiet rebellion. The setting is seen through Miss Chen’s sensibility, especially in the final “lighthouse” image, which nicely charges the theme of guiding second thoughts. However, the environment doesn’t significantly constrain or redirect on-page choices; it’s more mood than tactical pressure. Still, the image system of mist, windows, and cobalt glass is specific and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dock and “sublittoral fringe” are vividly rendered—copper and pearl dawn, cargo nets, pilings vibrating with whale song—giving the scene strong atmosphere without confusion. Details are filtered well through Mira’s working body and competence, so nothing feels like a tourist catalog. The scrimshaw as a recurring object meaningfully charges the final image, anchoring the choice. Environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics beyond its liminal symbolism, which keeps this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    The farmhouse and turbines are economically but vividly rendered, with the “permanent shadow” and “renewable indifference” fusing worldbuilding and emotional atmosphere. The dried flowers function as a micro-setting object that decisively charges the final image and constrains the emotional choices in the room. Details are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding white-room syndrome while never bloating description. The physical environment doesn’t strongly constrain action, but it deeply textures tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and humming quartz pillars are vivid, specific, and integrated with action (her palm on quartz, watching wind-etched patterns on ice that model the poetry’s ephemerality). The environment consistently mirrors the thematic concerns (fragile surfaces, shifting patterns) without feeling like mere decoration. While the setting doesn’t strictly constrain her choices, it deeply charges the final image of poetry “remembering how to breathe again.” The worldbuilding (ban, authorities, quartz frequencies) feels internally consistent at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.3)
    The glassblower’s courtyard, scorched planters, and glass chimes create a distinctive, coherent atmosphere that’s tightly integrated with the magic (phoenix furnace, plant messages, courtyard energy). Details are filtered well through Maya’s perception, especially her relationship to value/contrast rather than color. The environment does exert some narrative pressure by guiding her via plant placement and situating the phoenix’s impact, but it doesn’t strongly constrain her options beyond that guidance. Still, the space feels lived-in, specific, and thematically charged without sliding into mere décor.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “laboratory of lost sounds,” the wall of analog recordings, and the miner’s carbide lamp lens create a vivid, specific environment that matches the premise. Setting is consistently filtered through Maren’s priorities (light as safety, sound as sacred space) rather than feeling like a neutral tour. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactical choices, but the lamp and the acoustic space clearly shape mood and the final image (“glowed above them like a small sun”). World rules feel internally consistent for the length and support the atmosphere without exposition bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observatory and its instruments are vivid and purposeful: “stood for centuries, yet somehow existed outside time,” the greened copper dome, the brass eyepiece, all echo the theme of enduring grief and suspended time. The cellar workshop, brooches, and scattered paper cranes create a tactile micro-setting that feels lived-in rather than decorative. Environment constrains choice meaningfully—this particular hidden observatory can function as a secret coordinate for other “drowning” people, and the telescope charges the final image of stars as “genuinely artificial.” Weather and broader city are sparing but sufficient given the tight focus.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.9)
    The rain, skylight, lamplight on onyx cards, and loft table form a vivid, coherent atmosphere filtered through Vesper’s sensibility. The measuring tape and cards as tools are nicely integrated into her work, and the rain-slick city lights at the end charge the “constellations” image. Environment doesn’t much constrain choice or tactics—this could largely occur in any quiet room—so its role is more tonal than operative. Still, the specificity and consistency of the space powerfully support mood and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the bronze prism pagoda, twilight light splitting into unnamed colors, and the impossible-geometry archive of crystallized “essence-memories” all feel strongly realized. World rules (avoiding patterns, essence-memories vs. recordings) are embedded into action and perception rather than dumped. The environment meaningfully shapes the story: the pagoda’s design gates access, and the archive’s physical form (crystals dissolving into skin) dictates how she engages with knowledge. The final image returns to pagoda and archive as charged objects, giving the world a strong atmospheric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the blooming glass library above clouds, drifting ghosts of clouds, and dream-glass shelves all feel specific and sensorially rich. Details are filtered through Sera’s sensibility (dusk colors, thresholds of light and dark), and the river stone functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image and her choice. The world’s dream-sharing rules are sketched efficiently through action and memory rather than exposition dumps, and the mood of high-altitude isolation suits the thematic concerns. The library itself pressures choices only lightly, but the environment and object meaningfully charge the ending image, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mountain workshop, mist, and starlight are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elena’s state, creating a strong, unified atmosphere. The chameleon enclosure functions as a micro-setting that focuses her attention and charges crucial objects (tail tip, shed skin). The environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options but it does embody isolation after scandal and charges the final images of mist obscuring/revealing and stars wheeling above. Details feel selective and purposeful rather than touristic or generic.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tower, meteor-silenced radius, roses, moss, table-wood, and frozen hourglass are all tightly integrated and continually filtered through Mara’s perceptual bias. Environment isn’t just backdrop; the wood’s memory, the roses’ testimony, and the impossible hourglass all literally constrain what she can know and do, and the dawn light on her wrist charges the opening and ending. World rules (meteor hush, plant-thoughts) feel consistent and are learned through her actions rather than exposition dumps. One could imagine slightly more tactile engagement with the physical tower itself in the climax, but what’s present is already strongly functional and atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    The vintage movie palace and projection booth are vividly and economically rendered (brass rail worn smooth, dust motes, thick walls muffling thunder) and clearly anchored in time and space. The setting is not merely decorative: the booth’s history, its window, and the projector directly enable the discovery of the box and the projection of the love-map. The idea of the booth as an “incubation chamber” for unused love elegantly fuses physical space with the core concept and charges the final images. This is rich, purposeful atmosphere that also structures the magic, just shy of the very highest tier of constraint-driven setting.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    The aurora-lit archway, tundra edge, and brass astrolabe are vividly rendered and tonally precise, giving the piece a strong sense of elsewhere without over-explaining the world. The archway as threshold and locus of the binding ritual, together with the aurora’s intensification at the climax, charges the final images and underscores the liminal theme. Environmental details like cold fingers and pulsing stone are integrated into action rather than bolted on. The setting shapes meaning more than concrete options (no physical constraints or dangers), but for a lyric piece this is effectively done.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and strongly filtered through the story’s quantum-ecological logic: superposed territories, a dune that is “occasionally everywhere,” bioluminescent flowers singing a “fractured lullaby.” Environmental rules (observation collapses multiplicity, the seeds rooting through multiple realities) are consistent and learned through action rather than lecture. The clock and the dune both function as micro-settings that charge the final image—the single tick and the dune blooming in all locations. Atmosphere and worldbuilding are tightly fused with theme rather than feeling like a postcard tour.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mechanical rainforest is vividly and precisely realized—brass canopies, aluminum fronds, titanium bamboo—and consistently filtered through the philosopher’s epistemic lens. Setting is not mere backdrop: the forest’s sounds convey information, the clearing and mechanism are spatially legible, and the final holographic map fuses environment with mind. The world rules (self-sustaining, algorithmic forest) feel internally consistent and are learned via observation and action. The forest meaningfully charges the final image when it’s revealed as the architecture of his own consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ridgeway, the “hour between dog and wolf,” mist, and ocean fog create a vivid liminal atmosphere that is both tactile and thematically aligned. The environment evolves with the journey—crossroads of fog and fern, moss-covered stone, deepening twilight—and the ticket punch functions as a charged micro-setting object that shapes how they navigate. The final image of Mara with “a star-shaped hole in the other” is strongly anchored in the physical world and recharges prior detail. The setting mostly pressures emotion and meaning rather than concrete logistics, preventing it from feeling fully inescapable.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cobalt fortress, endless snow, crooked door, worn staircase, and damaged bench create a vivid, coherent environment that mirrors and charges the emotional stakes. Objects like the piano and bolt recur with reweighted meaning and are integrated into action rather than serving as static scenery. While the snow and cold are more thematic than tactical constraints in this scene, the setting deeply inflects tone and the final image. World details feel selective and purposeful, not touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “fold between moments” temple library is vivid, specific, and well-integrated, from constellation-leather tomes to starlight-water and impossible windows. The setting isn’t mere backdrop: its out-of-time nature explains Ossian’s role and how the books can rewrite reality. The final image of constellations drifting to the ceiling and stars wheeling outside meaningfully charges the ending and underlines the story’s cosmic-temporal theme. A touch more tactile interaction with the environment under pressure could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    The monitoring station, tethered cables, and bleached reef are vividly drawn and consistently filtered through Mara’s professional gaze, giving the setting both scientific and elegiac weight. The environment constrains what’s possible—remote instruments, radio contact, no direct physical intervention—and that constraint underwrites the quiet, cerebral nature of the climax. Recurring objects (reef, station, atlas page) charge the final image of being “moored but drifting.” The piece could layer one or two more tactile or sonic details at peak pressure, but what’s here is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.5)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay is vividly rendered and tightly integrated—the cold metal grating under bare feet, rusted scaffolding, gutted ships, and collapsed roof all shape how she moves and sees. The ancient stone circle hidden within this futurist ruin meaningfully charges both the thematic contrast (future/ancient) and the final image. The opera glasses and the stones function as micro-settings/tools that constrain perception and literally reconfigure what can be read. Setting is not just backdrop; it frames and enables the decisive revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    The volcanic hot springs and bioluminescent cavern are vividly rendered and feel integral rather than decorative; details like mineral-crusted rocks, sulfurous water, and fungal glow are specific and purposeful. The setting constrains choices (Authority’s off-limits spring, hidden cavern, early dawn descent) and charges the final image as she emerges steaming and newly connected. Environmental details (plants leaning in, air tasting of iron and time) are well filtered through Naja’s sensibility. A bit more sense of physical peril or instability in the cavern could further bind environment to stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    The arboretum, cliff, and defunct lighthouse are vivid and thematically integrated, not mere backdrop. Environmental elements (salt-kissed air, ocean waves, failing lighthouse) mirror and reweight her sense of adapted purpose and enduring grief. The lighthouse’s obsolescence directly charges the final image and her self-understanding. Setting could constrain immediate tactical choices more, but for this quiet, lyric mode it’s doing heavy conceptual work.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse library setting is vivid and integral: seventeen flights climbed, maritime-law stacks, the rotating beam slicing the room, and moving walls all shape mood and action. The environment actively pressures her (shrinking room, falling books) and then literally charges the final image as the beam ignites the cards. Details feel selective and purposeful rather than touristic. The world’s liminal, salt-crusted strangeness dovetails well with the theme of threshold vision.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.3)
    The desert encampment, meditation caves, wind, and sun are economically but vividly rendered, and they matter: the ink’s evanescence and the need to photograph/read patterns before they vanish are direct consequences of environment. Kael’s desert-bred perception filters the landscape so it never reads as a generic backdrop. The final image of emerging “into the light” after dwelling among ink patterns in a carved cave nicely charges the setting with thematic weight. The only thing keeping this below the very top band is that environmental constraint, while present, could pressure moment-to-moment tactics even more.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cryogenic archive beneath snow is vividly rendered—the crystalline stairs, nitrogen-frosted glass, muffled silence, and thermal details all build a convincing, cold, secretive space. The environment supports the thematic isolation of forbidden truths and meaningfully frames her solitude and control over the vault. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain her options (she moves through it with professional ease), it does charge the final decision with a sense of grave, buried consequence. The consistent sensory return to snow, ice, and breath integrates atmosphere with action rather than feeling like backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dome, desert, and roses are vivid and purposeful: sand-scratched glass, amber light, and specific objects like ballast and compass fragments all serve both mood and meaning. The enclosure isn’t postcard dressing—it’s the literal site of the conflict (space for refugees vs. sanctuary for continuity) and charges the final image of clean light after dust. World rules around the tower’s fall, scattered airships, and refugee pressures feel consistent at this length. Setting meaningfully constrains the options on the table without over-exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sound wave garden is vivid, specific, and fully integrated—the acoustic flowers, frequency pools, and edge-of-city static all shape how Mara moves and what tactics she uses. The rail spike and shifting gravity in particular tie environment directly to choice. World rules feel internally consistent and are taught through action rather than expository dump. This is publish-level scene-setting, though one more moment where the environment directly constrains or endangers her body would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observatory above the clouds, the brass telescope, and the echoing dome are vivid and consistently filtered through Celeste’s astronomical sensibility, giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine. Setting is not just decorative: tools like sextants, astrolabes, and the vantage over the city concretize her investigative process and charge the final image of dawn and the newspaper building below. The rosewood nib as a recurring micro-object meaningfully bridges family legacy, method, and the act of publication. World rules are coherent, though the observatory’s altitude is more mythic than literal, which suits the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “laboratory of lost sounds” is vivid, specific, and tightly integrated with the premise—glass cabinets of preserved sounds, thunder rooms, forgotten lullabies all read as lived rules rather than window dressing. The amber functions as micro-setting as well as object, constraining her tactics and charging the final image once cleared of the wasp. Sensory atmosphere (smell of moth wings and rust, machine hum like peace) stays aligned with mood and action. The only thing holding this just under the very top is that the lab itself rarely constrains concrete physical choices beyond providing the machine.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    The whispering grotto, mist, limestone walls, and acoustics are vivid and tightly integrated with the premise: sound and resonance become literal vehicles for memory and meaning. The tile fragment, the pool, and the walls all matter to how Moth works, not just what she sees. The atmosphere of “lilac unease” evolving toward something sacred is sustained and well-modulated. Setting and object-as-setting clearly charge the final image, though they could constrain tactical choices even more to reach the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ancient plaza, shattered sky, and ruined minaret are sharply realized, and details are filtered through Layla’s memory-saturated perception. Setting is not mere backdrop: the tiles literally hold time, the plaza’s history of seven renamings mirrors the theme of erasure, and the final image of the plaza “remembering itself whole” charges the environment with agency. This integration of landscape, history, and object-as-setting is strong, though a few images (“sky fractured like broken glass”) lean familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting work is excellent: the dark theater, the hedge maze, and especially the mystic orchard are vivid, sensorial, and tightly tied to Margaux’s perceptions and actions. The maze and garden are not just backdrop; they’re where her body lies, where the coin is found, and where the final performance literally reshapes the world’s time-texture. The orchard and maze clearly charge the final image—the enchanted hedge, ghostly music, and perpetual performances—and constrain who can witness her. A slight cap: spatial specifics of the theater interior matter less once we move outside, so the early theater detail, while atmospheric, is somewhat more ornamental than operative.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    The light painting studio, camera rig, residual electricity, and the geode are all vividly rendered and tightly integrated into the concept of mapping thought paths. The environment isn’t postcard description; it actively supplies the technique (long exposures, luminous trails) that shapes the solution. The recurring light/stone imagery charges the final image and reinforces the story’s mental-architecture motif.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    The coastal cave network is vivid and texturally specific—tides, limestone, serpentine channels, emotional temperatures, and the ocean’s “ancient, patient song” all create a strong atmosphere. Setting is not mere backdrop: the rock holds embedded emotions, the sea’s rhythms structure her work, and the fossil-in-stone plus wall contact at the climax charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    The amber warehouse, honey-colored light, shelves of cracked teacups and buttons, and the cliffs above create a vivid, coherent environment that strongly shapes the premise (canyon echo jars, button archives, hourglass work). Setting is filtered through Mara’s role—she notices time, cataloging, and the physicality of loss—and the environment materially charges the final image of a “living map of human connection.” The world’s rules (captured echoes, prophetic buttons) feel internally consistent in a mythic-realism mode. A bit more embodied interaction with the space under pressure could push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the zephyr bluff, mist, and patterned snow create a tactile, atmospheric stage that also drives the stakes through melting and visibility. Environmental conditions affect options (vantage point, seasonal clock, mist lifting to reveal codes) rather than just serving as backdrop. Details feel filtered through Marcus’ eye as an ex-operative, with attention to terrain and patterns, not generic landscape. The only limitation is that, after the strong opening, later village and interior spaces are sketched more minimally, slightly reducing environmental pressure there.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fog-bound crossing, ticking rain gutters, skeletal trees, and lifting mist are vivid and tightly integrated, not decorative. The environment constrains pace and perception, mirroring the thematic “fog” around family history and then clearing at the exact moment of conceptual clarity. The final image—fog lifting, stars like punctuation—directly reweights the story’s ideas about palimpsests and narrative layers. A slight reason for not going higher is that the physical danger of the crossing remains abstract rather than materially influencing any choice.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly specific and integrated: scorched wasteland, chimney smoke, weathered hives, and the cottage’s suspended time all feel precise and lived-in. The oasis and lantern are not postcard backdrops; they shape perception, choices, and the mechanics of seeing across timelines. Details are filtered through the potter’s tactile, process-oriented gaze, keeping description purposeful (e.g., timelines “like cracks in twice-fired clay”). The recurring oasis/lantern image strongly charges the final beat where she carries the glass back into the dark.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the narrow, dusky neighborhood, the luminous harbor, and the fire escapes are all filtered through Mira’s priorities and constraints (scarce light, makeshift containers, mirror angles). Environmental details like the harbor’s moonlight directly shape tactics—the entire gardening system depends on that light and the architecture that blocks it. The recurring objects (mirrors, fire escapes, rosebush) charge the final image without feeling ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tidal library, cloud-ocean, Chronology Wing, and Acoustic Archives are vivid, coherent, and strongly filtered through Mira’s extinction-conscious lens. Setting images (the floating sanctuary, atomically reflective walls, the sundial above the clouds) are not just ornament; they mirror and charge her internal state and the final reconfiguration. The environment’s rules (books arriving with atmospheric tides, time behaving oddly) remain consistent and legible. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices, it deeply shapes thematic stakes and the closure image, which is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, and prismatic interior are vivid and purposeful, not postcard decor: steam, wet stone, and apertures shaping the light all mirror Margot’s post-storm emotional state. The temple literally houses the installation and supplies the charged final image of her letter catching prismatic light, so environment clearly charges closure. Sensory detail is visual-forward but specific and filtered through her contemplative mood; spatial relations (steps, chamber, spiral) remain coherent. The setting might constrain choice even more tightly in a longer piece, but at this length it is rich and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    The university radio station, observatory, and labs are sketched with enough specificity (transmitter hum, charts, tower, surveillance feeds) to feel concrete and functional, not just decorative. Setting is filtered through Mara’s technical and sensory biases (subsonic ache, frequency mapping), which helps atmosphere and plausibility. The environment constrains tactics—the radio tower is the vector the tricksters want, and the station is her only leverage. More tactile, lived-in details in the booth under pressure could elevate this further, but as-is it’s strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    The under-cathedral nexus, the domed chamber with starlight cracks, and the bronze disc are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Mara’s sensibility, with details like dust motes and the shaft of starlight doing emotional as well as visual work. Environment meaningfully constrains events: the converging tunnels, the vaulted acoustics, and the organ’s vibrations physically rotate the disc and make the organ’s “voice” plausible. The compass, starlight, and underground geometry recur and charge the final image of the compass pointing down. A slight reason this doesn’t climb higher is that environmental danger (beyond atmosphere and claustrophobia) stays relatively low.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.5)
    The quarry and mist are vividly and economically rendered, immediately establishing mood and thematic alignment (“wound in the earth,” “memory itself”). The environment doesn’t materially constrain action, but it does frame the work in a charged, liminal space that echoes the cold case’s dormancy and Elena’s internal “quarry of her mind.” The recurring physical ribbon as a desk object also adds a tactile micro-setting anchor. Overall, atmosphere is strong and specific without bogging the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    The experimental station and impossible weather are vividly, economically rendered (“violet clouds twist into impossible geometries,” “auroras that sang”), and the environment clearly participates in the premise (thin places, metaphysical geography after jet-stream collapse). The setting constrains choices—stranding, ice shelf, descent into cold—and charges the final image of them stepping into the “strange, singing cold.” The copper nail and weather phenomena both act as micro-setting objects that meaningfully color options and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.0)
    The mountain scenic pullout, mist, valley light, scaffolding, and plastic wrap are all concretely evoked and clearly filtered through Mara’s sensibility. The setting works as a liminal, in-between place and as a functional device (the wrap’s code, the road as a bridge-route). Environmental details like the too-crystalline light and quantum-fine resolution shift deepen atmosphere and world rules rather than feeling decorative. While the pullout doesn’t tightly constrain physical choices, it meaningfully charges the premise and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.8)
    The circus train and forest preserve are vividly particular and consistently filtered through Marco’s practical, territorial gaze (overgrown siding, curved windows, motion-sensor “birdhouses”). The setting is not decorative: the abandoned circus and foreign bills become a lived-in archive of both spectacle and crime, and the seclusion of the disused rail line is what makes Marco’s offer to hide his father plausible. Recurring objects (the train cars, the bills, the sensors) concretely charge the final image of a “safe” territory that can shelter or trap. Atmosphere (mist, dusk, overgrown tracks) supports the thematic “dusky harmony” without feeling like generic mood lighting.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory, the brass telescope, the opening dome “like an eye,” and the variable stars create a vivid, thematically aligned environment. Setting details are filtered through Mara’s professional attention and exhaustion, which sharpens atmosphere rather than feeling like a tour. The daylily and telegram act as micro-setting/objects that recur and charge the final image at the desk. The environment meaningfully charges the ending—the stars overhead are not just backdrop but the very medium of the story’s epistemology and solace.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “swirling orchard vortex” with impossible spirals, black water, and cyclone branches is vivid, specific, and consistently re-invoked through the scene. Environment shapes action—the wind and branches resist her, the cursed geometry holds the apprentice suspended, and the spiral literally slows as the curse eases. Details feel filtered through Maren’s practiced, tactical eye rather than tourist description. The setting also charges the final image (vortex slowing, seeds sinking), giving the world a felt reaction to the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.9)
    The cobalt glade, bruised-purple sky, and spiral blue grass create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels particular to this world and mood. Environmental response—the grass tightening into new geometries as their consciousness merges—nicely charges the closing image and ties setting to thematic change. Objects-as-setting (topiary clipping, mirror shard) are tactically used rather than merely described. The world’s broader rules stay tantalizingly hinted rather than fully felt as constraint, which slightly limits how much the setting pressures choice.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid and particular—apple trees in ribcages, roots coiling around skulls—and the setting’s bone-threaded growth tightly mirrors the theme that life and rot are inseparable. Details are consistently filtered through the Oracle’s perspective, and the final image of the burned card on the martyr’s palm is charged by everything established about this place. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, it profoundly charges the emotional and thematic frame of every choice.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    The quarry office trailer, idle machinery, and limestone dust create a strong, lived-in atmosphere that mirrors Marcus’s stalled life without feeling over-signaled. The recurring grille cloth scrap functions as a micro-setting object that meaningfully charges the final image and frames his internal state. Environmental details (drafts, cold aluminum box, empty quarry) are well-selected and filtered through his perspective. The setting rarely constrains physical options, so its role is more thematic than tactical, but it remains specific and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    The magnetic arbor three thousand meters up, rust-brown railings, charged air, and luminous vines create a vivid, specific environment that’s tightly thematized as a liminal space “in touching distance of both earth and sky.” Setting details are filtered through Emilia’s scientific/scholarly lens, integrating atmosphere with her mindset. The arbor’s suspended nature and humming magnetic fields also charge the final image and echo the theme of transition. It could constrain action more concretely, but as a symbolic and atmospheric frame it’s powerful and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and original: tidal atrium, glass ceiling, lunar gears, water channels carrying “memory,” and geothermal smelting are all sensorially specific and filtered through Maris’s practiced familiarity. These details are integrated into action (catwalk navigation, tide-synced shelves, forge work) rather than standing as static description, and the moon/tide mechanism charges both the shelves and the mobile at the end. The environment subtly constrains movement and behavior (careful crossing of catwalks, rotational revelation of books), though it doesn’t quite force a hard choice. It very nearly reaches the highest band; what holds it back is that the physical constraints don’t sharply alter anyone’s tactics in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    The crystal caves are vividly and economically realized, with light, silence, and crystal facets all woven tightly into Marcus’s perception. The environment doesn’t just decorate; it actively charges the core images (pearl, shrine, artifacts) and culminates in the final radiance spreading across every surface. Sensory specificity is selective and purposeful, filtered through his professional familiarity and new awe. It stops just shy of transcendent because the environment constrains mood more than actual choices, but it’s still a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: ivy, rust, shattered glass, the river, and the bathroom tiles all mirror and pressure Maya’s internal state. Environmental elements aren’t just backdrop; the river physically tests her as she wades, the ivy’s progress is tracked like data, and the station’s decay/remaking parallels her own. The accordion and bathroom function as micro-settings that charge the final images (accordion in light, last graffiti line). Every key object and space is filtered through her hydrologist lens, keeping the atmosphere tight and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    The library and its “glowing mist,” shifting shelves, and propagation delays are vividly tactile and integral to action, not just backdrop; she literally uses the environment’s rules to navigate. Sensory choices (“air tasted of cardamom and forgotten names”) are particular and filtered through her questing mindset, matching tone and theme. The setting’s behavior evolves with her progress (delays accelerating, mist parting), and the watch functions as a tool in a rule-bound space. The environment substantively charges the final image of new pathways opening and the library no longer being lost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    The velvet observatory, plants, and crystalline violin are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elena’s sensibility, avoiding generic fantasy décor. Environment and objects genuinely constrain options: summer heat and coming dawn threaten the ice violin, while mountain caves and imperial vaults define what’s possible. Recurring elements (mulberry, ferns, pothos, coffee cup, violin) all return at the end charged with added thematic weight. Description is dense but purposeful, rarely feeling like mere ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    The skyborne ice grotto under the aurora is vividly imagined and sensorially alive, with details (thermals, steam vents, hovering temperature threshold) that feel specific and purposeful. Setting is tightly integrated with the premise of halting decay and bathing the dead in auroral light, and the environment directly charges the final image (emerald chip blazing, mirrors pooling green-gold light). The aurora’s responsiveness to grief/ the dead subtly functions as both world-rule and emotional barometer. The space feels not just pretty but functional and sacred, shaping what Lyra can do and how she does it.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    The umbral grotto above the clouds, the ancient cedar, and the bay with its fishermen are vividly drawn and consistently filtered through Keiko’s sensibility. Setting is not postcard-only: the impossible height of the cedar and floating grotto explain how this refuge exists and how Keiko accesses it. The hairpin and clouds recur to charge the final descent and the “endless, contented cycle” image. A slightly stronger sense of physical risk or constraint from the environment could push this to the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse, gallery deck, wind, and chimes are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Mara’s crisis. The environment meaningfully shapes the story: wind enables the chimes’ “method,” dawn light enables the shard’s refraction, and the beam shutting off underscores her internal shift. The hollow mirror shard functions as a micro-setting object that constrains perception and charges the closing image when she clips it to the railing. Details stay purposeful and avoid touristic excess.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid, original, and integrated: the floating rock, magnetic grotto, and pond create a coherent, tactile environment. Environmental specifics (magnetic forces, iron-rich stones, blue-black minerals under starlight) deepen atmosphere while also justifying the heightened trance state. The world’s rules are consistent and introduced through observation and teaching, not bare info-dump. The setting doesn't severely constrain choices, but it clearly charges the lesson and the ending descent.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    The canyon of echoes and bone towers is vivid, specific, and strongly tied to the magic system—sound-as-sediment, towers as harmonic matrices, ravens as pattern-bearers. Environmental features do real work: they’re not just backdrop but the literal infrastructure of navigation and the locus of the crisis. The final image of Kael turning toward the third tower in this canyon where "sound became stone and stone became memory" is charged by all the prior setting work. A slight cap comes from the fact that the environment doesn’t physically constrain choices in-scene; it primarily frames conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    The icebound spire, thin air, and “brilliant dimness” are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Maren’s attention. Environment and object-as-setting matter: the climb vs teleportation, the cold and numbness, and the luminant walls pulsing with her breath all shape how the ritual unfolds and charge the final image. The recurring keystone and interior light concretely bind setting to theme. It stops just short of 9-band because setting constrains mood more than tactics, but it’s very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    The harbor, pier, and especially the sunken-library ship are rendered with vivid, purposeful specificity that feels both tactile and uncanny (“books transformed into organic sculptures,” barnacled hull as cathedral). Setting consistently shapes what she can do: the low tide window, the need for secrecy during the lantern ceremony, the unstable wreck creating air pockets and concealment. Details are filtered through her lamplighter/maritime sensibility, avoiding tourist inventory while strongly charging the final image of lanterns as notes on a “dark score.” This environment clearly constrains action and richly charges closure, just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    The amber-glowing observatory, crystalline dome, and collapsing cosmos are vividly drawn and recur throughout, anchoring the abstraction in concrete images. The bowl of ancient coins and the headset as tools in that space make the environment feel functional, not just decorative. While the observatory doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it frames them as a last, high perch over a dying universe and charges the final white-light image. World rules around contraction and static remain consistent and are delivered efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory, telescope, brass tubes, and dusk light through a cracked lens create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that mirrors and amplifies Mira’s emotional state. The atlas page and its sea monsters serve as a micro-setting object that clearly charges the final image. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain her options, but it consistently frames her as custodian of both stars and souls, which supports theme and mood. Detail selection is purposeful and free of generic filler.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sapphire viaduct, dripping arch, and dawn light are vivid, and the environment is not mere backdrop: the physical dripping from the arch both signals and literally supplies the mechanism of restoration. The setting’s specific properties (stone that leaks ocean “back,” refracted light at dawn, central span where the bell hangs) meaningfully charge the final image. Details are selective and filtered through Emris’s observant, numerate perspective, avoiding tourist-catalog description. This is very strong work, just short of the absolute top tier because the broader world beyond the viaduct, while sketched, feels slightly thinner.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    The reservoir, ridgeway, algae-slick church steps, and emerging buildings are vivid and specific, and they’re filtered through Marcus’s history (schoolhouse, bridge, pharmacy) in a way that feels lived, not touristic. The drought and partial resurfacing create a charged, liminal atmosphere that supports the themes of memory and resurrection. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, but the temporary low water level and impending rains act as a soft clock on meaning-making. The twilight/ridgeway/reservoir complex frames the piece strongly, even if the final image leans more conceptual than concretely environmental.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, economical, and character-filtered: the waterfall’s “impossible geometries,” air that “tasted of first mornings,” and trees bearing all seasons at once all feel specific rather than generic. Crucially, the orchard isn’t just decorative; its time-folding property is the only plausible source of the frozen dew crystal and the singing trees charge the climactic transformation. The environment continues to evolve with the action (cascade, orchard hum, trees singing, starlings arriving), mirroring the thematic union of opposites. This depth and integration make the world feel both mythic and functionally necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    The nocturnal arbor above the clouds is vivid and specific, with the bioluminescent canopies and “latticed ceiling between earth and stars” giving a distinctive atmosphere. Details are filtered through Vera’s professional gaze (notation, light pathways) rather than as neutral tourism, which keeps the world grounded. The parachute buckle functions as a micro-setting object constraining her responses, especially at the start and near the end. The environment is more atmospheric than constraining in terms of tactical choice, which is why this doesn’t quite reach the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    The floating rock dojo, quantum foam, and glass-jar brain are vivid and specific, and they consistently mirror and charge the philosophical stakes. The dojo’s rotation and the view of history rewriting itself function as more than décor, reinforcing the theme of shifting causality and fragmented wholeness. However, the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics or options; it’s more atmospheric than operative. Still, the integration of setting and mood is high-level and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cottage, brook, moonlight, and post-storm air create a tangible nocturnal atmosphere that aligns well with the story’s quiet, reflective tension. Details like the worn deck and brook’s murmur are economical and grounded in Margot’s perspective. The environment slightly constrains choice by making the brook an immediate, plausible disposal method, but it mostly serves mood rather than pressure. Still, the final image of moonlight on the water gives the setting a gentle, resonant role in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tunnel/echo chamber is vividly realized and integral: it doubles sound, makes the leaf blower ritual possible, and holds their voices in a way that thematically mirrors memory. Details like dust as “frozen stars” and the ancient spider web feel lived-in rather than decorative and are filtered through Martin’s grief. The environment constrains choice—they must go belowground to work on what “can’t be spoken upstairs.” This is excellent micro-setting work, just shy of transcendent because the physicality could be pushed one notch further under peak emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    The frozen garden, mist, and statues are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Maris’s perception, creating a strong, specific atmosphere. The dream-environment actively shapes the logic of the piece (doorways inside her, the realm wanting to absorb her, freedom from the collar only in sleep). The pendant-as-light-source literally marks “boundaries of light,” and the garden’s shattering and redistribution into “a thousand dreams” charges the final shift. Economy is good: details recur and evolve rather than piling up decoratively.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.3)
    The workshop and ember nexus are vivid and specific, with tactile and sensory details (“rust-colored shadows,” geothermal convergence, taste of disappointment) filtered through Cassia’s perspective. The nexus and twilight atmosphere charge the final image as the crozier transforms and the light pulses, aligning environment with thematic rebirth. That said, the setting rarely constrains tactics in concrete ways; it functions more as symbolic and tonal scaffold than as a hard practical limiter. World rules around alchemy and sacred objects are consistent enough for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and particular—“city hung between two cliffs,” “abandoned radio towers,” “gorge…a throat of darkness”—and tightly married to mood and theme. Details are filtered through her professional eye and recharged at the end when the “graveyard” becomes a “chrysalis,” and the gorge shifts from emptiness to potential. The environment does not heavily constrain physical choices beyond providing the hub and perigee vantage, so it’s more atmospheric than tactical. Still, the world feels coherent, textured, and essential to the piece’s identity.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    The spectral grotto, sideways clocks, and harbor-under-starlight are vivid and specific, and the environment actively shapes tactics: only in the grotto can Mateo see the patterns and locate the confluence. The ferry as a “permanent fixture in both timelines” and the hourglass as a tool create a micro-setting logic that feels coherent. Sensory detail is more conceptual/visual than fully embodied (little sound, temperature, or bodily sensation under pressure), but what’s present is economical and purposeful. The recurring object-as-setting (hourglass) also charges the final image and ties space, time, and stakes together.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    The optical illusion gallery and the Connection Room are vivid, specific, and tightly integrated with the story’s logic and theme. Details like corridors that “stretched infinitely yet ended after ten paces” and the hooks in the walls feel filtered through Marina’s professional sensibility and shape what she can do. The environment directly enables the central act of weaving and charges the final geometric pattern around her. A touch more sensory variety beyond the visual could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    The benthic city, pressure locks, and trench are vividly realized with selective, purposeful detail (luminescent architecture, geological body of the alien, impossible starlight). The environment is not just backdrop: deep-ocean pressure, bioluminescence, and the trench’s “impossible light” are inseparable from the premise of edge geometry. The chain link as a recurring object and the trench vista both charge the final image. A bit more tactile interaction with environment under constraint (e.g., physical limitations at depth) could nudge this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mist-clad atrium, glass ceiling, “bruised hour” and skeletal ferns create a vivid, tonally aligned environment that feels specific rather than generic. Details like mist rolling from the ventilation system and spiderweb shadows are filtered through Mira’s attention and reinforce the liminal sound/silence theme. The hearing aid and photo function as charged micro-setting objects that shape how she works and what she can infer. The atrium doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, but it does meaningfully charge the final image (two women under watchful ferns with the device falling silent), so the setting is doing real narrative work.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    The undersea facility and tidal environment are vivid and specific—“exhaled saltwater through its cracked seams,” narrow corridors, murky observation window, cable junction chamber. The setting meaningfully constrains action: time, pressure, flooding, and isolation shape what Mara can and can’t do. Environmental motifs (tide, pressure, “crashing hush”) reappear at the end, charging the final image of the sea “preparing for the next transition.” A slightly wider range of sensory modalities beyond visual and pressure could deepen texture further.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory under snow, the warm interior with old paper, the opalescent dome, and the black ink on the white desk create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that mirrors Mira’s interior quieting. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics beyond housing the servers, but micro-setting elements—the porcelain shard, the ink, the telescope—are meaningfully integrated into action and theme. Weather and dawn light modulate tone and visually charge the ending image. Detail selection feels economical and POV-filtered rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is strikingly specific and central: towers of bone, endless echoes, a canyon sky written with birds—all of it is not just decorative but functional to the story’s mechanics. Texture, echo, and light literally enable her project; the environment constrains her method (she must touch bone, rely on echo, and read the birds) and charges the ending image of a permanently singing canyon. World rules around echoes and texture are consistent and learned via action rather than exposition dumps. At this standard, a single minor limitation is that almost every detail is at the same lush intensity, with little modulation of sensory focus as stakes rise.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    The underground garden is vivid and integrated: bioluminescent mushrooms, ghost orchids, frozen earth above—details are purposeful and filtered through her scientific eye. Setting is not postcards; it actively charges the ending, contrasting winter’s kill with impossible subterranean blooming and the “something impossible” beginning to bloom. The arrowhead and the phone function as quasi-micro-settings/objects that structure beats and the final image. A slight limitation is that the environment doesn’t quite constrain tactical options—its role is symbolic and atmospheric more than logistical.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and particular—sky-bridge above a clockwork city, enchanted orchard with living statues, golden tears sinking into roots—anchored early and consistently. Environmental details mirror the theme (mechanical towers vs. fragile orchard, locust shell, golden apple) and evolve with the plot (orchard dying, then blooming; statues cracking, then crumbling). While the statues and orchard conceptually constrain the world, we don’t quite see the environment forcing difficult tactical choices in-scene beyond her having slipped past them earlier. Still, the final images (“towers that suddenly seemed less permanent”) are strongly charged by place and object.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cobalt arcade, with its darkened games and skeletal carousel, is vivid, tonally consistent, and tightly bound to the tactics (its “blank space” status enables the null-field drop). The thunderstorm bottle and null-field device function as micro-setting tools that shape choices and charge the final image. Details are selective and purposeful, avoiding tourist-list description while still giving the place an eerie, lived-in abandonment. A hairline limitation is that non-visual senses are underused given the potential (sounds, temperature, smells) for even more embodied atmosphere under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and particular—the rusting circus train in a hidden oasis, wind bells chiming, desert mist—filtered through the carpenter’s tactile awareness. Environmental features aren’t just backdrop; the abandoned train supplies materials, the wind drives both bells and sculpture, and the grove/water make the place feel shrine-like. The recurrent objects (bells, brass, carousel machinery) charge the final image of spinning light and quiet music. It’s atmospheric and purposeful without feeling like a museum tour.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Scientific Poetry Library is richly specific (thermodynamics sonnets, meteorological haiku, non-Euclidean floor plan) and always filtered through Cordelia’s sensibility. Setting is not mere backdrop: the building’s strange architecture and analog-laden shelves are the very medium of her experiment and the reason hyperbolic geometry matters. The recurring scarf-as-object is tightly bound to the environment, both as tactile detail and as a “measuring line” through curved space, and it charges the final image. Tone and atmosphere—quiet, slightly uncanny, intellectually lush—are fully integrated with place.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse, fog, dawn light, sea stacks, and hidden cave are vivid and specific, and all are strongly filtered through Mara’s sensibility. Environment is not decorative: the archipelago’s geometry, tide, and sun angles literally constrain discovery and access to the Dream Walker space, and light-as-setting directly charges the final image. Details like the library’s “strange hours” and the cave that appears only at a specific dawn angle integrate tone and world logic. A touch more tactile, non-visual grounding under peak beats could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the “forgotten crossroads,” impossible geometry, and star-reflecting cobblestones are not just pretty but structurally tied to how Mara gains access. The subterranean “room made of doors” nicely concretizes the city’s metaphysics and directly stages the climax. Details are selective and filtered through mood, supporting a consistent, gently uncanny atmosphere. Environment constrains options (the coordinates, the space between cobblestones) and clearly charges the final image of a living city with many unopened doors.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integral: the shattered greenhouse “ribs,” sunken orchard, luminescent spores, and surrounding shipwreck constellation all shape action and meaning. The environment constrains choices (diving, working underwater, fungal networks in roots) and charges the final image of shipwrecks as completed guardians. Details are filtered through Vera’s folklorist lens, so world-building never feels like a catalog. The shipwreck ring plus fairy ring as literal and conceptual anchors meet the high-band gate of environment charging the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    The forgotten library, broken window, dust, and ghost-sound of playground swings create a strong, coherent atmosphere that mirrors the characters’ exiled status. Details like the copper kettle, porcelain plate, and cracked windows are selective and purposeful rather than touristic. The setting doesn’t significantly constrain choices, but it clearly charges the final image of two exiles reflected in the shard. World rules and spatial layout remain consistent and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: cliff-face orchards drinking waterfall mist, a verdant parapet, and the waterfall’s roar modulating with the magic all feel lived-in and atmospheric. Details are filtered through Mara’s work and ritual (parapet as workspace, mist beading on her hair, dawn as threshold), not as postcard catalog. The environment meaningfully charges the premise—this is where worlds thin, where impossibility already exists—and the final act of planting on that parapet reuses the space with new weight. It doesn’t quite *force* difficult tactical choices, but it decisively shapes the story’s texture and closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prism sanctuary, starlight, and crystalline stone are vivid, distinctive, and integrated into the action rather than feeling like backdrop ornament. The setting participates in the mechanics of the story—the prisms refract names into visible light and the sanctuary becomes the new container for the once-suffocating silence. Spatial and atmospheric anchoring are clear from the opening lines and remain consistent. The environment doesn’t tightly constrain tactics, but it strongly charges the final image and thematic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.3)
    The vault, chapel, fresco, and rain are vividly realized and tightly thematic: “rain-scoured walls,” echoes, and moisture damage all support the idea of a living, eroding archive. Setting is filtered through Maren’s professional eye, which keeps details purposeful (angles, wall quadrants, map correspondences). Environment meaningfully shapes tactics—the need for silent footage, controlled lighting, careful documentation, and the urgency of decay. The final shift to a rain-stopped morning with open doors gives the space a charged, reconfigured presence.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sunken library is vividly and economically realized (mahogany shelves “swaying with the current,” fused radio room, fish circling the skylight), and always filtered through Elena’s professional eye. The environment is not just backdrop: as a library and a wreck, it thematically mirrors archives, transmissions, and drowned histories, and the snow globe as micro-setting charges the final image. Physical constraints of being underwater are sketched rather than dramatized tactically, but the setting’s symbolic and atmospheric integration is excellent. A bit more tactile interaction with the hazardous, alien environment could have tied it more directly to choices.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “misty courtyard above the clouds” and floating cities are vividly evoked, with details like fog, ancient stone, and quantum-threaded networks creating a memorable atmosphere. The environment meaningfully supports tone and concept (her liminal workspace between physical and digital, earth and sky) even if it rarely constrains choices. The flower press, murals, and weather all integrate smoothly into the setting. It falls just short of the very top tier because the setting enhances but does not truly pressure the action.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.7)
    The icebound spire, brass cage, and crystalline walls create a vivid, tonally apt environment, and the frozen height above the clouds nicely echoes the emotional numbness of the staff. Setting details are selective and purposeful rather than touristic, and the fortress as a place where “people existed rather than lived” underwrites the thematic work. However, the environment mostly mirrors emotion rather than actively constraining choices; Maren’s decision would largely play the same in a less distinctive setting. Still, the imagery is strong and integrated into her perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Antarctic sky gondola, altitude, polar light, and specific cloud types are vividly rendered with strong professional filtering and consistent atmospheric mood. The environment feels lived-in through instruments and procedures and is thematically fused to the idea of atmospheric memory. While the setting doesn’t materially alter tactics beyond enabling solitude and observation, it does charge the images and final realization quite effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tree-trunk library, hollowed heart-chambers, and open crown to the sky are vividly realized and strongly filtered through the artist’s tactile and visual bias. Setting and objects (oak, coin, sky) carry atmospheric and thematic weight, especially in the final image of star-reflections and the condemned sanctuary. The environment conceptually constrains choices (one last night, a secret library about to be erased) even if it rarely affects micro-tactics in a concrete way. Overall, the place feels memorable, integrated, and essential to the story’s mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.8)
    The airship, autumn sky, Karst Plains, and starling murmuration are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through a cartographer’s sensibility. Setting shapes the premise—an airborne research vessel used as a plotting instrument—and charges both the luminance and the final starling image. The navigation chamber, cargo hold dust, and phrasebook create a tactile, lived-in environment rather than a postcard. Environment does influence what’s possible (projecting constellations onto terrain) even if it doesn’t overtly constrain moment-to-moment tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    The frozen library above the clouds, with ice-hewn shelves and driftwood-like decay, is vivid and specific, and the Hall of Mirrors is an evocative spatial escalation that grounds the climax. Environmental elements integrate with action: descending spiral stairs of ice, navigating the mirror corridor, and locating the mechanism in an impossible in-between space. The setting also charges the final image, where oceans gleam like gear teeth, reweighing earlier mechanical and celestial details. The environment shapes access and tone more than moment-to-moment tactics, but it feels deeply lived-in and thematically tuned.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    The orchard planet, floating rock arches, and abandoned sidewalks are vivid and quickly situate the reader in a distinct SF setting without bogging the piece down. Details like the silver leaves, blight, and communal greenhouse integrate setting with the core problem and theme of fragile sustenance. The arches and nebula provide a strong atmospheric frame and charge several images, especially at the end, though they rarely constrain specific choices. Overall the world feels lived-in and coherent, but the environment is more mood than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lighthouse and ocean are vivid and thematically integrated: “dusk bled orange,” “waves cresting in fractal repetitions,” and salt-stained windows mirror her pattern-work and duty. The lamp room with its brass-and-crystal mechanism feels specific and lived-in, and the puppet head functions as a recurring micro-setting/object that charges the final image. The lighthouse as a hidden site at the world’s edge subtly constrains action—this work must be done in isolation, at this particular threshold of land/sea and day/night. It stops just short of 9-band because the environment enhances tone and theme more than it actively shapes a concrete tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cliffside labyrinth orchard, mechanical birds, and lethal frost are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action and choice. Environmental specifics (tree angles, shadows, roots forming arrows) directly shape navigation tactics and underpin the blueprint conceit. The final image of the nut held up to the stars brings setting and object together in a charged way. A bit more sensory variety under peak pressure could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    The braided ravine, its five channels, and the foam patterns are not just backdrop but active conceptual machinery that shapes Maya’s insight and the ash-scattering tactic. Environmental details (foam behavior, collision of currents, caught chrysalis) are selective, vivid, and thematically aligned. The setting decisively charges the final image of ashes taking different routes toward the same ocean. A touch more non-visual sensory detail (sound, cold, smell) under peak emotion could deepen atmosphere further.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glass orchard library, bottled moonlight, and cloud-sea are vividly particular and consistently filtered through Vera’s professional lens. Setting is not postcard-only: the floating, liminal architecture and glass fruit explicitly mirror and charge the themes of suspension and refracted possibility, and the final “shift in cloud currents” clearly reconfigures the closing image. World rules (moonlight as memory of where light had been, quantifying absence) feel internally consistent at this length. The environment meaningfully shapes the tone and closure, lifting this category into a high band.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and functionally integrated: fortress walls “weeping” post-rain, impossible inland tidal pools, and the coral ice pavilion all feel particular and physically grounded within the story’s own logic. Environmental features actively shape the story—the rain reveals the pools, the canyon and pools provide the path down, and the fortress’s weeping ceasing is the clearest external sign of success. Details are tightly filtered through Maron’s sensory and professional bias (tastes, textures, chemistry), avoiding tourist-list description. The setting could constrain tactical options even more directly under pressure, but at this length it already does strong work.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.8)
    The astronomical tower, glass dome, meteor-iron weight, and singing grain elevators create a vivid, memorable world, and setting details are tightly tied to character and action. The environment and objects (especially the clock and weight) actively constrain and enable choices and charge the final image. Sensory specifics—pitches of different grains, rhythmic footsteps, starlight—serve atmosphere without spilling into static description. The only limit to perfection is that weather/season and larger valley geography stay somewhat impressionistic rather than fully inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    The moonlit canyon, sandstone walls, and specific history (indigenous carvings, Air Force periscope tests) are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the premise of stored/entangled memories. The canyon and alcove aren’t mere backdrop; their physical geometry (angle of moonlight, deepest recess) and layered history directly shape Elena’s actions and the final image. The recurring mirror, moonlight, and stone form a coherent atmospheric lattice that charges the ending. A bit more tactile, non-visual sensory texture under peak pressure could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    The serpentine grotto, luminous mist, and gravity inversion create a vivid, atmospheric environment with strong visual and conceptual specificity. Details like dust rising, mist “almost solid,” and the three-dimensional spiral stone all feel purposeful and on-theme. The setting does shape how she moves (clutching the wall, descending into tighter coils) but rarely constrains her options in a way that sharpens stakes. Atmosphere is excellent; functional constraint is only moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    The siskin alder grove, telegraph ruins, and hollow alder workshop are richly specific and consistently filtered through Maren’s sensibility (“fossilized spider silk,” “frozen symphonies”). Setting is not mere backdrop: the telegraph infrastructure and lightning-struck sculpture materially enable her method, and the returning birds charge the final image. Atmosphere and world rules are coherent and support the theme without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    The magnetic nexus, iron-rich cliffs, twilight, and humming earth create a vivid, specific atmosphere that’s strongly filtered through Kavir’s perceptions. Setting isn’t just postcard description: the nexus is explicitly what amplifies psychic echoes and makes his method possible, and the cliffs’ hum charges the final image. The micro-setting of the worry stone and physical ground ties environment to embodiment. A slight extension of how the broader world physically manifests the covenant’s power would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    The workshop with its broken roof, exposed stars, and incoming fireworks is vivid and consistently filtered through Marlow’s attention. The environment meaningfully charges the final image: external theatrical explosions versus the “fertile quiet” inside, with the roof-gap literally framing the sky as she sits in earned stillness. The radio apparatus and diary function as micro-setting objects that shape what she can do. A slight reason this isn’t higher is that the fireworks/time-pressure never quite constrains her options, serving more as symbolic counterpoint than a live clock.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    The treetop village, swaying workshop, suspended pot, and dense botanical air are vivid and efficiently sketched, with olfactory detail well-integrated into the environment. The setting is filtered through an herbalist’s nose and craft, which sharpens specificity. The village’s perpetual motion nicely mirrors the thematic concern with serenity within motion, giving the atmosphere more than postcard value. Still, the physical environment rarely constrains tactics beyond general sway and smell management; it could push choices harder to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    The orchard planet, floating rock arches, and inverted gravity are vivid, coherently rendered, and filtered through a pilot’s eye in a way that feels lived-in rather than touristic. Crucially, the environment constrains tactics—she navigates by irrigation flows through arches, Inversion changes how water and fruit move, and the final image depends on the world’s physical logic. The arches and water channels are not mere backdrop; they’re structural to plot and discovery. This deep integration of setting with action and theme (resilience through paradox) earns a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    The port’s “towering labyrinth” of containers, fog, and strange wind circuits is vividly evoked and never feels generic. Crucially, the setting isn’t just backdrop: the container configuration literally creates the disaster and dictates investigative tactics, then is physically dismantled at the end. Weather and airflow function as active constraints that embody the theme of invisible architectures. A slight tilt toward abstraction in a few passages (“atmospheric engine”) keeps this just short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ice cavern and aurora are vividly rendered with selective, purpose-driven detail—organ-pipe columns, impossible refractions, and the “throat of stars” metaphor build a strong atmosphere. Setting is filtered through Mira’s synesthesia, so world-building and character perception reinforce each other. The environment is not just decorative: “where ice remembers song” and the physical columns she strikes are integral to the story’s mechanism and final proof. While the cold and physical danger don’t drastically alter tactics, the cavern’s unique properties clearly charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    The Thunder-Echo Range, the canyon hush, and driftwood remnants of vanished floods create a vivid, specific environment that shapes the ritual’s terms (“place where thunder remembers itself”). The setting’s rules (junction of worlds, thunder’s memory) are learned through action, not exposition dumps, and the environment clearly charges the final image. Sensory detail leans visual and conceptual but is selectively used and filtered through Maren’s trained, monastic perspective. The range feels integral to the story’s logic rather than a generic mountain backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is a major strength: the topaz workshop, bioluminescent walls, mechanical press, and contracting universe with vanishing stars all feel precise, original, and sensorially rich. These environmental elements mirror and charge the emotional and conceptual stakes, especially the stars winking out as she refines her equations. While the setting doesn’t strictly constrain tactical choices, it permeates every action and heavily charges the final image. World rules (halo fragments, Seraph Collapse, empathy work) are integrated smoothly without expository drag.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway, dragonfly-wing materials, and carved story seeds create a vivid, specific atmosphere that feels organically magical rather than generic. Details are filtered through Kael’s role and history (e.g., his naming of “geometric proofs of beauty” via Master Venn), which grounds the world in his experience. The setting enhances tone and theme but only lightly constrains choice; the ridge itself doesn’t force different tactics beyond the journey frame. Nonetheless, the recurring objects-as-micro-setting (pendant, seed, flute) substantially charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    The quartz arbor, mist, and crystalline branches provide a distinctive atmospheric frame that aligns with the emotional-objects premise. The car, windshield, and frost function as a micro-setting where the key discovery is literally inscribed, and the final image of the arbor “singing” ties setting back into theme. Details are selective and sensory without bloating, and the professional lens (a scientist attuned to patterns) shapes what’s noticed. The environment charges the final image more than it constrains choices, but it remains memorably specific.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    The forgotten orchard, bamboo, mist, loom, and jigsaw frame create a vivid, coherent micro-world that strongly supports the liminal, mythic mood. Setting details are filtered through Mariko’s craft-focused attention and recur at the end to charge the threshold crossing. The environment is not mere backdrop—it is the thin place and workspace that makes her action possible. A bit more tactile interaction with the orchard itself under peak pressure might push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    The orchard planet, floating arches, and honeycombed mine shafts are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Mira’s working perspective. World rules (crystallized sap, dying roots, sap–aquifer linkage) feel coherent and are learned through action rather than dumped. Setting meaningfully constrains tactics: the withering orchards and abandoned mines dictate her conduit solution, and the arches shift from ominous shading to framing hope in the final image. The integration of forge, mines, and surface orchards gives the piece a strong, atmospheric spine.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    The abandoned spaceport bay is vividly, economically rendered, with strong sensory specificity tied to Kael’s unique way of perceiving. The shard and its interaction with the environment (emergency lighting, air composition, temperature gradients) anchor the speculative texture rather than feeling pasted on. The setting charges the final image—sitting alone in the quiet bay, mapping “the space between worlds”—even if it doesn’t tightly constrain physical tactics. The world’s broader rules are implied with consistency and without clunky exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is vivid, specific, and integrated with theme: “bone against the sky,” Fresnel lens as “frozen chrysanthemum,” and the cairns as coded messages all feel tactile and lived-in. The haunted lantern room and rough sea directly shape perception and choices, and the sea glass functions as a micro-setting object that constrains and charges the final image. Weather, light, and architecture evolve with the action rather than sitting as backdrop. A hairline restraint from 9+ is that the physical constraints of the environment (e.g., what she can or cannot do about the failed lamp) don’t significantly narrow options beyond mood and symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Emerald Lighthouse, green glass, obsidian sea, and storm-charged sky are vivid and omnipresent, and they actively shape what Kael can do (the climb, the lens, the beam, the green dawn). World rules around light, glass, and storm behavior are consistent and learned through action. The lighthouse and its optics also charge the final image of a green-tinted dawn and “emerald stars,” meeting the object-as-setting constraint. A bit more non-visual sensory grounding under peak pressure could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating tea house, chains that “sang in the wind,” rice-paper walls, and the morpho-wing workshop create a rich, coherent atmosphere that feels both tactile and otherworldly. Setting is tightly filtered through Mira’s perception, with the environment mirroring the themes of suspension, light, and fragility. While the tea house doesn’t heavily constrain physical tactics, its precarious, elevated nature and mist-filled valley charge the final decision to stay with a sense of chosen liminality and sanctuary. World rules are consistent and learned through action and image rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    The labyrinth, stormlit tower, moonlight, and dream-crusted trees are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Mara’s work-focused perspective. Environmental elements constrain and enable action—the moonlight shaft reveals the dream-map and later heals extracted sorrow, and the physical maze shapes movement and process. Details are selective rather than touristic, giving a strong sense of place without bloat. The final image of dawn, quiet maze, and dream-laced fountain feels spatially and atmospherically grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse, mica window, and ancient oak are vividly rendered and integrated into action, not just backdrop. World rules (mirror world, Great Reversal, fruits holding dawn, oak existing in both worlds) stay consistent and matter directly to what Elora can do. Environmental elements meaningfully charge the final image—the oak as conduit, the window blazing with faces, the night’s quality changing—so setting is inseparable from closure. A slight bias toward visual imagery over other senses keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    The laundromat, coffee shop, and especially the Library are vividly and economically evoked (“shelves that curved into themselves…casting no shadows”; “enlarged tranquility”). Setting and tone are well fused, and the Library’s paradoxical architecture mirrors the story’s thematic concerns. However, the environment rarely constrains concrete choices—it frames and deepens rather than forcing tactics—so the setting feels more like an elegant container than an active pressure on the scene. Still, the hidden-in-plain-sight library is integral enough that the story would lose much of its charge without it.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the overgrown palace courtyard, salvaged-door tea house, and guerrilla gardens all mirror and materialize the theme of transformation. Details like shoulder-high wisteria, jasmine in November, and goldfinches after migration do mood work while subtly cueing the world’s strangeness. The environment governs access (only “noticers” can find the tea house) and charges the final image of Mira re-entering the city with seeds. It could constrain immediate tactical options a bit more, but it’s already doing strong atmospheric and thematic labor.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “frozen library floated three miles above the cloudline” and the “quartz hush” create a distinctive, sensorially rich setting that suffuses the entire piece. Environmental features constrain choices (her clothing, fingerless gloves, the risk of tears freezing, the silence she’s chosen) and charge the tone. The library’s cold, crystalline isolation mirrors the fading vows, while the slide’s warmth at the end becomes a setting-level contrast that heightens closure. World rules remain consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.3)
    The pirate market under the rotting pier is vivid and sensorial, especially in the opening (“smelled of brine and secrets”). The setting feels lived-in and thematically apt, and the presence of unseen onlookers subtly amplifies stakes. However, beyond social surveillance, the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics in the confrontation itself. The recurring physicality of the pier and water at the end nicely charges the final ascent toward morning.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is a major strength: the lavender bluff, aurora, fox-fire lichens, mycelial forest elections, and taste-weather all interlock into a coherent, sensory-rich world. Details are filtered through Mira’s perceptual quirks, which keeps them purposeful rather than touristic. The environment charges the final image (aurora as ballots, compass pointing toward the valley), though it rarely constrains concrete tactics in the scene. World rules feel consistent and discovered organically through action and perception rather than dumped.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    The Crystalline Caverns are vividly rendered with purposeful, character-filtered detail (“auroral sorrow,” “cathedral spires”), and the crystals’ light amplifying her drawings gives the environment an active role. The subterranean space is thematically apt, mirroring buried memory and suppressed creativity. The cave enables crucial plot mechanics (hidden carving; natural gallery) but rarely constrains options or creates physical stakes. Still, specificity and atmosphere are strong and consistently support tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse domes, toxic sky, dried oasis, and repurposed reservoir as Archive are vivid, selective, and thematically aligned with artificial vs organic truth. Environmental detail is efficiently tethered to stakes—rationing and euphemistic “redistribution” contextualize the city’s lies and Mira’s reactions. The old reservoir turned Listening Archive physically embodies the idea of stored, unshed candor and charges the final image of her standing “in the deep places beneath dying systems.” Setting rarely constrains tactical choice in-scene, but it does structurally and thematically frame every move.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    Whispering Bluff above the clouds, the kinetic sculpture, and the ancient ice create a vivid, atmospheric setting that feels specific to this story. Environmental details (wind, temperature shifts, clouds below) matter to how the sculpture works and why this location is chosen. The recurring object-as-setting (bells/ice) charges the final image, with the fragment “half its original size” gleaming at the heart of the sculpture. Description is purposeful and filtered through Mira’s craft-focused sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dome, desert roses, and reversed poles are vivid, economical, and constantly relevant to character and theme; the environment isn’t just backdrop but an active metaphorical and practical frame for M4-RY’s choices. Details like “crystalline petals soft as flesh” and the thermal vents are both imagistic and functional. The act of burying the photo under the most mutated bloom uses the setting to charge the final image and embody the thematic turn. World rules stay consistent and are learned through interaction rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    The courtyard at dawn is vividly evoked and feels lived in, with details like tangled bougainvillea and worn brick arches, and it returns at the end to charge the communal image. The shift to the neglected mailroom as a contrasting micro-setting neatly embodies “outside world intruding” versus sanctuary. Details are well chosen and filtered through Marissa’s sensibility, though the environment mostly mirrors theme rather than constraining tactical choices. Still, setting and recurring objects (courtyard, mailroom, locket, folder) are integrated above a merely decorative level.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    The sunken laboratory, bioluminescent algae, reinforced glass, and tidal generators are specific, atmospheric, and consistently filtered through Elara’s familiarity rather than as a tourist catalog. The environment meaningfully explains why the lab and its contents survived and why she can operate undetected, so it does shape the logic of the story. However, the setting rarely constrains an immediate choice—there’s no moment where water, pressure, or layout forces a particular tactic under stress. It’s rich and integrated, but more as enabling backdrop and thematic echo than as an active tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly imagined and tightly integrated: the docks with skewed gravity, the harbormaster’s office, and especially the salt crystal growing chambers feel tactile and strange without over-explaining. Environmental details consistently constrain and color action—Maris’s careful footing on the pier, disorienting gravity shifts in the tunnels, the cold brine she wades through. Recurring objects (lanterns, the wildflower book, salt crystals, the whale’s heart) evolve and charge the final image, where she’s sealed inside salt and memory while the lanterns burn steadily above. World rules around gravity, memory conservation, and salt crystalization are consistent and learned through her experience, not static exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cottage at the forest-brook edge, the tranquil candles, the nocturnal haven, and the brook’s whisper all feel vivid and consistent with the magic system. Setting is strongly filtered through her craft—she literally “maps silence” from the water—and the environment shapes both her method and the final image as the brook “whispers its approval.” The details are selective and purposeful rather than touristic, and the recurring brook and candles charge the final cadence. This is rich, integrated atmosphere just shy of utterly transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rooftop garden and meteor shower are vividly evoked and strongly tied to tone and theme—meteors as “punctuation marks” over a “sentence” of buildings is a memorable, earned image. The city, inscriptions, and garden all feel specific rather than generic, and details like string lights and potted herbs are efficiently used. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain choices, it does charge the final image and underscores the tension between permanence and decay. World rules stay coherent and the setting feels lived-in rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    The velvet garden, moonflowers, and seashell are sensuous and specific, and they’re all clearly filtered through Mira’s memory-obsessed perspective. Setting isn’t just backdrop; the plants literally function as an externalized mind, and the final image of the garden at twilight’s end is charged with her decision. World rules (memory fragmentation, resonance, quarantine protocols) are sketched efficiently and feel internally coherent for the length. A touch more tactile interaction under pressure (e.g., a concrete constraint from the garden itself) would push this toward the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, stalactites, and heritage rose are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Mei’s purpose and history. Setting constrains action (stalactite drips masking sound, the sanctuary as a protected liminal space) and charges the closing image (the rose blooming under aurora as a symbol of defiant, thorned mercy). Environmental details evolve with the scene—the dripping water that first marks time later blurs ink as Mei grasps the key’s meaning. This is near top-tier work; marginally more tactile engagement with the space during the confrontation could push it into the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    The canyon and serpentine nexus are vividly rendered and tightly tied to the premise: the geography is also an acoustic architecture, so “deeper” literally and figuratively means more layered sound. Details like “reed-blown melancholy” and starlight knifing into the chamber are selective and motivated by Mara’s attention, not a tourist catalog. Crucially, the environment constrains and enables action—the nexus is where echoes sleep and can be woken, and the final image of her songs braiding through the canyon’s memory is inseparable from this setting. The only reason this doesn’t push into the 9s is that the setting guides mood and revelation more than hard tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glacier shrine, the ancient ice with ship bones, and the submerged wreck create a strongly textured, coherent atmosphere that feels integral rather than decorative. The environment meaningfully shapes the premise—this is the liminal place where “boundaries thinned” and the ritual can occur. The snow globe as an object-as-setting element is charged and returns at the end with added emotional weight. A slight expansion of how the physical conditions of the ice cave constrain or endanger Maya could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the whispering parapet, harbor like hammered bronze, rain-slick stone, and fireflies all create a tactile, luminous atmosphere that mirrors the story’s attention to pattern and craft. Details are filtered through Kenji’s sensibility (nets as philosophy, moon paths on water) rather than reading like a tourist catalog. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, it decisively charges the final image—the parapet, fireflies, and harbor boats form a layered visual argument about continuity and pattern. The recurring moon paths and fireflies elevate the micro-setting to a thematic engine.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    The radioactive wasteland orchard is vivid and specific (“poisoned snow,” luminous apples against gray sky), and the Geiger counter and nausea meaningfully interact with the environment. The stillpoint/diamond literally reconfigures the setting rules, and the orchard walk at the end is charged by Vera’s new knowledge. Non-visual sensory detail is modest, but the world feels coherent and lived-in. The setting isn’t mere backdrop; it underwrites the core mystery and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is a major strength: the stormlit observatory, sea of clouds, and especially the cobalt glass portico create a vivid, coherent atmosphere filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Details like lightning “churning with perpetual lightning” and blue light pooling across equipment feel purposeful and tightly integrated. The environment underwrites her isolation and frames the “stormlit place” the prophet names, and the cobalt glass returns in the final image as witness and lens, charging closure. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain physical tactics, but it absolutely charges tone, solitude, and the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dunes, “feral loft,” salt and wild roses, and the jars create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels lived-in and distinct. Setting is filtered strongly through Cosima’s sensibility, with details like “wind through the dunes made music against broken glass” mirroring her obsession with sound. The recurring objects (loft, jars, music box, lighthouse graveyard) charge the thematic frame of preservation and loss and feed directly into the final image. The environment rarely constrains tactical choices in a hard way, which holds it just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    The drift-ice marina, sound-anchored lighthouse, and resonance chamber are vividly evoked and strongly filtered through Meris’s professional perception. Environmental rules (ice/lighthouse harmonics, defensive frequencies) aren’t just decorative; they directly constrain tactics and enable her solution. The cold, the singing ice, and the twilight light all color her choices and strongly charge the final image of her palm on the window. A bit more tactile engagement with the ice itself during the climax could push this into truly exceptional territory, but as-is the setting is a major asset.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Ren’s professional eye. Environmental details (ice thickness, post-rain magnetism, cold absorbed by basalt) directly shape what she can do and when, and the viaduct’s alignment with the moon charges key beats. The final image—her touching the basalt, looking at the viaduct before sunrise—reprises and reweights the setting as crucible and witness to her revolution. This is deeply integrated worldbuilding without excess exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    The flooded subway tunnel and hidden nineteenth-century chamber are vividly rendered and thematically apt, with water and underground space echoing concealment and revelation. The environment actively matters—flooding reveals Malcolm, the gap in the wall enables the discovery, and the lanterns and carved names charge the final image. Some sensory variety beyond the visual (sound, smell, bodily discomfort) could further intensify atmosphere and urgency. Overall, setting is specific and purposeful rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    The shop is vividly and economically rendered—“vibrant hush,” ticking mechanisms, dust motes, storm light—and the clockwork specificity feels lived-in rather than ornamental. The environment meaningfully colors perception, especially in how Eliana now “sees” the heart differently under the post-storm light. The setting supports tone and theme more than it constrains concrete options; nothing in the physical layout or tools forces a particular tactical choice. Still, the music-box emporium and its atmosphere are integral to the story’s identity and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    The acid sea and cogwork platform are richly realized and consistently present in Mal’s perceptions, from hissing spray on the lower gears to the workshop tilting on a wave. Setting details are not decorative: the acid sea establishes real danger, the floating gears define her tools and constraints, and the relic arrow/kaleidoscope are spatially and functionally grounded. The final image of a “bell tower built from pure mathematics” rising where sea meets sky is charged precisely because the physical environment has been made so tangible. This integration of environment with concept and final image is strong enough to feel publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    The archive room and data infrastructure are vividly sketched (“ghost-light of a billion dead profiles,” cascading backups, quarantine directory) and consistently filtered through Elena’s sensibility. The setting is not just backdrop; it enables the investigation, makes the quarantined directory plausible, and culminates in the patch materializing in her palm. World rules around deletion vs. backup are clear enough and support the premise without bogging down in exposition. The final image of screens pulsing 1408 effectively charges the environment with lingering consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse orchard over shifting ice floes, the impossible apple trees, and the mirror-lined room are vivid, specific, and tonally unified. Environment and objects actively matter: the mirrors’ history of reflections and the crystal’s refraction mechanics literally create the story’s central method for insight, and the orchard/ice reappear to charge the final image. Details are consistently filtered through Maren’s sensibility, and the setting coherently supports the story’s themes of impossible growth and precarious balance. The only slight limit is that the physical peril or constraint of the ice landscape never directly pressures her choices in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    The drift-ice marina, converted lighthouse clinic, and ruined fishing villages are vividly, economically evoked, with sensory details (“salt and diesel,” creaking boats, slabs of drift ice) that all feed tone and theme. Setting is filtered through Vera’s perception of endings and dissolutions, integrating atmosphere with her inner state rather than reading as tourist catalog. The heirloom parasol functions as a micro-setting object, charging both the Warsaw backstory and the final image. The environment doesn’t force hard tactical constraints, but it quietly shapes the kind of work, danger, and seasonal finality she confronts.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    The vineyard hill, fog, amber lanterns, and distant station are vivid and consistently filtered through Marcus’s awareness, creating an atmospheric, end-of-season mood that supports the emotional arc. The environment does light functional work: the missed bus and isolated pavilion trap them in a temporal and spatial pocket until dawn, and the stressed vines concretize the thematic analogy. The final image of the vineyard as “full of beautiful mistakes that had become something true” charges the setting with thematic weight. A bit more tactile engagement (cold air, smells, textures) under stress could make the space feel fully lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the kinetic parapet, dunes, murmuring pavilion, and “whisperfield calm” all feel specific and lived-in, not generic fantasy dressing. Environment actively participates—parapet sand and iron filings are literal components of the ritual, and the pavilion is itself a fragile conjured clearing whose fading drives the action. Spatial relations and atmosphere are consistently clear and tonally aligned with the piece’s quiet mysticism. The final image meaningfully recharges both parapet and pavilion, so setting helps charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.3)
    The lavender field against rusted factory ruins is vivid and particular, with strong sensory layering (scent of lavender and metal, beams “like broken teeth”). Setting consistently mirrors and supports theme—nature’s reclamation paralleling emotional restoration—and recurs meaningfully in the final image of “broken things” blooming. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactics, it does charge almost every beat and anchors the emotional tone. The specificity feels confidently chosen rather than generic-industrial.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    The shadowed library at dawn, the sonically reflective architecture, and the crystal as a micro-setting are vivid and purposeful, all filtered through Elara’s professional and emotional priorities. The environment isn’t just pretty; it enables the experiment (library as tuning fork) and charges the final image (crystal in pocket, ancient books “dreaming”). This interplay of place, object, and theme is strong enough to feel central to the piece’s identity.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    The fog sculpture garden, beach, and junkyard ecosystem are vivid, sensorial, and thematically charged—fog, marine layer, driftwood, and magnetic tape all echo the logic of decay and partial recording. Environment constrains and shapes choices: the fog’s limited visibility justifies directional markers and the ephemerality of sculptures mirrors the prophet’s unstable memory. The setting is not mere backdrop; it’s the operating metaphor-system that culminates in the final monument and seashell image. This is very close to top-tier: one more tactically constraining interaction with the physical environment (e.g., fog or tide forcing a micro-choice) would push it into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory above the clouds, the mountain’s shaking bedrock, the dome, orrery, and instruments are all vividly realized and constantly tied to Kenji’s perceptions. Setting actively shapes what’s possible—this place exists to watch the moon—and the tremoring foundation charges both the mood and the stakes. The recurring objects (clock hand, orrery, telescope) return at the end in a charged way that frames the final image. Description remains economic and POV-filtered rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.3)
    The mountain-top hospice above the clouds and the “particular quality of light” create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that supports the quasi-sacred tone. Setting details (clouds as visiting spirits, open courtyards) are selective and integrated rather than touristic. The environment mainly charges mood rather than constraining choices, so it’s more atmospheric than tactical. Still, the elevated, radiant location and recurring light motif clearly frame the story’s sense of threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    The nocturnal floating observatory, brass telescope, and massive orrery are vivid, purposeful details that shape what Mira can do (study shadows, use the key, realign arms). The “after the spoons bent reality” world-rule is introduced efficiently and consistently drives the shadow anomalies. The observatory’s stuck-in-night limitation and its later movement through dawn/noon directly charge the final image. Setting is both distinctive and functional rather than mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Blackwood hedge maze and secret garden are vividly and efficiently rendered—roses with "colors that had no names," November wrongness, copper-and-honey air—and feel filtered through Marianne’s sensibility as a rationalist confronting the uncanny. The maze and garden function as more than backdrop: they gate access to Iris, embody the threshold between worlds, and hold the stone table and tooth that anchor the final image. Seasonal and sensory dissonance support the theme of reality fracturing under pressure. The world-rule implications (how this garden persists, how it links to the other world) are sketched, not fully developed, but at this length they feel like purposeful mystery rather than white-room omission.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is lush, specific, and integral: the “serpentine grotto,” perpetual mist, tide, and adapted jeweler’s tools all feel lived-in and attuned to Maren’s scientific/artistic eye. Environmental details are filtered through her priorities (how light hits shelves, the chamber as a “pearl of stillness”), and the grotto’s qualities—its twist, mist, and shelves—literally frame and focus her work with the glass. The recurring images of mist, stone, and refracted light charge the final tableau of the colored shadows and the implied presence of Elena. It stops just short of 9+ because the environment shapes mood and meaning more than it constrains or complicates any specific choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned data center turned moss cathedral is vivid, sensory, and consistently filtered through Maya’s sensibility (systems failing, organic ambiguity). Specific details—the luminous moss, thawing icicles, “maps she read like scripture”—create a strong atmosphere that mirrors the thematic work. The environment meaningfully charges the final image but mostly as metaphor and mood rather than a hard constraint on action. Even so, the setting feels inseparable from this story’s identity rather than a generic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    The feral nexus, ruined lighthouse, fog, and sea create a vivid, tonally precise atmosphere that’s consistently filtered through the novelist’s liminal attentiveness. The setting is more spiritual/emotional constraint than physical, but it clearly functions as the place “where the world felt thin,” enabling the apparitions and then stripping back to “ordinary” at the end for a charged contrast. The shell as micro-setting/object is neatly tied to perception and returns in the final beat. The environment doesn’t much restrict tactical options, which keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting and atmosphere are major strengths: the harvest moon, verdant arbor, brass framework, and living vine all feel concrete, tactile, and suffused with tone. Environmental specifics matter—ancient oaks, blessed soil, sacred spring, dawn’s “liminal hour”—and these elements are not just decorative; they’re integral to the ritual’s conditions. The final image of an overabundant arbor heavy with impossible fruit is both spatially legible and thematically charged. The world’s magical rules are conveyed through these details rather than exposition, giving the setting an organic authority.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    The withered orchard in a subarctic crater is vividly realized, with frost-silvered trees, perpetual twilight, and the aurora all filtered through Vera’s work. Environmental features are not just decorative: the dying trees are the very subject of her alchemy, the crater holds the observatory ruins, and the unique sky conditions (aurora, liminal hour) enable her starlight-based method. The recurring objects—flash-paper, copper plate, hollow tree—are spatially coherent and charged with meaning. While the setting more strongly motivates and charges the action than it physically constrains options, it deeply colors the final image of maps hidden in the oldest tree.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    The marble cavern is vivid, specific, and integral: its reflective, polished surfaces and moonlight fissures are not just atmosphere but the literal mechanism enabling temporal echoes. Details like calcite deposits, underground streams, and geometric center are filtered through Marcus’s eye and directly shape his tactics (mapping angles, placing the device). The environment charges the final image—“The marble remembers”—with both physical and thematic weight. This is one of the piece’s strongest dimensions.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    The bronze grotto and its mineral walls, starlight shafts, and “shingled hush” are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through her sensibility. The environment is not decorative: it echoes the oxidized brass of the burner, conducts the miners’ exhaustion, and provides the geometry (opening, starlight angles) necessary for burdens to orient and calcify. The lamp as an object-as-setting deeply charges the final image when she carries it out while leaving the crystals. Setting and object constraints are integral to how the magic works and how the thematic closure reads.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    The loft, rain, and skylight are vividly rendered and recur as functional elements, not mere backdrop. The “aquarium of gray light” and rain-beaded glass shape how she sees the bowl and her hand at the end, charging the final image. Tools and materials (knife, ash block, kettle) are tactile and embedded in action. Environment and object-as-setting together meaningfully constrain tone and cadence, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    The kinetic lagoon, crystal platform, cloud-stairs, and stalled carousel create a striking, coherent environment that is constantly filtered through Mira’s perception. The setting is not mere backdrop: the impossible physics mirror her fractured time sense, and the lagoon plus camera wheel charge the final image (water stilling as she accepts herself and the wheel sinking out of reach). World rules are surreal but consistent and taught through image rather than exposition. It stops just shy of 9+ because the environment frames her choice more symbolically than through concrete constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    The spaceport is vividly rendered—cracked marble floors, pitted glass dome, cotton candy spirals—and setting details are tightly tied to Lena’s perception as an engineer. Environmental specifics like water infiltration, mushrooms in the bookstore, and crystalline mineral deposits are not mere backdrop but directly inform her conceptual plan. The sextant, dome, and drainage system help charge the final image, though they rarely constrain concrete physical choices. Overall, the setting feels textured, lived-in, and thematically resonant at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vividly evoked—the rain-soaked crystals, forest edge, and “soundless sanctuary” produce a strong, coherent atmosphere filtered through her perceptions. Environmental details (crystal forecourt, dawn light, forest birds) mirror and support her internal shift from repression to tentative creation. The crystals function as more than décor by responding to her confession, though the environment constrains mood more than concrete options. The final image of her walking back “toward the hidden sunrise” ties tone and place together effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    The twilight barge canal, still air, and glowing water are vividly rendered and integral: the phenomenon depends on canals, twilight angles, and surface alignment. Setting is tightly tied to the premise (negative architecture, spaces between structures) and charges both the middle spectacle and the final darkened image. The sundial as a handled object functions almost as micro-setting, recursively anchoring theme and action. A bit more non-visual sensory texture could push this higher, but what’s present is selective and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    The harbor, golden dock under snow, and rolling fog are rendered with precise, lived-in sensory detail that fully support the contemplative tone. Setting is tightly filtered through Mira’s attentional bias (the warmth of the planks, the “oceanic hush,” the tactile ropework), and the environment evolves subtly as snow and fog accumulate. These details charge the mood and the final isolation in white silence, making the dock feel like a liminal, protected space for her work. However, the environment does not materially constrain her choices or tactics; it shapes atmosphere far more than action, which slightly limits the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the fog, the last ship, rust-and-gold garden, and palace hall all mirror the emotional terrain of exile and partial absence. Details are tightly filtered through theme—the carpet as lost map, the roses as unreachable grief, the garden wind scattering leaf-“writing.” The crimson thread functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image as a bridge home. Environment doesn’t rigidly constrain physical choice, but it strongly shapes meaning and the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    The suspended palace chained to stalactites is vivid, specific, and threaded through multiple beats (opening tremor, drilling below, final resonance of the phoenix’s song through chains and cities). Setting is not postcard décor; it materially charges the ending by carrying the phoenix’s song into the mechanized world and mirroring the hybrid tension (stone vs. void, sky vs. abyss). Details like crystalline walls, heat lamps, and excavation machines are economical yet evocative. The only small shortfall from the 9+ band is that the environment shapes resonance more than concrete tactical choices in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    The obsidian lagoon, dunes, migrating clouds, and black sand are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with theme—the setting is not a backdrop but a ritual apparatus (water as forgiveness, volcanic glass as fire transmuted). Environmental details recur and evolve, from initial description to the tactile use of sand and water in the healing act, to the final image of “dark stars in dark water.” The world feels coherent and sensorial without sliding into a tourist catalog. It stops just shy of 9+ because the environment, while thematically charged, doesn’t strongly constrain options so much as beautifully echo them.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    The city of forgotten fountains is vivid and tonally unified, with decayed plazas, dry basins, and leaning buildings all reinforcing the idea of lapsed memory. Crucially, setting is not just backdrop: the constellation of fountains actively gives Mira the sequence to open the box, and the fountains’ refilling charges the final image. Details like the migrating geese and autumn’s pause deepen atmosphere without clutter. This is very high-level setting work that shapes action and theme rather than merely decorating them.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.3)
    The nebula garden is vivid, specific, and thematically resonant—“flowers that glowed with their own light, needing no sun” elegantly merges setting and idea. Environmental details (drawing luminescence from the nebula, blooming across light-years) are woven into action rather than feeling like postcard description. The spatial and conceptual geography stay clear, and the garden meaningfully charges the final image of the Keeper drifting on. While the setting constrains tactics only lightly, its integration into premise and closure is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse and monarchs are vivid, specific, and strongly filtered through the protagonist’s grief-focused gaze. The setting isn’t just pretty; the glass, rust, dusk light, and butterflies’ collective movement all mirror and charge the thematic revelation about collective sorrow. The greenhouse as a liminal, abandoned yet repurposed studio concretely supports the spectral mentorship and the final image of her writing on the ribbon. Environment doesn’t drastically constrain physical options, but it meaningfully shapes mood, imagery, and the story’s final reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    The obsidian ridge, tidal danger, and clock tower are vividly rendered and tightly tied to community survival and Maren’s burden. The pendulum, brass, and rake handle work as micro-setting objects that physically carry the theme and final image. Environment doesn’t overtly block her choices, but it consistently charges them, especially the tower as liminal space between land and sea, accusation and absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is vivid and particular: the cobalt silo, velveteen darkness, village cemetery, and tapestry details all feel textured and anchored in Marta’s perceptions as a gardener and thinker. The environment is not mere backdrop—the silo’s isolation and ruin make it plausible as a secret workspace and charge the final sentinel image. The cemetery’s “tenderly organized” dead mirror the coded border and the grandmother’s notebooks, reinforcing theme through place. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices, it strongly charges the mood and the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    The obsidian spire, frozen lake, and geothermal vents are vivid and specific, with concrete details (spiral staircase, glyphs, crystal apex, volcanic ink) that feel integrated rather than touristic. Setting is filtered through Maren’s professional lens (glyphs as “forgotten warnings,” walls as circuitry), which supports theme and atmosphere. The environment does shape tactics in a light way—the spire houses the models and circuitry; the vents provide ink—though it mostly enables rather than constrains choices. The final image of her stepping onto the frozen lake with the spire behind her nicely charges the setting without quite turning it into an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ember alcove, misted window, amber radio glow, and luminous dust create a vivid, coherent micro-world that’s strongly filtered through Elena’s sensibility. Environmental details are selective and purposeful (embers pulsing with the signal; mist “softening the world’s sharp edges”), and the final image is deeply charged by the setting. The world’s rules about story famine, luminous sound, and dust memories feel internally consistent and learned through observation rather than dump. The setting enhances atmosphere and theme more than it tactically constrains choices, which keeps it just short of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Vanishing Point Gallery, foggy edge of the city, meditation garden, ash, and the rocking chair all form a coherent, atmospheric ecosystem that mirrors and supports the themes. Details like dissolving paintings and ash settling between stones are specific and purposeful rather than touristic. The environment charges the final image more than it constrains concrete choices, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sunken city, layered ruins, and storm-drain sanctuary are vivid and efficiently rendered, with details (levels, flooding, candles, waterproof containers) tightly filtered through Marcus’s habits and priorities. The environment meaningfully constrains choices (he lives below, scavengers above, rising water and potential pumping shape the long view) and the chronometer cog functions as a charged micro-setting object that frames the final handoff. A touch more sensory variety under pressure could elevate this further, but it is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “velvet library” and amber October light are vivid, and the space’s sound-dampening and reflective atmosphere directly enable Mrs. Chen’s method of subtracting noise. Details like leaves “like illuminated manuscripts” and the oak table ground the lyricism in concrete space. The setting isn’t a postcard backdrop: the library’s quiet, enclosed acoustics make the humming exercise and its fragile harmony plausible. The rosette as object intertwined with the setting also charges the final image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.3)
    The rusted greenhouse, corroded glass, and silver planetary line create a vivid, specific atmosphere that supports the ruin/regeneration motif. Details like rust-flaked soil, silver leaves, and purple-glowing fruit feel tactile and are consistently filtered through Mara’s sensibility. The greenhouse meaningfully charges the final image (“rust and regeneration”) even if it rarely constrains concrete choices. World-rule hints (banned seeds, industrialized food-memories) integrate smoothly without derailing the intimate focus.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lightning collection tower, copper coils, blackout-dark city, and mechanical hive are vividly and economically rendered, with repeated “amber/nectar” light giving a strong atmospheric through-line. World details (vertical farms, lightning-charged bees) feel specific and lived-in without becoming a tour. The setting charges the final image—the humming coils ready for the next storm parallel the plan to resurrect wonder—but doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices. Overall, environment and motif integration are very solid, just shy of using setting as an active obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bay at dusk, the tideline, and the Kettering house are vivid, tactile, and consistently filtered through Mara’s noticing. Setting details like the “streetlights blinked awake” and “spring air went still” aren’t decorative; they modulate tone and charge the final image of the house “holding light like a promise.” The micro-setting of the windowsill altar and specific found objects also function as a kind of emotional architecture. The environment doesn’t tightly constrain physical choices, but it deeply charges the atmosphere and ending.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    The underwater garden is vividly and economically realized—the animate fish, coral-encrusted monuments, and breathing stone create a strong, unified atmosphere. Setting is filtered through Marina’s shifting understanding so that details reweight meaning (the garden as exclusionary luxury, not innocent beauty). The environment subtly constrains action (limited oxygen, distance to the surface) and charges the final image of ascent. To reach the very top tier, the physical difficulty of the ascent and underwater environment could bear slightly more tactical pressure on her decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    The infinite staircase is vivid, rule-bearing, and thematically charged, with details like steps “echoing into vastness” and dice that “clattered upward” teaching the altered physics through action. That environment directly constrains her choices: there is no end to climb toward, so “stepping sideways into the void” becomes a meaningful, pressured tactic. The office setting is sketched more lightly but still grounds the conceptual in a concrete waking world. The recurring object-as-setting (the dice) and the staircase together strongly charge the final image of the dice beside the laptop.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rooftop greenhouse and smog-choked city are vividly rendered and thematically fused—contaminated air versus fragile, curated life; erasure versus preservation. The moon, glass panels, orchids, and brush all function as spatially coherent, recurring anchors that charge the final images (smog thinning, glowing brush beside her). Environment meaningfully shapes the rules: moonlight is required to access the “library,” the greenhouse is a sanctuary of forbidden beauty. It’s extremely strong, just shy of transcendent because the physical space doesn’t quite force a tactical dilemma beyond atmosphere and access.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    The grotto city, frozen waterfall, damp museum, and artisan quarter are vivid and integrated into action rather than feeling like a tour. Environment directly constrains and shapes choices: the freeze traps the city, kills crafts that need warmth or bees, and dictates thawing tactics. Recurring objects (ice wall, lens, bread, museum) charge the final image and keep the world cohesive. Sensory specificity and atmosphere are high without bogging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse and rocky island are richly evoked and functionally necessary: the spiral stairs, cold stone, beam, and hunger stone at low tide all shape timing and access. The environment constrains choice (she can only act when the tide recedes and exposes the stone) and charges the final image (cracked hunger stone, lingering lighthouse with backwards clocks). Specifics like the “wind carved through the lighthouse beam… sweeping geometries” feel both atmospheric and plot-adjacent. The world rules of thin moments at low tide are internally consistent and legible without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned carnival funhouse and hall of mirrors are vividly realized and thematically apt, with tactile details like dust motes, warped glass, and grotesque shadows. Setting is not mere backdrop: mirrors and lingering luminance directly shape how fear appears and how Margot can confront it. The final image of empty mirrors and flickering luminance is a charged environmental closure. A few more non-visual sensory cues (sound, temperature, smell) under peak beats could deepen immersion further, but what’s here is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    The floating orchard, copper-wrapped trees, and blue hour sea/sky bleed create a distinctive, atmospheric environment that feels lived in rather than decorative. Setting constantly constrains and enables choice: anchors, ballast, and apple trees as instruments are all integral to tactics. The worldbuilding is economical yet suggestive, with the apple trees’ salt-air adaptation and salvaged materials reinforcing theme and tone. The final image of the orchard between sky and sea is charged by everything we’ve learned about this precarious habitat.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    The turtle-shell city is vivid and specific—bleached bone, spirals, rusted gate, horizon line—and details are always filtered through Maren’s mapping sensibility. Environment isn’t postcard; it directly constrains stakes (shell crack, immobility, risk of city tipping into the sea). Recurring objects (shell, gate, horizon) all charge the final image of the turtle shifting under her. A touch more tactile interaction with the city’s inhabitants or the sea itself could deepen the world, but what’s here is already strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.0)
    The disused, ivy-overgrown railway station is vividly rendered and integrated—dusty sunlight, cracked tiles, birds, and ivy all create an evocative, almost liminal atmosphere that suits the theme of past overtaking present. The rosebush and petals provide a recurring visual anchor that times the encounter and returns in the ending. However, the environment mostly frames and mirrors rather than constraining choices; the station’s specific physicality doesn’t significantly alter tactics or options. Still, the setting is concrete, selective, and thematically consonant, well above average for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    The submerged pavilion, river, and distant drawbridge are vividly rendered and deeply integrated into action rather than postcard description. Environmental constraints—the tide window, underwater cracks, silt, and sediment—directly determine what Marcus can do and when he must leave. The inkwell and the pavilion together charge the final image, tying environment to theme. Sensory detail is lush yet controlled, with the “cathedral of green light” and fish through doorways doing real atmospheric and thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sunken library, storm, blackout, and mineral-slick floors are vividly rendered and always filtered through Mira’s professional eye. The environment meaningfully constrains action (no power, treacherous footing, reliance on lamp and paper) and shapes her tactics. The recurring objects—the lamp, dripping water, and especially the stamp—charge the atmosphere and final image. Setting, tone, and character are tightly integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and particular—camellias rooting into clouds, a glass basilica, light-trapping lanterns, the edge of a floating isle—and all are filtered through Mei’s relationship to craft and loss. World-rules (inverted roots, stored sunlight, paradoxical descent/ascension) are consistent and thematically linked to visibility, memory, and liminality. The environment meaningfully charges choices: the basilica as institutional alternative to Mei’s DIY ritual, the island’s edge as necessary launch point, the lanterns as “luminous torment” that reframe her life’s work. The final image of lantern light and ongoing labor is strongly powered by these environmental motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    The floating observatory, polar stratosphere, aurora, and ionospheric instruments are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Mira’s perceptions, giving the piece a distinct atmosphere. Setting is not just decorative: the ability to drift between poles and monitor quantum fluctuations is what lets her pursue her metaphysical “hunt,” and the aurora’s imagery charges the final image of pooled potential. The geode functions as a micro-setting object that recurs meaningfully. Environmental detail is economical yet specific, with consistent world rules and no white-room moments.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ancient observatory at sunset, cracked dome, and “brilliant dimness” are vivid, tonally apt, and consistently filtered through Mara’s astronomical/technical priorities. The setting isn’t just backdrop: the old star-charting function of the observatory elegantly mirrors and underwrites her new mission. Details like the drones’ launch through the dome and the star trails appearing across the sky integrate environment with action and theme. It stops just short of 9-band because the environment doesn’t materially constrain choices or impose practical obstacles; it charges mood and concept more than tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cobalt terrace, forgotten shore, and driftwood carvings are vivid, specific, and tonally aligned with Mara’s inner landscape, with recurring wood imagery mirroring broken lives and accidental “carvings” of fate. The setting is well integrated into action (her descent, sifting, kneeling, waves) and charges the final image of her remaining on the shore to “remember what it meant to be accountable.” However, the environment mostly functions symbolically and atmospherically rather than constraining choices or tactics. A slightly stronger sense of physical constraint or exposure would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.0)
    The parapet, mist, and valley are vivid and introduced early, with details like “stone ribbon fraying at the edges” and moonlight silvering the mist giving real atmosphere. The setting is not just postcard; the wind and mist carry her voice and concealment, and the neutral parapet makes the meeting possible. The moon as an environmental feature meaningfully constrains tactics via the timed apex. Still, the storm-worn conditions themselves don’t materially change anyone’s options beyond mood and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    The coastal setting, utility poles, and Pacific conditions are specific and filtered through Marina’s navigator mind, avoiding generic seascape. Environment constrains choice (the weather window, the launch point, the open water once the poles vanish) and charges the final image of the island ahead and shore behind. The astronomical compass functions as a tool-as-setting that both anchors her body and reweights the ending moment. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with no white-room gaps or postcard filler.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    The underground bioluminescent lake and cavern are vividly rendered and tonally aligned with the theme (“light thriving in absolute darkness”). Setting details are consistently filtered through Marcus’s state and return meaningfully at the end, charging the final image. However, the environment is more atmospheric than constraining: the lake’s danger and strangeness never force a concrete tactical choice. The object-as-setting of the baseball also feels lived-in and thematically charged, strengthening the overall sense of place.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    The orchard under permanent moonlight, silver blossoms, and cold-burning spices are vivid, specific, and tightly filtered through Mira’s perception. Setting isn’t just pretty; it establishes a liminal, fairy-tale logic that justifies ghosts, phoenix, and threshold-beasts, and it charges the final image of the siblings walking between the trees. Environmental details (glowing fruit, invisible winds, spices) mirror and support the theme of thresholds and paradox. A touch more interaction between her changing body and the altered environment could further heighten constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    The midnight glade above the clouds is vivid and sensorially rich (“moonlight pooled like spilled mercury,” “star-flowers…so sweet it burned her throat”), and the setting’s uncanny beauty mirrors the painful truth she confronts. Objects as micro-setting—the onyx cards, the birthday tablecloth—are well integrated and charge the final images. The glade exerts more thematic than tactical pressure, but that’s sufficient at this length; nothing reads like postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    The recycled spaceship, with its layered rebuilds and twilight population, is vivid and tightly interwoven with the story’s mood and stakes, culminating in the line about the ship preparing to be transformed one final time. Mei’s workshop and the observation deck feel concretely inhabited, and the environment (limited power, salvaged photographs, the long-haul vessel) meaningfully shapes what tactics are available. The recurring objects (the Tear, the photos) are fully integrated into setting and final image. A touch more non-visual sensory grounding under peak pressure is the only thing left on the table.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    The black sand beach, volcanic heat, and rumble are sensually and economically drawn, creating a strong atmosphere that mirrors her liminal state. Setting is consistently filtered through Mara’s body and attention (warm sand, exhaled air, alignment overhead), and it ties into the surveyor’s mission and the fireflies’ release. The volcano and beach don’t strongly constrain her choices—she could make similar choices in another mystical landscape—but they do charge the final image. Overall, this is evocative, purposeful scene-setting rather than postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    The luminous fort, phosphorescent paint from the cradle of sparks, and darkened corridors are vivid and integrated with character perception and action. Setting meaningfully shapes tactics—the blackout, the grove’s light, and the fort’s architecture all enable covert communication rather than serving as mere backdrop. The fort’s history as both protector and prison ties environment to theme. Still, the environment constrains choices more conceptually than physically; we rarely see concrete obstacles or logistics dictated by layout or guards.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    The frictionless tidal bluff, aurora, and eel behavior are vividly rendered and integral to both mechanics and mood—water gliding, eels drifting, and the aurora responding to the pattern all materially shape what Korin can do. The collapsed star dust and rocks function as tools bound to this environment’s physics, and the final image (“eels sang mathematics into the frictionless night”) is charged by those concrete conditions. World rules feel consistent and are mostly shown through action rather than lecture. This is very strong, just shy of exceptional because the sensory palette still leans heavily visual and conceptual over fully embodied texture.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory above the clouds, the storm, and the darkroom timer are vividly rendered and tightly bound to Mara’s psyche and tactics (lightning as intermittent illumination for her writing, the timer structuring resistance). Environmental details (glimpses of the city through cloud gaps, copper dome “catching lightning like a prayer”) deepen theme without feeling like generic scenery. The storm and altitude genuinely charge the final images of rarefied truth and “storm-kissed wonder.” Setting stops just short of constraining a concrete choice; it amplifies rather than forces tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glass atrium, fractured light, and murmuring brook are vividly rendered and consistently integrated into action—the sundial literally requires the light, and the glass walls become working surfaces. The environment supports tone and theme, culminating in the “cathedral of questions without answers” image that clearly reweights the whole scene. Adelaine’s mechanical arm and instruments function as micro-setting tools, constraining how she works. The only small limit is that the brook’s presence is more atmospheric than tactically constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    The abandoned prison library with its peeled-back metal roof and desert sky is vivid, tactile, and consistently filtered through Mara’s sensibility. Environment directly shapes choices—the nightbloom seeds, the holes in the roof admitting moonlight, the rust and dust that must be worked with rather than erased. The recurring images of razor wire buried in wildflowers and stars seen through structural damage culminate in the “luminous fracture” line, charging the final stance. Setting is inseparable from theme and action; swapping it out would break the story.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tidal arbor above clouds, the glass floor, flickering compasses, and the old projector are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the premise. Setting is filtered through her habits and work (keys memorized by cracks, projector as companion), which keeps it from feeling like a tourist catalog. Crucially, environmental elements directly constrain and charge the climax: the terminal as “suspended above choice,” the compasses locking in, and the broken clock restarting give the ending its conceptual and emotional charge. This is one of the story’s standout strengths.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ridge, monsoon, and crimson flowers are vivid and recur with evolving significance—from beauty to calendar to charged site of risk. Setting is not mere backdrop: the monsoon deadline and the ridge’s ancestral function directly shape options and urgency. The final image of the ridge humming beneath her palms, with rains coming, powerfully charges the environment with possibility and uncertainty. Sensory specificity is strong without tipping into clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    The islet after rain, twisted pine, driftwood table, wet sand, and cerulean sea are vividly, economically rendered and threaded through the action. Setting and recurring objects (compass, lace, bonsai) strongly charge the atmosphere and final image even if they don’t physically constrain options in a hard way. Weather and environment subtly mirror internal states (post-storm calm, “salt and renewal”) without feeling like blunt symbolism. The space remains consistently oriented and tactile, supporting the lyric accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    The atmospheric detailing is the story's standout feature, with vivid imagery like "coral-crusted bookshelves" and "oilcloth that smelled of brine." The setting feels distinct and tactile, effectively grounding the surreal concept of an underwater library, though the "impossible geometry" remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.5)
    The terra-cotta arbor and silver bell provide solid anchors, but the setting often feels like a backdrop for the monologue rather than a source of constraint. Atmospheric details like "stars that belonged to no nation" veer into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    The inverted view through the camera obscura effectively defamiliarizes the setting, turning the viaduct into a distinct, charged space that grounds the magical elements in specific optics.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.3)
    The "living bridge" setting is visualized with specific, tactile details ("moss-slick spans," "roots... geometric patterns") that actively support the central metaphor. The environment feels essential to the plot rather than just a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is actively integrated into the plot, with the prize wheel, stage, and booth serving as essential components of the cipher rather than just backdrop. The atmospheric details of the decayed carnival effectively ground the dystopian stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.4)
    The sunken greenhouse is not merely atmospheric; it provides the essential tools (salt water, forge, cold) that constrain and enable the plot. The setting's decay mirrors the thematic focus on broken trust, and the specific sensory details (apple roots in salt water) ground the magical realism in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the transition from the amber light of golden hour to the silvering moonlight of Emerald Station effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal shift. The sensory details (green tiles, white lilies, trapped smoke) create a vivid, dreamlike atmosphere that supports the magical realism tone.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.5)
    The juxtaposition of the delicate glassworking tools against the industrial decay of the control room is vivid and well-rendered. Specific details like the "pontil rod" and the "river ice" grounding the scene create a strong atmospheric container, though descriptions occasionally veer into purple territory ("constellations," "theatrical cracks").

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    The "children's medical library" is a specific, atmospheric setting that grounds the scene well. The physical details of the cast and the rusted beams create a solid sensory environment, though the "dying beast" simile is slightly overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "ambered hush" and "marbled quiet" create a distinct, textured sense of place. The setting details (the useless maps, the dimming sky) actively support the narrative arc. A slightly wider sensory palette beyond the visual/auditory could deepen the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and atmospherically consistent; details like "amber-gray light" and "whispering against stone" effectively ground the abstract concepts in a tangible frozen reality.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the acoustic property of the forecourt creates the inciting incident naturally. The sensory details ("wet stone," "suspended shard") effectively ground the scene and support the "resonant hush" tone required by the prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is an active participant, with the impossible simultaneity of blooming and withering perfectly externalizing the theme of timeless truth. The maze functions as both a physical constraint and a judge of character, charging the final image with high conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with the "perpetual twilight" and station details grounding the scene well. The integration of technical elements with the environment establishes a strong sense of place, though the temperature details feel slightly repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.4)
    The atmospheric imagery of the flooded opera house is vivid, but spatial logic is inconsistent (sitting on a chair vs. chest-deep water). The sensory details of the cello's sound in water defy physics, breaking immersion for the sake of mood.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    The frost patterns as "botanical illustrations" provide a strong, specific grounding image that links effectively to the theme. The setting is vivid, though occasionally the description leans into abstraction ("auroral sorrow") rather than concrete sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, offering vivid specificity in the "beaded valve wheels" and the auditory texture of the radio static against the dripping tunnel. These details ground the abstraction effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.9)
    The "composting library" is a vivid, specific environment that successfully integrates with the theme ("Books became soil"). Details like "mineral script" and "mushrooms bloomed from leather bindings" ground the surreal premise effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is established with effective sensory details like the "sharp perfume" of sage and the "twilight" quality of the eclipse. While the atmosphere supports the tone well, some descriptors (e.g., "hush of dreaming roots") lean towards the flowery, slightly distancing the reader from the physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.3)
    The silo library is atmospherically rendered ("industrial bones," "climbing vines") and grounds the scene effectively. However, the broader context of a world that "stopped dreaming" remains abstract backstory and does not exert immediate, concrete pressure on the character's choices in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is atmospheric and specific, effectively utilizing the sensory details of the lighthouse ("beam's rhythm," "fog crept") and the tradecraft materials (UV paste). The environment feels lived-in and integral to the protagonist's solitary method.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.1)
    The "dimensional anchor chamber" is rendered with vivid, specific imagery that integrates well with the story's unique magic system (painting on air). The setting actively enables the resolution rather than serving merely as a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integral to the plot; the "mirrored horizon" is not just scenery but the catalyst for the climax. Sensory details like the "crystalline walls" and the "groan" of the ice effectively ground the abstract epiphany in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)

    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "windblown sanctuary" and the "braided hemp" provide specific, tactile constraints that ground the action. The "solstice hush" effectively charges the atmosphere, justifying the protagonist's auditory focus.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting is atmospheric and specific, with the brass fixtures and "yellow lantern glass" grounding the cosmic scope. The environment effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal state, though the "automated payments" exposition feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific details like the "copper sun" and the "fragments of crystalline blue" in the box grounding the fable-like tone. The atmosphere of the abandoned oasis is palpable, though the "contextual clues" paragraph drifts into abstract summary rather than sticking to sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    The emerald silo provides a distinct, atmospheric anchor that grounds the abstract concept effectively. The sensory details of the "green glass" and the "green-gold" light work well to establish a mood, though the setting functions more as a backdrop than a constraint on action.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is established with sensory detail, but the description leans into "purple" territory ("rainfall's final curtain," "symphony of ripples"). While the "cobalt lagoon" anchors the scene, the "drake... something older" introduces a vague fantasy element that isn't grounded or utilized.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "pillars of living limestone" and "mycorrhizal networks" are specific, vivid, and causal. The physical properties of the temple dictate the protagonist's actions and the logic of the resolution. The environment effectively constrains the work Maren must do.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.3)
    Atmosphere is palpable; the wet stone, rain, and overgrown garden are not just backdrop but active participants in the theme of erosion vs. persistence. The sensory details ("wind through bronze bells") ground the abstract philosophical debate in a specific physical reality. The setting actively pressures the logic of the "footprints" method.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific sensory details like the "salt-crusted boards" and the "submerged concord" grounding the fantasy elements. The atmosphere of twilight on a dead reef effectively mirrors the thematic transition from war to life.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "iron cancer" and "steam and rust" establish a functional, if slightly derivative, post-apocalyptic atmosphere. The phonograph cylinders provide a specific, tactile grounding element, though the broader wasteland setting feels generic and does not uniquely constrain the characters' choices beyond basic survival context.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific imagery of "temporal strata" and "warped titanium." The sensory details of the supernova and the "probabilistic ghost" of Andromeda effectively ground the abstract premise in concrete visuals.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting creates a cohesive fable-like atmosphere with images like the "brass sky," though physical constraints are decorative rather than visceral. Details like "breath forming crystals that tinkled" strain credibility, functioning as aesthetic ornamentation rather than environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.5)
    The whispering gallery is rendered with evocative, sensory details ("stone ear," "dusty skylights") that ground the abstract concept of "walking words." The atmosphere of the "interregnum" is palpable, blending the decay of the old order with the quiet potential of the new. However, the "nomadic penumbra" remains a somewhat abstract description of the city outside rather than a tangible environmental pressure within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptional, functioning as both a physical space and a psychological mirror that actively participates in the closure. The "mountain that breathed paper" and the "mercury-glass" skin are vivid, high-concept details that charge the final image of refraction. The environment effectively constrains and then reflects the character's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is masterfully utilized; the "frozen rain" and "woven hush" aren't just atmospheric but constrain the action (allowing the work) and charge the final image of time resuming. The sensory details ("silver needles," "moth-eaten") are vivid and thematically integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.5)
    The setting is not merely a backdrop but the antagonist and the resolution mechanism combined. The acoustic physics of the canyon (rhyming echoes) constrain the protagonist's choices and shape the theme. The tactile details of the "smooth and yellowed" bone ground the high-concept fantasy effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the acid sea and the workshop are not just backdrops but active pressures. The "between breaths held underwater" constraint is excellent, acting as a micro-setting that dictates the pacing and creates immediate physical stakes. This integration of environmental hazard with narrative time earns a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting acts as a crucial constraint; the cave's vastness defeats the easel, forcing the protagonist to interact with the micro-setting (shells). This integration of environment and tactical choice is exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sensory details are vivid ("honey-thick perfume," "salt-worn"), effectively grounding the atmosphere. However, the spatial logic at the climax fails; the physics of a scent traveling upwind or across a harbor to guide navigation strains suspension of disbelief in a story otherwise grounded in physical tasks.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, effectively blending salvaged technology with ancient mysticism to mirror the story’s themes. The specific details—fabric maps, the locked antenna, the corrosion patterns—ground the abstract concept of "reverse migration" in tactile, credible reality.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptional; the instability of the "hanging orchard" and "rope bridges" physically constrains the action and mirrors the psychological fragility. Specific details like the "hemp ladder" and "storm-churned soil" ground the speculative elements.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    The "opal dock" and "nautical twilight" create a vivid, specific atmosphere that serves the story's liminal themes well. The sensory details of the mist and the dampness effectively ground the scene, though the opening simile ("mist like a question mark") feels slightly overwrought compared to the stronger descriptions that follow.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the juxtaposition of the rising creek and the impossible underground garden creates a vivid, dreamlike atmosphere. Specific details like the "luminescent fungi" and "clusters of midnight-blue orchids" effectively ground the magical realism.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmosphere is strong with vivid sensory details like "air tasted of copper" and "bleeding starlight." The score is held back by the inconsistent naming of the central location (ember vs. cobalt), which blurs specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    The atmosphere is the piece's strongest asset, with the nautilus shell and "ember nexus" providing a vivid, tactile grounding for the abstract magic. The imagery consistently supports the tone, though the "copper light" and "twilight" verge on common atmospheric tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting is the story's strongest anchor, effectively blending the tactile (birch bark, deer sinew, curling edges) with the conceptual. The specific materials of the scroll ground the sci-fi premise in a vivid, earthy reality that enhances the atmosphere. However, the cabin itself remains somewhat generic beyond these specific props.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is rendered with high specificity, using the "Byzantine clepsydra" and "occluded windows" to ground the atmosphere in tactile detail. These elements effectively constrain the scene’s lighting and focus, supporting the "trembling calm" tone without becoming generic.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.9)
    Atmosphere is the piece's strongest asset, establishing a vivid "breath between storms" mood. Sensory details like "frost on winter glass" function well, though the floating island setting remains somewhat standard genre furniture that frames rather than constrains the tactical action.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Atmosphere is excellent; the "dust and decades" and the specific sensory details (Brahms mixed with Billie Holiday) ground the scene. The perfume bottle serves as a strong micro-setting anchor that constrains the manifestation effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    The library is rendered with some striking imagery ("origami made of centuries," helical shelves) that effectively establishes a surreal atmosphere. However, the setting remains largely visual and abstract; the piece lacks the tactile, sensory grounding needed to make the metaphysical elements feel physically present.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting acts as an antagonist and a tool; the "razor-straight" horizon and the specific mechanics of the hydraulic clocks constrain the action and charge the final imagery. The contrast between the "hammered steel" fjord and the "rippling silk" of manipulated time creates a vivid, tangible atmosphere that supports the surreal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    The bioluminescent environment is rendered with specific, atmospheric detail that actively serves the theme. The setting works as a necessary catalyst for the protagonist's realization about permeability.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    The rainwashed library is rendered with distinct sensory authority ("sea of grey June water," "clouded mica pane"), anchoring the mood effectively. The mica lantern functions as a crucial micro-setting element that constrains the climax, integrating perfectly with the action.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is integral, not just atmospheric; the specific detail of wetting a finger with condensation from the tunnel pipes to play the instrument is a brilliant integration of environment and action. This constraint—using the tunnel's "sweat" to make music—elevates the scene to the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    The specific details of the walnut ink and the atmospheric setting of the jetty are strong and grounded. The sensory environment supports the tone well, though the setting functions more as a backdrop than a source of constraint or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the ivy-choked station serves as an effective objective correlative for the characters' internal neglect and resilience. The physical details of the station ground the abstract themes of the narrative, providing necessary atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.3)
    The sensory environment is the story's strongest asset; "chiropteran frequencies" and "moth-wing percussion" create a vivid, constraint-based setting for a blind protagonist. The ultrasonic landscape actively shapes the POV's perception, satisfying the requirement for setting to constrain choice/experience. Anchors are solid.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting of Kepler Station is vividly rendered through specific details like the "sideways tug" and drifting coffee. The concept of the "margin between drafts" provides a unique spatial and conceptual location. The "heavier on Tuesdays" line leans slightly into whimsy, but the atmosphere generally supports the cerebral stakes well.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting is established with stock imagery ("scattered diamonds," "silver under the full moon") that feels decorative rather than pressure-inducing. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the light show rather than a constraining force.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with sensory details like "ochre pigments" and the "limestone cave" grounding the scene. The isolation of the archive effectively pressures the protagonist's introspection and final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting acts as a vital third character, actively constraining choices by mirroring the protagonists' neural states (discord vs. harmony). The "auric lagoon" and "trembling ribbons" provide a specific, immersive lexicon that charges the final image of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    The shifting container labyrinth is vivid, spatially coherent, and integrates well with the electromagnetic storm concept. The acoustic properties of the setting are effectively woven into the protagonist's navigation method.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.5)
    The atmospheric details ("cobalt dock," "bruised light") effectively set a moody tone. However, the spatial logistics of the shutter shadows are difficult to visualize, blurring the scene's physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cobalt library is rendered with excellent sensory specificity ("blue-tinted windows," "thickening mist"). The setting actively supports the mood and serves as a thematic mirror for the "quiet rebellion," grounding the abstract concept in physical detail.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is vivid, with specific details like the "sublittoral fringe" and "scrimshaw" anchoring the scene. However, the environment serves mostly as a backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint that forces the characters' hands.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    The &quot;renewable indifference&quot; of the turbines effectively charges the setting with thematic meaning, externalizing the emotional hush. The shadow of the turbines creates a claustrophobic atmosphere that pressures the characters' choices. The driftwood and dried flowers serve as effective, tactile anchors for the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with the cobalt light and humming quartz creating a cohesive atmosphere. The environment actively connects to the magic system (amplifying thoughts), which is a strength. However, descriptors occasionally veer into the generic ("ancient porcelain") or overly precious.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and actively shapes the narrative, particularly through the plant arrangements acting as a necessary navigational tool rather than just backdrop. The sensory details effectively ground the "phoenix aftermath" atmosphere, making the environment integral to the protagonist's specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "laboratory of lost sounds" is rendered with excellent sensory specificity, particularly the acoustic details of "catches in breath" and "unconscious harmony." The environment actively supports the premise, though the reliance on the lamp's "golden shadows" feels slightly repetitive in establishing atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.5)
    The observatory setting provides a vivid, atmospheric backdrop with specific details like "green with age" copper and "blackened" fingers. While atmospheric, the setting functions mostly as a thematic mirror rather than a constraint that forces specific tactical choices. The "outside time" aspect is established but remains largely ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    The atmospheric details—the rain-beaded skylight, the onyx-ink cards—effectively establish a mood of urban noir and mystery. However, the setting primarily serves as a backdrop; the environment does not constrain the characters' choices or heighten the immediate pressure of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.1)
    Atmosphere is consistent, but descriptions rely on genre abstractions ("colors that had no names," "defied architecture") rather than specific, grounding details. The "bronze prism" is a strong anchor, but the interior lacks distinct sensory texture beyond the visual.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is established with vivid, atmospheric imagery ("glass petals," "liquid starlight") that anchors the reader in the specific reality of the archive. The spatial relationship between the library and the clouds is clear and effectively utilized for the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmospheric details (mist, lantern light, cold air) ground the scene well, but the imagery leans on standard literary tropes ("stars pierced the darkness," "shimmering stillness"). While functional, the setting descriptions sometimes feel decorative rather than constraining the protagonist's choices in a tactile way.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the "meteor hush" is not just flavor but the condition that enables the protagonist's method. The sensory details of the tower—the coffee rings, the frosted hourglass, the dawn light—are vivid and constraining, grounding the magical elements in a tangible reality.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.0)
    The physical grounding of the projection booth is solid, with specific details like the brass rail and rusted metal box. However, the atmosphere relies partly on stock imagery ("dust motes," "static electricity") rather than fresh, character-specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is established with vivid, if occasionally purple, sensory imagery ("ribbons of green and violet," "writhed like painted breath") that creates a coherent atmosphere. However, phrases like "unmarked seasons" and "unwritten calendar" feel like ornamental insertions rather than integrated world-building elements that constrain character choice. The archway provides a solid spatial anchor, though the "tundra" remains largely a visual backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the "dune that bloomed... in twelve locations" offering a specific, imaginative constraint that dictates Maren's physical behavior (eyes half-closed). The sensory details are vivid and the quantum mechanics are integrated well into the physical environment.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific sensory details like "brass canopy" and "pneumatic vines." The focus on auditory cues (titanium bamboo's whine vs. steel mahogany's resonance) effectively grounds the fantastical environment in a consistent physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is atmospheric and serves the liminal nature of the story, though it leans heavily on familiar tropes like mist, twilight, and foam. The Ridgeway provides a functional stage for the action, but the sensory details often feel generic to the genre.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    The wobbly piano bench bolt is an excellent micro-setting detail that physically constrains the character and unlocks specific memories. The fortress atmosphere is vivid and consistently applied, pressing in on the characters. The setting feels lived-in and damaged, supporting the post-siege context.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is established with competent but generic fantasy markers ("impossible light," "fold between moments," "constellation-leather"). While the atmosphere is cohesive, the environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices; the library provides every tool needed without friction or scarcity.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with vivid sensory details like "edges yellow with salt air" and "white as bone" effectively grounding the speculative premise in a tangible, decaying reality.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the tactile contrast between the cold, sharp industrial debris and the ancient, humming stone creates a vivid texture. The "glass crunching beneath her bare feet" is a specific, sensory detail that grounds the abstract "stargazer" concept in a physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid, sensory-rich ("sulfurous waters," "bioluminescent fungi"), and functionally integral to the plot. The environment constrains and enables the action, grounding the mystical elements in a tangible, geological reality.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.5)
    The juxtaposition of the thriving arboretum against the obsolete lighthouse effectively mirrors the protagonist's resilience. However, some descriptions lean into cliché ("salt-kissed air") rather than fresh, sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.0)
    Exceptional integration of setting as a dynamic constraint; the contracting library physically forces the protagonist's choices and mirrors the thematic stakes. The sensory details ("salt-crusted windows," "desperate wings") are vivid and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    The environment actively pressures the protagonist; the wind acts as a clock by erasing the ink, while the post-eclipse glare punishes Kael's specific physiology. The setting is not just a backdrop but an active participant that forces the pace of the investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is rendered with strong sensory specificity, from "nitrogen-frosted glass" to the "crystalline stairs," effectively grounding the abstract stakes in physical reality. The atmosphere of insulation and "dizzying quiet" exerts a palpable pressure on the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the glass dome and specific plants (desert rose) constrain the interaction and provide the tools for Mira's resistance. Sensory details (amber light, cordite, hydraulics) effectively contrast the two worlds (nurture vs. hunt). The environment feels lived-in and specifically repurposed.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.4)
    The "sound wave garden" is an exceptionally realized setting, blending physics with surrealism in a way that dictates narrative logic (gravity shifts requiring the spike). The environment is not just a backdrop but an active participant that shapes the protagonist's tools and tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.0)
    The observatory is not merely a backdrop but the primary lens through which the protagonist processes the conflict; the copper instruments, the dome, and the "whispers" ground the abstract logic in tangible, atmospheric detail. The setting actively shapes the "orbit of regret" metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sensory details are vivid and specific, particularly "smelled of moth wings and rust" and the "crystalline suspension" of sounds. The laboratory feels distinct and atmospheric. The setting effectively mirrors the internal state of the protagonist, grounding the speculative elements.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    The grotto's atmosphere is vivid, with acoustics and mist playing central roles in the scene's pressure. However, a significant material inconsistency undermines the physical reality: the artist uses "chalk" on a "stone floor" in the setup, but the climax describes a "sand mandala" and a "structure in the sand."

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is established with vivid imagery, particularly the "fractured dome" and the tactile details of the tesserae. The atmosphere of ruined majesty is strong, though the specific nature of the "fractured sky" remains slightly abstract, hovering between sci-fi and metaphor without firm grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.2)
    The theater and orchard are established, but the descriptions lean heavily on stock imagery ("velvet curtains," "ancient apple trees"). While the synesthetic details add color, the setting does not constrain the protagonist's choices; the maze, intended to confuse, offers no resistance to Margaux, functioning as a backdrop rather than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    The light painting studio is vivid and integral to the story's mechanism; the environment actively shapes the "somatic marker" method and grounds the abstract concept.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral, acting as both the antagonist and the partner in the scene. Sensory details like "warmth gradients" and the "serpentine channels" ground the abstract concept of emotional mapping effectively. The environment actively constrains Maren’s perception, which is a strong use of setting.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with vivid sensory details ("honey-colored panels," "cracked teacups") that effectively ground the abstract premise in a tactile reality. The atmosphere of preserved time is well-established, though the environment functions more as a container than an active pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    The bluff and the melting snow provide a vivid visual anchor. However, the recurring "silver hush" and somewhat purple descriptions ("tilt of the earth") feel decorative rather than integrated into the action's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    Atmosphere is tangible and functional; the "rain gutters" serving as a timer is a brilliant integration of setting and structure. The environment actively mirrors the internal state—fog for confusion, stars for clarity/punctuation—which charges the final image effectively. The sensory details (dripping, ticking, rustling) create a vivid, claustrophobic texture.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.7)
    The setting is atmospherically consistent but relies on generic "soft apocalypse" tropes (burnt sky, distant settlements). The sensory experience is dulled by the repetitive use of the word "thrum" (four times in a short text) to describe the atmosphere, which flattens the specificity of the oasis.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.1)
    The verticality of the fire escapes and the specific constraint of darkness forcing the mirror mechanic are excellent. The setting actively shapes the protagonist's tactics (using mirrors to catch harbor light), satisfying the "setting constrains choice" requirement for high marks.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is highly distinct and tactile, with "atomically reflective walls" and the "tidal" nature of the books actively shaping the imagery. The physical environment (the sundial casting no shadow above the clouds) integrates tightly with the thematic realization.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptional; the temple and the nest installation are not mere backdrops but active constraints that frame the narrative and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sensory anchoring is strong, with details like "fillings ache" and "charts... suspended in a moment of weightlessness" effectively grounding the cosmic stakes in the immediate physical setting.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmospheric detail is strong, particularly the lighting and the "pooled" darkness. The "spatial mutiny" concept is well-grounded in the physical space, though the mechanics of the organ-shifting floor lean heavily into unexplained fantasy.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.9)
    The quarry setting is vividly rendered and effectively mirrors the theme of dormancy and memory. The atmosphere supports the mood well, though the setting acts more as a backdrop than an active constraint on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "violet clouds," "snow that fell upward," and "singing frequencies" create a vivid, surreal constraint that justifies the metaphysical plot. The environment actively pressures the characters and makes the concept of "wound-doors" plausible within the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "wet-plate" glass flake and rusted station wagon offer specific, grounding details, though the description veers into abstraction ("quantum vibration," "rendered in some new spectrum") that distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptional; the rusted circus train serving as a ranger station provides a vivid, specific constraint that shapes the atmosphere and dialogue. The integration of the foreign currency as "gallery art" on the curved walls effectively anchors the backstory in the physical environment.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    The observatory setting is established with strong sensory details ("dome opened like an eye," "desiccated daylily") that support the atmosphere. The integration of the celestial and the personal is handled well, though the environment acts more as a backdrop than a constraint on choices.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and active; "roots drinking black water" and the "perpetual cyclone" constrain movement and establish a dreamlike logic that supports the plot. The environment is not just a backdrop but a physical force Maren must navigate and counteract.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.6)
    The cobalt glade provides a cohesive atmosphere, though descriptions like "bruised purples" and "defiant spirals" lean toward generic fantasy aesthetics. The setting responds to the characters at the end, which is a nice touch, but the environment functions more as a backdrop than a pressure cooker that constrains choices.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.4)
    The catacomb orchard is not merely atmospheric; its logic (fruit growing from rot) provides the thematic solution to the protagonist's conflict. The integration of setting and story logic is seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    The "drafty quarry office" and "aluminum box" provide a stark, sensory-rich backdrop that mirrors the protagonist’s crumbling reputation. Specific details like the "rust holes" (despite a slight semantic slip regarding "puncture") and the limestone dust firmly anchor the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting offers vivid imagery of the floating arbor, but the logic falters with the description of magnetic fields being "older than cuneiform" in a forty-year-old garden, creating timeline confusion. While atmospheric, the environment serves as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraints or pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's standout feature, blending the mechanical (gears) with the organic (tides) to create a vivid, specific atmosphere. The sensory details of the melting IDs and the moon-silvered water are excellent, though the score is capped at 8.8 per the Q2 threshold rule.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with the crystal cave's interaction with the flashlight beam providing strong atmospheric grounding. The environment feels tangible, though the transition to "glowing" magical realism at the end is abrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmosphere is vivid and specific, successfully grounding the abstract themes in the "cathedral of green silence" and the silver-taped accordion. The setting details (ivy, shattered windows) effectively mirror the protagonist's internal state without feeling purely decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "propagation delays" concept introduces an intriguing sci-fi rigidity to the magical setting. However, atmospheric details often rely on genre clichés ("shimmered between states," "tasted of... forgotten names") rather than distinct, grounding sensory specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.1)
    The specific contents of the rope (fulgurite, birch map) are vivid and grounding. However, the opening image of a "golden dock" radiating warmth in winter is physically confusing—likely visual, but phrased as tactile heat—and the "oceanic hush" leans into atmospheric generalization rather than sharp, sensory particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is the story's strongest asset; the shadowed garden and the details of the thread and roses effectively externalize the internal states. The atmosphere is vivid and consistently supports the tone without overwhelming the narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting contains vivid visual details ("obsidian lagoon," "reverse stars"), but the atmosphere is marred by the mechanical repetition of unique descriptors ("kelp-drift peace"), which breaks immersion and feels ornamental rather than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.3)
    The setting is atmospheric, with specific details like the "constellation pattern" of dry basins and the "stained glass box" anchoring the scene. While evocative, some descriptions lean into "magic city" tropes (buildings sharing secrets) rather than fresh, singular observation.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.5)
    The nebula garden is vividly realized with specific sensory details ("luminous flowers," "ionized gas"), anchoring the fable-like tone effectively. However, the setting serves primarily as a static backdrop for the lesson rather than a source of pressure or tactical constraint that forces choices.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is tactile, vivid, and causally integrated; the "marble lungs pulling brine" and "scales dressed in anemones" ground the fantasy in visceral reality. The environment acts as evidence, not just backdrop, with the foxglove ampoule serving as a critical micro-setting element that anchors the revelation. This category is the story's strongest asset.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.0)
    The Escher-esque staircase is a functional, if standard, metaphorical space that mirrors the protagonist's loop; the "sourceless light" is a bit generic. However, the tactile focus on the dice—"stone cold," "chipped along its fourth edge"—effectively grounds the surrealism. The physical properties of the objects anchor the scene well against the abstract backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    The greenhouse setting is vivid and acts as a crucible, trapping the character with her work while the moon provides the necessary resource (light).

    Summit crater micro-setting constrains every move—tripod placement, vial angles, retreat route. Moonlit pallor and windless silence are filtered through Chen’s mineralogical eye; luminescent blooms provide tactile contrast that charges the final photochemical burn. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from crater center to safe ridge. Environment literally collapses into the image, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.1)
    The depot is not backdrop but instrument: copper pipes become diagnostic tools, mist becomes refractive medium, horn blasts become clock. Water features function as microscope, spectrometer, and emotional barometer—every sluice and temperature shift constrains her next hand motion. Micro-setting (the drone’s lens, the basin’s meniscus) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies and objects never float.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is more than postcard: the outpost’s rust, the glass pane as reading surface, the ice thickness dictating drill timing all constrain action. Falcon, beacon, phrasebook supply micro-setting texture that loops into plot. Sensory hierarchy remains Mira-centric—she cares about moisture geometry more than vistas, so detail is filtered through vocation. Frozen lake reappears in the final image as the cost surface she must cross, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    Selective sensory triangulation—amber light on ebony fork, wild hush, cobblestone pulse—grounds the ghost-town texture without tourist catalog. The fork functions as micro-setting: its material note constrains every tactical stop and charges the final bell strike. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the square, tower, arch. Environment does not yet constrain a character choice at 9+ level, capping at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kelp-shrouded limestone and red-flashing gauge are handled, not catalogued; the vial’s shifting surface becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as Mara hauls Chen through collapsing pillars toward the sub hatch. Environment mirrors internal pressure: temple “dissolving back into the patient ocean” charges the Earned Stasis. One hairline slip: “gathered hush” is named but not given acoustic or tactile specificity until late.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse is sketched with salt-scabbed walls, copper dawn, and chapel rot—sparse but sensorily weighted. The impossible architecture (nested rooms, descending stairs that climb) is not ornamental; it literalizes the theme of “sustaining impossibilities” and physically corners Matthias into his final choice. Spatial choreography stays coherent even while geometry breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    The greenhouse functions as micro-setting: glass fogged, silver apples, mercury-rose scent all constrain what can happen; only burial in its soil can restart dawn. Winter-cracked fields outside mirror the stalled season inside, charging the final thaw. Spatial choreography is clean—door, aisle, oldest tree, soil. The setting’s rule (endless night) is broken by the specific act, so the environment directly shapes the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    Red canyon walls, copper needle, and waxed-cloth plate are tactile, bias-filtered through weaver’s maritime eye (“veins of precious metal”). The labyrinth’s cracked stone and dawn light constrain logistics: thread visibility depends on angle of sun, forcing dawn work. Micro-setting qualifies: the needle and silk-wrapped stones act as portable geography that alters later travelers’ paths. Final image—threads turning stone to rose gold—charges closure under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    The catacomb ceiling roots “seeking the bones below” act as both literal ceiling and metaphysical constraint, guiding Miriam’s decision to preserve rather than extract. Apple blossom pressed at the end recharges every white petal seen earlier, turning floral snow into sacramental currency. Spatial choreography is flawless: sundial base size matches pedestal, pruning shears reappear as action tool, lamp borrowed/returned, all tracked without drift. Environment charges final image; without the orchard-into-bones logic the renunciation would lose its transworld resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    The golden arcade’s brass columns and amber ceiling are re-used, tactile, and fate-bearing: the same mail slot that once romanticized birthday cards now risks maternal identity. Children’s chalk codes convert floor tesserae into living cipher, literally steering the send/don’t-send choice. Micro-setting—mailbox 47B mouth felt against palm—crystallizes the final image. No description excess; every sensory hit advances stake or tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cobalt walls, copper-green dome, and rotating-flame beacon are not backdrop: the dome’s color signals age, the flame’s gas line is the covert channel, the courtyard’s acoustics let her eavesdrop. Velvet, needle, and eternal candle act as micro-settings that constrain posture and timing. Autumn wind and dawn light evolve—from first sentence to last—mirroring her narrowing window. The Archive Vault beneath the floorboards is named only at the climax, but its existence is foreshadowed by “original star charts,” so the final image of rewritten cosmology lands with spatial coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mangrove labyrinth and moonlit shard function as micro-setting that literally enables the ritual; spatial choreography is clean (houseboat window, shard dragged through droplets). Sensory selection skews to sound (spirits) and touch (warm stone), reflecting perceptual urgency. Setting constrains exit—only the labyrinth keeps the spirits’ song audible, hence the healing possible. Final image of fading condensation recharges the stakes: the place lets the encounter evaporate, underlining impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    The atrium’s glass ceiling, fog, and hospital-gurney body form a micro-setting that literally channels Maricel’s narrowed perception; the coral fragment finally “charges the final image” by becoming the map she will follow. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ruined orchard district is not postcard backdrop; its fog governs what pigments Mara must use, what light she can harvest, and therefore how she can rediscover joy. Micro-setting objects—cracked plaster, phosphorescent jars, the studio wall—literally constrain her next brushstroke. Spatial choreography is clean: fragment propped, wall painted, glow reflected back onto fragment. Final image of ancient dancer seeming to leap again is charged by the very environment she has created.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sound-wave garden’s parabolic dishes and bronze chimes are returned to twice, constraining attention and finally making the exposed fresco “breathe,” satisfying the 9+ gate. Pigment chemistry, scaffolding height, and coin crack give tactile anchors; spatial choreography remains coherent. Selective sensory economy (sound over visual catalog) mirrors Lena’s narrowing perception under mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Greenhouse humidity, cork-board Morphos, and peppercorn-rattle acoustics are filtered through Elias’s rogue-scholar sensorium—sight, sound, touch guide choices. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: elephant-ear threshold, butterfly vortex, circle formation; no impossible positions. The greenhouse is micro-setting par excellence: its iridescent insects literally become the communication channel that constrains tactics and charges the final image. Sensory economy favors immediacy—no tourist catalog—while peppercorn scent and dew on radish rows ground the covert botanic encryption.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.1)
    The shell is not backdrop but breathing constraint: its spiral dictates where she walks, where verses are wedged, how sound escapes at dawn. The galaxy postcard functions as micro-setting—held, tilted, re-tilted—its star-origin re-prices her earthly insomnia. Reef-shadow light is a tactile filter that shapes what she can see and therefore write. Environment, tool, and body converge in the final image: shell-mouth, postcard-galaxy, poet’s hand—impossible to swap without collapsing the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Opal walls and glass orchids function as micro-setting: their prismatic fragility mirrors the choice to keep the crack. Light refracts “like slow thoughts,” charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; watering can tilt angle, chime hook, workstation form a triangle of action. Setting constrains choice—repair lab exists, yet she refuses it—so opal library is not postcard but tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    The archive’s dust, lamplight on obsidian, and mineral scent are filtered through an obsessed linguist’s selective attention. The glass ink well functions as micro-setting: handled thrice, its prismatic flashes echo the “symphonies” and charge the final hand-link image. Spatial choreography is flawless—desk, stairs, parchment, hands track cleanly. Only the cavern-origin line feels like a museum tag; it doesn’t constrain present action.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is not backdrop but tool: the volcanic steam channels literally constrain her redesign options, while the basalt ribs metaphor mirrors her own pressured stance. Brass chain links grow warm against skin, integrating body, tool, and rock into one micro-environment. Sensory hierarchy obeys her surveyor gaze—she notices mineral deposits before fresco color. The breathing mountain charges the final image, making refusal to choose catastrophe impossible.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Attic air-currents, skylight beam, and dust galaxies function as micro-setting that literally steers her attention and supplies the mapping method that reframes identity. Spatial choreography is flawless; the meteorite’s placement on the sill is a tactile, lived-in navigation of the same beams. Environment thus constrains the final choice, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    The drifting-prism terrace functions as both macro-setting and micro-setting: its impossible surface forces the survivors to invent new spatial intuitions, and the oak rail’s grain becomes the tactile map Mara navigates. The logbook and the rail are recurring objects whose altered states (her annotation, the compressed ring) directly shape the final choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: Mara’s carpenter-eye reads wood before void.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    The curved water of the dome, eddying feather, and breathing spires create a tactile, viscous environment that constrains vision and movement; the facility’s “pressurized warren” later justifies the donning of suits. Sensory selection favors visual luminosity, but the omission of sound or pressure on skin under-utilizes the underwater premise at key beats. Spatial choreography is clean: feather, window, monitors, doorway, suits track without drift. The final image of swimming fireflies re-uses the water medium to charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    The iridescent geode is not backdrop but instrument: light refraction steers her mood and the crater-glass physically enables the revelation. Micro-setting—the vials’ weight in her palm, the glass smooth as memory—constrains her speed and posture under time pressure. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel, uncork, drop, climb; no floating bodies. Environment charges the final image as the cave’s pulsing light becomes the visible archive of what almost was.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tidal arcade is vividly sensed—salt-corroded arches, star-freckled LEDs, kelp drag across Victorian columns—and the four-hour countdown actively compresses Mara’s tactics. Body-as-setting appears in callus-reading and the warm bishop against her hip; both objects constrain her choices and recharge in the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean across the 200 m performer array. One micro-slip: “constellation-bright LEDs” drifts toward poetic overlap; still, the setting never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Crystalline petals and gravity generators are sketched in motion, never catalogued; orbital garden remains slightly abstract but always filtered through dancer’s proprioception. The moonstone speck works as micro-setting that literally enters and rewrites her bloodstream, satisfying the 9+ constraint. Spatial choreography is maintained—kneel, rise, final pose—so the body itself becomes the set. Twilight under stars is atmospheric but static; it could have pressed harder (oxygen limits, orbital rotation) yet serves as mirror for memory’s last light.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prism atrium functions as micro-setting that constrains the final epiphany: the broken glass panels literalize “finding light in what others dismissed” and their reflected pillars bend the interference patterns Martin reads. Mist, dawn light, and still pond are selectively filtered through glazier’s eye for fracture and transparency. Spatial choreography is clean—stone splash → rings → pillar reflections → edge disappearance. Environment directly charges the closure image; meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Moonlit ridge, charred stumps, porcelain box, and bodily scars are rendered through Marcus’s fire-watcher gaze; each constrains his path and charges the final image. Selective sensory triage (silver light on scar tissue, white aspens) mirrors internal renewal without slipping into postcard excess. Spatial choreography holds as he walks, stops, descends.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tide-polished grotto functions as micro-setting: every shell/glass shard constrains where the next can be placed, and the gauge’s calcite hook literally limits her reach until she unhooks it. Bioluminescent algae and brass gleam provide sensory hierarchy filtered through Mira’s engineer-poet gaze. Spatial choreography is immaculate—needle, tide, pattern tableaux tracked without drift. The 9.0 gate is missed only because the environ-body-tool fusion is so complete it borders on symbolic convenience; still, the gauge’s final re-pricing is inseparable from its physical perch.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ivy as living circuitry, sodden ash flashing into preserved film—these tactile specifics anchor the fantastical premise without exposition dump. Micro-setting (marble hearth, leather satchel) doubles as tool and memory trigger, constraining how Maya can extract clues. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and acoustic texture, matching cartographer POV. Final ivy “exhale” recharges the environmental motif so it participates in closure instead of decorating it.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prism parapet and rain-slick terrace function as micro-setting: their refractive surface literally enables Vesper’s method and returns in the final scattering of mirages, charging the closure image. Sensory detail is selective—droplets as “tiny worlds,” bronze bells rolling—anchored to Vesper’s artist-perceiver bias. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single continuous scene. Weather and architecture are not backdrop but toolkit; removing the wet stone or refracted light would break the mirage mechanics, so environment constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    The terrace’s layered scorch-marks and blood function as micro-setting that constrains tone and choice; midsummer heat presses like a second antagonist. Sensory selection stays filtered through Maren’s fatigued priorities. Spatial choreography is clean despite eight named delegates. Environment could more actively shape the final concession beat, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    The salt flat functions as both stage and antagonist: every fissure is a line Marcus drew, the alkali dust coats his gloves, the crystallized surface actually fractures under the rain he finally lets fall. Helicopter, briefcase, fossilized shell, even distant thunder are kinesthetically anchored and tracked without spatial drift. Weather is not backdrop—it’s the withheld commodity he weaponized, so when it arrives it rewrites the setting itself. Meets 9+ gate: environment literally “charges the final image” as the footprint-shaped map washes away.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silver courtyard, starlit snow, and prism sanctuary are not postcard scenery—they constrain movement and perception; the crystalline pavilion literally frames her access to the web. Micro-setting (her silk robe hem dragging fresh snow, the prism’s refracted colors guiding her finger placement) shapes the untangling choreography. The final image recycles the “silver courtyard under snow” line as charged echo, now stripped of serenity, satisfying the setting-to-closure gate. Only hedge: “like scattered diamonds” is familiar snow glitter; it passes unnoticed amid denser particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    The decommissioned dome, campfire stick, and driftwood-carved symbols constrain his staging choices and echo the “meteor hush” tone; spatial choreography is airtight. Sensory selection skews auditory (hush, echoes) which mirrors the inward turn. The stick’s final placement beside the puppets recharges earlier performances, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is micro-constraint: altitude-defiant grotto dictates perishable bamboo and catches the monarch updraft. Tower, moth wing, and body function as tools whose physical limits shape tactics. Selective sensory triad—silver scales, blushing light, cool air—economy without checklist. Spatial choreography stays clean as Mira “adjusts another joint” while butterflies spiral in.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ice walls, aurora, and ceremonial rope function as micro-setting that literally guides the casting choreography. The aurora’s “green fire” is not backdrop—it listens, becomes an agent in the final illumination beat. Spatial tracking is immaculate; bronze pour heat vs. ice enclosure creates tactile contradiction that charges the bells’ birth. Meets 9+ gate: environmental constraints shape tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.3)
    The bunker’s ivy-mouth, amber emergency lights, and crystalline seals are tactile, selective, and filtered through her time-fractured perception. The micro-setting of the wafer seal—thin as communion bread—constrains the climax: pressing it is the only physical action that triggers transcendence. Environment and object merge to charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dusk’s fading light and shadow angles are not mood paint but functional instruments, driving the twilight reveal beat. The brass compass, camera, and clay tablets act as micro-settings that constrain method and class. Palace corridors, observatory chamber, and desert coordinates are cleanly tracked without spatial drift. Sensory economy matches the POV—she notes “fading light” and “ground resonated” while guards approach, not tourist vistas.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Sanctuary’s absolute silence is not a gimmick; it forces the characters to write light-words, turning the very air into a tactile negotiation table. Micro-setting inside the music box—brass cylinder, pins, the metallic scent of old grief—constrains Kale’s final choice: she must literally touch the broken fragment to mend it. Spatial choreography is immaculate: the box is placed, slid, wound, and finally re-forged in a clean visual arc. Environment, tool, and body triangulate to charge the closing image of the now-whole song.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    Workbench, frost, and fog form a micro-setting triad that actively constrains breathing rhythm and tool manipulation. The calcified orchard’s silver bark and petrified fruit are re-used in the final shimmer, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is immaculate: the sextant’s pieces, the door, and the brother’s translucent edges track cleanly across the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cathedral-orchard is not mere scenery: ladder placement, rafter walkway, and blossom drift all constrain movement and timing, charging the final tableau. Specific sensory triangulation—“slanted light,” “apple blossoms landing on their joined hands”—anchors POV bias. The setting’s conversion from nave to canopy mirrors the vow-renewal theme without overt symbolism, satisfying the 9+ gate for environmental charge on the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    The astral orchard is not backdrop; its spiral chronology literally funnels her to the central pistachio tree where choice happens. Micro-setting success: the copper tub and 3-second-delay mirror are tools that precipitate insight. Crystalline starlight soil and phosphorescent fear compress atmosphere into physiology. Only hairline slip: we never feel temperature or smell—minor sensory gap.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mountain-breathing shelves, neural-path corridors, and dust-on-absent-books atlas are tactile, POV-filtered, and directly enable navigation and the final trade. No object or body part charges the exit image as decisively as the setting itself, so the 9+ gate is just missed; still, the bookstore’s organic reconfiguration supplies the decisive resource for both rescue and propagation.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Saltdust, rust, peeling paint, and mirror-variations give tactile specificity; the emerald card micro-setting constrains every move and reappears in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial track is clean—porthole → ticket booth → descending to mirrors—yet “listing slightly to starboard” is the only vestige of a ship that supposedly drifts; we get no felt motion or nautical detail to ground the promised bay/ocean threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mechanism room is tactile and specific—brass gears, copper-threaded strand, moon-cut shadows—each detail filtered through Maren’s cataloguing gaze. The ceremonial rope functions as micro-setting that literally constrains/permits the final choice; its material history is the lever that rewrites the building. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no orientation drift.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    Glass pavilion hums wind-through-crystal, a live instrument that guides choice—its song shifts pitch when Esme decides, turning micro-setting into actor. Star-chart overlay on city ruins gives tactile geography; “vine-choked towers” is selective, not tourist. Broken prism functions as portable setting: its internal starlight memory constrains how Esme maps the city. Weather (dawn wind) is causal, not backdrop. Spatial choreography clean: descent, bench, chamber, city spread tracked without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    The stormlit observatory is tactile: solid fog bridges creak underfoot, crystals refract lightning into retinal after-images, and the summer quill writes in palpable light. Each environmental detail is filtered through Elden’s archivist gaze—shadow angles equal temporal depth—so setting constrains her tactical choices. The final image of the quill tumbling through clouds re-weights the entire spatial metaphor: the archive is now literally above the world it remembers. Micro-setting (the central crystal’s looping shadow) directly catalyzes the conceptual repricing, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.3)
    Evening primrose catching “last amber light” and the mosaic-instruction fragments give tactile, POV-filtered specificity; the fortress itself functions as pressure—its walls force circular walking and public witness. The kerosene rag is successfully treated as micro-setting: its familiar weight alters Kael’s gait and triggers memory. Spatial tracking stays clean across the spiral path and lantern sequence. Environment could have constrained tactics even more (wind, wall height), but what is shown is vivid and selective.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Grotto ceiling as faux-constellation and the centimeter-level tide gauge constrain Chen’s perceptual authority and shape his final metaphor; environment materially guides the tactics of disclosure. Salt-thick air and mineral glitter are filtered through POV bias rather than tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless—cicada passed, bodies lean, water level logged.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    The xenial trellis and cloudvines actively constrain movement and supply the only footing during inversion; environment literally dictates her tactical swings and final stance. The porcelain doll functions as micro-setting in her shirt, charging the closing image with conceptual cost. Sensory economy is tight—cloud-bank shatter, vine texture, inverted stomach lurch—all filtered through Mira’s hyper-attentive, breath-focused POV. No static catalogs; every detail either enables action or mirrors internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prism terrace is not backdrop but instrument: refraction density guides Marco’s throttle choice mid-scene, and the rainbow lattice becomes the silent “song” that retunes Elena’s ear. Micro-setting—the storm glass vial—functions as barometer and emotional seismograph, its fern crystals foreshadowing the peace that will cost Marco his own detachment. Spatial choreography is clean: gondola, bench, rail, console, cables track without drift. Sensory hierarchy is POV-specific: operator notices decibels and crystal lattice; grieving passenger notices color and void.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    Selective sensory layering—fiber-optic waterfall cool on skin, ruby warm as blood—anchors wonder without catalog bloat. The orchard’s spiral circuitry and nebula fruit constrain action: only someone who reads dead languages can interpret the ruby’s data. Palace smart-stone seasons echo theme of painted-over truth. Micro-setting (scanner, rail-bike) tools constrain tactics and are handled on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sanctuary’s charcoal pillars and starlit ash function as micro-setting: they supply the visual grammar for burning/oxygen metaphors and constrain the ritual silence. Selective sensory focus—scars catching starlight, footprints in ash—keeps description woven through action; no white-room syndrome. The ring of melted wedding bands is concrete, tactile, and repurposed; it charges the final hand-to-hand touch. Setting never overloads; it mirrors internal state without overt symbolic declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mushroom cathedral is not backdrop; rack proximity guides her reach, luminescent pulses time her breathing, and the breach opens between physical rows she has just touched. Sub bolt’s paradoxical weight anchors the micro-setting and final image. Sensory triangulation (glow, hum, cold metal) is selective, POV-filtered, never touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sepia archive is economic yet atmospheric: vanilla dust, parquet catching slant light, brass horn catching last sun—all filtered through Cassian’s selective attention. Micro-setting objects (cylinder, crank, modified diaphragm) constrain tactics: without the crank’s weight he never tries the machine. Golden shadows evolve to violet, mirroring without announcing his darkening knowledge. Spatial choreography clean; no anachronism.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    Selective sensory triangulation—silver-singing apples, humming gold, gauntlet-warm paper—keeps description lean yet speculative. Alchemical rules (“factually mystical… documented in ledgers”) anchor world logic without expo dump. Setting actively guides choice: darkness forces strange fruit, the orchard reshapes into amphitheater, branches become stage wings. Spatial choreography stays crisp even during reality-shifts; distances and body positions track.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    The file room operates as micro-setting: dust thickness, manila scent, and metal shelves directly guide discovery (“dust patterns…creating faint pathways”). The brass button functions as portable setting/handled tool; its tarnish constrains later action—she archives it as evidence. Spatial choreography is tight; no geography drift. Era details (1867–75 placement chaos) are filtered through POV’s archival priorities, lending credibility without exposition dump.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.6)
    Auric lagoon is not backdrop; its mineral shimmer is the only reason puddle-maps can exist, so setting literally generates the plot. The forgotten cable vault under the rocks is a micro-setting that constrains final choice—she must hide or be caught. Starlight, tide, and searchlight choreograph spatial tension; no geography drift. Sensory filter is POV-biased toward survival: she notes “golden water” only as a data surface, not scenery.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prism-atrium is not mere scenery; its light refraction directly responds to the anti-melody, physically enacting the silence Marcus engineers and thus charging the final image; the tool-obeys-music rule taught early and paid off at closure satisfies the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.1)
    “Ashen skyborne arbor” and “perpetual twilight” anchor immediately; the floating tree’s bark, copper light, and falling leaves are tactile, lived-in, and filter through Miren’s taxonomic gaze. The setting subtly guides choice—only from the oldest branch can the moonstone speck be accessed—charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    The subterranean waterfall, mossy tool racks, and swirling leaves in the skeletal greenhouse are not postcard backdrops—they guide access (hidden door revealed only when leaves part), supply cleaning spray (mist keeps rust at bay), and mirror Marcus’s internal drift. The compass rose itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice, its spinning needle charging the last image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (tinkerer notices gears, not botany). Spatial choreography is flawless: three-level descent, crack-to-mist path, leaf-parting threshold all track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    The foundry’s “steaming puddles reflecting firelight” is returned to three times, each time with a different emotional tint—urgent labor, lonely exhaustion, final beacon—so the micro-setting constrains her stamina and later offers homing light. The zodiac coin itself operates as portable setting: its crack tracks spatially in tongs, silk, palm, chest, charging every transfer with heat or weight. Spatial choreography is flawless—bellows, crucible, bench, door—no impossible body positions. Weather (rain patter) is not backdrop but active opponent that keeps the forge laboring, hence counts as environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gorge is not backdrop but acoustic crucible: its limestone walls return laughter re-weighted, forcing Kael’s tactic shift. Micro-setting objects—the warped harp frame and the heating tooth—constrain tuning choices and signal proximity to soul. Spatial choreography is clean: switchbacks, outcropping, narrowest point track without drift. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: dawn light, fog, stone memory, then sound as working medium.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.1)
    The forest’s harmonic ratios are not backdrop but prosthetic: the 120-degree tree angles literally dampen her augmented nerve pain, forcing her to stay. The pewter mask strap micro-shifts from interrogation scar to gardening tool, charging the final image when both masks lie together in the loam.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alchemist’s market is immediate: rope bridges sway “with each transaction,” starlight is sold in bottles. The lens fragment functions as micro-setting, constraining Mira’s gaze and literally refracting what can be known. Sensory hierarchy favors the visual, but it is POV-justified—translator as watcher. Final image of rainbow across “forgotten names” reuses the elevated vantage established in paragraph one, so spatial choreography stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ticket office is sketched with sensory economy (“warped counter…exhaled must”) that doubles as body-attention filter for an elevator tech who notices air shifts. Dust-pattern micro-setting directly enables the pivotal discovery, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean: chair drag → climb → tile lift → box cradle; no floating geography. Circus referents (carousel, sequined leotard) evoke era without museum dump; fluorescent death sets temporal anchor and auditory zero-hour.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Glass orchard, pneumatic dock, crystalline branches—every anchor is sensuous, tacticle, and skewed to POV’s librarian sight. The setting itself becomes the constraint that fractures; when frost letters crawl, the world-rule is rewritten in real time. Micro-setting (bottled breath, press bed) charges the final image. Orientation is taught by word 30.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Environment (asteroid corridors) and object (crystal shard) directly constrain interpretation choices; shard’s facets “refract time-light into prismatic ghosts,” charging the final image. Baroque spirals act as micro-setting that guides Kasimir’s eye and argument, their “frozen water finding its level” mirroring his emotional surrender. Sensory economy: amber light, gilt edges, visible time-threads—select, purposeful, filtered through ex-revolutionary aesthete perception. Spatial choreography clean; no headcount confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    Resonance chamber functions as micro-setting: its acoustic properties actively supply the interference pattern that lets Aldric reverse the transmutation. Spatial choreography stays clean; “sound folded back upon itself” is vivid and purposeful, anchoring the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    Environment is protagonist: the limestone cathedral, phosphorescent water, and resonant hush literally narrow her options to immersion or retreat. The compass-as-lodestone and collection vials function as micro-setting that constrains every beat; removing them would collapse the plot. Sensory selection is POV-true—Mara catalogs scent, echo, mineral breath, never tourist visuals. Final image reuses the lagoon’s glow as both cradle and abyss, charging the Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.1)
    Coastal storm debris, salt-slick granite arch, kelp-choked tunnel, and the cedar root’s “twisted chambers” are tactile, choice-guiding environments. Weather and objects (slide, root, brass frame) constrain options—she can’t drive further, must walk, must select wood that will read translucent. Micro-setting inside the arch supplies both acoustic filter and relic discovery, directly charging the final aesthetic pivot. GPS blink-out functions as temporal/technical anchor that later flips to thematic stasis, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.1)
    Amber pavilion panels act as a micro-setting: their shifting colors literalize the “hidden layers” metaphor and constrain Mara’s perception—she sees color the way the flower sees moonlight. Autumn dusk provides a live clock, darkening the glass and cueing the final insight. Sensory detail is selective (catching light like captured fire) and filtered through an artist’s eye. The postcard stack is handled, re-sorted, and re-weighted; it charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Obsidian lagoon as micro-setting directly constrains the final choice—its black non-rippling surface is the literal medium of memory transfer. Zeppelin library offers charged specificity (“copper clouds,” “gondola weighted with volumes”) that mirrors archive theme. Idiom stays consistent, no anachronisms. Spatial choreography is crystal: rope ladder, dune crest, water’s edge, driftwood messages—every move tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is built from micro-details—torn rice paper breathing, worn dock grooves, spacing of lanterns—that constrain Miranda’s speculative reconstruction. The bottle functions as portable setting, its amber interior refracting blueprints that literally shape her design choices. Final image of lanterns relit by hand re-weights the atmospheric tone from ghostly to generative. Spatial choreography stays clean across the four shard transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rooftop orchard, phonograph pavilion, and vials of coiled wax function as micro-setting—every prop is handled, never merely viewed. Apple blossoms falling without wind reweight the prophecy beat, making the garden an active participant. Spatial choreography is flawless across the two time shards.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    The icebound atrium functions as micro-setting that literally constrains every move: ice thickness dictates retreat speed, frost line sets planting circle, dome glass reframes star geometry at closure. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—metal-tasting probability, silk-and-glass texture of years—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is crisp: ice retreats in measurable rings, seed hole is center, probability fledgling orbits overhead. Setting charges the final image; clear glass vs. distorted ice mirrors the shift from stasis to randomness.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rope itself acts as micro-setting: its hemp strands, smooth patches, and vibration under palm pressure constrain Mara’s choices and charge the final image. Wind velocities, stone buttresses, and two-mile altitude are filtered through her meteorologist’s priorities, never tourist-catalogued. Spatial choreography is clean—rope, bell, console, cracked stone—across the single continuous scene. Environment evolution (storm hits, stone cracks) directly alters her physical stance and confirms cost.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    Brass fixtures, amber lantern glass, and meteor-silver function as micro-setting; the glass’s flicker in ventilation current directly triggers the closing self-recognition. Spatial choreography stays clean—deck, viewport, database console—without over-mapping. Sensory economy favors light/colour over sound, mirroring the vacuum outside. The station’s forgotten-Belt location constrains choice: no elevator, no rescue, only the option to keep polishing or suicide (she chooses polish).

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    Scorched apiary and amber-glass box both constrain choice: only the box’s translucency lets her discover the letter, only the dead hive’s silence drives her to speak. Sensory triage—crumbling cloth, crystalline wings—mirrors urgency without checklist excess. Micro-setting qualifies; environment charges the final image. Slight over-reliance on visual; still, setting materially shapes tactics and closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    The emerald glass silo, the auction-code toaster, and the numeric-less night sky are sketched with selective sensory strokes that filter through Mira’s yearning; the tower itself becomes a micro-setting that constrains her nightly ritual and is charged in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lagoon’s mirror-stillness after the drake’s exit is used to reflect Maren’s revised stance; environment charges the final image. Rain-smell and soaked canvas shoes are tactile and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography holds: kite path, drake emergence, wading line all track. The “burnished hush” risks tonal shorthand, but the sensory choice is selective and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    The temple orchard is not backdrop but active co-protagonist: porous limestone breathes, copper veins conduct, fungal lines map communication—every remodel beat rewrites the setting’s capabilities. Micro-setting inside the diary’s margins (fading ink, loose stone) and the copper wire itself function as handled tools that constrain action and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is caretaker-specific: she smells mineral breath, notes iron blooms, hears birds arrive—never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions or prop drift. Environment, tool, and recurring diary converge to enable the ending’s conceptual reprice.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rain-slick spiral stair and overgrown sculpture garden are not backdrop but gyroscope: every step Elara takes is mediated by wet stone, moss, and the tower’s echo. The fly amber micro-setting constrains her tactile ritual—she turns it “like a rosary,” binding thought to flesh. Weather evolves causally: first rain enables mud prints, second rain will erase them, charging the final image. Bronze-quiet tone is sustained through sensory selectivity—wet stone, bell-like voice—never drifting into postcard lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    The jetty’s salt-crusted boards, rusted nails, and freshwater seeps are rendered through tactile action (kneeling, pressing seeds, dew-slick boots). The birds’ calls map the space like sonar, turning the structure into a living manual. The setting constrains every micro-choice and charges the final image of invisible seeds at work. Meets 9+ gate: environment shapes tactics and final charge.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.1)
    “Iron cancer” and “metal bones” give tactile rust and steam; the waxed leaf is a micro-setting that constrains Calder’s nostalgia and later seeds the closure image. Spatial choreography is flawless—three-mile walk, bench underside, shelf placement, clipped-to-pack finale. Sensory hierarchy favors smell and metallic taste, true to bloodhound and scrapper. No world-rule contradiction; phonograph cylinders and bunkers feel consistent with salvage culture. Setting pressure is light but present—distance measured in footsteps across rust—so just shy of 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    The station’s warped titanium and time-folded sky are filtered through Maya’s astronomer gaze, producing tactile specifics—brass warmth, gravitational flux after-images—that constrain her movements. The compass rose functions as micro-setting, charging the final stance; remove it and the closure collapses. Spatial choreography is coherent despite relativistic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    Frozen spire above clouds is not postcard scenery; altitude crystals bite skin, wrong-colored sky presses close enough to distort vision, constraining Kael’s eye-watering climb. Micro-setting object—the sundial lid—returns with reweighted meaning (coordinates that shift live), charging the final image. Selective sensory economy: breath tinkles like glass, furs sparkle with permanent frost, brass sky color recurs to mirror internal shift. Spatial choreography stays coherent across ascent/descent; no impossible positions or floating rooms.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    The whispering gallery’s acoustic curve and dusty skylight actively filter attention; the missing-pawn board becomes a micro-setting that constrains their closing conversation. Spatial choreography is clean—the archivist “looks up at the dome” where Mira’s invisible words hover. Light through dust is not ornament but “luminous absence,” a phrase that reweights the city’s glow as potential rather than loss. Setting never stalls; every detail is walked, touched, or seen through Mira’s exact bias.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.3)
    The mountain bookstore breathes paper and ink; candlelight spirals through hollow corridors, guiding micro-choices (three-level descent to Philosophy wing). The mercury-glass body itself becomes micro-setting, refracting dawn into new spectra that charge the final image. One persistent object—the stone—constrains the climax by burning into her chest, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Frozen rain functions as micro-setting: silver needles outside the guild hall mirror the “woven hush” tension and block exit, forcing interior focus. The tapestry border becomes tool-as-setting; its knots constrain finger placement and letter mapping, guiding every micro-move. Platinum labyrinth is off-stage yet charges closure when rejected—environmental pressure without physical presence. Sensory economy favors metallic, textile, and acoustic textures that feed the POV’s tactical eye.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Bone towers plus echo physics function as active obstacle: they amplify, distort, and ultimately authorize her refracting tactic; the pale spire is re-handled at entry, midpoint, and final image. Mist and canyon walls narrow acoustic choice, guiding her impromptu stages. Sensory hierarchy favors audition over visuals, matching POV bias. World rules stay consistent without exposition; no object drift.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Acid-eaten rigging, brass railing, sulfur stench—details are filtered through a diver-alchemist’s priorities of corrosion and tactility. The workshop’s tilt and the jellyfish ropes of dissolved rigs constrain movement and time, charging every micro-choice. The statue’s pockmarks double as micro-setting and future map, directly shaping the final tactic; without them the story logic collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    The coastal cave network is not backdrop; its narrowing shafts and tide-ruled temporality directly shape Maren’s shift from oil-on-canvas to shell-fragments. The cathedral chamber’s “impossible turquoise” pools force the physical impossibility of representation, triggering the shell idea. The shells themselves become micro-setting that constrains the final gesture: each shell can hold only one shard of light, making the mosaic inevitable. Environment charges the closing image—her abandoned easel embedded in tide-swept stone—meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cobalt paint, salt-worn glass, and iron railing vibrations are handled, not catalogued. The lantern room’s spatial logic is tracked cleanly through the captain’s tilted face and the rocks beyond. Micro-setting (vial cork, iron stairs) constrains Mira’s stealth preparation. Environment charges the final image: the lighthouse shifts from fortress to open hand.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dead starlit station, broken dome, and valley-scattered satellite debris constrain scavenging choices and supply the gyro/magnet parts. The bronze censer foot doubles as micro-setting: its color-shift under starlight directly steers the compass calibration. Sensory selection stays urgent—starlight on oxidation, jacket patches under fingernails—never tourist catalog. Environment mirrors interior decay yet remains physically coherent; spatial choreography tracks cleanly as she wires cores around the bronze axis.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    The storm-battered hanging orchard is far more than backdrop: rope bridges swaying in perpetual wind physically force cautious movement, constrain exits, and mirror the fragile social bridges Mira tries to rebuild. Truffle-rich root systems and lichen-speckled glass eye are tactically exploited—she pockets, displays, and finally relinquishes the relic—so setting and object actively shape tactics. Sensory detail is filtered through forager expertise (soil smell, fungal netting) without tourist excess; spatial choreography stays clean across ladder, bridge, and market stall. Environment charges the final image: the orchard entrance beacon symbolizes repaired social visibility, nudging the score into high band.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    “Opal dock in mist” is not backdrop—it narrows visibility, hides footprints, forces the gap-seeing method. Lighthouse beam as tool recurs and charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate. Sensory economy is extreme yet vivid: salt-killed flower, brass key’s hollow shaft. Spatial choreography flawless—no floating bodies or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is vivid and selective: narcotic rose scent, dripping limestone, luminous fungi—details filter through map-dealer eyes (“empirical”). Micro-setting rule met: brass matrix chip becomes the tool that literally locks into wall and charges final image; cavern geography stays coherent as ants trace a legible path. Weather cue (“creek rises”) bookends story but doesn’t constrain tactical choice—more texture than pressure, keeping it from 9+. No spatial drift; bodies/props tracked cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cobalt grotto itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice: its bleeding walls force tactile confrontation and foreclose denial. Sensory hierarchy is character-specific—she notices copper-tasting air and starlight that “burned cold” because her body is the instrument of judgment. Spatial choreography is immaculate: ridge → mouth-like entrance → abyssal drop, each shift mirrored by internal descent. The fireflies’ impossible altitude season charges the surreal rule-set early, paid off at closure. Environment literally drips into her skin, charging the final image; thus the 9+ gate is met.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Twilight ember nexus is not backdrop but resource—its copper glow seeds the sphere’s chromatic recipe and constrains the visible spectrum she can harvest. The shell’s columella curl acts as micro-setting ruler, determining drop-size and sphere-geometry; remove it and the science collapses. Spatial choreography is immaculate: doorway shadow falls across notes, sphere passes palm-to-palm, distances track. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—scientist notices refractive indices before emotional temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cedar box and sinew-tied scroll function as micro-setting that constrains the final choice; the cabin’s darkness and owl call charge the closing image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Maren notices ink smell and bark texture because they are her memory technology. Spatial choreography is minimal yet clean—one table, one box, no impossible moves. Weather is used as tonal echo, not backdrop cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    The shop’s copper fog, jade chambers, and “drowning heartbeat” ticks create an enclosed micro-setting that constrains Elena’s perceptions; the screw’s tactile grooves replace generic medical props. Sensory hierarchy respects her anosmia: sound, temperature, and weight carry scene. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism—fog lifts as insight arrives. One minor spatial drift: “outside” city reveal appears only at end, but closure still recharges the interior workshop atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sheet-archive micro-setting constrains every tactic: the scattered Chopin score becomes the weapon, the music stand the altar, the perfume bottle the conduit—objects wielded, not backdrop. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Margot notices dust motes only when they catch the vortex’s light. Spatial choreography is clean: bottle placed → draft → pages lift → orchard visible through open door. Final image of white petals on grass re-uses the archive’s “white” motif, charging the outside world with inside meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.6)
    The library is rendered with tactile specificity: helical shelves, translucent dictionary pages, whispering air. Environment and object (dictionary, spiral floor) physically constrain motion and perception, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; each spiral turn is tracked. The “resounding hush” tone is maintained through selective auditory and proprioceptive detail, never static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    The horizon scope, brass key, and mercury tubes function as micro-setting that literally constrain choice: the key’s razor teeth force blood, the mercury’s impossible climb proves time negotiable. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through Maren’s cartographer gaze—visual precision, chill metal, hammered-steel fjord—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate: key out, turn, blood, horizon ripples. The station’s isolation and the fjord’s breath-hold charge the final image of the re-sewn seam.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.3)
    The mushroom beds function as both environment and metaphor machine: their permeable mycelium literally guides Chen’s nutrient-mapping choice and gives Mara the conceptual breakthrough. Sensory selection is POV-filtered—she clocks “climate-controlled beds” and “blue-green frequency” because they mirror data flows she can’t stop seeing. Spatial choreography is exact: metal stairs, railing, tablet sketching, button exchange—all track without drift. The setting charges the final image: the glowing rows remain after she decides, quietly repricing what “network” now means to her.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rain-soaked library island, candle-mica amber, and condensation canvas are selective, sense-driven, and filtered through Maya’s probability gaze. Skylight drip and “liquid shadow” steer her melancholy without announcing metaphor. Micro-setting (mica pane) literally refracts the clue that re-weights stakes, satisfying 9+ constraint requirement. Spatial choreography is steady; only one clock cue (“late sunlight”) but sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glass harmonica disc functions as micro-setting that literally constrains the final choice—its cold rim under wet fingers triggers the sonic breach of protocol. Tunnel pipes supply condensation, anchoring humidity as causal detail that changes the disc’s voice and thus the story’s outcome. Spatial choreography is clean: receiver cradled between pipes and conduits, distance tracked when Sarah touches disc, no impossible positions. Environment evolution is causal, not decorative—rain seepage alters sound, alters decision.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    The jetty-as-finger, walnut-ink chemistry, and jasmine scent are concretely filtered through Maren’s archivist gaze; the locket functions as micro-setting that constrains her attention. Spatial choreography is clean: she stands at the end, figures approach from the road, hands are taken. Weather is twilight, but its emotional shading (purple, darkening) is integrated into the euphoric/haunted tone rather than decorative. The town’s hollowing is shown through emptied shops and silence—dense, not catalogued.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    The station’s broken windows and moss benches are lived-in logistics shelves; crates of purifiers determine where characters sit and how they navigate space. The ivy operates as both metaphor and physical curtain, guiding Emil’s partial concealment in the doorway and later framing the communal table. Micro-setting of the ticket office constrains the gathering size and keeps the climax intimate. Final image of moon fragments on the shared table reuses the setting’s dominant visual (dim platform light) to charge the new, permanent “infrastructure of mutual aid.”

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observatory tower, sideways-drifting coffee, and the nib-as-worry-stone act as micro-settings that constrain gesture and focus attention. Sensory selection is POV-driven: Mara notices gravitational tug in her “inner ear,” professional filters notice timestamps preceding discovery dates. The gravitational anomaly as metaphorical “bookmark” charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate test. A half-step short of 9.0 only because corridor geography and station layout remain abstract; bodies never risk impossible positions, but spatial choreography is lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    Harbor moonlight is not postcard; it is the literal score Theo converts into sound, constraining every tactical adjustment they make. Spatial choreography is immaculate—windows light up across water in response to speakers, giving Marina visual confirmation of her “voice.” Camera-as-micro-setting charges the final image: the empty shutter becomes the instrument of renunciation. Sensory selection is POV-filtered: visual rhythm of waves substitutes for unheard music, mirroring Marina’s synesthetic triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    The limestone cave is not backdrop but archive—every pigment, ogre-shadow, and hand-match constrains how Mara moves, photographs, and weeps. The tapestry fragment itself functions as micro-setting: its threads literally guide her fingers to the wall, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies, light, and torn cloth track cleanly. At 8.9 only because the off-grid months outside the cave are a blank; the environment that matters is rendered with economy and sensory hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sound-wave garden supplies physics that constrain tactics: sound makes light ripples, drumming literally bends visible reality, shaping their final duet. Sensory palette filters through Theo’s auditory bias—every description vibrates, never touristic. Mini-setting of railing + lagoon surface tracks bodies cleanly; no impossible moves. Starlight proximity and auric water reconfigure in final image, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    The corrugated containers, electromagnetic hum, and “poisonous green” aurora are filtered through Marcus’s technician ear; every sensory note either enables or constrains his auditory tactic. The keyhole welded into “faded customs stamps” is a micro-setting object that literally gates entry; the folded-map room recharges the premise at closure. Spatial choreography is clean: we track his boots, the echoing gaits, the woman’s emergence from behind a container. No static catalogue—each detail is handled under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.9)
    “Cobalt dock gleamed after rain” instantly colors place and weather; body-as-micro-setting appears when Marina’s hand angles the mirror. Spatial choreography is clean: dock → water → bridge → warehouse row, distances track. Tool (mirror) constrains every tactic; environment (angled shutter shadows) becomes the message medium, satisfying 9+ gate. Sensory economy favors reflected light and wet wood—selective, urgent, never museum-tour.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.9)
    Cobalt glass, mist, and dimming light serve as both atmosphere and metaphorical filter—literally tinting perception—while the chessboard and window sketches function as micro-settings that constrain tactics. Sensory economy is biased toward sight and hush, matching the idea of “amplified quiet.” The magnetic grotto itself is withheld until mid-scene, a minor orientation lag, but its starlit under-bridge locale is sharply re-envisioned as a clandestine forum. Environment does not physically alter the climax, preventing entry to 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sublittoral fringe is more than postcard: salt-stink, copper dawn, whale-song through pilings constrain bodies and mood. Whalebone map functions as micro-setting, its grooves dictating tilt and shared gaze. Final image fuses body/tool/horizon—“dance toward different horizons”—charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    The farmhouse-turbine shadow is sketched with spare, selective strokes; the dried bouquet functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice to speak plainly. Sensory hierarchy reflects Marcus’s performative detachment—sound of brittle stems, visual grayness—keeping detail purposeful. Spatial choreography is coherent across the single room. The turbines do not actively constrain tactics, so the score stays below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    Cobalt glass shadows, cracked-lake porcelain, and humming quartz are selective, sensory, and mirrored in Meris’s fracturing of meaning. The colonnage itself is the micro-setting/tool that constrains her compositional act and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: palm on pillar → deeper colonnade → watchers arrive. No environment detail is idle; each refracts the theme of dissolving fixity.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glassblower’s courtyard is sketched through sensory triangulation—scorched earth crunching underfoot, embers scattered across cobblestones—filtered by Maya’s texture-first attention. Selective detail (wind chimes, reed tongue, scorched planters) repeatedly constrains movement and later charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean; no floating rooms. While the wider city remains generic, the micro-setting of body-plus-tool qualifies for high-band gate at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    The carbide lamp’s yellowed glass and the tuning-fork spine function as micro-setting that constrains choice (light temperature governs volunteers’ openness; spine forces her to move carefully). Laboratory is sketched with selective sensory economy—“fractured light dancing across analog recordings”—that keeps momentum. Spatial choreography is clean: lamp adjusted → wall illuminated → playback switch → door opens. Miner’s lamp recurs in final image, charging closure with warmth against the cold blackout past.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    Observatory functions as micro-setting: brass eyepiece, green dome, spiral stairs constrain pacing and metaphor. Tactile metalwork details (oxidized copper, resin tears) ground grief in weight and temperature. “Outside time” rule is consistent and pays off in final crane-drop that folds past and future together. Sensory hierarchy biased to touch and starlight—exactly what a grieving craftsperson would cling to.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rain-skylight loft, lacquered table, onyx cards, and coiled measuring tape create a tactile micro-setting that literally guides Vesper’s spatial comparisons; the same tape later charges the closure when it “moves between pages,” re-anchoring the cross-cultural epiphany. Sensory hierarchy is biased to Vesper’s anthropologist eye—she sees patterns first, rain second—so detail never feels touristic. Environment affects action once: rain shifts to mist at dawn, cueing the soft landing, but weather does not constrain tactics further, keeping the score just under 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bronze prism pagoda is not backdrop; its warming/cooling surface and geometry that “shouldn’t exist” directly gate entry and later mirror her internal split. Twilight is compressed into color-fragments that lack names, a sensory filter that signals cognitive estrangement. Spatial choreography is flawless—hand to bronze, crystals dissolving into skin—so the micro-setting (body + artifact) satisfies the 9+ gate. One minor hedge: no weather or broader geography, but at this length the pagoda *is* the world-rule engine.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glass-petal library above the clouds is economically anchored; its dream-glass shelves and cloud drift are tactile and bias-filtered through Sera’s curator gaze. Spatial choreography is clean: she palms the stone, activates shelves, stands at a console—each object is handled, not catalogued. The setting constrains her access to forbidden footage and provides the technical means to copy, so it passes the 9+ gate. Minor lapse: no sensory price (cold, vertigo) is extracted from the altitude, keeping it just short of exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mountain mist, lantern flicker, and translucent shed skin are not backdrop but tools: the mist “obscuring and revealing” mirrors her own method shift, and the regenerated tail-tip is handled twice—once as observed evidence, once as moral exemplar—charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; the bench debris and broken thermometer track across beats, grounding every motion.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    The meteor-hush tower is not backdrop; its electromagnetic silence is the enabling condition for plant telepathy and thus every investigative beat. Micro-setting objects—coffee rings, hourglass, scarred wrist—are handled in live beats and constrain choices (coffee rings must be read, hourglass must be blood-marked). Spatial choreography is clean: transitions from cot to table to window track without drift. Final image of blood on frozen sand reweights the impossible object with undeniable cost, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    The projection booth functions as micro-setting that constrains every move—narrow stairs, brass rail worn smooth, rusted box bolted to wall—while the empty auditorium below supplies the emotional echo chamber. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Celeste notices dust motes as emotional static, reels as love incubators. Weather (muffled thunder → breaking rain) is tracked and finally charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is airtight: her body, the box, the window, the wall where map projects.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    The aurora-lit archway functions as micro-setting that constrains and finally releases the Keeper; selective sensory detail (“ribbons of green and violet aurora,” “frozen fingers”) is POV-filtered and purposeful, charging the final imperfect star-traced arc that crystallizes freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glowing dune is not backdrop but tactical partner: approaching with “eyes half-closed” keeps it multiply real, constraining her choreography. Micro-setting objects—frozen clock, humming seeds—are handled, their states altering choices. Sensory triage favors haptic and auditory frequencies over postcard visuals. Environment directly charges the final image; meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mechanical rainforest is rendered with brass leaves, pneumatic vines, titanium bamboo—each detail does double duty as both world and mind-map. Spatial choreography stays clean through the single clearing, and the final image recharges the setting by turning it into a mirror of cognition, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is micro-anchored in ticket punch, leash, ridgeway mist; these objects act as portable stage sets that constrain every stop (must punch leaf, must abandon leash). Veiled ridgeway charges the final image—its obscurity literalizes the un-mapped life she finally enters. Sensory hierarchy favors touch (warm brass, snapped leather) over vista, matching POV bias toward tethered intimacy. Spatial choreography is tight: three gapped halts on rising slope, no geography drift.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cobalt fortress, eternal snowfall, and war-damaged interior (crooked door, arrow-slit light, sheared bench bolt) actively constrain tactics: Kovacs could mask children only because the piano room survived; Rielle can play only because the bench is braced, not replaced. Snow functions as micro-setting—Rielle’s climb is slowed, numbing, metaphorical. Sensory range is selective (cold iron banister, wobbling bench, single resonant middle C) and filtered through a soldier’s priorities. Space stays coherent: staircase → landing → corridor → music room; bodies move without teleport.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    The temple-library is both macro-stage and micro-tool: shelves that record futures, starlight-water basins, impossible windows—every detail is tactile, usable, and constrains Ossian’s quiet campaign. Spatial logic is clean; movement through stacks is tracked, exits implicit. Sensory hierarchy obeys an immortal archivist: constellation-leather bindings, suspended dust motes, evaporated ink becoming actual stars—none are touristy, all service theme. Environment charges the final image when evaporated ink drifts upward, mirroring the graceful collapse below. 9-band quick test met: setting actively shapes tactics and final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.0)
    Station, atlas page, and reef skeleton function as micro-setting; the groaning cables and salt-stiff paper constrain gesture and attention; the atlas page is handled twice (tapping, palm-press) and returns to charge the final image; sensory selection skews visual but the swaying floorboards and radio crackle keep embodiment live; no environmental detail breaks physics or POV filter.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    Spaceport repair bay is tactile: cold metal grating, rusted scaffolding, glass shards under bare skin; every detail is filtered through Kess’s philosophical slant. Micro-setting (bare feet, opera glasses) constrains movement and becomes the lens for final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The ancient stone circle is given tactile weight (dark stone, subsonic hum) and directly shapes the final choice. No world-level accuracy demands here; specificity earns high band.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Volcanic minerals, bioluminescent fungi, and sulfurous steam are filtered through Naja’s skin and mission; the hot-spring geography constrains access and hides the cavern. The kite-tail reappears at the end, recharged as signal and spent tool. One micro-gap: the Authority’s “unstable geology” is asserted, not tested, so environment never actively threatens her descent.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    The arboretum’s salt-kissed air, bromeliads, Japanese maple, and decommissioned lighthouse cohere as micro-setting that constrains Mira—she must choose plants that survive exposure, mirroring her own exposure to memory. The cliff edge and decaying lighthouse supply persistent physical risk and metaphorical obsolescence that charges the final image of her “working on, quietly talented.” Tactile details (gravel paths, shears suspended) weave through action rather than pausing it.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    Micro-setting triumph: tarot cards, salt-stained windows, and compressing shelves function as active agents, not backdrop. Lighthouse beam recurs as heartbeat timer, constraining her rhythm and charging the final ignition. Spatial choreography is crystal—books track inward with glacier patience, no floating geography. Meets 9+ gate: the broken box reappears in the last image, now glowing, reweighting meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    Wind-carved sandstone and drone-metal glints are filtered through Kael’s predator eye; the environment literally lets Vera carve her message and lets Kael read it, so setting constrains tactics. Micro-setting win: the half-faded ink on stone is a clock and a map simultaneously. The cave’s air current that finishes the spiral is the same current that will erase it—an environmental lever that charges the final image. Sunlight as judgment is slightly overt; one more tactile stab of heat on albino skin would edge this to 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cryogenic archive is not postcard backdrop; nitrogen-frosted glass and snow-muffled insulation directly constrain the override sequence. “Frost webbing her visor” becomes a tactile obstacle to vision during the key beat. The vault’s subzero temperature is the physical price that makes the letter’s burn against her chest meaningful. Environment thus charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dome’s scratched glass and amber light are not backdrop; they filter every decision and literally color the final image. Ballast canvas, compass shards, and coral petals are micro-settings that constrain how the plants—and people—grow. Spatial choreography is clean: eastern airlock, western beds, entrance row tracked without drift. The environment charges the closure when the first clean light breaches the glass, proving the dome’s continuance.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sound-wave garden is rendered through tactile synesthesia—ferns that arpeggiate, puddles that ache—so setting acts as both arena and instrument. Every object (rail spike, acoustic flowers, compressed-air pools) constrains tactics: the spike anchors against gravity loss, flowers amplify the silence-cast. Sensory economy is ruthless; no detail merely decorates. The final image of Mara walking home with an “alien heartbeat” recharges every prior acoustic metaphor without repeating them.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    The observatory’s copper instruments and echoing dome act as micro-setting that literally guides her choices—she weights documents with sextants, hears whispers refract. The rosewood nib is handled three times, its tactile specificity constraining the editorial act at closure. One minor slip: “vaulted chamber” is slightly generic; still, the place is lived-in and stakes-scale matched.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    Laboratory of suspended sounds is sketched via sensory hierarchy—moth wings, rust, crystalline cabinets—filtered through acoustician Vera. Spatial choreography is clean: foyer → hall → final chamber → interface. Amber as micro-setting constrains the final hand-to-port action. Weather is irrelevant, so no penalty for omission; world-rules (fossilized time-bridge) stay consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    Micro-setting triumph: the grotto’s cupped limestone and dawn-mist lilac directly shape the acoustic mandala and the emergent hush. The tile flake’s resonance is a tactile extension of the walls, constraining her method. Tourist histories and echo physics are learned through chalk, not exposition. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as strangers enter and form a ring without blocking the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ancient plaza is rendered through tactile ruins—cooling steel fingers on sun-warmed shards, fountains turned to rubble—while the “shattered sky” becomes an environmental mirror of cracked memory. Spatial choreography stays clean as Layla kneels, gathers, arranges; bodies emerge from hidden pockets without stage-direction clutter. The blue tessera from the fallen minaret is returned in the final line, recharging the opening image and constraining her choice to stay and face reprisal; this object-as-setting satisfies the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mystic orchard operates as micro-setting: apple-bloom/rot simultaneity constrains her choreography—every step must land between fruiting and withering. Hedge maze amplifies echoes, turning vegetal walls into sound-light mirrors. Synesthetic color-map makes spatial progression legible without visual redundancy. Final image of garden forever dancing recharges every leaf with her perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Studio darkness, crystalline photos, copper-wire pendant—details are selective and mirrored in Mara’s layered mind. The geode’s “cool edges ground her spiraling awareness” directly constrains her micro-choice mid-scene. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. Micro-setting qualifies and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    Coastal cave system constrains every move: limestone channels dictate where emotions pool, tidal pulse marks time, wall warmth guides hand placement. Micro-setting of elm fossil acts as portable chamber whose 50-million-year memory recharges final fusion. Selective sensory hierarchy—temperature before visual, texture before sound—mirrors Maren’s professional-then-personal priority. Environment is not backdrop but agent that enables the climactic reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    The amber panels and canyon echo are not backdrop; they constrain acoustics and perception—Mara uses the echo’s audible loneliness as the catalyst that reconfigures visitor desire. Spatial choreography stays clean: deepest corner → shelf → entrance, each move altering tactical possibility. Honey-colored light and preserved sound are micro-settings that charge the final image when the jar is opened in public. Setting detail is selective, never touristic, and filters through Mara’s cataloguer gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    The pillbox, body-in-motion on slick frost, and drone—three micro-settings—directly constrain tactics and charge the final image. Mist-lift reveal is timed to coincide with knowledge shift, so weather serves plot rather than décor. Spatial choreography is flawless: descent path, village tavern, valley camera angles track cleanly. Zephyr bluff earns irreplaceability: only its seasonal melt schedule makes the stake urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Fog, river sound, and ticking gutters are not backdrop but temporal clock that halts to trigger closure; micro-setting (carriage interior, needle) constrains gesture. Sensory triage—whispered water, lapping wheels, slow percussion—mirrors woman’s thin-scraped layers. “Spindrift serenity” diction stays inside coachman’s weathered lexicon. Final image of needle tucked in journal charges earlier object with new conceptual weight—setting-as-tool achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    The scorched-wasteland/oasis contrast is economically sketched through orange sky, distant smoke, and sun-pattern navigation; spatial choreography stays consistent. The lantern glass serves as micro-setting that literally reframes perception and drives the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors visual/tactile—appropriate to a potter’s sight-and-touch bias. Environment does not physically constrain tactics, so misses 9+ gate by a whisker.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Harbor moonlight, rusted grating, and the “fragment of reflected moonlight” in a coffee-can form a micro-setting that literally guides watering angles and mirror placement. The gauge tooth functions as mobile setting-as-tool, constraining the final memorial decision. Selective sensory triage—papery petals, oar-rhythm water—keeps economy tight while rooting every garden in tactile iron and salt air.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.2)
    The tidal library is not backdrop; its atmospheric tides literally insert new books and force her daily task, constraining tactics. Micro-setting—the atomically reflective wall—mirrors her fractured identity and is handled twice, each time reframing her self-perception. Brass sundial evolves from useless to re-weighted: absence of shadow becomes the emblem of light-based time, charging the final image. Sensory economy is tight: cloud-hum, crystal vibration, warm book pages—all filtered through her hybrid animal/human sensorium.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, and rain-slick marble are not backdrop but active: the temple’s steamy petals force her wet ascent, the pond’s reflection ripples beneath the final image. The spiral installation functions as micro-setting that literally constrains her final choice—she must physically tie her letter to it. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: she notices architectural acoustics and refracted light because her life is language and silence. One hiccup: “violet and gold” cloudburst edges toward postcard palette, but the color is immediately welded to steam on stone, so forgivable.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    The station itself—transmitter pulse, metal casing, flickering lights—functions as micro-setting that constrains her tactic (she must broadcast from here or lose the game). Sensory hierarchy favors tactile and sonic detail over visual catalog, matching a DJ’s trained ear. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: palm on transmitter, charts lift, headphones adjusted, no floating props. The “impossible colors” and rearranged circuits verge on world-rule exposition, but each instance is tethered to a character’s report, preserving plausibility. The radio tower as conduit for cosmic frequencies is specific and memorable; removing it collapses the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    The domed nexus, starlit cracks, and shifting bronze disc are rendered with economy; every detail either pressures claustrophobia or enables map-reading. The organ’s reverberation is both atmosphere and mechanism—its vibrations physically rotate the disc, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is flawless: five tunnels, western passage, floor-shaft all track cleanly. Micro-setting (compass point) constrains the final gesture, charging the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    Quarry-as-body: limestone walls narrow Elena’s options (she must descend to paint), mist clings like memory, ribbon fragment weighted beside her acts as micro-setting that constrains the act of portraiture. Sensory hierarchy biased to Elena’s tactile compensation for facial absence—charcoal dust, paper clip pressure, cold stone under boots. Weather (mist) evolves with plot, swallowing light then releasing witnesses. Spatial choreography clean: descent, arrangement, ascent track without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Violet clouds singing auroras, snow falling upward, negative-temperature readings—each impossibility is filtered through Mira’s map-librarian eye for pattern. The copper nail micro-setting is re-grasped, pocketed, and finally lifted like a key, charging the last image. Spatial choreography stays clean across the one-room station; only the sub-ice hatch appears without foreshadowing, a minor geographic pop-in.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mountain pullout, rusted wagon, violin case, and scaffold wrap are sketched with brisk, sense-driven selectivity. Micro-setting (flake in pocket) ultimately constrains the final image as it dissolves, meeting 9+ gate. Wind-pattern on plastic sheeting is tactile and audible, guiding Mara’s action directly. Time-of-day lighting arc (morning mist → crystalline valley → sunset) supports causal escalation without decorative overload. One minor spatial float: “edge of visibility” remains un-anchored distance-wise, but it does not rupture choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    The circus train is not postcard scenery: its tilted carriage literally houses Marco, the curved window frames the dusk image that charges the ending, and the faded paint mirrors the father’s faded identities. Spatial choreography is clean: father emerges from tree line, pack size is noted, both sit on platform, hand on railing. Weather (October mist rising from tracks) is filtered through ranger-trained perception. The foreign bills function as micro-setting inside the car and constrain the conversation; their arrangement is handled on page. No static cataloguing—each detail is re-seen during the dusk sit.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory dome as opening eye, the brass telescope, and the pressed daylily function as micro-settings that constrain choices: the dome forces shared sky-gaze, the telegram’s fragility bars aggressive handling, the telescope’s brass chill keeps fingers trembling. Sensory selection is POV-true: Mara notices star-pulse periods, not constellations. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single continuous scene; bodies track from doorway to telescope to table. The final image—two writers under changing stars—recharges "nothing changes alone" with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    The orchard-vortex is not backdrop—it tightens the rescue: spiral roots limit footing, blossom shrapnel slices skin, black water drinks sound. Micro-setting of the clenched pouch (seeds + mirror shard) literally holds the moral crime and charges the final image as it sinks. Sensory triage under crisis: wind taste of rot, blossom blur, scream swallowed by water—each filters through Maren’s soldier-druid attention. Only minus: spatial exactitude of the two mirror-pools could be one sentence sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.3)
    Cobalt glade is vivid—blue spiraling grass, dusk bruise—yet remains scenic backdrop; it never constrains movement or supplies tactical friction. The topiary clipping functions as micro-setting and is handled in two beats (clutch, crush), qualifying for 9+ gate, but its geometric order never collides with the chaotic glade to narrow choices. Spatial choreography is flawless; distance between Mira/Marcus tracked. Weather/light is decorative rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    Catacomb orchard never drifts into postcard; every root-around-bone detail is filtered through Marcus’s manic inlaying and the Oracle’s barefoot vigil. The burned card functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice: its remaining heat and ruined image force acceptance. Spatial choreography stays clean; one contiguous walk-through maintains orientation. Environment, tool, and body interlock to charge the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Quarry trailer, limestone dust, and rust-holed cloth create micro-setting that constrains the final stance—he’s literally inside the ruins of certitude. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: acoustic memories attuned to “roar after applause,” tactile glass bubbles. Spatial choreography is tight: crate on desk, cloth above, draft moves cloth during decision beat. Objects (crate, bottles, cloth) evolve states and charge the closing image; environment earns 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    Floating arbor, iron rail, rust-brown knuckles, and charged-air ripples give tactile 3-D grip; magnetic suspension is economical yet specific. Silver-leaf spectrum and electromagnetic taste extend physics into new sense. Environment literally lifts her above earth, enabling the transition metaphor; altitude functions as micro-setting that shapes every beat. Final image of “garden in touching distance of both earth and sky” re-uses setting to charge closure.</question>

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal atrium’s water-level catwalks and moon-synchronized gears constrain Maris’s every step and timing; the mobile of fish-in-air re-appears as the charged final image, its light-catch re-pricing identity. Micro-setting (bamboo creel repurposed as scroll-cradle) alters Maris’s gesture economy and ties past occupation to present ritual. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and motion over visual catalog, matching a librarian-fisher’s kinesthetic bias. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions across rising/falling floors.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)

Sensory hierarchy follows inspection priorities—echo-location, surface texture, light refraction—anchoring professional gaze. Spatial choreography is immaculate: alcove, shrine, shell, pearl tracked without drift. Final image reuses the refracting lattice to turn solitary beam into communal radiance, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment (river, ivy, tiled wall) directly constrains tactics: each day’s deeper wading is enabled by platform collapse that offers stair-less water access; accordion’s patched bellows mirror ivy’s repair of rust, charging final leave-behind. Sensory hierarchy true to ex-hydrologist: temperature, clarity, coordinates noticed before emotional label. Micro-setting (body in current) functions as setting when she balances notebook above thighs—choice physically limited by flow. No slips touching closure; river’s “refusal of nothing” recharges every prior reading.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    Library breathes in cardamom and reluctant light; propagation delay mechanic is taught through her steps and corrected reach, turning spatial illusion into navigable tool. Watch casing’s matched embossment gives tactile anchor. Mist and shimmer risk vague grandeur but are repeatedly yanked into functional use (“pathways parted”). Physical hierarchy holds: body→tool→architecture. Lacks 9+ because environment never quite bites back—no collapsing shelf or lost exit to force tactical change.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Velvet observatory, ice violin, and sentient plants are never backdrop: the transparent body literally lets Elena see stolen holes, the dome’s midnight midsummer heat threatens the melt deadline, the mulberry presses its historic stain into her mind. Setting constrains the final choice—she must act before heat and dawn arrive.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    Skyborne grotto, carved-ice walls, and steam vents literally constrain every move—too much heat and the corpse slumps, too little and the skin refuses pigment. The aurora is not backdrop but active resource: its pulses dictate pacing, color choice, and final mirror angles. Body-as-micro-setting rules: temple temperature governs tool efficacy and emotional tempo. One hairline slip: “three miles above” is asserted twice; otherwise spatial choreography is tracked flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cedar summit, clay bottles, and lacquered phoenix hairpin are tactile, choice-guiding objects; the grotto’s misty mouth literally shapes access—one mis-step would plunge Keiko into cloud. Sensory economy favors touch and breath over visual catalogues. The hairpin’s final reposition in Keiko’s palm charges the closing image, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse gallery, wind-chime sets, and salt breeze constrain stance—she can’t pace, must listen. The shard-as-micro-setting refracts sunrise onto the deck, charging the final image. Sensory triage—smell of salt, sound of three chimes, feel of worn glass—mirrors her narrowing attention. No postcard listing; every detail is filtered through her need to “unhook.”

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.1)
    Magnetic grotto, floating platform, and pond micro-setting are re-used as tactile teaching tools; platform descent in the final beat physically enacts the “passing forward” idea, charging closure. Starlight-on-magnetism rule stays consistent and is learned through action rather than exposition. Sensory selection skews visual, but the returning ripples supply the required auditory/temporal layering.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Bone towers, ravens’ recursive geometries, and the pulse-trap canyon are not backdrop but tooling: the fracture in tower-three literally disrupts standing waves Kael must retune. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—he notices wind direction and crystalline sound, not tourist vistas. Micro-setting (arrowhead in palm) constrains his immobility and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Environment directly shapes the only possible tactic—meditative realignment—meeting 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    The icebound spire is evoked through selective sensory hierarchy—cold pain, refracted twilight, frost spirals—each detail constraining her stamina and pacing the ritual attempts. Spatial choreography is clean: entrance, center chamber, keystone placement track without drift. The “brilliant dimness” functions as micro-setting inside the body, narrowing perception to breath and glow, charging the final image. Unique descriptor “brilliant dimness” recurs and modulates, giving the environment a textured POV signature rather than generic alpine spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Micro-setting triumph: the brass lighter, key tag, and algae bottles function as movable “rooms” that constrain every beat. Barnacled hull, fused books, and swollen door provide tactile specificity that guides her body through the breach. Lantern sky and black water create a vertical/horizontal grid that mirrors her grandfather’s axis of silence-to-light. Final image—the lanterns as musical score—recharges every prior lamp she lit, proving environment can be both pier and bottle, sky and page.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    The amber-filtered observatory dome functions as both environment and tool: its light color-codes the tightening frequency and literally colors the final white-out. Coins serve as micro-setting handled in 3+ beats, embodying extinct value systems that foreshadow repricing at closure. Spatial choreography stays clean—console, bowl, headset, pressure seal track without drift. Sensory palette is narrow (visual/auditory) but purposeful; crisis narrows perception to static bursts, aligning with theme. No world-rule contradiction; scientific shorthand stays plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Observatory is sketched with spare but specific instruments—cracked lens, brass speaking tubes, scattered prismatic light—that constrain where Mira can stand and what she can see. The atlas page micro-setting (inked sea monsters) doubles as literal map and emotional boundary, charging the final image when she pockets it. Dusk timing tightens the stake: darkness is literal deadline for her departure. Only the predecessor’s voice lacks spatial origin, a deliberate echo that serves theme rather than geography, so the cap is waived.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    The viaduct crystallizes as a micro-setting: its drip cadence literally constrains the pacing of Emris’s forge-work and charges the final bell-ring.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.0)
    The moonlit brook and cottage deck function as micro-setting: isolation enables undistracted puzzle-design yet offers the flowing water that literally carries the trap away. Sensory economy is strong—weathered deck, thick air, storm-born silence—filtered through Margot’s designer perceptions. Spatial choreography is clean; seed-hand-to-water motion tracks without drift. The setting constrains choice (no neighbors, no witnesses, only the brook as disposal) and returns charged in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.9)
    The tunnel is the star: doubled sound, suspended dust galaxies, spatial choreography exact (“angled the nozzle toward corners”). It functions as micro-setting that constrains every acoustic choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Martin notices vibration, dust motes, echo-delay, filtered through grief attention. The final image charges the setting: laughter now ricochets where absence did; without the tunnel the reweighting collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Frozen garden, mist, and statues are not backdrop but weaponized terrain: frost burns skin, statues insert faces into her memory, mist erodes self-boundaries. Micro-setting triumph: the pendant contains a miniature of the same garden, making the final squeeze a literal collapse of exterior into interior. Spatial choreography clean—distance to pendant tracked via pulsing glow. Environment charges closure image; without the garden’s implosion the “ashes” would carry no repricing weight.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ember nexus is not postcard scenery; its geothermal fire/steam hybrid literally powers the workshop and supplies the moon-light that makes the paste glow. Spatial choreography is clean—bench, fracture, crucibles stay tracked. Sensory economy is excellent: three cracked crucibles and the taste of disappointment tell us more than a page of décor. The new wood “threaded with veins of silver” charges the final image, fusing setting and object into one living constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    City-suspension, broken-glass moonshafts, and the shard’s frozen-light veins are vividly selective, all filtered through Mira’s professional eye; the micro-setting of the gutted transmitter cavity physically constrains the final reach and discovery, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.1)
    The spectral grotto’s starlight is not postcard scenery—it literally inscribes the pattern-map onto the hourglass, constraining the confluence maneuver.

    The benthic metropolis is rendered through Carta’s professional eye—pressure geometry versus celestial azimuth—so every bioluminescent surface comments on her lost certainties. The chain link micro-setting literally constrains her final gesture: its retained shape against pressure becomes the tactile lens through which she first “sees” edge geometry, charging the closing image. Spatial choreography stays clean across the city-to-trench move; distances and bodies track. Selective auditory omission (no water sounds) mirrors her stunned sensorium, tightening POV. Details of “edge geometry” are parceled through action, never dumped—world rules learned by watching metal glow.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mist-clad atrium is more than postcard; the rolling mist literally blurs exits, forcing the two women to stand together under the ferns while the signal completes. The corroded hearing aid is micro-setting-as-tool: its crackle times the beats and its silence marks closure. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Mira notices static hiss and spider-web shadows first, never a generic catalog. One slip: “reeling hush” is used twice in near-repetition without added charge.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    The salt-bleeding concrete and narrowing corridor body the claustrophobic drive; the gold fleck micro-setting doubles as tool and talisman, constraining her to stay and document. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she notes cable “rubber casings degraded” because her mentor mapped them. Spatial choreography is clean: descent/ascent mirror tide ebb/flow. Environment charges the final image: rising water = unavoidable price, making the facility itself the last witness.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.1)
    Selective sensory layering—opal dome catching moonlight, cathedral silence of snow, ink’s organic fractal—mirrors Mira’s narrowing attention.

The final image of echoes that “never stop speaking” recharges the setting’s acoustic rule-set, meeting the 9+ constraint gate.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    The garden is not backdrop but tool: the phone mounted between terrariums literalizes the conduit; the upward-tugging arrowhead in Maya’s palm constrains her final choice. Sensory triage favors touch and kinesthetic weight against winter-death outside, mirroring her thawing interior. Spatial choreography is flawless—root stairs, wall mushrooms, moss without disturbance—tracking bodies and objects cleanly. One micro-setting object (the phone) delivers the closure laugh, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sky-bridge height, clockwork hum, and marble statues are sketched with cinematic economy; each detail filters through Mira’s bodily tension. The orchard is rendered through sensory loss—gray creaking branches—so the single golden apple pops.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Desert-circus train, spring-fed grove, and cottonwood shade are sketched with swift, camera-like selection; every sensory stroke (light through broken windows, brass catching water-ripple gleam) doubles as emotional filter. Spatial choreography is flawless—fragments, tools, and body move without drift. The micro-setting of the crown itself becomes the final environmental constraint: its spin demands tomorrow’s hanging elements, locking next action. Weather and scale modulate naturally, never catalogued for tourism.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.3)
    The library itself is the micro-setting that constrains and finally reconfigures perception; shelves curve, corridors double back, external dimensions lie. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Cordelia notices paper dust and lavender because her grandmother equation-scented letters made those smells knowledge-bearing. The prime-number hours and Poe/Lobachevsky 1889 pedigree are named only once and reused, satisfying proper-noun economy. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly—scarf-trail, shelf-perimeter, atrium desk—anchoring the hyperbolic walk.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.1)
    The archipelago’s fog, tide-governed hours, and sea-stack geometry actively constrain when and where Mara can act; the cave only “opens” at one sun-angle, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the lighthouse library and wet watercolor palette feel tactile without tourist clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.1)
    The “shadowed nexus” is more than postcard: its impossible geometry literally re-orients Mara’s body and denies normal vectors, so setting constrains tactics and charges the final image.

Micro-setting (ribbon, cobblestones, doors) doubles as tool and symbol without stalling momentum. Spatial choreography is tight; no impossible positions or floating rooms.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sunken greenhouse ribs, phosphorescent spores, and ring of wrecks are never scenic postcard; each re-enters as tactical object (she climbs whale-bone ribs, bags glowing caps, feels wrecks’ magnetic drag). Micro-setting succeeds: the mesh bag’s luminescence becomes the final lantern that recharges “crisp as autumn air.” Sensory hierarchy obeys Vera’s academic gaze—she tastes, measures, names—so detail stays purposive. Only the single-scene scope keeps it from the 9-band gate that demands environment physically constrain the final motion.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Library operates as micro-setting: dust-laden aisles, broken window, copper kettle—all tactile, lived-in, and filtered through archivist habit.

The heritage rose outside mirrors the thorn she keeps on her desk, constraining her notion of “wise blood.” Only the aurora remains decorative—it never limits choice.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.0)
    The seashell half charges every beat—warming, cooling, guiding descent—and the petroglyph wall literally scripts the final teaching mission, satisfying the 9+ gate. Canyon acoustics constrain tactics: sound’s refusal to die forces Mara to become the listener her sister lacked, binding setting to closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glacier shrine is not backdrop; its breathing ice walls force Maya to cut tunnels one cautious stroke at a time, literalizing how truth is carved from pressure. The melted globe’s tilted lighthouse is a micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless: globe pocketed → altar → cloth wrap → exit. Environment directly constrains the tactics of communion.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Whispering parapet, rain-slick bronze harbor, and firefly traceries filter through Kenji’s net-mender gaze—every sense is vocational, not tourist. Bamboo whisk and tangled net function as micro-settings that constrain finger choreography and philosophy. Spatial choreography is immaculate: bodies seated, net passed, firefly lands on weave. Final image of moon-path across harbor re-uses the parapet height and water surface, charging the closure; thus meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    The orchard-as-micro-setting directly shapes every beat: Geiger chatter, poisoned snow, roots breaching leaded earth. The diamond’s shoe-box coffin becomes the final tactile image, charging closure. Sensory triage favors touch and sound over visual catalog, matching a investigator’s priorities. One minor gap: no bodily radiation symptom (nose-bleed, metallic taste) to threaten or guide Vera’s timeline, a missed pressure lever.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Observatory, cobalt portico, and lightning-filtered glass are tactile, bias-filtered, and return in the final image to refract the coming dawn—setting directly charges closure. Selective sensory economy keeps sky, glass, and equipment in tight rotation, each beat anchoring her attention and choices.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    “Salt and wild roses threading through floorboards” is selective, not catalog. The loft’s broken furniture and drift-treasures constrain her movements—she must crawl from blanket-nest, cart jars downstairs. Music box’s tarnish and mechanism mirror internal corrosion; final glow in jar charges image. Spatial choreography clean—dunes, boardwalk, town—no floating rooms.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    The drift-ice marina is not backdrop but active antagonist: its groans dictate timing, its resonant shelf limits footstep tempo, the hum bars intruders. Micro-setting—the resonance chamber’s fork, the copper sound-baffles—becomes the surgical theater where the final choice is physically performed. Weather and architecture constrain every tactical move; the golden sunset is not color but countdown timer compressing decisions. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    Basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and moonlit viaduct are filter-selected through Ren’s cartographer eye—angularity, reflectivity, magnetic variance. The brass theodolite functions as micro-setting: its minute turns constrain her bodily posture and mark time. “Iron singing with temperature shifts” gives the viaduct sensory agency, not postcard backdrop. These elements charge the final image: the viaduct’s gleam fades at sunrise, reweighting her nocturnal labor as the new horizon.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tunnel is more than backdrop—water depth constrains movement, brick gap supplies the hidden chamber, lantern light literally guides Elena’s gaze to the wall carvings. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: corroded brass, cold water ankle-level, radio crackle all reflect a utilities investigator’s priorities. Micro-setting (the lantern) constrains the final image—she holds it up to cast shadows, linking past fugitives to present escape. No weather clichés; the drought’s end is causal, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    The shop’s “vibrant hush” of ticking gears is both atmosphere and moral engine—timepieces literally measure penance. Light through storm clouds is returned at the end as a charged reprise that reweights the apology. The clockwork heart itself acts as micro-setting: its frozen valves dictate every choice Eliana makes. Spatial grounding stays clean; only nit is that “behind the counter” plus loupe plus letter hand-off could crowd the bench, but choreography remains trackable.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Acid-spray geography is tactile and immediate; the grinding gears, prismatic haze, and tilting platform constrain every micro-choice. Micro-setting triumph: the kaleidoscope’s mirrors and the arrow tip literally refract the stakes into the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Mal notices what a cart-glider would. Only nit: no smell/taste of acid, but the visual-mechanical density is so complete the omission is forgivable.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.1)
    The archive’s “ghost-light” and degrading photos act as micro-setting that constrains her access and mirrors her own fading. Sensory selection is POV-driven: she notices holographic timelines and static edges, not tech specs. The patch functions as recurring object-as-setting, charging the final image when it “materializes in her palm.” Spatial choreography stays clean—no floating cameras or impossible reaches.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    The impossible apple trees rooting between sea and sky are not postcard color but a living constraint: their blossoms later mirror the families’ possible reconciliation, charging the final image. The fragment and vintage mirrors function as micro-setting that literally refracts choice; removing either would collapse the mechanics of empathy-mapping. Spatial choreography is flawless—Maren moves “between mirrors” while ice cracks below, the upward/downward vectors tightening breath-space. Sensory selection stays urgent: only visual and haptic detail (warm crystal) survive until the blossoms exhale a scent of thaw.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    The drift-ice marina is not backdrop; the creak of boats against unmelted slabs dictates the tempo of every beat. The parasol’s ivory tip functions as micro-setting: its steady erosion tracks the months she stays, charging the final image. Cold, diesel, and salt are filtered through Vera’s new sensorium—she hears dissolution in every surface. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Selective, POV-filtered imagery—taillights swallowed in fog, copper leaves stripped by autumn—grounds mood without tourist clutter. The amber pavilion functions as micro-setting that literally colors every beat and charges the final image. Vineyard rows provide tactile parallelism (stress-forced fruit) and spatial choreography is clean as they walk down together at dawn. No weather clichés; every sensory note bends back to theme of beautiful mismatch.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.4)
    The kinetic parapet’s metallic adjustments underfoot constrain Senna’s descent and later supply the sand used in the consecration circle—setting-as-tool. The murmuring pavilion breathes, guiding her to listen to pauses, not words. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through a line-walker’s peripheral discipline; world rules stay consistent without exposition. Micro-setting (granite stone) becomes the altar where meaning crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lavender/metal juxtaposition is tactile and purposeful: purple scent softens rusted edges, guiding the townspeople’s willingness to stay. The factory door-table and vines-as-arches evolve from backdrop to active symbol, constraining where they can draw and what can be built. Micro-setting (dove-gray case, photographs) functions as portable altar, charging the final archival act.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    The library functions as tuning fork: the chandelier crystal’s hum and dawn light constrain Elara’s method of listening and charge the final image. Shadowed stacks and “amber radiance” are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve with the beat; spatial choreography remains clean in a single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    Fog garden functions as micro-setting that actively erases orientation, forcing the chalk counter-inscription; the driftwood pointers are tools whose “vanishing points” literalize the stake. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: salt-heavy air, chalk dust against coat, sound of gulls mixed with highway hiss—each filtered through a man who experiences time eroding. Final image of tide taking the markers tomorrow is environment charging the closure. One hairline slip: “magnetic tape unspooling” metaphor is lovely but momentarily physics-bends fog; waiver granted under poetic license.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Titanium struts, brass blur, thin alpine light—selective sensory triad anchors immediacy. Observatory height and shifting bedrock constrain the recalibration imperative; the orrery itself becomes micro-setting that charges closure. Spatial choreography clean: bench, dome aperture, Chen’s shoulder. No exposition dump; world rule (lunar decay) learned through telescope and seismograph. 9+ gate met: tool (orrery hand) directly shapes final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.0)
    The floating mountain hospice is more than postcard: its cloud-drift courtyards mirror the liminal space between life/death and supply the “particular quality of light” that cues Maya’s agency. The broken vinyl shard functions as micro-setting—tactile, spatially tracked, and finally rejoined—charging the closure image. Sensory economy is sharp: oxygen cannula rasp, bow-scrape as pancake-stir rhythm, scent shift from antiseptic to “something green and beginning.” Radiant haven remains metaphorical rather than constraining tactical choice, capping short of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    The floating nocturnal observatory is more than postcard: its frozen gears, brass telescope, and stone foundation each constrain Mira’s next tactile move. Micro-setting triumph is the keyhole shaped exactly like the key’s teeth—an environmental detail that literally unlocks the climax. Spatial choreography stays clean as Mira moves from telescope to journal to orrery. Only gap: we get no sensory cue for how the isle “feels” when daylight returns—no temperature lift, wind shift, or weight change.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hedge maze geography is sketched sparsely but tracks; secret garden’s impossible flora (roses “colors that had no names”) functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—Marianne must accept unnatural rules to proceed. Atmosphere of copper-honey air and warm tooth grounds tension in body. Weather not relevant; omission harmless. Idiom consistent with rural-English vibe. Setting details integrated through action (following instructions, tasting air, picking up tooth).

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grotto’s serpentine mist, tide-smoothed stone table, and light-catch angles actively constrain how glass must be placed—setting is tool, not backdrop. Micro-setting rule met: sea-glass shards function as portable celestial surrogates, their curved surfaces dictating where dawn beams can land. Sensory hierarchy filters through Maren’s astronomer eye—she notices refraction indices and color temperature, not tourist geography. Final amber piece placement is spatially tracked and charged, passing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    The data-center-turned-moss-garden is not backdrop but active constraint: soft footing forces slow, reverent motion; green-filtered light sanctifies the encounter; melting drips provide the metaphoric map Maya trades for absolution. Spatial choreography is clean—Chen “navigating the moss-carpeted pathway” shows us the exact moment external space shapes internal stakes. The amber pendant and the dripping icicles function as micro-settings that constrain choice: both are handled on-page and their final pairing reconfigures meaning. Environment, tool, and body converge to charge the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ruined lighthouse, salt-poisoned earth, and invasive thorns are selectively sketched yet constrain choice (paths converge, only one exit). The spiral shell fragment functions as micro-setting: handled twice, its jagged edge literalizes the cost of memory. Mist is not backdrop but medium—figures “move against the current of dissolution” inside it. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: mathematic curves of shell, tactile press to temple, final pocketing—each tactile engagement advances the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    The brass-and-vine loom is rendered as a tactile micro-setting that literally constrains every turn; its copper wire tension decides the harmonic pitch. Dawn light evolves from “pale” to “true,” mirroring the land’s revival. Spatial tracking is clean—vine from soil to framework to fruit—no impossible positions. Meets the 9+ gate: the tool charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    Frozen orchard functions as micro-setting that constrains every move: frost limits finger exposure, dictates slow choreography, and preserves photon traces in silver paper. The crater’s perpetual twilight creates the “world holds its breath” clock that compresses usable hours. Sensory hierarchy obeys Vera’s alchemical lens—she notices electromagnetic whispers before color, starlight before snow. Final image of maps sealed in cambial hollow fuses body, tool, and environment into one charged object.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marble is handled as both mirror and archive: its “polished finish” guides Marcus’s measuring ritual and ultimately supplies the reflective canvas for the climax. Sensory selection is urgent—torch smoke, brass corrosion, moonlit channels—never tourist catalog. Micro-setting (the cavern’s geometric centre) literally dictates where the timer must be placed for the echo-bloom, so environment constrains tactics. One slip: the “underground streams still run clean” is told once and never used again, a missed opportunity to let water reflection double the motif.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bronze grotto functions as micro-setting: its walls supply the mineral substrate that lets burdens crystallize, and the starlight shafts provide the exact angles needed for calcification. Sensory detail is selective—sound is “shingled hush,” touch is “miner’s exhaustion seeping like condensation”—each filtered through the weaver’s perceptual bias. Spatial choreography stays coherent; the burner remains center-stage, and the seventeen crystals form a legible mandala. The environment actively constrains the magic system rather than merely decorating it.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    The loft’s rain-drummed skylight and ash block function as micro-setting: weather and grain steer every beat—droplets lens the light that guides her first cut, growth rings map years of marriage/drought. Final image of palm-shadow through translucent wood is environment-as-tool constraining perception. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room lapse.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    The kinetic lagoon is not backdrop; its upward spirals mirror Mira’s suspended want and finally grant purchase for the ghost’s walk—environment constrains the climax. Crystal platform, broken camera teeth, and cloud-stairs are tactile, re-used anchors. Sensory selection narrows to touch (wheel teeth catch skin) and hearing (music returns) at the exact beat of merger, charging the final image. No physics drift; world rules remain internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    Cracked dome starlight, cotton-candy ghosts, and shelf-mushrooms are selective, sense-rich details filtered through an engineer’s gaze. The terminal’s evolving “shadow infrastructure” is both metaphor and literal constraint that shapes her hydroponic plan. Micro-setting (sextant in her palm, condensation on blueprints) repeatedly guides choice. Final image of refracted light on crystalline windows charges the closing beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Crystal forecourt functions as micro-setting: its hum answers her whisper, constraining the choice to confess and later to sketch. Rain-soaked stones and suspended droplets mirror her stalled internal gears, then evolve as dawn brightens to reflect decision. Spatial choreography is immaculate—kneel, unpack, sketch, repack—no floating props. The 9+ gate is missed only because the final image does not weaponize a concrete environmental detail for closure; the sanctuary stays atmospheric rather than tactical at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.0)
    Micro-setting (sundial, canal water) constrains choice when the brass warms and water glows, charging the closure. Selective sensory hierarchy—“half-light,” “brass face catching what little remained”—mirrors epistemic uncertainty without tourist overload.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    The golden dock radiating warmth against snow is instantly cinematic yet filtered through Mira’s calloused palms; every plank and frayed fiber is judged by its utility to her archive. Fog functions as acoustic insulation, forcing attention inward to the hush that parallels hermetic knowledge. Micro-setting triumph: the rope itself becomes topography—coves of oilcloth, headlands of birch-bark script—guiding her final choice to reseal rather than expose.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    The autumn garden is not backdrop but prosthetic memory: skeletal roses force Maren to ask about the daughter, and the wind-scattered leaves literally write the first draft of the obituary. Micro-setting—the thread extracted from a pre-war map—constrains the closing gesture: only that specific red strand can literalize the Duchess’s “return route.” Spatial choreography is flawless: from fog-bound quay to desk lamplight, every move is tracked through Maren’s biased noticing (scent first, visual second). The palace carpet’s missing cities echo the daughter-shaped absence, charging the final image without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.1)
    The suspended palace—chains, stalactites, excavation tremors—actively pressures choices: every shudder reminds that the mechanical world is boring upward. The crystalline wall Cael touches doubles as sensor and synapse, anchoring the palace’s “dream” in tactile detail. Micro-setting (brass incubator, velvet-wrapped egg) constrains the assembly action and reappears in the final metallic feathers. Environment, body, and tool jointly charge the closing image; without the palace’s sway the song would lack its industrial echo.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.0)
    Lagoon’s obsidian basin and cloud-migration timeframe act as micro-setting that literally suspends the black sand—environment constrains the final tactile ritual. Sensory hierarchy favors touch (cool water, sand through fingers) over visual catalog. Spatial choreography tracks Elena’s slow entry and waist-deep stance without drift. Weather progression (“clouds continued their migration”) mirrors internal thaw, charging final image.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    Fountains, leaning buildings, dry basins, migrating geese—every environmental detail is filtered through Mira’s surveyor gaze and mirrors her cognitive state. The seven-fountain constellation constrains the unlocking sequence; the stained-glass box micro-setting charges the final image. Weather (autumn pause) affects timing and goose flight, hence choice. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography tight.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Nebula garden is not wallpaper; its luminous petals constrain how help can be given (light without fire) and supply the rescue resource. Micro-setting of the failing pod is sketched with sensory economy (“dying life support,” “viewport”) and stays consistent. Spatial choreography clean: Keeper materializes, palm-garden visible, light transferred. The brass gear’s final drift externalizes the rule that measurement alone fails—object charges closure image under Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Greenhouse glass, copper light, and monarch wings create a consistent chromatic filter that mirrors internal shift from rusted isolation to migratory cohesion. Ribbon functions as micro-setting: handled in every beat, its inscribed verses steer choices. Dusk timing narrows usable daylight, pressuring the final teaching session. Final image—her pen on the ribbon—charges the whole space as workshop of shared grief.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tidal obsidian ridge is not backdrop but tool: its twice-daily disappearance mirrors Maren’s buried truth, and the black glass shelves literally guide her descent at the end. Sensory detail is selective—brass dust taste, iron stair chill—filtered through her horological precision. The micro-setting of the pendulum bob itself becomes terrain she must carve, constraining her final choice. No slippage in spatial choreography; environment is lived-in and tactically active.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cobalt silo functions as embodied setting-object: its peeled spirals mirror tapestry border and physically direct Marta’s lantern-lit decoding session. Velveteen darkness inside smothers sound, forcing tactile tracing of symbols—constraining how discovery happens. Moonlit cemetery gate glimpsed from car exterior supplies orienting beacon; cobalt structure’s cosmic-finger image charges the final rooftop stargaze beat. Setting matters to tactics; no micro-object apart from sovereign case, so 9+ gate fails.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.3)
    The obsidian spire, geothermal warmth, and frozen lake constrain every move—without the vents the lake would freeze, without the crystal circuitry the quill would not write. Micro-setting of the quill itself (polarized-light mineral ink) directly enables the climax. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Maren notices fracture-shard light and mineral scent because they bear on her task. Final image of starlight reflected off ice recharges the opening vista, now reweighted by the document she carries.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ember alcove, shortwave dial glow, and mist-pressed window constrain attention and supply the only light source that makes the phosphorescent dust legible; spatial choreography is clean, sensory hierarchy mirrors Elena's copyist priorities, and the micro-setting directly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Gallery-as-framing-device constrains every beat: rocking chair’s perpetual motion, meditation garden’s ash-catcher stones, fog that erases outer walls. Porcelain-mask eye-slits act as micro-setting that literally reframes visible art and triggers Elena’s stance shift. Tactile handling of charcoal, gold lacquer edges, and ash grains roots abstraction in sensory body. Setting evolves from promise of preservation to site of deliberate dissolution, mirroring internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    The drowned city is sketched through functional descent layers—quarantine, loot, foundation—each tied to story function rather than postcard tourism. Water height, candle perimeter, and the dry platform act as immediate geography that shapes who can sit and what can be saved. The chronometer cog doubles as micro-setting, its brass teeth catching flame-light to signal precision amid decay. Sensory economy favors touch and sight, filtered by Marcus’s scavenger practicality.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.3)
    Velvet library, amber windows, and the zitter rosette are sensuously anchored and return in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Selective auditory focus (“sound-dampening walls”) directly enables the subtraction-of-noise method, so setting constrains tactic; autumn leaves pressed like manuscripts provide a POV-filtered visual that marries season to theme without catalogue excess.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.3)
    Rusted greenhouse, corroded glass, soil flakes give tactile anchor and mirror societal decay. Stewardship details—pruning for beauty not yield—show occupation-to-stance link. Celestial triangle remains visual only, never limits action; weather absent, distance inside greenhouse fuzzy. Setting constrains choices lightly, charges final sunrise image adequately for mid-band excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    The copper-warm coils, lacquer box of gold-leaf bees, and nectar dusk light are returned at closure, reweighting “efficiency vs. wonder.” The tower deck constrains the conversation—no escape from the site of failure—and the matchbox micro-prop is handled twice, focusing attention. Environment specifics directly shape the decision to abandon optimized code.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tideline, Kettering porch, and bay streetlights are not backdrop; they constrain access (she can only place, not enter) and supply the orris root and hush-shard that charge the ending. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Mara’s nose finds violets, her eyes catch “deliberate patterns” in weeds—details others dismiss. Weather/environment evolve causally: dusk hush literalizes into the shard that cuts the constant noise. Micro-setting of the windowsill becomes the altar where meaning crystallizes; remove it and the exhalation has no stage.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    The garden’s ‘coral colonize what humans once called monuments’ is not mere postcard beauty; the foxglove ampoule lodged between pedestal stones literally cracks open the past and future. Spatial choreography stays clean—Marina floats before the statue, hand near bag, bubbles spiral upward—no impossible positions. The anemone-dressed marble fish function as micro-setting that mirrors the living death theme. Weather is pressure: dwindling oxygen is the ticking clock that narrows every sensory detail to immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.7)
    The Escher-esque staircase and body-as-micro-setting constrain every move; “cold stone against legs” grounds abstract space. Sourceless light and echo create texture without checklist overload. Setting evolves: step → void → office desk, each shift causally linked to her decision. Dice as recurring object charges final image, but environment never alters tactics as much as psyche; hence 9+ gate missed.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rooftop greenhouse is not backdrop but respirator—humidity, orchid perfume, and smog press against glass to shape every breath Mara takes. The moon-tipped brush functions as micro-setting: its moon-crescent glint and erased characters dictate what can (and cannot) be painted, charging the final canvas image. Saffron pigment’s quiet warmth is returned as environmental counter-tone against toxic amber smog, a sensory pairing that tightens theAccumulative/Textural pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grotto’s perpetual mist, ice-sealed thoroughfares, and cliff-face hives are tactile and POV-filtered: Celeste notices damp before it ruins pigment, smells rot beneath rosewater. The emerald lens operates as micro-setting, its color shift literally revealing fracture lines that guide the communal thaw. Spatial choreography is clean—kitchen → corridor → artisans’ quarter—bodies and bread tracked without drift. Environment constrains every choice: cold halts glass kilns, dictates lens use, and turns bread into rationed monument. Final image of hairline cracks seen through tinted glass marries outer landscape to inner reconfiguration, meeting the 9+ gate for setting-charged closure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Environment is not postcard: spiral stairs’ cold stone guides her descent, lighthouse beam carves “sweeping geometries” that externalize her war on linear time. The hunger stone’s wet letters and cracking underfoot constrain the final beat—when it splits, the world-rule rewrite is grounded in physical cost. Micro-setting supremacy: the yoyo’s floating magnetic axle and 4-D string are rendered through tactile manipulation, not exposition. Tide as clock provides live countdown, tightening the final initiation.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.3)
    Carnival funhouse is sketched with compact, night-side sensory detail (warped glass, dust in moonlight) that mirrors internal distortion without overt nudging. Micro-setting of the clasp works harder: its silver warmth against throat charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays intact in the single location. Economy is good; no filler landmarks.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    The floating orchard is no postcard: salt-soaked bark, copper wire disappearing into black water, tilt underfoot—all tactile and choice-shaping. The xylophone mallet (grandmother’s banister) functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when the last chord fades to silence, tying heirloom loss to present salvation. Sensory hierarchy follows crisis: during vortex approach, visual fractals and bone-felt vibration dominate; smell/taste recede—exactly what narrowed perception would filter. Spatial choreography is clean: west anchors dropped, east raised, platform tilts eastward, vortex fixed three miles northeast—no impossible drift.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bleached turtle bone, sun-hammered brightness, and hairline fracture function as micro-setting that literally constrain movement and charge the final image. Sensory selection is filtered through a cartographer’s eye: spirals, distances, geometry take precedence over tourist catalog. The gate’s rust and the crack’s exact path evolve causally with plot, guiding Maren’s choice to blow the whistle. Spatial choreography is flawless—shell plaza, sea-edge, turtle heart are tracked without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ivy-choked station is vivid and selective—green light, bird nests, cracked tiles—filtering through Elena’s goal-driven gaze. The rosebush works as micro-setting/timekeeper, its bare branch mirrored in the stripped myth. No spatial drift; props (satchel, climate case) are handled. The environment never actively constrains a tactical choice, so the 9+ gate is missed.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.1)
    The submerged pavilion is not backdrop but tool: water pressure limits movement, dictates clock, and supplies the silt that yields the box; the green cathedral light mirrors Marcus’s mournful absorption. The inkwell’s patina and the seaweed “mourning veils” are selective, POV-colored details that charge the final sealing gesture. Spatial choreography is immaculate—steps, alcove, crack, box—every object is trackable. Environment constrains the closing choice: he must decide before the tide reclaims the space, welding setting to stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    Water-pressed marble table, mineral-slick floors, bloated spines—details are selective, sensory, and filter through Mira’s cataloguer gaze. The stamp-as-micro-setting constrains action: its hidden lettering and weight shape every discovery. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Final image recharges the same stamp, now repurposed as her pledge, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    The inverted island (roots in clouds, cranes that fall upward) is not scenery—it enables the only release mechanism Mei has. Basilica glass, lantern mirrors, gem cavity folds are tactile tools that constrain how she can act. The tea garden at dusk narrows sensory field to reflected amber and flicker, mirroring her exhausted attention. Final image of lantern light released from stored sun literalizes the larger rule: nothing is lost, only transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    The floating observatory is no backdrop: its creaking hull, cooling relays, and aurora-lit windows constrain every move and charge the final image. Frost, hiss, and magnetometer readings are filtered through Mira’s professional eye, never touristy. The geode doubles as micro-setting, its purple chambers literally handled under the desk lamp, refracting the theme back into her gaze. Sensory hierarchy is exact: pressure narrows to crystal, screen, window—objects that reweight meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    Observatory dome cracks and amber sunset provide immediate tactile anchor; drone console and brass chip handled with tactile specificity. Micro-setting of the chip-as-constellation cleverly fuses body/tool/environment. Final image of pulsing star trails reuses dome aperture, charging closure.

    Cobalt terrace at dusk functions as micro-setting: its railing and salt-sand shore constrain Mara’s nightly penance ritual and supply the driftwood that becomes her surrogate confessional. Color and tide mirror her shame without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography holds as Mara descends, kneels, rises—Elias remains twenty feet away, distance preserved. The terrace reappears as looming judgment in the final line, recharging the opening image.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    The parapet’s slick stone, whistling wind, and silvering mist are woven through action—feet halt, mist swirls, moon glints on brass—so environment guides stance and timing. Spatial choreography is flawless; groups approach east vs. west, halt at ten paces, cross at apex. The micro-setting (brass pull) also constrains choice, satisfying the 9+ gate. Only the valley below stays generic, a hair’s-breadth shy of fullest specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    Coastal kayak launch and Pacific swells are economically sketched; brass compass, worn smooth and warm against chest, functions as micro-setting that constrains the yes/no choice. Utility-pole metronome provides an idiosyncratic anchor that is later relinquished, charging final image. Dawn light and silver-bright water mirror emotional shift without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clean—bodies, kayaks, shore distance track across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lake’s living light physically steers the climax: Marcus sets the ball on the dock, and the “something luminous stirred” beneath—environment directly charging the stasis image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: ex-operative notices exit routes, classified ciphers, the ball’s weight—never tourist-catalog. Proxemics stay clean: dock, woman, water, tunnel mouth tracked without impossible jumps. One micro-setting error: “ancient yet trembling” is abstract, but it’s a lone clause in an otherwise tactile world.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    The silver orchard is no postcard: its cinnamon burns cold, its saffron threads glow like “captured sunset,” and these sensory anomalies directly enable the transformative act. Spatial choreography is clean—Mira kneels, crushes, stands changed; Tam’s ghost moves between trees without positional drift. The moonlit permanence functions as both atmosphere and constraint, charging the final hand-hold with otherworldly cost. One hairline slip: “invisible winds” is a placeholder phrase amid otherwise precise imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.3)
    The midnight glade above clouds is not backdrop but pressure engine: the rare air demands repentance and the luminous sap leaking from the cracked saucer literally materializes stolen time, forcing her recognition. Micro-setting inside the birthday cloth likewise constrains—every traced hand is a prior foreclosure that now dictates her promise. Sensory selection narrows under crisis: the star-flower scent “burns her throat” mirrors internal shame. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from ascent to descent with no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    Observation deck micro-gravity, magnetic cradle for the Tear, and fractal photo grid give tactile staging; ship’s seventeen rebirths act as iterative palimpsest that ultimately constrains the final transformation, satisfying micro-setting rule.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    Black sand’s retained volcanic heat literally steers her barefoot pacing and mirrors internal “perpetual heat” of giving; the warm exhale at the end recharges the motif. Lightning-bug mason jars function as micro-setting that constrains choice—each opened lid reduces her remaining “wealth.” Celestial alignment is not backdrop but clock that synchronizes with the surveyor’s urgency, tightening final release timing. Spatial choreography is flawless: path, beach, volcano station tracked without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    The white-stone fort at twilight is sketched in two sensory strokes yet immediately orients us; blackout narrows perception to touch and faint glow, mirroring secrecy. The bronze quill holder and half-painted sundial function as micro-setting—handled, tilted, re-interpreted under match-light—so environment physically constrains the next move. Spatial choreography stays clean: workshop door, corridor darkness, footsteps tracking outward. Weather and scale stay off-stage, appropriate for this length, but “luminous fort” never acquires a tactile lived-in detail beyond walls, so the world feels lightly wallpapered.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Tidal bluff, tide pools, aurora, and vial of star dust are not backdrop but instruments: the dust’s gravity wells steer the eels, the bluff’s geometry dictates stone placement. Sensory hierarchy obeys Korin’s precognitive filter—she sees magnetic fields, feels vanished friction. The setting constrains the final image: only here, only now, can the spiral complete and the eels sing. Micro-setting (star dust vial) literally bends light around her fingers, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Copper dome catching lightning, cloud-gap revealing the broken-promised city, timer’s metallic tick—each detail is filtered through Mara’s censored, altitude-seeking gaze. The storm constrains her ritual (writes only in flashes) and supplies the final image that recharges earlier lightning motif. Setting doubles as micro-tool: envelope slid into timetable becomes literal city map. No spatial float; bodies/props tracked cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    Glass atrium, brook murmur, and brass gears are filtered through Adelaine’s instrument-biased perception; light angles double as musical notation, tying setting to stakes. The Danish needle card acts as micro-setting—its harmonic grid literally scores the overture—constraining the final discovery. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies orbit the sundial without drift. Environment guides choice: light beams dictate when they can read each angle.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Corrugated metal “peeled back like a sardine can,” moonlight “liquid silver” spilling through—setting is tactile, specific, and filters through September’s bias toward fracture and neglect. The library itself constrains choice: only here can seeds survive heat, only under peeled roof can moonflowers root. Spatial choreography clean: Kai digs where dust is deepest; Mara sorts while crouched. Environment mirrors interior state without overt symbolism—roof hole = identity hole—yet never stalls action. Meets 9+ gate: the roof-gash recurs in final image, charging the blooming act.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    “Tidal arbor above the clouds” is never tourist exposition; the glass floor’s rolling vapor and useless compasses constrain every departure and splice decision. The broken anniversary clock functions as micro-setting—its frozen hands dictate her nightly ritual and the exact tempo she later hijacks. Sensory hierarchy is POV-loyal: she notices ivory cracks before passenger faces, smells projector ozone before cloud damp. Final image—starlight reflected in the glass floor beneath reunited feet—recharges the sky-as-sea motif with emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ridge flowers function as calendar and countdown, guiding both imagery and decision; the seed’s micro-setting (soil between blooms) constrains the final gesture. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Kima notices petals as seasonal code, not tourist spectacle. Spatial choreography is clear: kneeling, parting earth, pressing soil. Monsoon horizon supplies tonal mirror without overt symbolism. World rules stay consistent; no expository dump.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Post-storm islet, wet sand, salt air, and the driftwood table constrain the pacing—everything must be done before dusk, in full view of the mutable “cerulean” horizon that will later carry the thematic color. The brass compass re-appears in-hand, its trembling needle supplying micro-setting pressure. Bonsai tools and lace square act as portable “settings” whose spatial arrangements dictate every cut and pause. Only the 8.8 gate is missed because no object/environment finally blocks an alternative path; the horizon is evocative but not an active obstacle.

Environment directly enables the decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.3)
    The twilight viaduct isn’t backdrop but active crucible: its stone absorbs Mei’s love-threads, its rail hosts the pilgrim’s balance, its wisteria refracts Kwan Yin’s tear. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mei’s spiritual focus—perfume before sight, breath before speech—and narrows during panic to water rising in lungs. The camera obscura functions as micro-setting, inverting reality to reveal truth; its physical setup (“clicking softly,” “foggy lucidity”) grounds abstraction in tactile ritual. Final image of blooming wisteria drunk on released love proves environment charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    The living bridge garden functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: its roots weave geometric patterns where photographs are laid, its ravine dictates the bridge’s curve, and it reorganizes botanically in response to Lyra’s revelation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—moss-slick spans, flowering vines, warm paper—filtered through Lyra’s professional attention to geometry. The halo fragment’s embeddedness in the railing ties setting to object, and the final image (“walk these paths again”) charges the garden as temporal infrastructure. Environment directly shapes the climax and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    The abandoned prize center functions as micro-setting: decaying toys mirror lost joy, moonlight guides discovery, and the crooked prize wheel hides the arrow—each detail constrains choice. The piano bench isn’t just backdrop; its chromatic logic enables decoding, directly shaping tactics. Final image of “cracked and waiting” wasteland charges the theme: environment actively reweights liberation as cultivation, not mere escape. Sensory hierarchy (dust motes, hydraulic groans, rusted iron) reflects Mira’s urgency without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.4)
    The sunken greenhouse isn’t backdrop—it constrains choice (barnacled hulls limit movement, saltwater shapes root growth) and charges the final image (impossible fruit blooming as Mira releases memory). Aurora light guides her forge work, making color-song a literal tool. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: wind rattling masts and cellular death-songs narrow perception during climax. Every detail serves pressure, never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    Emerald Station’s green tiles, silvered rails, and liquid shadows aren’t backdrop—they constrain choice (platform seven as rendezvous) and charge closure (moonlight flooding platforms as Maya departs).

    The abandoned control room functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and charges choices: its ghostly panels justify Marcus’s habit of narration; its isolation enables his workshop; its repurposing signals his shift toward connection. The melting ice isn’t backdrop—it times his emotional thaw and echoes glassbreaking, binding environment to action. Sensory detail (grime-filtered light, groaning ice, molten glow) is filtered through Marcus’s craft and grief, never touristic. The sphere’s final radiance recharges the setting’s meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rusted library functions as micro-setting: its groaning beams mirror Maya’s fractured psyche, its dust-choked air heightens claustrophobia, and its shelves yield the seashell talisman. The stars above frame moral witness. However, while atmosphere is vivid and filtered through Maya’s stunt-double attention to structural instability, the setting doesn’t actively constrain a tactical choice—the cast decryption happens regardless of location. Thus, it charges the final image but doesn’t shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    The storm-tossed ridge fort isn’t backdrop—it pressures every choice: drowned roads, collapsed passes, muffled corridors. The oracle’s sodden robes and flaking booklet function as micro-settings that constrain action (she carries silence like a talisman). Weather and darkness actively shape tactics: the last star’s dimming tightens the timeline. Final image charges the setting—darkness becomes navigable terrain via silence.
