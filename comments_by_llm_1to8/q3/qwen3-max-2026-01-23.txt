  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    The canyon and frost patterns constrain the reflection beat and charge the final image through their "delicate cartography." Sensory detail is selective (cold sandstone, smoke taste, violet dawn, frost filaments) and filtered through crisis urgency. Spatial choreography is clean within the single location. The recurring frost motif links early signal to closure, though the body and ledger strip function more actively as micro-setting than the canyon itself in forcing choices.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    The winterglass conservatory is vividly anchored early with concrete sensory detail (enchanted glass, pale light, mossy stones) and constrains Elara's method—the thermally sensitive surface is essential to heat-mapping. The conservatory functions as both spatial ground and micro-setting tool: its unbroken glass charges the final image of mending spirits. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's priorities (vibration, visual color blooms) over auditory input. The setting participates in closure: frost melts where hands rest, literalizing emotional thaw.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    The underwater library is vividly rendered (coral-crusted shelves, bioluminescent fungi, obsidian door) and constrains Elias's work—he uses whalebone tweezers and navigates water-damaged texts. The shards' impossible occupation of paper dimensions supplies a tool-as-micro-setting that charges the final image when the mosaic beacon glows. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's professional focus. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the tide cycle.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.1)
    The terra-cotta arbor is anchored early and returns at closure, framing the covenant moment. The bell's physical detail (tarnished curve, silenced clapper, ribbon) charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective: "sun-warmed tiles," "violet dawn," "rain-slicked slope." The arbor and bell together constrain the final choice—Elara's tenderness with the clapper reflects the sanctuary of quiet they've built. Spatial choreography is clean across the ridge, creek, and ravines.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    The viaduct's wisteria, moonflower, and moss-veined stone are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Elara's artist eye. The camera obscura functions as micro-setting, constraining perception (inverted world) and enabling the discovery of the carved heart. Kwan Yin's tear physically channels sunset into the chamber, materially shaping the reveal. The environment supplies resources (stone heart reservoir, blossoms radiating) that charge the final image, lifting the score into the 7-band despite some decorative excess in the opening cascade.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    Vivid, selective sensory detail throughout ("dew-kissed paths," "obsidian pond," "silvery radiance"). The living bridges, maze geometry, and natural elements anchor setting effectively. The halo fragment and photograph function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across the nexus and pond. The garden's hyperbolic geometry constrains Elara's method and supplies the closure mechanism, elevating beyond postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    The abandoned carnival prize redemption center is vivid (dust motes, glass-eyed bears, faded tickets) and micro-setting (piano bench, hairline seam, baseboard carving) constrains and enables key actions (arrow retrieval, wall press). The bulldozer's shadow functions as a spatial-temporal anchor that tightens pressure. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through urgency. The setting charges the final image (vault revelation in the condemned wall) and shapes the foreman's shift from demolition to stewardship, meeting the Q3 9+ test of environment constraining choice and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sunken orchard, fractured glass dome, shipwrecks, and aurora create vivid, specific anchors filtered through Elara's synesthetic perception. The forge paradox (dry under the sea) charges the climactic beat. However, the environment does not constrain Elara's choices; she kneels, places the coil, and succeeds without spatial friction. The setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure, capping the score below 9-band entry despite strong sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.7)
    The emerald station and ivy-draped platform are vivid and consistent. The moonbeam jar as micro-setting constrains the reinterpretation beat, charging the floral arrangement reveal. Spatial choreography is clear (platform, bouquet, forest path). However, the station's "usually bustling" state and the midnight train's approach are ornamental—neither pressures Elara's choice or alters tactics at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    The abandoned control room is anchored early with vivid particulars (frost-rimed floor, grime-streaked viewport, skeletal consoles) and the glassblowing tools—blowpipe, marver, annealing oven—are integrated into action beats rather than catalogued. The setting's decay mirrors Elara's grief and provides the spatial frame for her ritual. However, the environment remains largely atmospheric; it does not meaningfully constrain her choices or supply a resource that alters the outcome. The cracked bookmark and glass dome function as charged objects at closure, but the control room itself could be swapped for any abandoned industrial space without structural loss. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("dust motes dancing," "liquid metronome"), and spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rusted library is vivid and returns at closure, but it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice. The oxidation trails guide discovery in one beat, and the vent provides a hiding spot, yet neither imposes a felt cost or alters Elara's tactics under pressure. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the roof climb and Silas's simultaneous search below stretch plausibility. The micro-setting (cast, shell, iron shard) is present but not leveraged to force trade-offs or charge the final image beyond decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.1)
    Spatial choreography is coherent (ridge, ramparts, courtyard, barracks, watchtower) and sensory detail is vivid and selective. The fort and its post-storm stillness supply atmosphere and constrain Elara's work to the precise timeframe when one star remains. However, the environment does not materially alter a choice or tactic; it provides backdrop rather than shaping the map's creation or its final charge. The booklet and stylus function more as tools than as micro-setting that reconfigures stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    The frozen courtyard is vividly detailed with "frost feathers," "skeletal silhouette," and "ice-locked fountain." Sensory specificity is strong and filtered through Unit Seven's calibrated sensors. The ice violin functions as micro-setting: its "paradox of stable ice" and sub-audible resonance directly enable the amalgamation catalyst, constraining and shaping the closure beat. The environment evolves causally—the breeze "absent in all prior loops" signals time now flows freely—and charges the final image of sentinel presence.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.1)
    The crystal forecourt is vividly established (rain-slicked cobblestones, quartz spires amplifying hum, moonlight projection) and constrains Elara's nightly method: she must position the lens on the central dais to catch moonbeam and ignite the crystals. The projection mechanic (lens + moon + crystal amplification) is specific and shapes the climactic turn. Sensory detail is dense ("harmonic hum," "ethereal luminescence") and filtered through Elara's reverent attention. However, the setting's social or access pressures remain implicit—no bystanders interrupt, no authority questions her use of the space—so the environment enables rather than complicates her goal, limiting its role in escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    The garden maze is vividly rendered—jasmine tangled with clematis, moss-stained bench, leaf-shaped niches—and the blooming/withering duality is consistent. The phoenix vine and the marble niche actively constrain Elara's ritual choices, and the living labyrinth sealing Kael's retreat charges the confrontation. Spatial choreography is clear (Elara on bench, Kael at path's edge, thorns coiling), and the yew hedge detail anchors the final image. The luck meter provides a world-rule anchor for the timeframe, though its mechanics remain abstract. Micro-setting (the bench, the marbles in the hedge) effectively functions as the stage for all key actions.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    The xenobiology research station, canyon ridge, and magnetic nexus are rendered with vivid sensory specificity (amber-to-violet sky, wind-scoured ridge, crystalline strands). The nexus itself constrains Kael's choice of timing (twilight) and shapes the climactic activation. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. However, much of the setting detail functions as evocative backdrop rather than applying immediate tactical pressure to Kael's moves; the station's interior and hangar are sketched but do not constrain the peak beat choices in the way the nexus does.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    The flooded opera house is vividly rendered with selective detail (waterlogged velvet, submerged pianos, tide-line willow) and the lantern's flicker creates atmospheric pressure. The water functions as both constraint (waist-deep, frigid) and symbolic medium, and the podium serves as a concrete anchoring point for the climactic act. However, the environment does not meaningfully narrow Elias's tactical options—he retrieves the program, places it, plays without spatial or material friction. The setting charges mood but does not force a choice or alter the outcome; it remains atmospheric rather than mechanically integral to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mountain weather station supplies concrete constraints: frost-rimed anemometers, barometer needle tremor, oak desk, and the logbook all participate in action rather than postcard description. The fever-thin air and melting ice drip create sensory anchors filtered through Elara's sharpened state. The aurora at closure charges the final image with "auroral sorrow," converting setting into emotional witness. Spatial choreography is clean (cabin interior, window, approaching squall) and the professional idiom (sensor failures, pressure dip, atmospheric chaos) reads plausible without over-exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tunnel is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (wet stone, rust, peeling ads, twisted rails). The beaded valve wheel functions as micro-setting and charges the final image when Leo turns it. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the descent. The "drowsy alertness" filters perception appropriately, and the valve's physical properties (cold, beaded spokes) constrain the revelation moment, meeting the 9+ gate criterion for environment shaping closure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory detail is vivid and sustained—moss cushions, wet paper, loam, black sand, phosphorescent flow—and the library's decay is specific. However, setting remains largely descriptive backdrop; no environmental constraint shapes a choice or tactic. The origami swan enables passage but is treated as a magical key rather than a resource with limits. Spatial choreography is clear, and the obsidian refuge anchors the middle sequence, but the environment does not pressure Elara's actions or charge the final image beyond aesthetic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sage Ridge's sagebrush scent, sun-warmed path, and the Heartwood Oak's root cradle provide concrete spatial grounding. The eclipse darkens the sky and birds fall silent, creating atmospheric pressure that supports the therapeutic turn. The baby hair curl—a micro-object—is handled twice and charges the final exchange. However, the environment does not constrain Elara's choices; it cooperates fully, serving as backdrop rather than obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.1)
    The silo is anchored early and returns with purpose: "curved walls," "east wall," "rusted ladder," "stone fireplace," and the final "cool metal wall" create spatial coherence. The tapestry fragment and half-burned diaries function as micro-setting that constrains the historian's probe and charges the closure image ("dragons watched, eternal"). The bronze light modulates from "aged bronze" to "gilding the tapestry fragment" at the end, subtly mirroring the thematic shift from emptiness to layered memory.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lighthouse and rocky island supply vivid sensory anchors—"granite teeth," "salt-stained study," "rose-gold light"—and the setting charges the closure: the door "open wide" transforms exile into harbor. Spatial choreography is clean (lantern room, iron stairs, gravel path, skiff), and micro-setting details (the oak desk, the stone) recur with reweighted meaning. The timeframe "after last orders" and dawn arrival create a contained pressure window. Minor issue: the restaurant owner's debt is mentioned but never dramatized, leaving one logistical element hanging without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dimensional anchor, loop pedal, and stained-glass window create a vivid micro-setting that constrains the ritual: the pedal functions as censer and the flickering window signals temporal threat. The palette's hidden latch is a tool that charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate's constraint requirement. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Kael's professional lens (loops, layered voice, muffled clarity), though the storm-wracked sea image feels slightly ornamental. Spatial choreography remains clean throughout the single-location scene.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glass spire and frozen lake are vividly anchored with selective sensory detail (misted breath on cold glass, rose-gold light, "upturned hush"). The mirrored horizon functions as both environmental feature and participatory element: it emerges at the precise dawn moment, doubles the spire into infinity, and "pulses with reflected light" as a visual metronome. The nautilus shell serves as micro-setting/tool, its logarithmic spiral constraining her mapping choices and charging the final image when it "felt warm, humming with completed score." Spatial choreography is stable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.1)
    The viaduct itself—rain-slicked stone, glowing surfaces, inverted walking—is vivid and charged early, grounding the opening. The labyrinth interiors (walls of laughter, chasms of sorrow, gardens of acceptance) remain generic metaphors without spatial coherence or tactical constraint; Elara scales and walks through them without physical friction. The tablet's warmth and glow are noted but do not affect handling or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cavern is vividly rendered—stone walls, hanging hides, copper wires, stretched membrane—and the "audibly muted sanctuary" functions as both atmosphere and thematic container. The drum itself becomes micro-setting, placed in her lap and felt as tactile pressure. The final image ("drum against her chest") charges closure by returning the object as a living presence. Spatial choreography is clean and the setting subtly mirrors her internal state without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    The courtyard is vividly anchored (jasmine, flagstones, wisteria arbor, sundial, oak weather station) and the dusk palette charges the tone. Spatial choreography is clear: gate → sundial → weather station → bench → horizon. The setting constrains choice by providing cover for "normalcy" performance and the wisteria arbor becomes the staging ground for encoding. The crimson clay grain—tagged to the quarantine zone—charges the final vial and breadcrumb tactic, micro-setting as pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.1)
    The grotto's spiral pattern, clay texture, and gnarled root anchor the action; the poet's hands trace grooves, tie the rope, and press the convergence point. Sensory detail is vivid (cool gritty clay, dust on cheek, warm pressure of energy beings) and filtered through the poet's priorities. The root enables the third-path choice, elevating setting beyond backdrop. Spatial choreography is clean. However, "energy beings" remain abstract; their "celestial sigils" and "chorus" are asserted rather than made tangible through grounded detail.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse with cracked glass and skeletal shipwrecks is vividly rendered and sensory detail is selective (drip of condensation, scent of charred wood). The setting pressures the sonic experiment: curved glass reflects sound, shipwreck ribs echo the melody. The mendicant's bowl as micro-setting object charges the final image when left "resting on the stone, a silent promise to return." Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.1)
    The amber grotto is vivid and purposeful: "fossilized resin walls glowed like captured sunset," "moss-carpeted hollows," light shifting "from gold to bruised violet." The petal constrains the central choice (subsume or discard) and the static sensation is consistently rendered. Spatial choreography is clean (grotto interior → ledge → outward). The setting charges the final image ("Deep within the grotto, amber resin held the memory") and the twilight-to-night progression mirrors Kael's transformation, satisfying the micro-setting standard.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    The garden setting (oaks, stars, salt breeze, wrought-iron stands) is vividly rendered and filters through Elias's broker eye ("forged bills of lading"). The bench, ivy, and lantern anchor micro-choreography, and the environment subtly mirrors the theme (forgotten poetry volumes/silent contributors). The locket's discovery relies on the ivy's proximity, giving the setting minor causal weight. No spatial confusion. The harbor walk at dawn closes the frame neatly, charging the final image with scale.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.7)
    The crystalline orchard, crater, and obsidian arbor are vividly rendered with purpose-driven sensory detail (light, chime, volcanic glass). Spatial choreography is clean—Elara moves through the orchard, finds Kael, and they reach the clearing together. The setting contributes atmospheric pressure but does not constrain a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; the arbor is discovered, not used to solve a problem Elara helped create.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rooftop canal system, crystalline towers, Chronos Spire, and Confluence plaza are vivid and persistent. Spatial choreography is clean: skiff drifts, canals still, petal suspends. The pendant functions as a micro-setting object that enables the time-sculpting choice, constraining her method and charging the final image when it "rests against her chest" as testament. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (frost on raindrop, spider's web tension during the Pause). Minor deduction: much description serves atmosphere over choice—towers "scrape the sky," canals "weave," but these details do not alter Elara's tactics or complicate her success.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cavern orchard is vividly particular: mineral-drip sustenance, stalactite ceiling, mosaic stepping stone with crushed abalone and lapis. The mosaic constrains Elara's method (she must kneel, place the eyes in chip-formed sockets) and the final drop charges closure by breaking the silence. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered. Minor slip: the "invisible threads binding stone to tree, past to present" drifts toward declarative metaphor rather than concrete perception.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    The library's spatial choreography is precise: crawl space, rope ladder, false panel, pipe chase, ventilation grate, circulation desk. The dawn light constrains Elara's timing (6:18 AM sunbeam placement), and the city's flickering lights bookend the action, creating atmospheric pressure. The ferromagnetic tape fragment's metallic surface catches light, charging the final image. The body-as-setting (bare feet, footholds, thumb tracing) functionally narrows her movements and adds tactile specificity. The "sapphire hush" recurs purposefully, modulating from profound quiet to shared sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mossy trellis is grounded early with vivid, selective detail ("emerald velvet," "moss-thickened trellis") and returns at closure, constraining Elara's final choice to plant hostas and touch the wood. The setting shifts subtly (storm-damaged areas, bent willow, stone bench) and these micro-settings alter her tactics. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional lens (clover seeding, moss thriving), and spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tidal island constrains choice (mudflats reveal paths only at low tide, watchtower isolation) and charges the final image (tide flooding mudflats as Elias sleeps). Micro-setting works well: the amber brooch cool against skin, heartstone warm in hand, mossy lintel where Elara sits. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("salt-bleached shipwrecks," "air thick with wet stone and blooming thrift"). The unearthed ravine functions as setting-as-pressure, revealing foundations that enable the exchange. Post-water-wars world logic remains consistent (levees shattered, mainland flooded, survival economy).

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.1)
    The musical crystal cave is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail ("amethyst spires," "selenite forests," "delicate chimes") and the cave pearl functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear, and the cave's luminescence modulates with the ritual. However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choices; the overlapping shadows are described but do not function as a tactical obstacle or resource that alters her approach. The environment remains atmospheric rather than pressuring.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ivory stones, sea-green verdigris, salt-damp air, and leaded window establish a tactile, humid coastal world. The trumpet valve as micro-setting constrains Elara's first restorative act and charges the pier scene, satisfying the 9+ gate. However, spatial choreography during the week of offerings (market square, archive window, pier) is narrated in summary rather than grounded beats, reducing immediacy. The setting supports atmosphere but doesn't apply sustained pressure on choices beyond the valve restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.9)
    The starlit vault, mist, collapsed dome, and ivy-choked booth are vividly rendered and create strong atmosphere. The map functions as a micro-setting object that constrains the climactic choice (she must surrender it). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (ozone, wet stone, forgotten flowers). However, spatial choreography weakens at the booth: the mechanics of sliding the map through the slot and the booth's interior void are not clearly visualized, and the rain-pool reflection's spatial relationship to the booth and Elara's position is unclear. The setting charges the final image but does not force a tactical adaptation beyond the initial offering.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stargazer's tower, meridian line, and whale migration below create a vivid spatial anchor with selective sensory detail (salt wind, ink-dark sea, lantern light on brittle vellum). The flagstone compartment and telescope contribute tactile specificity. The micro-setting (tile on meridian line, alignment with constellation) directly enables the vision sequence and the final transcription, charging the closure when Liam reads the vellum on the wall. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.1)
    The escondite is vividly rendered with amethyst, citrine, bioluminescent fungi, and layered sensory detail. However, it functions as backdrop; the crystals do not constrain any choice. The spatial tear and library are told as spectacle without tactile interaction. Spatial choreography remains clear. The final image ("dawn's light filtered through the apex, casting rainbows") reprises the opening prismatic motif with reweighted warmth, narrowly reaching micro-setting qualification for a resonant close.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prep room is rendered with strong sensory specificity (fluorescent hum, stainless steel, antiseptic sterility cut by aged oak and iron-rich ink) and the vintage ink pot functions as both tool and recurring object. The setting constrains Elara's choice to prepare her father herself and the "deathly vitality" tone is anchored in the room's paradox. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the dawn stained-glass window at closure offers a visual shift that supports the threshold moment.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bonsai labyrinth, lamp, and workshop nest concrete particulars within the POV's studious attention. The gold leaf applied "days prior" and the shimmering forest at closure charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint. Sensory hierarchy (filtering sparrow chirps, focusing on hum) reflects professional priority. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the micro-setting (lamp, notepad, bench) structures the charting ritual that anchors the entire arc.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    The container labyrinth is vivid and specific: "steel cliffs," "moss-streaked containers," "narrow canyons" create a concrete maze. The setting functions as micro-archive, each "dent and scratch a sentence," and the tidal rhythm structures the protagonist's routine, pressuring his twice-daily retreat. The poison label is discovered "caught in chain-link near Pier Seven," grounding the object in spatial detail. The setting does not constrain a choice at closure—he simply melts back into the maze—so the piece stays below the 9+ gate, but the environment charges mood and reinforces the theme of erasure and layering without becoming postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.7)
    The observatory (stone dome, splintered workbench, floorboards) and the cliff's wind-scoured edge anchor early and create atmosphere. The half-finished cello functions as micro-setting, constraining Elara's method and charging the final image when she places the shell upon it. Sensory detail—"salt-tinged breath," "cherry tobacco," "dust on her cheeks"—is vivid and filtered through memory-driven perception. The setting supports closure by housing the cello and shell convergence, meeting the 9+ gate, though spatial choreography remains minimal (single room, minimal navigation).

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    The carnival raft setting is vivid and distinct: gondolas, fire-eaters, rope bridges, calliope music, salt-bleached wood. Spatial choreography is clean as Kael moves between rafts, Ferris wheel, spice market, clock tower. The graffiti—nautilus shell as archive map, seven-star dolphin marking safe houses—uses micro-setting (walls, surfaces) to constrain and enable the encoding method. The foundation stone chip and charcoal pouch function as tools that charge the final stance, pushing this into the upper 6-band under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.1)
    The moonlit crater rim is vivid and selective: "frozen gravel," "sharp crescent," "bowl-shaped scar," "billion-year-old rock layers ablaze in hues of rose, amber, and deep violet." Sensory hierarchy reflects Kael's professional eye and emotional state; the dawning hush is rendered through cessation of sound, tightening perception. The environment constrains choice (biting wind, deep cold test his resolve) and charges the final image (the glowing rim imprinted on memory). Minor: the chemical capsule's spatial setup could be sharper, and "ethereal silver light" leans generic, but the setting drives pressure and payoff without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mist-coated depot, cedar-scented shop, and especially the slate basin fed by the copper heron spout are vividly rendered and specific. The water feature directly constrains Elara's method—she reads refraction to diagnose the fracture—meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Sensory detail is filtered through her blindness (warmth/shadow on skin, vibration through floor), anchoring POV bias. The spatial choreography remains clear across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting details are vivid and selective: crystalline ice dust, frost-rimed planks, grimy window, rusted beams all create tactile atmosphere. The outpost's corroded infrastructure and the frozen lake pressure Elara's isolation and supply her tools (window condensation, shadow-casting geometry). The single-location constraint and recurring objects (window, glass, stove) charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the environment actively enables her method.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ancient archway functions as both frame and setting anchor, appearing at opening and closure with amber-light transformation that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (archway, cobblestones, well, forge, square), and sensory detail is vivid (chamomile/rosemary, rain-scented stone, hearth-baked bread). The ebony tuning fork and cobblestones constrain Elara's method (rhythm via footsteps), satisfying the micro-setting allowance. However, the setting does not impose a hard choice or resource limit—it receives her action without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    The underwater temple is vividly rendered with bioluminescent fungi, obsidian dais, and coral archways. The oxygen gauge and crystal vial function as micro-setting elements that constrain choices throughout. Spatial choreography remains clear across the sanctum. The "gathered hush" functions atmospherically but could more directly shape a tactical choice to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, copperlight beam, and narrow door with scuffs are vivid and purposeful. The lattice salvaged from the confessional constrains the reveal method and charges the final image. Spatial choreography (iron stairs, beam rotation, moth hovering) remains clear. Minor slip: the prison's occupation and daily operations remain vague, reducing grounding during the standoff.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.1)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly rendered with specific flora (silverbark trees, venom-thorn vines, shadow-rose, Heartwood) and the carved stone bead functions as both tool and constraint, pressed against bark to trigger awakenings. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("honey-scent flooded the air," "emerald leaves erupted"), and the micro-setting (body + bead + plants) charges the final image when the bead remains pulsing in the Heartwood's roots. However, the endless night and winter-cracked fields remain atmospheric backdrop rather than spatial constraints that alter tactics; the bride moves freely without environmental resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.1)
    The red canyon labyrinth is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (wind-softened spirals, crimson walls, dust-filled basin). The ghost orchid's fragrance recurs purposefully, and the basin crack that births the orchid constrains Elara's final choice—she ties the thread to a living emblem rather than restoring the vanished garden. Spatial choreography remains clear across alcoves and the central chamber. Minor density: some descriptions (falcon smoothed to anonymity) add texture without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered with specific, purposeful detail: roots cradling bones, moss-covered epitaphs, apple blossoms mixing with damp earth. The setting directly constrains Elara's choices—she selects a branch from a sapling "growing defiantly near the tomb" and uses moss on the oldest stone for alignment. The sundial base and the tomb threshold function as micro-setting that charges the final image when the shadow completes its journey.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.1)
    The golden arcade is vividly rendered with nano-forged alloy, holographic koi, and real sparrows establishing futuristic nostalgia. Sensory detail is purposeful (ozone, jasmine, polished floor) and the chalk on the floor constrains Elara's final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement. However, spatial choreography is vague—her movements from standing to kneeling to the mailbox lack clear positional anchors, and the arcade's layout remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt observatory is anchored early with cerulean halls, wind-scoured ridge, and celestial machinery. Autumn leaves and mist frame entry and exit. The eternal candle and Elara's alcove provide micro-setting that constrains her method (proximity to flame required). Spatial choreography is clean through the halls-to-doors sequence. However, the "echoed silence" and "cobalt" recur as atmospheric labels without altering a key choice; the setting supports mood but does not force a tactical trade-off at closure, capping the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.7)
    The mangrove labyrinth and Elara's hut are vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (phosphorescent spirits, cypress stilts, damp wood/sage). Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. However, the environment does not constrain Kael's choices or alter his tactics; it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure. The shard, though handled twice (placed on windowsill, given to Kael), does not materially shape his decision—it serves as lens and talisman without limiting options. Micro-setting allowance met, but closure charge from environment is decorative rather than causal, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mist-clad atrium at twilight is anchored early and modulates from sterile to sanctuary as pressure shifts. The brain coral fragment functions as micro-setting, warming in her palm and mirroring human worry's complexity; placing it beside the cast charges the final image. Spatial choreography (Anahera beside sleeping Leo, her proximity to the cast) remains clear. The atrium's glass ceiling and swirling mist supply atmospheric specificity without overwhelming the beat. One slip: the setting does not meaningfully constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it pressures tone but not decision.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ruined orchard district, fog-as-film, and the courtyard beneath the stone-sparrow archway are vividly rendered and purposeful. Sensory detail (pearlescent fog, moss-eaten bench, damp wall) is selective and filtered through Elara's artistic perception. The fog functions as both atmosphere and mechanism (exposed film), constraining her method and charging the final image. The fragment's ceramic coolness and the projected sun's warmth layer tactile and visual senses effectively. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The fog evolves from shroud to gentle veil, reflecting her internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Sound Wave Garden is vividly rendered with concrete sensory anchors: crystal chimes painting ripples, silver-leafed trees humming notes, resonant stones pulsing amber. The setting constrains the central beat—reflected sound focusing through the nickel onto the mural—and charges the final image of Elara humming the mural's melody as trees harmonize. However, spatial choreography during the key moment (droplet-to-dewdrop-to-nickel-to-mural geometry) remains impressionistic rather than legible, and no environmental cost or access limitation shapes Elara's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.7)
    The greenhouse is vividly rendered ("humid air, thick with the scent of nightshade and pinned morpho butterflies") and recurs throughout. However, it functions primarily as backdrop; the space doesn't constrain a choice or meaningfully alter tactics. The gourd seed is planted and discussed, but the soil and tools remain decorative rather than tactically essential to the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.1)
    The gargantuan shell is vividly rendered with pearlescent walls, nacre slopes, and aperture, and it evolves from passive refuge to resonant partner, directly shaping the closure image when the light blooms in spiral patterns. The galaxy postcard functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and pressed into the glowing wall at the turn. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., "smooth as forgotten promises," "dappled happiness"), and the shell's curve physically constrains his posture each evening, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping choice and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.1)
    The opal library and cracked bamboo tube supply vivid, purposeful detail that charges multiple beats and the final image. Spatial choreography is clear—atrium, oculus, concentric spirals—and the crack constrains method. Minor deduction: the "museum of extinct feelings" frame remains decorative; it does not limit access or alter a choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.9)
    The extinct language archive is anchored early with dust-moted silence, lamplight, and shadowed corridors. Spatial choreography is clear (desk to antechamber to pre-dawn window). The glass ink well and Codex function as micro-setting objects that constrain the protagonist's method and charge the final image (the glowing translation on cold stone). However, the archive itself remains generic; no specific architectural feature or sensory detail unique to this place pressures Elara's choices or alters her tactics during the climactic translation.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.1)
    The crumbling amphitheater and volcano's "breath" are vivid and pressure the design challenge; the surveyor's chain and spectrometer anchor tactile action. Dappled light and volcanic stone recur purposefully to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the exact layout of colonnades and central arch remains slightly abstract. The setting enables Kael's solution (flex points, thermal vents) and the ending reprise of "dappled light" and chain coiled beside the gate ties setting to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.2)
    The attic skylight and meteorite chip anchor the spatial frame once established, and dust motes function as micro-setting that charges the final image. However, the attic itself remains generic—no tactile detail of books, no smell or temperature—until late. Spatial choreography is minimal: Elias stands, lowers hand, writes; no movement through the space. The pigeon on the sill at the end adds sensory constraint but arrives too late to shape prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.1)
    The drifting prism terrace supplies vivid sensory anchors—emerald light, fractured hush, ozone—and the bench's wood grain micro-setting drives Elara's method (analyzing grain). The terrace's angle shift illuminates the spiral pattern, a purposeful detail that charges the ending image. However, the terrace itself does not constrain choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it remains backdrop for reflection rather than participant in pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.1)
    The underwater facility is vividly anchored with specific sensory detail (bioluminescent anemones, rusted ladder, crystal dome breaching like a whale's blowhole) that filters through Elara's astrological lens. The environment constrains movement (flooded corridors, hairline crack) and the dome's opening supplies the firefly glimpse that charges the closure. Spatial choreography remains coherent across vertical movement. The burnt feather and plankton method function as micro-setting tools that enable her star-charting.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The iridescent cave setting is rendered with vivid, purpose-driven sensory detail: "Amethyst and citrine light bled through colossal crystal facets" anchors both atmosphere and the logic of memory-paths as visual phenomena. The crater glass functions as micro-setting—its coolness, weight, and color-changes constrain Elara's investigative method and charge the final beat when it's "warm and satisfied." Spatial choreography remains clear (kneeling, testing, walking toward entrance), and the cave's hum and pulsing walls provide embodied pressure. The geode environment directly enables the story's central mechanic (crystallized memories) rather than serving as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tidal arcade is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: moss-lined crevice, Vega's reflection timed to the tide, the seventh arch as verified convergence point. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout; the body (kneeling, dissolving into shadow) and the bishop as micro-object constrain Corbin's choices and charge the closure when it departs in the stranger's pocket. Sensory hierarchy reflects Corbin's professional focus (tidal charts, pedestrian patterns, celestial angles). The setting does functional work rather than serving as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.1)
    The twilight garden is vividly rendered (night-blooming jasmine, mossy threshold, rose thorns, spiderweb) and the dewdrop + moonstone interaction is concrete. Spatial choreography is clean: Elara gathers the drop, touches it to the dust speck, inscribes Kael's forearm. However, the setting operates as backdrop rather than constraint—no environmental detail narrows Elara's choices or complicates the inscription. The garden's "sacred soil" and star positions (Lyra, Vega, Altair) serve atmosphere and thematic color but do not pressure the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pearl Bay at dawn is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (sea mist, damp cobbles, moss-furred pilings, obsidian pond surface) and the prism atrium functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when light fractures into rainbows. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (dock, pond, atrium, workshop path). However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Elara's path is unobstructed and the setting provides atmosphere without altering her options or imposing cost. The atrium's transformation from veiled to blazing marks the shift but remains symbolic rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    The moonlit ridge path, weathered stone, and porcelain box provide concrete anchors; sensory details (cool air tightening scars, scent of damp earth, breeze in pines) are filtered through Elias's professional and emotional lens. The box's cracks constrain his understanding and charge the final image as a map of survival, meeting the 9+ gate's requirement that an object or environment shape choice or closure. Spatial choreography remains clear (settling on stone, rising, descending), though the setting functions more as backdrop and symbolic frame than as a source of immediate tactical pressure during the reflective sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tide-polished grotto is vividly rendered ("cathedral of stone smoothed by centuries of patient ocean breath") and functions as micro-setting throughout, supplying shells and sea glass that anchor the ritual. Spatial choreography is clean and the setting's cyclical tidal logic charges the final image of the tide embracing the pattern. Environment constrains the method (tideline materials) and the closing sea whisper reinforces continuity, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ivy-veiled passage and fireplace alcove anchor setting early and concretely. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"damp flagstones," "black mouth of ash," "ivy thinned" sunlit patch—and filtered through Elara's professional and emotional lens. The film negative's reweighting in the sunlit patch charges the final image by contrasting enclosed stone with remembered open garden, and the recurring ivy brackets the story with a closing rustle that mirrors her burden. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves; the environment subtly mirrors internal states (encroaching ivy vs. preserved sunlight) without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prism parapet and terrace are vividly rendered with obsidian stones, crystal facets, and liquid rainbows. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric; the mirrors and prism enable the painter's work but don't constrain his choices or impose spatial difficulty. The bells provide a temporal frame but the painter completes his task before they ring, so the environment never pressures a tactical shift. Sensory detail is strong but remains decorative rather than integral to escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.9)
    The terrace, moons, and ebony clipboard anchor setting and atmosphere with vivid, purposeful detail (sun-bleached limestone, violet sky, cooled obsidian surface). The clipboard's material history ("last peace tree felled before the war") charges the final image when placed on the altar stone. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. However, the setting remains largely scenic; the terrace does not constrain a tactical choice—Kaelen's actions would proceed identically in any ceremonial space. This places the work just below the 7.0 gate, which requires environment to alter a choice or charge the ending beyond description.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    The salt flat is vivid and purposeful: "million precise cracks," "crystalline crust," "star where five cracks met" all anchor the ritual and constrain the placement choice. The convergence point functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—exact coordinates matter to Silas's logic. Sensory detail is filtered through his POV (polished city shoes crunching absurdly, salt biting through wool). The wind and fissures return with reweighted meaning in the closing lines, carrying the echo of wings. Environment actively shapes the protagonist's tactics and the closure's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.1)
    The silver courtyard, snow, and prism sanctuary are rendered with consistent sensory detail (mercury stone, crushed pearls, luminous filaments), and the frozen setting anchors the timeframe and tone. The prism's facets and the threads themselves constrain Elara's method, shaping her physical approach and the ritual's mechanics. The final image ("snow began to fall anew, gentle and cleansing") reweights the opening stillness with purpose. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no impossible positions or unexplained object shifts occur.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    The decommissioned radar dome is vividly anchored—steel ribs, fractured aperture, moonlight beam, gravel path—and its original purpose (patient listening) is repurposed thematically to mirror Elias's shift. The dome constrains the opening beat (isolation, echo, profound silence) and charges the final image ("its work of listening complete"). Seedy bars and The Rusty Nail are named but not rendered with sensory detail or spatial choreography; they function as concept-placeholders rather than lived-in pressure points. The story stick as micro-setting object is handled across multiple beats and its tactile presence (warmth, cherry wood, smoothness) ties setting to character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.1)
    Vivid sensory detail throughout: mossy floor, diamond dew, starlight blossoms, cloud-grass arches. The grotto functions as a lyric frame rather than a constraint on choice; Elara's movements (kneeling, weaving, placing) don't depend on unique properties of this sky-high space—the work could occur in any secluded natural setting. The moth wing (a tool/object) and the butterfly's perch on moss are the only moments where setting detail intersects with action, and neither shapes the outcome of the splinting decision.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound sanctum, aurora, ceremonial rope, and punched card scrap function as micro-setting elements that constrain Elara's method and charge the ending. The aurora's light unlocking the crystalline matrix is a purposeful spatial-mechanical detail. Sensory work is vivid and selective ("whisper of fiber on fiber," "delicate chime of the first snowmelt drip"). Minor slip: the glacial setting occasionally reads as postcard catalog ("endless ice," "living light") without altering tactics mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.7)
    The vine-draped bunker and storm anchor setting vividly. Sensory detail is selective (rain lashing, oak roots, muddy path) and filtered through Elara's altered perception post-transcendence. The forest path's "ethereal luminescence" charges the final image. However, the bunker interior remains generic beyond the directive on the table; no tool or spatial constraint shapes her choice to break the seal.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ziggurat observatory, cedar table, and clay tile are anchored with selective sensory detail (dust-scented air, grooves worn smooth). The tile's physical presence—positioned, rotated, cradled—constrains the ritual action at closure, satisfying the micro-setting test. However, spatial choreography remains vague (where is Polaris relative to the nexus? how does rotating clay cause charcoal to glow?) and the palace "suspended between regimes" functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a pressure that alters Enlil's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.1)
    The soundless sanctuary and music box provide tactile anchors (pearlescent walls, rosewood texture, ivory key), and the box constrains the climactic beat when Kael holds it. However, "shifting reality" outside—library-to-starlings, liquid light—remains decorative postcard imagery that never pressures a choice. The sanctuary's silence is described but doesn't shape tactics; spatial choreography (archway, Elara's position) stays vague. The micro-setting (box-in-hands) does functional work, lifting the score into mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    The fog-shrouded orchard is vivid and purposeful: frost-rimed soil, skeletal branches, hollow trunks, and twilight frost all create atmosphere and constrain the timeframe. Spatial choreography is clear (Elara kneels beneath the pear tree, raises the sextant toward branches). The sextant itself functions as micro-setting—its spiderwebbed mirror, missing horizon glass, and bent brass arc are handled twice (unwrapping, mending) and the mosaic surface transforms the world in the climactic beat. The final image (single bud on the skeletal tree) charges the ending. No gate failures; the orchard and sextant together enable the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cathedral-orchard hybrid is vividly rendered and pressures the repair task: Elara must "weave with" living branches, not restore rigid stone. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("dappled breeze," "moss-carpeted floor," "golden scar tissue"). The ribbon threaded through "reinforced wood and new cherry-branch supports" functions as micro-setting, constraining her method and charging the final image when Lyra traces it. Spatial choreography is coherent (pews, rafters, rose window) and the orchard's presence shapes the repair's symbiotic nature, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint on choice and closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    The astral orchard is vividly rendered with silver leaves, shimmer, and pulsation; low-gravity water droplets and regolith crunch ground sensory hierarchy. The pistachio shell cameo constrains her method (she must align emotionally, not extract) and charges the final image when it etches with light. Spatial choreography remains clear across habitat, viewport, surface, and tree. The orchard's nonlinear mechanics shape her tactical shift from inquiry-as-demand to inquiry-as-invitation.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.1)
    The mountain bookstore supplies vivid tactile detail (dust on runes, moonpetals near wisdom passages, shelves groaning into the Warden) and the spatial labyrinth pressures navigation. The botanical diary functions as micro-setting, constraining her method (she opens it to the gap, the void hums). Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the transition from "slumped against a shelf" to "stone at their feet" to "stairway of soft light" compresses geography quickly. The environment charges the final image (whispering corridors, rustle of pages) but does not constrain the ending choice—Elara's decision to "tend gardens" is reflective rather than forced by setting limits.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.9)
    The abandoned carnival ship and its fog-shrouded bay are vividly rendered (splintered railing, carousel horses frozen mid-gallop, hall of mirrors) and purposefully support the memory-alteration frame. The emerald swatch card functions as micro-setting (a recurring object that charges the final image when released). However, the setting mostly decorates rather than constrains choices—Lyra's movement through the ship is framed as exploration, not spatial problem-solving, and the fog operates symbolically without altering tactics. The ship becomes a charged backdrop for reflection but does not pressure a key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    The clock tower mechanism room is vividly rendered with colossal brass gears, oil-stained floorboards, and fractured sunlight. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: the scent of oil and aged timber, the cool void of omitted threads, the amber glow of the wax seal. The ceremonial rope functions as micro-setting, its braids constraining Elara's method and charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting directly enables the closure action (reconfiguring the rope) and the anomalous door's presence pressures the protagonist's choices, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint or closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    The harmonic caves, Glacial Heart ice, and echo chamber stone are all handled concretely and constrain the protagonist's choices (descent into cold, kneeling on stone, examining cracks). The "gently luminous" quality of the ice fractures directly enables discovery and charges the final image (concentric circles as new map). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (cold stone, dizzying light-dance, crack patterns as cartography). The stone's temperature shift (frantic heat → cool and still) tracks causally and brackets the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glass humming pavilion is vividly rendered with recurring sensory anchors (thrumming hum, etched constellations, obsidian dais) and the collapse-of-civilization timeframe supplies scarcity context. Spatial choreography is clear across the spiral ascent and apex arrangement. The "shard of hush" imposes silence and the prism fragments constrain the rekindling method, so objects and micro-setting do constrain the final action. Sensory detail is occasionally generic ("profound quiet," "deep indigo") but the pavilion's hum modulates with the alignment and the charged final image of valley lights answering meets the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stormlit observatory, obsidian balcony, solid fog, and granite monuments are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (ozone scent, pearl-glow, thunder murmur). Spatial choreography is coherent; the shadow-to-cairn geometry and fissure emergence ground the sequence. The setting constrains her vigil (sealed above the world, monuments frame her method) and charges the final image (fog glows, hush deepens). Micro-setting qualifies: the balcony and vellum function as workspace that enables the closure action.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.1)
    The blooming fortress, starless night, and mosaic courtyard are rendered with vivid sensory detail and constrain Elara's approach: darkness necessitates the flame, the tiles require tactile tracing. The knot functions as micro-setting, enabling the revelation that charges the final image. Spatial choreography (archway, gravel path, courtyard, kneeling position) remains coherent throughout, and the environment directly shapes the climactic discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto, tidal pool, hermit crab, and jade cicada supply concrete micro-setting that constrains Elara's observational method and charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful—starlight on water, damp stone, anemone pulse—and filtered through her chronicler's gaze. The hermit crab's shell-switch becomes a spatial metaphor that Elara uses to reframe Kael's silence. Spatial choreography (pool between them, shared gaze toward it) remains clear. The jade cicada functions as tactile anchor across beats, elevating setting through recurring object.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    The xenial trellis, cloud sea, and inverted gravity are vivid and coherent; spatial choreography tracks cleanly (Elara lifts, cloud ocean surges upward, trellis groans). The silverwood knot, seed, and sprouting vine function as micro-setting that charges the final image: roots spiral upward, shoot curls downward—growth against logic mirrors the gilded hush made visible. The trellis's "steadfast xenial grace" constrains her tether during inversion, directly affecting her ability to collect the silence. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (thin cold air, liquid amber sensation, ozone and starlight scent).

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    The drifting prism terrace is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail (liquid light, crystalline chimes, fractured rainbows, emerald and gold rivers) that consistently filters through the gondola's motion and Elara's monitoring task. The storm glass vial functions as micro-setting, constraining Elara's attention and providing a visual anchor for the noise-to-silence shift. The sky-lark's note and the prisms' physical properties (refracting, kissing in the breeze) shape the atmosphere and subtly guide Leo's perceptual shift. Spatial choreography is clean: gondola on channel, prisms above, far dock ahead. The terrace charges the final image when Leo's smile occurs within its "shimmering expanse," making the environment indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.4)
    The hidden orchard is vividly rendered with layered time, silver-barked trees, bioluminescent petals, and the Heartstone Monolith, and the kaleidoscopic waterfall functions as a threshold that will "solidify into an impassable crystal barrier" at dawn. However, spatial choreography during the peeling sequence is vague—Elara kneels "on soft moss" but the monolith's surface mechanics and her hand movements lack tactile grounding. The setting charges the atmosphere but does not constrain a choice or supply resources that alter outcome; the orchard's "awakening" at the end is a thematic flourish rather than a setting-driven consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ashen sanctuary, charcoal walls, and open-ceiling starlight are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Elara's need for refuge. The door scar and doorknocker ring function as micro-setting elements that constrain her final choice, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean. The recurring starlight motif shifts from "cold, indifferent" to "quiet promise," supporting the thematic arc without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bioluminescent farm is vividly rendered (cerulean/emerald/violet caps, damp soil scent, pulsing light) and constrains the final choice: Elara kneels at the Heartroot nexus, the specific setting element that enables the transmutation. The bolt—a micro-setting object—charges both the opening and closure images. Spatial choreography is clean (standing within the cavern, kneeling before the colossal root, walking away). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, reflecting Elara's need for sanctuary and wonder. Minor gap: the farm's social or operational texture (why does the elder announce this, who else is present?) remains generic, and the Heartroot's mechanics are declared ("most sensitive nexus") rather than discovered through action.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sepia reading room is richly textured with specific anchors (Persian rug, sagging bookshelves, celestial maps, gramophone) and the dust bands on the western wall function as a micro-setting detail that directly enables the climactic discovery. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elara's POV, with the room's atmosphere modulating from mausoleum to cradle as her understanding shifts. The crank handle as a tactile object constrains her search and charges the final image. The setting participates actively in the closure rather than serving as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.1)
    The alchemical orchard is vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (crushed pearl paths, liquid mercury, phosphorescent moss), and the obsidian pedestal supplies the closure object. However, the environment functions primarily as atmospheric set-dressing; no spatial constraint or resource shortage forces a tactical choice. The micro-setting (the pedestal, the puppet) does anchor the final beat, meeting the 9+ gate requirement minimally, but does not pressure Kael's approach or complicate his action.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.1)
    The file room is vivid: "dying fluorescent tube," "metal shelves," dust as archive. The button and box function as micro-setting, constraining Elara's discovery method (dust pattern reveals the envelope). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her archivist's eye. The setting charges the final image—"file room transformed...from coldness into sanctuary"—and the night air frames her exit. Minor slip: "city lights gilding the hallway" arrives late without prior spatial anchoring of windows or exterior proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.1)
    The auric lagoon's mineral properties enable the broadcast, directly constraining tactics and charging the final image—environment shapes the climactic choice. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (damp earth, cobwebbed booth, dust motes), and spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, the "vast tapestry of stars" and "golden screen" veer toward postcard lyricism in places, and the ironwood grove materializes without prior spatial priming.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    The radiant grotto with bioluminescent moss and prism atrium supplies a vivid, purposeful anchor; the quartz crystals respond to sound (light coalesces, dewdrops form on tips), constraining Elias's method and shaping the liminal timeframe. Sensory selection is strong: "wet stone and night-blooming jasmine," "brass saxophone gleamed like captured moonlight," "dewdrop swell...catch the light...fall with a sigh." The valley fog, ancient oaks, and moss-curtained entrance filter through Elias's ritual familiarity. The prism atrium charges the final image (unified light, single rainbow across his path), satisfying the 9+ quick test by constraining the method and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ashen skyborne arbor and the emerald moss provide vivid baseline anchors, and sensory details (leaf "cool and textured like aged parchment," "soft, silvery luminescence") are concrete. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Elara kneels, places, and receives without spatial friction. The "hush" and "boundary between past and prophecy" remain atmospheric labels rather than actionable pressures. Micro-setting (the miniature library, the alcove) is described but does not charge the final image or create cost.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    The greenhouse's "swirling leaves," the waterfall cavern with bioluminescent moss, and the river stone all appear on-page and constrain choices: the leaves force improvisation with the curtain rod, the waterfall mist enables the compass repair. Sensory detail is vivid ("obsidian pool," "basalt shelf") and filtered through Elara's tinkerer's eye. The river stone placed beside her tools in the final beat charges closure by anchoring the abstract lesson in a concrete object. Spatial choreography remains clear through the descent and return.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.4)
    The rain-washed foundry is vividly rendered with concrete details (pooling rainwater, grimy windows, stone hearth) that establish atmosphere. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the single location. The forge and anvil function as micro-setting elements that enable the ritual action, and the crucible itself constrains the symbolic work. However, the environment does not force a choice or alter tactics under pressure; it serves as a stage for predetermined actions rather than a live constraint that narrows options or charges the final image with situational cost.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.1)
    Echo Gorge is vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("obsidian cliffs," "moss-cushioned ledge," "mist coalescing") and the acoustics actively shape Elara's method (distorted notes "fractured against canyon walls"). The misaligned harp and crocodile's tooth function as micro-setting elements that constrain and enable her healing work. However, the environment does not impose a tactical choice or narrow options under pressure—it amplifies but does not resist. The final image uses the gorge's sunrise to charge Cora's dissolution, meeting the 9+ gate's "charges the final image" criterion, but the lack of environmental resistance caps the score at mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.8)
    The ultraviolet forest supplies vivid sensory anchors (indigo fractals, UV glyphs, Fibonacci bark) filtered through Kael's altered vision. Spatial choreography is coherent: pine needles, mossy stone, thorny vine, oak bark track cleanly. The setting does not constrain a middle choice—Kael moves through it without environmental friction altering tactics—so the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is missed. The UV glow charges the final image of the strap as compass, elevating the score modestly, but the forest functions primarily as backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    The alchemist's market is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (captured moonlight, bottled echoes, comet dust) and anchors the opening. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The fragment itself functions as micro-setting: handled in multiple beats, its texture (cool, elusively tangible) and warmth shift constrain Elara's interpretation and charge the final image when placed in the frame niche. The market supplies the paintings as resources that directly affect the outcome, moving setting beyond backdrop into causal participation.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned ticket office is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: the sickly fluorescent glow, dust accumulation patterns, the hidden ceiling panel. Spatial choreography is clean (counter, ladder, ceiling cavity) and the environment actively constrains Leo's method—he must wait for the light to die, ascend the ladder, find the catch. The recurring dust motif both grounds the setting in Leo's professional expertise and charges the final discovery. Sensory hierarchy reflects Leo's priorities (visual precision, tactile confirmation) without resorting to catalog description.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass orchard library, bottled whisper, and frost patterns are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (ozone, blooming frost-flowers, starlight ink). Setting constrains choice minimally—Elara uses the frost as a map, but spatial choreography and tool-use remain abstract. The bottled whisper returns with reweighted meaning (empty at the end), charging the final image. Micro-setting (the bottled object, the frost patterns) elevates the score into the 7-band by shaping the attempt and the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.1)
    The baroque asteroid and Hall of Echoing Time are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (gilded cherubs, amber chroniton rivers, velvet texture). The mirrors-as-projection-screens device constrains Elara's method and charges the final demonstration. However, much description remains postcard-level (weeping angels, cosmic dust) without altering tactics, and the storm's mechanics are asserted rather than experienced through bodily pressure or spatial consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.1)
    The resonance chamber is introduced with vivid detail ("perfect sphere hewn from singing granite") but functions only as backdrop: the granite hums in response to the note, yet this property never constrains a choice or alters Kael's tactics. The music box and philosopher's stone chip are handled on the page, but spatial choreography is vague—where is the arched window in relation to the workbench, and how does the tether "pierce the granite wall like mist" when the chamber is a sealed sphere? The covenant of rust and the verdigris glow anchor the thematic palette, but setting qua environment does not pressure the protagonist's moves.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    The subterranean lagoon is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail: "obsidian water so perfectly still it seemed to swallow light," "walls curved in gentle, impossible arcs." The setting constrains Elara's final choice—she cannot take a sample because "some truths were too immense for glass vials." The compass's behavior (needle pointing to lagoon's center) and the flowstone walls anchor spatial choreography. Micro-setting (silt, shore, dripping ceiling) charges the psychometry beat and the final tribute gesture. The lagoon functions as both environment and thematic pressure, elevating the score.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archway as shelter, observatory, and threshold constrains Elara's refuge and charges the closure moment when she steps from it. The turbine hum and moss-traced rain anchor sensory experience in the POV's priorities. Spatial choreography is clear: she holds the slide to lightning, props it in stone, carves within the curve. The carved driftwood fragment functions as micro-setting, its grooves and scars guiding the knife, and the final talisman charges her departure. Setting detail is selective and purposeful, avoiding catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    The amber pavilion and the etched glass window fragment are vividly rendered and constrain the revelation to a specific dawn moment. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's artist perception. The glass itself charges the final image by revealing hidden layers. Minor issue: the pavilion's "perpetual, nostalgic glow of autumn" is told rather than shown through light behavior on objects or skin.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.1)
    The zeppelin library is vividly anchored (oak panels, engine hum, "floating sanctuary") and the obsidian lagoon is rendered with strong sensory detail (salt, fear, starlit surface). The beach debris—stones, conch, driftwood—constrains Elias's ghostly intervention and shapes the pivotal correction. Spatial choreography in the vision (dune, waterline, ridge) remains clear. The setting charges the final image of truth "no longer trapped in sand or memory," meeting the 9+ gate for constraint and closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory detail is vivid and consistent: salt wind, tattered lanterns, pine resin scent, rice-paper thump. Old Woman Mei's laughter and Kael's net-mending are concrete anchors. The amber bottle and hemp paper appear in the final beats and charge the closure image, meeting the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography remains stable across quay, workshop steps, and central plaza. However, the Cove itself functions more as backdrop than constraint; no environmental feature narrows Elara's options or imposes a tactical cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard atop the spire, the mossy stones, the Sentinel Tree, and the crimson apple all constrain and charge the final image. The wax shaving warms in her palm, a micro-setting element that triggers the memory and syncs with her heartbeat, directly enabling the prophecy recognition. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "damp earth after rain," "wind through dry reeds," "soft pink of a held breath." The ancient stones function as the "listening stone" that the prophecy foretold, making the setting indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.1)
    The icebound atrium is vivid and specific: "crystalline ferns glittering like captured constellations," "ancient oaks sheathed in ice," "frosted glass dome." Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven, filtered through Elara's reverent focus. The setting constrains her action (kneeling on groaning ice, clearing a circle) and the final micro-beat (ice dripping from a branch "like a tiny bell") charges the ending. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Gate met: environment shapes tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    The windblown sanctuary and solstice stillness constrain choice: Elara reads frost-feather angles, barometric shifts, and ibex behavior to diagnose calm, all directly shaping her decision not to sound the alarm. The bell rope's pine-resin glue and the spire's shadow alignment are tactile, purposeful anchors. Spatial choreography (parapets, ridges, clouds below) remains coherent. Minor density: some phrases ("profound solstice hush," "sacred stillness") approach stock lyricism without fresh specificity, though they do modulate with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.1)
    The shooting star tracking station supplies vivid atmospheric detail (crystalline floor, great dome, dormant consoles) and the yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting that charges the final reflection. The dome viewport and the lantern's curve constrain Elian's nightly ritual and provide the physical anchor for his epiphany. Sensory selection is filtered through reverence (dust motes as dormant stars, amber glow as small sun) and the environment remains consistent across the arc, meeting the 9+ gate by shaping both choice and closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The beekeeping oasis is vivid and specific: skeletal apiaries, brittle lavender, sun-bleached altar, hive marked 'A', shattered clay pot. These details are filtered through the recluse's perceptive gaze and anchor Elias's emotional geography. The stained glass box functions as micro-setting, constraining the ritual and charging the final image with colored light and moonlight. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The scorched wasteland bookends provide scale and reinforce the oasis as sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.1)
    The emerald silo is vividly recurring (humming core, pulsing light, final glow) and constrains the closure by housing the capsule and providing the green light into which Kael dissolves. The urn fragment and garage-sale table are tactile micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("cold, sharp edge," "sun-dappled oak table"). The "post-numerical age" world rule is asserted but not demonstrated through action or obstacle, remaining conceptual rather than lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("liquid obsidian," "drake's tail feather...vanes shifting from lagoon-cobalt to ember-copper"). The lagoon, dunes, and tide are present throughout and lend atmosphere. The feather functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image, lifting the score above postcard description. Spatial choreography is clean (bench, dunes, far shore, sea oats, return to bench).

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard—stone pillars, oaks, copper veins—constrains every choice: Kael must locate seams, honor wood's breath, thread wire into hidden grooves. The final image (acorn copper-wrapped at stem, pillars humming) charges closure. Sensory detail is purposeful (cool stone heart, morning light catching groove, silver ferns after rain) and filtered through caretaker expertise. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across fifty repetitions. One slip: "living stone pillars" remains metaphorically vague; the mechanics of stone-as-conduit are declared but not shown acting until the ending chime.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting details are vivid and specific: obsidian stones, moss-swallowed guardians, bronze quiet, petrichor and lilac. The sculpture path and hidden fissure provide spatial anchors, and the stone basin at closure holds the resonant resin. Micro-setting (the fly amber warming in her palm, the basin glowing) constrains the revelation and charges the final image. However, the tower's exterior and chamber interior remain largely atmospheric backdrops; they do not pressure Aris's choices—she moves through them unimpeded.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    The blooming jetty at twilight is vividly rendered with sensory specificity—weathered wood, sea lavender, stubborn roses, violet sky, groaning planks—and filtered through Kael's perception as a battlefield reclamation site. The setting provides the materials (soil, planks, marsh, splintered piling) that Kael uses in his planting ritual, and the final image (green thread through a crack in the wood) charges the location at closure. The jetty functions as more than backdrop; it constrains his physical actions (kneeling, clearing earth, pouring water) and supplies the spatial logic for the bird calls and the submerged concord below. Micro-setting elements (jasmine thicket, splintered piling) anchor the bird translations and shift meaning across beats. This meets the 9+ gate requirement (environment charges the final image), but register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("narrow ribbon of weathered wood defiantly cradling") that feels more authorial than POV-filtered, preventing full entry into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rusthaven is vivid and particular: "skeletal vehicles," "wind sighing through twisted rebar," "ochre sky." The waxed leaf functions as micro-setting, constraining the riddle solution and charging the final image when it "felt warm, holding the sun of a forgotten season." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from bench to lantern-lit workspace to departure. Sensory hierarchy reflects Kael's priorities (visual detail, tactile memory) and the post-war world rules remain consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    The time dilation observation deck is vividly realized with "starlight into luminous rivers" and "light from ancient suns arrived fractured, smeared across minutes." The gilded compass rose is handled twice (touch, then final glow) and anchors spatial choreography. The temporally stretched sky constrains what Elara can observe and charges the final image when distortion "parts" to reveal the Lyre. Setting actively shapes her discovery and the ending resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.1)
    The icebound spire, wrong sky (violet/green swirl), and floating chessboard above solidified moonlight create vivid, purposeful images that anchor the single scene. Sensory detail is selective and tonally apt: "air humming with fractured time," "ice walls reflected the wrong sky in dizzying patterns." The setting constrains choice minimally—Kael slips through a fissure, but the environment never threatens or complicates his task—yet the corrupted sky and its incremental healing charge the final image strongly. The sundial lid's constellations aligning with the healed stars tie setting to closure. Micro-setting (the board, the pieces) is present and functional, elevating the score into the 7-band despite limited tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.4)
    The whispering gallery is vividly realized through acoustic properties, fractured dome light, and spatial choreography of Elara's walking pattern. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. However, the setting does not meaningfully constrain a choice; Elara's ritual proceeds unimpeded, and the gallery's acoustics serve symbolic rather than tactical needs. The chessboard placement on the broken plinth charges the final image but does not alter prior options.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.1)
    The labyrinthine bookstore is vivid ("staircases spiraled into star-charted darkness," "sub-basement of extinct dialects") and the sanctuary behind the astronomy dome anchors the ritual. The stone's obsidian/quicksilver texture and the feather's "impossibly soft barbules" constrain the seeding action. However, spatial choreography is loose—Elara teleports from sub-basement to sanctuary without transition—and the mountain's response (shelves grinding, pine-scented breeze) feels convenient rather than causally prepared. The feather-texture method charges the final act but the bookstore itself functions more as backdrop than active constraint after midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frozen village is vivid and specific: suspended raindrops, mid-spill flour, moss-crowned well. Sensory details are filtered through Kael's chess-tutor lens (living chessboard, pawn structures). The platinum labyrinth and tapestry border constrain his final action—he must decode threads to manipulate rings—so the micro-setting shapes the closure. The awakening sensory rush (hammer clang, laughter, baker's greeting) charges the ending. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.4)
    The bone canyon and pale spire anchor setting vividly with purpose-driven sensory detail (mist, acoustics, fused vertebrae). The canyon's echo mechanics directly enable Elara's strategy, constraining her method to this location. Micro-setting (the spire base, acoustics) charges the final image when voices weave into resonance, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint and closure linkage despite some overwrought diction.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    The acid-sea workshop is vivid and purposeful: the shearing gear incites the crisis, the centuries-old statue provides the kintsugi map, and the raging-then-calmed emerald sea charges the final image. Sensory selection (ozone, acid mist, tortured brass) reflects urgency. The ceramic sparrow functions as micro-setting, constraining the repair ritual and charging closure. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    The coastal cave network constrains Elias's journey (damp walls, ivy-veiled fissure, bioluminescent algae) and the hidden oasis charges the final image—sunbeam, still pool, white sand create the sanctuary where he can release the shell. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through his painter's POV (dawn-gilded pilings, rose quartz bleeding into liquid gold). Spatial choreography is coherent: cliff → misstep → fissure → passage → cavern → pool's edge. The cave's peace "seeping into his bones" and the shell's reflection "doubling the colors" tie setting directly to the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt lighthouse, dawn light, and Atlantic setting are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (dew, salt air, churning waves). The vial itself functions as micro-setting, charged with memory and handled with reverence. The environment does not constrain tactical choice in the peak beat—Elias's release of the scent is unopposed—but the cobalt tower and "gold dawn" frame the final image and charge the thematic resonance of quiet power.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.4)
    The starlit signal station is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (dome, waxing gibbous moon, cold console). The censer foot's tactile presence (verdigris, lotus carving) grounds micro-setting work. The broken hydraulics frame the opening but never constrain a later choice; the station remains a backdrop rather than a pressure source. Spatial choreography is coherent but the environment does not force a tactical shift or charge the final image beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    The hanging orchard is vivid and purposeful, its storm-battered resilience mirroring the thematic stakes. Spatial choreography through the ravine path is coherent, and the lightning-scarred quince tree grounds the truffle harvest in tactile detail. The orchard constrains Elara's movements and supplies the critical resource, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for setting participation in choice and closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    The opal dock, mist, and nautical twilight anchor the opening cleanly and recur at closure ("the opal dock gleamed faintly—a sacred space"), charging the final image with the persistent atmosphere of witnessed solitude. The circular study with "salt-stained logbooks" and "leather cover cracked like old ice" grounds Silas's investigation in tactile, purposeful detail. Micro-setting qualifies: the logbook itself becomes the repository that constrains the final choice (Silas must press the flower beside J's entry, not merely remember it). Sensory selection is POV-filtered (the "violet and silver" bruise of twilight, the "pearlescent planks"), though some descriptions lean decorative rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    The blooming cavern is vividly realized: phosphorescent fungi, ghost orchids, humid air, cave crickets, dripping water. The carpenter ants function as micro-setting and their route (the invisible ramp of earth and roots) directly constrains Elias's path, satisfying the 9+ gate partially. Sensory detail is filtered through urgency as the creek rises. The only slip: the final paragraph's "world glistened, washed clean under the returning sun" is generic postcard rather than character-filtered perception.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.9)
    The ridge, grotto, and veins of azurite are vivid and stage the journey clearly. Spatial choreography is clean: base → ledge → cloud layer → cobalt archway → inner chamber. The dew-slick ledge and obsidian altar anchor key beats, and the environment pressures the climb with "treacherous" terrain and "thinning air." However, setting remains largely descriptive postcard; no object or environmental constraint forces a tactical choice that alters outcome. The fireflies and silver fox offer atmospheric resonance but do not constrain agency.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    The ember nexus is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (warm stone, violet twilight, swirling embers) and returns in the final third to charge the closure image when "the ember nexus flared in sympathy." The nautilus shell columella curl functions as micro-setting, constraining Elara's method by its "perfect spiral" alignment. Spatial choreography is clean (bench, path, Elara's position), though the mechanics of how light channeled through a shell applies pigment remain metaphorically hazy. The setting earns the mid-7s through purposeful reprise but does not compel a tactical choice that alters outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mountain ranger cabin grounds the piece with tactile specifics: "deep grooves worn into the pine table," "cold seeping through the chinks in the timber," "birch bark scroll…a piece of the land itself." The birch tree shading the cabin door anchors the scroll's provenance. The dream-flight setting pressures perception (past selves appear on the mountainside) and the final dawn image ("fiery gold" on the peak) charges the closure. Micro-setting (scroll, table, cabin door) and dreamscape both constrain and enable the protagonist's choices, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    The water clock shop is vivid and purposeful: brass gears, dripping clepsydrae, and morning fog create a sensory envelope that supports the story's meditative rhythm. The clamp's wear patterns—thumb groove, scratch from hurried cleaning—function as micro-setting that constrains Elara's tactile perception and charges the repair. Fog lifting at the end mirrors internal clarity without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean; the shop's liquid symphony anchors each beat.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating rock platform, crow quill, and crystallizing ink all constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Elara's scholar-lens (bruised violet clouds, liquid starlight scars). The micro-setting—bare feet on cool granite, the inkwell beside her—functions well as body-and-tool setting. However, spatial choreography of the platform itself (size, edges, prayer flags) remains somewhat generic; the tea ceremony context is more atmospheric than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive's "towering oak shelves" and "leaded glass window" anchor space vividly, and the orchard outside operates as both constraint (doomed landscape) and thematic charge. The antique perfume bottle functions as micro-setting, its "cut-crystal facets" and coldness recurring with purposeful tactile weight. However, the grand piano and archive floor remain somewhat postcard-static; they are described but do not actively constrain Elara's choices—she simply sits and plays without spatial or resource friction. The setting modulates tone effectively but does not force a meaningful tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ancient temple library and the spiral ramp are vividly anchored with selective detail—crystalline arches, star-dusted periphery, guttering candle flicker—and the physical ascent constrains Elara's choices throughout. The softcover dictionary's "warm" presence in the final image charges closure. Spatial choreography remains clear across the spiral turns, and the "resounding hush" functions as atmospheric pressure that deepens with each stabilization.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    The hydraulic clock with its suspended droplet constrains the ritual and charges the final image when the droplet falls "with a soft, definitive plink." The fjord's granite cliffs, razor-edge horizon, and leaded window create a coherent spatial anchor that narrows perception during the countdown. Sensory detail—the sun halting, sea and sky melting into watercolor, the fjord becoming a black mirror—modulates with the ritual's pressure. The station's function (horizon measurement) and the master clock's hidden panel directly enable the protagonist's transformative action.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.9)
    Setting details are vivid and sensory (rainwashed stone, humid platform air, mosaic tiles), and the mica lantern functions as a constraint that enables the door reveal. The shift from library to subway is spatially coherent and the mosaic clock with no hands provides a charged image at closure. However, much description is ornamental (wet grass, blooming linden) rather than pressure-driven, and the sealed City Hall station section appears without prior setup or character knowledge of its significance, weakening the sense that environment shapes her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.1)
    The subway utility tunnel anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph, satisfying the Orientation Test. The scarlet phone booth, dripping pipes, and swinging bulb create tactile specificity, and the glass harmonica disc charges the final image by shifting from "relic of loss" to "compass." However, the tunnel itself does not constrain a choice—it remains atmospheric backdrop—so the 9+ gate (environment/object must constrain choice or charge closure) is not met. The disc's reprise and the streetlamps' hum thread setting through the ending effectively, lifting the score into the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    The blooming jetty at twilight is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (sea campion, thrift, daisies, salt mist) that recurs and charges the final image. The setting constrains the ritual to this precise liminal hour and the physical objects (lamp, cup, walnut ink, paper) are handled across multiple beats. Micro-setting qualifies: the body and tools shape the ritual's execution, and the wave's salt mist blessing the ink is a purposeful closure beat. Spatial choreography (kneeling, unpacking, writing, pressing locket, rising) tracks cleanly throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    The disused railway station is vividly rendered with concrete sensory detail (ivy, cracked concrete, wildflowers, frozen clock tower, dusk light). The setting constrains the choice to wait and charges the final image: "Moonlight silvered the ivy, transforming the station into a beacon." Micro-setting (the bench, the ivy) recurs and evolves symbolically. Spatial choreography is clean (platform, benches, caretaker's note drop-off implied). However, the station functions more as symbolic backdrop than tactical constraint—no door, locked gate, or physical barrier shapes Elara's decision. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric but tilts heavily visual; other senses are underused.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ultrasonic forest is vivid and consistent: high-frequency hum, dewdrop *ping* on quartz, subterranean river *thrum*. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's priorities (touch and vibration over sight), and spatial choreography is clean. The forest constrains her method (musical notes guide the path) and charges the final stillpoint image. Minor: the constellations' pause is asserted repeatedly but never shapes a tactical choice or tightens a deadline; it remains atmospheric rather than a live constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.1)
    The gravitational anomaly functions well as micro-setting: its "gentle tides" reveal "filaments of cause and effect," the exotic void-metal nib hums and resists, and spatial choreography (floating tear, console shard propulsion) grounds action. The anomaly's luminescence and time-bending properties charge the final image ("The anomaly's light bent around her, a final blessing"). Minor issue: the Lyra signal backstory and Exodus Fleet catastrophe are named but remain abstract; we never see sterile shear or colonists, so the anomaly's pressure on Elara's choice to return feels conceptual rather than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.2)
    The luminous harbor and moonlight are vividly rendered and anchor the piece spatially. Micro-setting (wooden planks, the pier's edge) grounds the signing ritual. However, the environment remains largely atmospheric rather than constraining choice—the harbor does not alter tactics or supply resources that shape outcome. The camera, though handled, functions more as symbol than spatial constraint, preventing entry into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail—dust-choked floor, moonlit chamber, crushed abalone shell—and the setting provides the artifacts that guide Kael's search. The tapestry fragment, mosaic, sketches, and sculpture are integrated into action rather than described passively. The circular chamber open to the sky charges the final discovery. The micro-setting (the vandalized portrait) directly enables the closure by encoding the Canticle's melody in its scars.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sound wave garden is vividly rendered with synesthetic detail (chiming blossoms, glowing vines, scent of rain) and the auric lagoon constrains Kael's method—he must drum on specific surfaces to coax the dream from the liquid gold. The crystalline silence and harmonic progression create a micro-setting that charges the final image when "a single chime lingered." Spatial choreography is clean and the environment actively participates in the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.4)
    The container labyrinth, geomagnetic storm, and port setting are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (emerald/violet aurora, rust streaks, metallic void). The hidden whispering gallery and acoustic triangle demonstrate purposeful micro-setting that charges the ending. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The storm's charged air and the brass key's serpent bow contribute texture without becoming postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cobalt dock, puddles, and wet timber create a vivid sensory anchor filtered through stillness and petrichor. The louvered shutters function as micro-setting, constraining Kael's method and charging the final image (Orion framed). Spatial choreography is coherent (Kael moves from mirror to shutters; Elara remains at dock's edge). Minor slip: "spiralingly calm" and "stillwater tension" recur as ambient mood rather than evolving with pressure, slightly dulling the urgency filter expected under crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt library, mist, and the magnetic grotto supply strong sensory anchors and recur with purpose. The grotto's "cool weight" and "faint pull of its hidden magnets" grounds Elias's final placement, and the star-dusted dome "kissed by dawn's gold" charges the ending image. Spatial choreography (library steps, shop windows, dew-slicked stones) remains clear throughout. The setting constrains the "hush before dawn" timeframe and the mist-veiled secrecy, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint on choice and closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sublittoral fringe is vividly rendered ("emerald shards," "kelp forests swayed like ancient sentinels," "bioluminescent moss") and the scrimshaw's physical presence recurs with purposeful detail ("cool beneath her oilskin," "warmed instantly," "abalone-inlaid eye gleaming"). The island's volcanic sand, silver-leafed palms, and freshwater spring charge the final image. However, the underwater descent and island arrival lack spatial choreography—how she breathes, swims without gear, or transitions from skiff to seabed remains unclear, reducing the environment's constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    The turbines ground the setting with concrete pressure—shadows sweep the table at the closure beat, and their hum undergoes "profound alchemy" from Mandate enforcement to chosen quiet. The scarred pine table, knife, cedar, and dried bouquet function as micro-setting that constrains and charges the ritual. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. Minor gap: the farmhouse interior is vivid, but the "perpetual shadow" claim isn't tested against time-of-day variation or weather shifts that might complicate the static gloom.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.1)
    Cobalt walls, quartz colonnade, and frozen lake are anchored early and the quartz hum recurs across beats, but spatial choreography remains painterly—the poet walks, touches, whispers, steps—without the environment constraining a choice or altering tactics. The final step onto singing ice is a thematic flourish rather than a test of access or cost. Sensory detail (diamond sparks, lantern-moth hush) decorates rather than pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glassblower's courtyard is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: "molten glass glittered like frozen tears among stubborn green shoots," "cracked flagstone where moss thrived." The setting constrains choice—shards and soil guide Elara's plant work, the workshop benches hold Kael's "failed" sphere. Sensory selection (ozone, damp ash, glass crunching underfoot) filters through both characters appropriately. However, the phoenix-scarred landscape operates more as atmospheric backdrop than active pressure; the courtyard's beauty-in-ruin functions thematically but doesn't force tactical decisions during the exchange itself, keeping it shy of the 8+ band where environment must constrain key moves.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.1)
    The laboratory is vividly rendered with "liquid amber" shadows and the Great Resonator sphere, and the carbide lens fractures light across its surface in a purposeful sensory beat. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the vacuum-sealed sound fragments and glowing waveform do not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics. The golden shadows recur but remain atmospheric rather than a spatial or material pressure that forces a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory is anchored early with sensory specificity ("aged brass and cold starlight," "deep indigo velvet drapes") and the telescope becomes a concrete tool that Elara manipulates to achieve the discovery. The bioluminescent grove in the valley functions as micro-setting that charges the final image, transforming the observatory from "tomb to cradle." Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the workshop return provides a second grounded location that supports the closure.

    The loft is vividly anchored with sensory particulars: aged paper, beeswax, onyx ink, brass measuring tape, rain-beaded skylight. The measuring tape is handled across multiple beats and its symbolic distance ("seven-inch span") subtly constrains Elara's interpretive method. The skylight's shift from "bruised twilight" to moonlight charges the final image, moving the setting beyond postcard to a frame that reweights the map's meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive's fractured dome, twilight bleeding violet, and the bronze pagoda as focusing lens anchor the scene vividly and filter through Elara's professional attention. The pagoda functions as micro-setting: it hums to life, releases atoms, warms at closure—these shifts constrain her ritual and charge the final image. Minor deduction: the atoms themselves remain abstract ("tiny, crystalline echoes") without tactile properties that would pressure her choices; the ritual choreography is largely mental, so spatial dynamics stay thin. The final reflection in the bronze surfaces is purposeful and pays off the opening description.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    The blooming library is vividly rendered—"archways of woven light," "dream-vines," "breath[ing]" shelves—and setting details (the archive nook, console screens, the stone's warmth) anchor choices. The river stone and the archive footage constrain Elara's method and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear; no impossible positions. The setting's organic architecture supports the metamorphosis theme without slipping into postcard catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    The workshop setting is vivid and purposeful: herbal lavender, recuperating barn owl, oil lamp, cherry wood box, Kael's terrarium. The misty night and starlit sky frame Elara's introspection and return in the dawn image, charging the closure with environmental rhythm. Spatial choreography is clean—workbench, terrarium, doorway, bench—and the tail tip as micro-object constrains her symbolic work. One element (the box on a leather cord) appears in the final beat and alters the closure image, meeting the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tower setting, frosted hourglass, potted fern, and coffee ring are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (frost defying warmth, fractal lacework). The micro-setting (bedside objects, window view) constrains Elara's attention and the fern's root-tunnel vision charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the dawn light melting the hourglass frost provides a purposeful environmental shift at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    The projection booth is vivid and purposeful: dust motes, green-shaded lamp, oak bench, creaking stairs establish tactile presence. The setting constrains choice (psychometry requires the booth's hushed dark for incubation) and charges the final image (descending stairs, cool night air frame the release). The 1943 gas-lit room is layered with sensory specifics—lavender soap, pen scratch, rain-streaked window—that anchor the vision and sustain the accumulative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.4)
    The aurora-lit archway and astrolabe are vividly established and recur throughout. The archway constrains Elara's spatial frame and the astrolabe guides her ritual, both shaping the structure of the night's vigil. Sensory detail (cold air, emerald/violet light, aged brass) is filtered through POV and atmosphere is consistent. However, the setting does not meaningfully constrain a choice at closure—Elara could perform her ritual anywhere under the aurora—and the archway's "whispers of centuries" and "silent benediction" edge toward postcard lyricism without altering tactics or foregrounding a specific cost tied to place.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glowing dune is vivid and purposeful, its bioluminescent blooms contrasting the void and grounding the mission. Spatial choreography is clear: guard walks, kneels in a hollow, stands, continues. The chess clock and archive are handled across beats, constraining choice (he must kneel to use the archive, the clock remains in his pocket as conceptual anchor). Sensory detail is selective—"sand that bloomed with soft bioluminescence," "obsidian surface shimmered"—and filtered through the guard's focus. The dune's blooming in his wake charges the final image, fulfilling the micro-setting requirement for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.1)
    The mechanical rainforest is vividly rendered with specific textures (oil-slicked moss, copper pines, mercury waterfalls), and spatial choreography remains clear. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop: no environmental constraint narrows Kael's choices or complicates his path to the obsidian tree. The gear socket "gleamed, an undeniable match"—convenience rather than friction. Micro-setting elements (body, tool) do not charge the closure image or alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.8)
    The ridgeway, mist, and standing stones are vivid but remain postcard backdrops; no environmental feature constrains a choice or alters tactics. The ticket functions as a carried object but does not shape action. Setting modulates atmosphere effectively but does not pressure the protagonist's stance at closure, capping the score below 7.0 per the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt fortress, spiral staircase, and hidden piano chamber are vivid and purposeful. The discolored stone on the twenty-third step constrains the discovery choice, and the piano bench bolt charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's professional lens (geometric precision, acoustic purity). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly. However, the "climate-controlled hush" and "vaulted ceilings" remain slightly generic; more tactile friction (temperature contrast, specific acoustic echo) would sharpen the setting's pressure on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.8)
    The Chronos Athenaeum is vividly rendered with obsidian halls, Font of Echoes, and crystalline dome. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the library does not constrain a choice or force a tactical adjustment at closure. The final image of dissolving shelves charges the ending with atmosphere, lifting the score into mid-band, but the environment does not pressure Kael's tactics in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    The monitoring station, console, and viewport anchor action throughout; the torn atlas page appears in three beats and charges the closure when overlaid with animated pathways. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "salt-stiffened joints," "turquoise water," "moon's shimmering path." The console's haptic surface constrains Elara's tapping practice, directly enabling the biometric unlock. Spatial choreography remains coherent across moves, and the setting's post-ban timeline subtly pressures her remembrance work.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    The spaceport is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: cold permacrete underfoot, fractured dome casting violet-gold light, overturned tool carts glittering like tears, faded revolutionary slogans. The ancient stone circle at the bay's heart functions as micro-setting that charges the closure: the hum travels through Kael's bare feet, washing anxiety away and enabling his final choice. The margin of daylight tightens the timeframe subtly, and the first star piercing the dome wound at the end provides a resonant final anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    The volcanic hot springs anchor setting with sensory specificity (sulfur, turquoise pools, mineral deposits) and constrain the unseal action—amber must be warmed in "the spring's heart." The scarred pine and moss-draped crevice function as micro-settings that guide Elara's search. Spatial choreography remains clear across kite discovery, crevice search, and pool immersion. The setting charges the final image: "sunset cast the valley in amber light mirroring the unsealed resin."

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.1)
    The arboretum and cliff setting anchor early and return throughout; the cypress bark and stone bench serve as concrete somatic tools. The lighthouse's reframing (vigilance withdrawn → resilience) is purposeful. Sensory detail is selective and consistent with Elara's botanical expertise, though the "pine-scented air" and "salt-tanged breeze" lean generic at the closure beat where specificity would charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.1)
    The library and cellar are vividly anchored: "salt-crusted glass," "slick stone steps," "glowing threads filled the cellar." The tarot box and threads function as micro-setting, constraining Kael's choice to descend and shaping the redesign action directly. Sensory detail is dense but occasionally ornamental ("weak diamonds," "liquid starlight") rather than filtered through urgency. The lighthouse setting pressures the choice (walls closing) and charges the final image (beam sweeps, box glows), meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    The wind-carved encampment is vivid and purposeful: grooves in stone, tunnels that funnel gusts, and the hearth stone as workspace anchor micro-setting choices. The capricious gust that spills the ink is a direct environmental constraint that enables the closure beat. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Kael's tracker priorities (calloused fingers, cool stone, wind sigh). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the final image—dawn light gilding stone—charges the acceptance without becoming postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glacial library is vividly realized with selective, purposeful detail: "blue-tinged corridors," "ice shelves," "crystalline filaments pulsing with latent energy." The hidden panel and dormant networks constrain her method and charge the climax. Spatial choreography is clean (oldest wing → cartography → panel seam). The snow above operates as conceptual pressure more than physical constraint, but the micro-setting (panel, slate, filaments) shapes the decisive action and the ending image of "snow-locked stillness" anchors the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glass dome and desert roses provide vivid, selective anchors (teardrop shape, crystalline blooms, cool glass, molten sunset glow). The sandbag scrap becomes micro-setting, handled twice to tie stems and charge the final image with repurposed-violence metaphor. Sensory detail (silver hue, petal chime, rough patch on tunic) is filtered through Elara's perceptual priorities. The dome's physical enclosure and the contrast with howling desert winds outside subtly guide her sanctuary logic and charge the closure image of stillness versus chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sound wave garden is vividly realized with selective, purposeful detail: crystalline harmonics, rivers of melody, thorny dissonance. The rail spike constrains choice—its warmth and glow guide Elara's method and charge the protective circle. The garden's emotion-transliteration rule pressures tactics (grief → rose-gold path). Micro-setting qualifies: the spike and soil anchor the climax, and the final constellation shift (the Cradle) reweights the space. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout; no generic postcard syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mountaintop observatory is vividly rendered with specific details (Bakelite telephone, brass chart table, green lamp, dome shutter) that anchor the investigation spatially. The locked shutter entry from October 12th directly constrains the proof, making setting integral to plot logic. The "endless sea of cloud" and "crystalline loneliness" establish atmosphere without overwhelming action. The rosewood nib functions as micro-setting, handled multiple times and charging the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for object-as-setting that constrains choice and participates in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    The laboratory of lost sounds is anchored with vivid, purposeful detail: reversed clocks, ozone mingling with rain, the Chippendale desk, and the amber on the console node. The amber's warmth and the wasp's silent witness across millennia constrain the tether action and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting shapes the tactic (placing amber on the node) and recurs meaningfully at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto's parabolic walls, moss, lilac mist, and sand floor are introduced early and pressure choices throughout: the tile flake's discovery, the sand mandala's placement in "cool sand at the grotto's heart," and the mist's eventual blurring of the design. Sensory detail (wet stone, fading violets, cool shard) is vivid and filtered through Elara's artist perception. The mandala itself functions as micro-setting—its expanding symmetry draws whispers "like iron filings to a gentle magnet," constraining her method and charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains coherent (kneeling, leaning toward the mandala, rising, stepping out).

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    The shattered sky, ash, cracked cobblestones, and mosaic stepping stone are vivid and selective, grounding Elara's reverent movements. The tessera and steel beams function as micro-setting elements that constrain her method (embedding the shard, building the shelter framework) and charge the final image when sunlight illuminates the new name. Sensory detail is filtered through her caretaker's attention—ash "fine as powdered bone," the "metallic scent of cooled embers"—and the plaza's chipped patterns teach her to read negative space, enabling the renaming. The environment directly shapes her tactics and the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.4)
    The orchard is vividly rendered with synesthetic detail (wind tasting of lemon zest, firefly glows as warm kisses), and the tarot coin at the apple tree's roots provides a charged final image. Spatial choreography is clear within the single setting, and the hedge maze frame anchors early. However, the environment does not constrain choice—Elara moves through it without friction, and the "fractured timeline" affects perception but not tactics. The coin's transformation (lovers now clasping hands) reconfigures the closure image, lifting this category into mid-6s despite the setting's passive role in escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.7)
    The light painting studio anchors spatially (safelight, camera, darkness) and the geode recurs with shifted meaning at closure, satisfying micro-setting criteria. The ozone scent and tactile details (warm muscovite, cool spine ripple) ground the opening beats in embodied perception. However, the studio does not constrain a choice during the climactic light painting; the work unfolds in "profound darkness" without spatial friction or tool limitation that would shape Elara's moves. Dawn light at the end provides atmospheric closure but does not add pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    The coastal cave network is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (bioluminescent algae, moss-lined cases, tide-worn crevices) and the setting directly enables Elara's heat-mapping practice. Spatial choreography is clear across moves from grotto to workshop to shore. The elm leaf fossil's placement in a marked crevice at closure links environment to future action. The cave's "damp contour" and her "bare feet" establish tactile familiarity that supports her professional authority, satisfying the micro-setting gate for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.4)
    The amber warehouse and rust-hued cliffs anchor setting vividly, and the canyon echo jar constrains one choice (uncorking it to release resonance). Spatial choreography is clean (bench, eastern ceiling crack, master hourglass), and sensory detail (honeyed gloom, beeswax seal, dust bleeding from fracture) reflects Elara's professional priorities. However, the warehouse does not materially alter tactics in the central button-cataloging sequence; it serves as atmospheric backdrop rather than a resource or obstacle that reshapes the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.7)
    The bluff, mist, and melting snow are vivid and recur with purpose, framing Elias's ritual and Anya's arrival. The engraved pillbox functions as micro-setting, handled twice (held, then given), and the faded forget-me-not inside charges the final exchange. The granite stone and moss anchor spatial choreography, and the zephyr's whisper modulates tone. Yet the environment remains largely scenic; the mist thickens and lifts without constraining a tactical choice, and the snow-code's dissolution is symbolic rather than a material limit that alters Elias's options at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fog-bound crossing, rain-gutter ticking, and yarn needle are vivid, selective, and purposeful. The river mist's "spindrift serenity" and the ferryman's eaves metronome anchor the reflective frame. The yarn needle constrains choice (mnemonic anchor) and charges the final image (pressed through fabric as renewal). Spatial choreography is clean; the ferryman's nod and ferry's appearance feel organic. Anchoring is prompt and sustained without tourism.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    The oasis is vividly particular—lavender near silent hives, sun-bleached glyphs, dry stone well—and the phototropic glass constrains Kael's method (must align with precise sun angle). Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling, tracing glyphs, positioning for the final ray). The thrum and fractured-timeline vision charge the final image when Kael sees the hives as "vessels holding the shape of compassion." The micro-setting (glass + sun patterns + stones) directly enables the core revelation and reweights the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    The fire escape garden, harbor moonlight, and alley setting are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (rust-flecked iron, emerald moss, damp brick). The lockmaster's gauge tooth and the rosebush anchor micro-setting that constrains Elara's ritual choices. However, the setting functions more as atmospheric backdrop than as an active agent that alters tactics at pivotal beats; the harbor's luminosity inspires rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal library, cloud sea, and stone circle constrain Elara's choices: she must time the ritual to the tide's zenith, and the circle's hum unlocks memory. Micro-setting details (brass sundial, cloud-stone railing, starlight-quartz ink) are purposeful and charge the final image. Sensory selection is strong (mist, hum in teeth and bone, ozone-scented halls). The environment actively shapes the climax and closure, meeting the 9+ gate's constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lotus pond and temple are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail ("wet stone and blooming lotuses," "moonlight gilding the temple's petals"), and the storm-dislodged nest anchors the inciting discovery. The materials Elara gathers—stones, stems, twigs, petals—supply the resources for the installation and constrain her method (weaving, spiraling inward). However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop and symbolic mirror rather than applying spatial pressure to choice; the installation could unfold in any serene public space without altering tactics. Spatial choreography is clean, and the post-storm timeframe lightly pressures the gathering phase, though the window never tightens into urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.1)
    The basement radio station is anchored early with oscilloscope glow and humming console, providing tactical resources (transmitter, modulator). Spatial choreography is clean; Aris's position, the quad outside, and Croft's approach are legible. However, the setting remains functional rather than charged—no tool or environmental detail constrains a choice or charges the final image beyond backdrop status. The astronomical charts are handled twice but do not evolve causally; sensory detail (dust motes, green glow) is vivid but ornamental, not filtered through urgency or integrated into micro-choices.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    The nexus is vividly rendered through selective, purposeful detail: "walls that had framed open sky moments ago now pressed close," "starlight above narrowing to a sliver." The organ—scarred pipes, worn bench, ivory keys—functions as micro-setting that constrains the climactic choice by forcing Elara into a confined loft. Spatial choreography is clean (steps into loft, settling onto bench, descending with key). The compass point and organ both charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (dust, cold, stone textures dominate). The setting actively shapes the resolution rather than serving as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    The quarry's physical particulars—limestone cliffs, mist, rusted machinery, moss-slick stones, submerged ledge—constrain Elara's search and supply the hidden niche that reveals the journal. The flint shard ("honed by time and river") functions as a micro-setting tool that enables the lance action. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("mist clung to limestone cliffs like breath held too long," "furrowed hush broken only by dripping water"), and the setting charges the final image when sunlight burns through mist to gild the walls, transforming "tomb of secrets" into "cradle of hard-won peace."

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    The weather station's damp, reinforced viewport, and salt-stained lamp ground the setting with sensory specificity. The copper nail's verdigris and the journal's faded ink create a micro-setting that constrains the decoding choice. The station's location above Serpent's Tooth reef directly shapes the evacuation stakes, charging the final image of the wave swallowing the structure. Spatial choreography during the evacuation remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mountain pullout, scaffold wraps, and alpine wind are vivid and purposeful. The glass flake constrains the final choice (placed on strings), and the scaffold's "deliberate pattern" charges the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's observant nature. However, the setting functions more as backdrop than active constraint—removing the pullout would not break story logic, only relocate the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.1)
    The circus train, its territorial markers, and the amber light establish a vivid micro-setting that constrains the conversation and charges the thematic layering. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (dust motes, metallic groan, crunch of gravel). The three markers (father's "SV," lion tamer poster, Aether Threads map) function as spatial anchors that guide Leo's reflection and his teaching of Kai. The final ridge ascent provides a concrete exit that supports the closure image, though the valley "bathed in forgiving dusk" tilts toward over-determined symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.1)
    The observatory, telescope, dream-journal, and pressed daylily anchor the setting and constrain Elara's actions (she must correlate Mira's cycles, she opens the journal, she receives the telegram at her desk). Sensory detail is selective (aged paper, polished brass, cold stars) and filtered through her scholarly focus. The telescope at Mira's deepest dim provides a micro-setting moment that charges the closure, pushing the score toward the threshold. However, much of the world detail (dream-temple, variable stars) remains abstract rather than tactile, and the observatory itself does not impose a spatial or temporal constraint that alters her tactics in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cursed lake, orchard vortex, and muddy shore anchor the scene vividly and remain spatially coherent throughout. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric: "bruised twilight sky," "cold, muddy shore," "emerald and silver thorn." The plant's growth and the ice's dissolution create environmental evolution tied to plot. The vortex and shore constrain Elara's positioning and the seed's planting location matters tactically. The final image—plant as "gentle sapling guarding the water's edge"—charges the ending with transformation. Micro-setting (the seed, soil, and shore contact) enables the ritual's mechanics and the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint and charge.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.7)
    The cobalt glade, violet-indigo sky, Sentinel Oak, and moss provide vivid anchoring. Sensory detail (jasmine, damp earth, liquid twilight) is filtered through Elara's purposeful lens. The oak's scars and her matching birthmark create a micro-setting constraint that enables the linking method. The clipping's glow projects a maze onto moss, charging the final image when the sapling sprouts. However, spatial choreography at the clearing where "reality dissolved" becomes vague; the rift's physical properties and Elara's exact stance/position remain abstract, limiting tactile grounding at the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.2)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid and specific: "gnarled apple tree roots snaked between bleached femurs," "phosphorescent moss," "rib-vaulted corridors." The setting supplies the altar stone at the heart where Kael lays the card, and the half-lit corridors frame the entire ritual. Spatial choreography is clear (gravel path, half-buried hand, moss-furred altar), and the environment subtly mirrors the theme of death, memory, and regrowth. The recurring bones and roots constrain Kael's reverent gestures (kneeling, placing stones) and charge the final image of the orchard exhaling approval. Minor deduction: the setting does not pressure a tactical choice or force a reversal; it functions more as resonant backdrop than active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.7)
    The quarry office trailer is anchored early with specific detail (aluminum walls, C-sharp floorboards, Cambrian limestone cliffs) and the sunset cliffs return at closure with purposeful reweighting ("no longer symbols of barren isolation but of patient strength"). The wooden box and its contents ground the reflection in tactile particulars. However, the setting functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active constraint—no choice hinges on the trailer's properties or the quarry's isolation, capping the score below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    The magnetic arbor is vividly specific (ironwood, magnetic filaments, luminous moss, pulsing nexus) and constrains Aris's action: he plants at the central nexus where magnetic currents converge, and the arbor's response (resonant hum, needle stabilization) validates his choice. Sensory detail is filtered through professional attention (frequency decay, residual warmth) and selective (the "soft pulse," "dark, rich soil humming with latent energy"). The micro-setting—seed in soil at the arbor's heart—charges the final image. Minor deduction: some phrases ("perpetual dawn," "swirling cloud cover") offer picturesque backdrop without pressure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal atrium is vivid and coherent: bronze gears "taller than an ancient oak," wintersun light, brine and aged paper scent. The creel functions as micro-setting, handled twice (placement, retrieval) and charged with meaning. Spatial choreography is clear (watermark, stone bench, mist-shrouded shelves). The setting subtly mirrors Elara's internal rhythm and constrains the ritual's choreography, though it does not force a pivotal choice that alters outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    The crystal caves supply concrete sensory detail—phosphorescent veins, quartz cradles, geological breath—filtered through Elias's inspector's eyes trained to spot fractures. The cave environment constrains the ritual (shell nested in quartz, pearl placed in spiral apex) and charges the closure image when latent radiance erupts in response to the crowning act. Spatial choreography (kneeling, lifting shell to glow, placing pearl) remains clear and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    The disused station, ivy, fractured platforms, and bathroom tiles create vivid spatial grounding. The accordion functions as micro-setting: its patched bellows constrain her self-image and charge the final choice to carry it. The graffiti on bathroom tiles supplies the wisdom that reweights her stake, making setting instrumental rather than decorative. Sensory detail—dust motes, jasmine, bee hum—is filtered through Elara's river-chronicler lens without catalog excess. The Serpentine River remains backdrop rather than active constraint, but the station house interior pressures her emotional reckoning throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.4)
    The glowing library is vividly anchored—crystalline spires, mist, shelves stretching into infinity—and sensory detail is selective. The confidence man's watch constrains Elara's documentation by serving as a metronome, meeting the 9+ quick test requirement that an object or tool constrains a choice. However, spatial choreography inside the library remains abstract; we do not see her move between shelves or handle volumes beyond the single blue-leather book, and the micro-setting does not visibly alter tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.1)
    The velvet observatory and ice violin constrain the climax: cold seeps through linen, the violin dissolves into water on velvet, and the confined space frames the ritual. Sensory detail is selective and vivid ("cracking glaciers and thawing rivers"), filtered through Elara's plant-attuned perception. The midsummer heat is mentioned but does not recur to pressure choice. Spatial choreography is coherent and the final image (shoot unfurling, water pooling) charges the ending, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.1)
    The skyborne grotto, obsidian slab, and aurora are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (cooling skin, thickening air, stilled light). The aurora's shift to "watchful emerald green" and its final bow acknowledge the ritual, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the crystalline steps provide a tactile exit. The setting constrains the ritual's timing and amplifies its reverence without becoming a postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.1)
    The grotto, yew tree, and stone basin are rendered with vivid, purpose-driven detail that grounds the ritual. The obsidian chisel and pearl hairpin anchor tactile moments. However, the "umbral grotto above the clouds" operates more as lyric backdrop than as a constraint that narrows Elara's choices; the environment enables but does not pressure. The scalloped basin and yew roots charge the final image with thematic weight, meeting the 9+ gate partially but not fully constraining a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    The breezy lighthouse setting is vivid and purposeful: wind drives the chime method, the cliff provides a natural disposal site for the cloak and shard, and dawn's rising light mirrors Kael's shift. Sensory details (salt on lips, indigo silence, rose-and-gold ocean) are selective and mood-appropriate. The wind chimes and their materials (copper, sea glass, silver) function as micro-setting that constrains Elara's interpretive choices and charges the final harmonious melody, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping tactics and closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto, pond, floating platform, and sycamore are vividly rendered with magnetic hum, obsidian water, and starlight pooling. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (cool surface, low hum, water rhythm). The magnetic field's effect on water rings provides a constraint that charges the meditation method. Spatial choreography (platform above pond, sycaore at entrance, single aperture) remains clear throughout. The environment shapes the trance practice and the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bone towers and canyon echoes are vividly rendered ("rib cages vast as cathedrals," "tusk-spired tower") and constraining: Corbin's brittle body binds him to the throne, making stillness the only viable tactic. The stone arrowhead's warmth and vibration at the climax directly charge the final act. Spatial choreography is clear (throne, towers, fissure, rim), and the birds' flight paths map the resonance geography, turning setting into actionable information.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound spire is vividly rendered with concrete impossibilities (upward-flowing mercury, motionless snowflakes, warm sandstone keystone in frost) that pressure Elara's perception and choices. Spatial choreography is clear: valley mist → ascent → clouds part → archway → keystone. The environment constrains action (thin air, sharp ozone, frozen tears) and charges the final image (moonflower bloom in her window box mirrors the spire's lingering luminance). Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through Elara's POV (she notices the spire's "trapped echoes of forgotten laughter," the "scent of damp earth and jasmine"), grounding the lyric mode in concrete anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sunken library setting is vivid and purposeful: waterlogged books, fractured moonlight through portholes, and sky lanterns casting shifting light create a charged atmosphere. The brass key and chest anchor tactile interaction, and the mudflats/tides constrain Elias's access window. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through his quest (trailing fingers over spines, seeking chromatic evidence). The recurring sky lanterns constrain the timeframe and charge the final image, pushing this into the 7+ band despite occasional ornamental phrasing ("cathedral of drowned knowledge").

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.1)
    Amber resin, brass telescopes, obsidian surface, and the luminous singularity pearl are vivid and anchored. The observatory deck functions as micro-setting: the ambered objects and console static constrain Elara's ritual and charge the final image. Sensory selection (trapped warmth, soft whispers of coins, resonant tone) filters through her meditative focus. The post-contraction cosmology is purposeful, establishing the backward-prophecy logic and the vigil's isolation. Minor slip: "faded velvet" and "leather pouch" appear without prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory setting is vividly rendered with "stone arches," "dust motes in slanted amber rays," and the "great crystal prism," and it directly enables the crystallization method through the dome's aperture and scattered light. The atlas page functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (he must position it on the stone table, intercept specific wavelengths). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Kael's reverent focus. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the ritual sequence, and the final image of "tiny rainbows across ancient stone" charges the closure without ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sapphire viaduct is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: "crystalline structure fracturing dawn's first light into liquid gemstones," chilled rails weeping condensation, reed conduits guiding droplets. The setting constrains Elara's method (drip intervals dictated by temperature, humidity, sun angle) and charges the final image when sunlight ignites refraction as the bell rings. Spatial choreography is coherent—viaduct, railing, bell halves, sea below—and the micro-setting (the third railing knot, the bronze fracture) functions as the crucible for restoration. Minor weakness: the "silent cove" and "barren sea" remain somewhat generic backdrops; the village is mentioned but never seen or felt as a pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Midnight Ridgeway, exposed cobblestones, and the water-stained foundation create vivid spatial grounding. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's professional attention. The green bottle's discovery is anchored in concrete space (nestled against foundation stone) and the ridgeway's visual rhythm ("shadows pooled thick even at noon") contributes to tone. The micro-setting (the exposed porch foundation) does enable the key find, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but the environment does not meaningfully constrain her choice—she retrieves the bottle without spatial friction or resource limit.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.1)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall, ancient apple trees, and copper brazier are vividly rendered with sensory specificity and remain spatially coherent throughout. The orchard atmosphere ("ancient freshness") is sustained without generic placeholder description. The copper wire lattice functions as micro-setting: Elara uses it to channel flame, directly constraining her method and charging the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through her alchemist's perspective (mossy stones, silver bark, dew-kissed leaves) and modulates with emotional intensity—calm observation before the turn, heightened focus during the transformation. The setting drives one key choice (wire weaving) and anchors the closure, meeting the 9+ test for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    The arbor functions as both setting and tool: Elara uses the silverwood vines as a "corrective lens" to realign her observation, making the environment instrumental to her solution. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (frost-laden vines, obsidian floor, starlight refraction), filtered through the watcher's professional attention. The parachute buckle and silverwood desk serve as micro-setting anchors. Spatial choreography remains clear across the crystalline platform, desk, and vine positions, and the nocturnal arbor above clouds constrains her solitary vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    The floating rock dojo is anchored early with vivid particulars (worn planks, abyss below, moss-carved altar, open arches). Mountains flickering into oceans and treaties vanishing provide atmospheric texture. However, the environment does not constrain a tactical choice or materially charge the final image—the dojo functions as backdrop rather than pressure. The brain jar rests on the altar throughout without movement or spatial interaction that alters outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    The echo chamber tunnel is vivid and functional: curved stone walls that "swallow sound only to return it transformed" directly enable the climactic moment when machinery becomes childlike laughter. Sensory details—damp earth, cool air, dust motes—are filtered through grief and ritual. The space constrains and charges the action, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Minor: some descriptions ("star-dusted night," "violet sky") trend decorative in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frozen garden is rendered with specific, purposeful detail—frost-ferns, ice-sheathed willows, skeletal branches—that charges the guardian's interiority and the practice of interiorizing exteriors. The pendant and the rift's golden light supply micro-setting pressure that constrains the climactic choice. Spatial choreography (mist recoils, vertical rift, pendant at sternum) remains clear throughout, and the sensory hierarchy reflects the guardian's professional focus on light and boundaries.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ember nexus is richly detailed—"residual embers glowing with paradoxical frozen bloom"—and functions as micro-setting: the cinder's captured starlight provides just enough energy for metamorphosis, directly constraining her method. Tools (meteorite mortar, bone pestle, snowdrop) are concrete and handled. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling, positioning fragments over the nexus heart). The "frozen bloom" motif charges the final image when crystalline blossoms mirror frost patterns. One slip: twilight as timeframe feels decorative rather than tactically urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.7)
    The suspended radio tower city, gorge, lunar perigee, and the Hollywood star fragment are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (ozone, aged wood, humming cables). The fragment's coolness and later warmth constrain her tuning ritual, and the moon's pull tightens the temporal frame. However, spatial choreography inside the control room remains vague, and the environment functions more as evocative backdrop than as a constraint that alters her tactics. The fragment and spire charge the final image but do not force a mid-scene choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.1)
    The spectral grotto and starlight patterns are vividly rendered and purposeful: constellations map fractured timelines, the empty hourglass anchors the solve, and the setting directly shapes Leo's tactical choice (study patterns, broadcast harmonic). Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. The "clocks run sideways" image is evocative but functions more as flavor than spatial constraint. Overall the grotto charges the closure image and constrains the method, meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.1)
    The optical illusion gallery is vividly established with "crystalline apertures," "shifting lattices," and "mathematically precise grace." The loom and sinew thread function as micro-setting elements that constrain Elara's ritual and charge the eruption. The final image—"walls melted into forests of forgotten promises; the floor became a river of flowing time"—transforms the space and shapes the closure moment, though the metamorphosis is metaphorical rather than tactile. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional focus (patterns, weaves, knots) without tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.1)
    The benthic city's bioluminescent pathways and "crushing dark" anchor atmosphere and constrain the central problem: navigating by stars unseen beneath water. The spire's crystalflex viewport and holotank are integrated into the demonstration sequence, and the final beat "the spire's walls seemed to vanish" charges the closure image by contrasting physical confinement with cognitive expansion. Sensory detail is selective—"pitted iron," "humming spire"—and filtered through Kael's professional lens. The underwater setting imposes a persistent physical constraint that shapes the story's premise and ending resonance, qualifying for the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vivid and purposeful, filtering sensory detail through Elara's professional focus (marble "veined like frozen rivers," violet haze, pearlescent glow). The hearing aid functions as micro-setting, constraining her method (absolute stillness required) and charging the final image when the mist glows. Spatial choreography is clear (archway, Lily approaching, kneeling). The setting does not, however, *alter* Elara's tactics or force a navigational choice under pressure—it frames and amplifies rather than constrains.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    The facility functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice: corroded ladder, narrowing corridors, seeping water, and the tidal clock all pressure Aris's descent and escape. The Phase Transition Array charges the closure image through specific physical detail (copper coils, frosted glass, obsidian surface with fractal frost). Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—broad atmosphere during descent narrows to the gold's pulse under stress, then expands to the Array's cathedral scale at the reveal. The rising water finale makes spatial choreography (door, ladder, shore) stakes-critical and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    The opal observatory and snow mantle are vivid but remain postcard description; the porcelain shard and ink-stained paper function as symbolic props without constraining a physical choice or altering spatial choreography. The "opal beneath the paper hummed faintly" offers sensory texture that supports tone, and the snow's "gentle descent, erasing scars" charges the final image with conceptual cost. Micro-setting (body, tool) is present but does not force a tactical trade-off. The environment pressures mood more than decision.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bone towers, canyon of echoes, and tunnel are vividly rendered and constrain Elara's method: the tunnel's acoustics are essential to layering sound, and the towers function as resonant instruments in the final beat. Sensory detail is purposeful—cool air, wind-scoured texture, the vibration "through the very marrow of the bone towers"—and filtered through Elara's tactile focus. The diamond as micro-setting object charges the closure when its flaw glows "like a captured constellation of meaning." Spatial choreography (entering the tunnel, climbing the tower, placing the diamond in the niche) tracks cleanly and advances the ritual sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.1)
    The underground garden is vivid and purposeful: foxfire mushrooms, vines, and the spatial layout all contribute to atmosphere and constrain the scene's intimacy. The hovering dewdrop and vine-twisting at the metamorphosis charge the final image with gravitational playfulness. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the micro-setting (altar, phone, crack in the wall) functions as a coherent stage. The environment meaningfully charges the closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for setting involvement.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.1)
    The orchard, bridge, and monolith are anchored early and vivid: "tarnished wonder," "seamless granite," "obsidian monolith." Spatial choreography is clean (bridge → ladder → grove's heart). The locust shell functions as micro-setting, constraining Elara's method and charging the final image when it glows. Sensory detail is selective but leans visual; the "thump-thump" heartbeat and "stone-thorns" provide tactile grounding, meeting the band requirement without deep occupational or systemic detail.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.7)
    The cobalt arcade is vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (hand-glazed tiles, liquid sapphire light) and the twilight timing constrains the ritual. The thunderstorm bottle and repurposed drone function as micro-setting objects that enable the climactic action. However, spatial choreography during the drone launch is vague—where exactly is the patrol drone, how close is the eastern arch, and does the mist/lightning actually obscure Kael from all angles? The setting supports atmosphere and ritual but does not force a tactical choice with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting details are vivid and selective: "ivy cradling its silent wheels," "stained-glass dome," "walnut flanks." The abandoned train and hidden carriage function as micro-setting that enables discovery and constrains Elara's choice (isolated space for private song). Wind bells and misting hush recur to frame the timeframe and charge the final departure. Spatial choreography is clear (truck, carriage door, kneeling, tracing). The "hidden oasis" valley reveal at the end supplies thematic resonance but does not constrain a prior choice, so setting pressure peaks mid-story rather than at closure. Sensory detail favors the visual; tactile and auditory are present but less developed under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    The library setting is vivid and specific ("Calculus of Longing," "Photosynthetic Haikus," hyperbolic crochet model), and the Contemplation Nook with its green lamp provides spatial grounding for the key beat. The scarf functions as micro-setting, constraining Elara's tactile focus (line 109) and charging the final image. The grandmother's study (lines 128–135) is sensorially rich (beeswax, chamomile, rain) and the firelight detail returns purposefully when the scarf's folds catch it (line 157). Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the library's atmosphere of "hushed pocket" and "gentle currents" supports the observed-solitude tone without becoming static postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: wind-scoured cliffs, sea caves, the eastern turret, the whispering archipelago. The library's stone anchors spatial choreography (cool stone beneath palms, spiral stairs, oak workbench, red-lit darkroom). Sensory detail is selective—salt-laced breeze, scent of old paper, gold and amethyst light—and filtered through Elara's professional and emotional priorities. The watercolor palette and camera constrain her method; the turret's eastern vantage enables the sunrise shot. The archipelago's whispers shift from mystery to "joyful chorus," charging the final image with environmental reconfiguration. Micro-setting (palette, lens, darkroom bath) functions as setting and tool simultaneously, meeting the 9+ gate criterion.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The shadowed nexus, ancient oaks, moss-covered keystone, and starlight are vividly rendered and establish a coherent atmosphere. Vega's light striking the keystone to reveal the fracture is a strong micro-setting moment that constrains the locksmith's next action. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and sensory detail (dew-kissed cobblestones, silk whispering) is purposeful. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop rather than forcing choices; the locksmith could complete the ritual in any symbolic location without altering the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    The shipwrecks and greenhouse ribs create a vivid, purposeful cage; the tidal pool serves as both mirror and ritual instrument, constraining the detection method. Sensory details are selective and grounded (salt spray, damp rot, apple-blossom ghost; mud vibration). The recurring fairy ring on shore mirrors the luminous circle in water, charging the final act when Aris tips the mushroom into the pool. Spatial choreography is clear across the kneeling, sketching, and rising sequence. The setting's desolation and the constellations broken by wreckage support tone and stakes without postcard excess.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    The library's "perpetual twilight" and the desk, saucer, and tea apparatus constrain the ritual and frame the mentor-student dynamic. The playground swing outside functions as micro-setting: its arc mirrors cyclical return, constrains perception (visible through the high window), and charges the closure when "the swing caught a stronger gust, its arc widening with renewed purpose." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (decaying vellum, steam fogging Kael's facets). However, spatial choreography of Kael's movement (through stacks, at the desk, stepping forward) lacks granular blocking; distances and Kael's exact position relative to Elara shift without clear anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.1)
    The parapet, waterfall mist, and seed anchor setting vividly and remain present across beats. The seed's warmth and glow function as micro-setting that charges the visualization sequence. Sensory detail (moss, mist, stone, roar) is filtered through Elara's professional and spiritual priorities. The final image—bud unfurling gold-green—directly reprises the central color motif and charges closure, though it arrives as affirmation rather than constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prism sanctuary, obsidian dais, and tapestry needle constrain Elara's method and charge the final image where starlight "no longer fractured by sorrow" pools around the empty net. Sensory detail is vivid (salt-bleached fibers, moss-flecked floor, cold brilliant starlight) and filtered through Elara's restorative focus. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. However, the sanctuary's rules and the mechanics of how prisms or starlight interact with spirits remain decorative rather than applying pressure to her choices mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rain-scoured vault is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (wet limestone, dripping water, dim glow) and constrains Elara's work by providing the eastern fresco that completes her alignment discovery. The henge, though off-page in present action, returns through video and shadow geometry to charge the closure image. Spatial choreography (table, window, fresco wall) remains clear and the environment directly enables the final interpretive leap, meeting the 9+ gate criterion of constraint shaping the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sunken library is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: "waterlogged shelves," "curtain of ghostly anemones," "rust-sealed strongbox." Spatial choreography is coherent throughout the dive and the snow globe functions as micro-setting, constraining observation and charging the final image on the console. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional focus (rebreather rhythm, lamp beam, tape texture). The submersible's dry chamber and ascent provide clean environmental evolution. One slip: the Athenia's telegraph wires are mentioned (line 105) but never appear on-page, and glycerin seas in the globe are precise yet the "silver particles" vs. "glitter" toggle slightly muddies the物ject's material consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.1)
    The misty courtyard above the clouds is vivid and specific, filtered through Elara's purpose ("vapor curled like liquid pearl," "stone's soul"). The flower press bolt plate returns twice—clutched, then wiped clean—and the flagstone constrains her method (carving with a sharp edge). The mist "swirled around her wrists like a supportive spirit," charging the final image with atmosphere. However, the setting does not force a tactical choice or complicate her task; it provides a backdrop rather than active pressure. The courtyard hums with "latent meaning" but does not alter Elara's options at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    The icebound spire, elevator porthole, and scattered light through the glacier are vivid and purposeful; the environment directly enables the goggles' decryption mechanism. Sensory detail is selective ("frost-bleached diary," "crystalline ramparts into prismatic shards") and filtered through Kael's perspective. The elevator's climb from Floor 3 to 10 structures the narrative and the scattered light constrains the revelation beats, charging the final image when he steps into the archive's "sunlit expanse." Micro-setting (the elevator interior, the velvet bench, the obsidian desk) anchors each beat without tourist-catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sky gondola functions as micro-setting; the brass telescope constrains observation choices and charges the final moment. Cloud types are specific and filter through Aris's professional lens. Spatial choreography is clean (gondola, telescope, journal, sky). The fallstreak hole—a real meteorological phenomenon—provides the geometric absence that validates the method and closes the piece, qualifying for the 9+ gate requirement that setting/object constrain choice or charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    The hollowed-tree library is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail: swirling bark, embedded shelves, scent of aged paper and living wood. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The setting directly enables the coin discovery (shelves of texts, the cerulean-bound volume) and the demolition threat charges the final departure. Elara's tactile bias filters every environmental cue, anchoring the sensory hierarchy to her face-blindness. The coin's texture and the fractal indentations function as micro-setting that constrains and charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.7)
    The airship setting is vivid (brass fittings, silk balloons, teak deck, hopscotch board) and the observatory window frames the starling murmuration effectively. The hopscotch board supplies the cipher and the crystal orb lives in a hidden compartment, so micro-setting does constrain the solution. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop and puzzle-box rather than applying pressure that narrows Elara's choices; the discovery feels convenient rather than hard-won through spatial friction.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    The frozen library above clouds, ice-flowers, glacial corridors, and hall of mirrors supply vivid, purposeful atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's quest: hoarfrost on vellum, the scent of beeswax on tools, ice surrendering "with a sigh." The celestial clock's cage of light and the mirror reflections constrain her final action (the lens uncapping) and charge the ending image with multiplied motion. Micro-setting (the deep blue velvet, the slender pick) anchors tactile engagement. Spatial choreography remains clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.1)
    Veridia's floating arches and impossible-hued fruit establish vivid, specific setting. The watering bell's verdigris surface, hidden star charts, and mossy pedestal ground tactile interaction. Spatial choreography (scaling arches with ropes, positioning mirrors, bell on pedestal) remains clear. The bell and mirrors constrain the climactic choice: Kael must aim the beam precisely, and that constraint charges the resolution. Micro-setting (the bell as tool) elevates the score into the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse setting anchors the scene and supplies the lantern room/console/pane apparatus, but does not constrain Elara's choices or complicate her execution; it is a stage rather than an obstacle. Sensory details (sea-mist, salt tears, vibrating stones, starlight) are vivid and filtered through the cosmic scale of her task. The puppet head—a micro-object—is handled twice (placed on console, glanced at afterward) and its cracks "gleam with residual light" to charge the final image, meeting the micro-setting allowance. Spatial choreography is minimal but clear.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cliffside orchard, Sentinel Tree, moss-crusted altar, and mechanical birds create vivid spatial pressure and the environment constrains choice (nut wedged in bark, altar's central peg for spindle alignment). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through urgency (frost crystals glitter, emerald trail weaving). The small nut and device physically enable the closure, satisfying the micro-setting rule. Spatial choreography is clean except for one ambiguity: the family "stumbled into view at the entrance" while Elara is "at the labyrinth's heart"—sightline plausibility is slightly unclear.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    The braided ravine is vividly rendered with mineral scent, granite, pine, and ephemeral foam lacework. The streams and foam patterns constrain Aris's insight at the closure beat: divergence/convergence directly shapes his realization and the proposal he will draft. Spatial choreography is clear (precipice, willow roots, stone, submerged log, trailhead). The chrysalis and sun-warmed stone anchor micro-setting that charges the final image, lifting the score into the solid 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.7)
    The glass orchard library floating on clouds is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (transparent trees, luminous manuscripts, chiming branches, swirling marble-like clouds). The bottled moonlight and river stone slate anchor micro-setting through tactile detail. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elara's action proceeds without spatial or material friction. The setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a pressure on the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.1)
    Desert fortress after rain is vivid and purposeful: puddles as mirrors, damp sand, night-blooming cereus perfume anchor sensory texture. The coral pavilion's ice and the tidal pool constrain Aris's method and charge the final image when ice melts to amber. Spatial choreography (courtyard → western dune → archway) remains clear. Micro-setting—the body and the pavilion surface—drives the peak beat when Aris presses his palm flat and the stored remorse surges.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.1)
    The astronomical clock tower is vividly rendered with specific mechanical detail (Jupiter's gear, resonance governor, moon-phase indicator) and the body/tool interplay—her hands working gears, polishing with rosewater—grounds the action. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; the gears do not constrain her choices or create tactical friction. The tower charges the final image through the starlight beam, lifting the score modestly, but spatial choreography during the repair remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.1)
    The moonlit canyon provides vivid sensory detail ("sliver of polished bone," "layered sedimentary walls") but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. Spatial choreography is clear (ledge, sandstone slab, ascent path) yet the environment never alters Elara's choices or tactics. The broken mirror shards are described but their physical properties—fractured surface, velvet pouch—do not pressure decisions. Micro-setting potential exists but remains ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.8)
    The serpentine grotto's impossible geometry (stalactites rising, water ascending) is vivid and the vigilance-seed fungi guide Elara's path, directly enabling her success. Sensory detail is purposeful—salt-laced mist, cool threshold silk, bioluminescent spirals—and filtered through her prism-vision. The inversion hour functions as both time pressure and environmental constraint, shaping when and how she can act. Spatial choreography remains clear across the vertical-to-horizontal warp, and the grotto's layout (Fibonacci spirals, keyhole chamber) ties to the margin doodle, charging the final discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    The siskin alder grove is vividly established with "muted hues," "damp leaf litter," "emerald moss," and the hedgehog's nocturnal disappearance, creating a coherent sensory frame. The porcelain insulator and the sculpture are grounded objects with tactile presence (cool weight, stress cracks). The setting directly enables Elara's method—the ancient alder trunks house the sculpture, the moss cradles the insulator—and the final image ("alders seemed to lean closer") charges the grove with responsive agency that deepens the closure. The micro-setting (moss, ferns, branch) functions as a constrained stage that holds the action.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.1)
    The magnetic nexus is vividly anchored with sensory detail (subsonic hum, iron-rich basalt, compass needles spinning) and the worry stone functions as micro-setting. The environment shapes Elias's contemplative stance and provides concrete anchors for his correlations (wind through fissures, cooling stone). However, the setting does not constrain a pivotal choice—Elias's journey inward is enabled but not pressured by the nexus. The final image of the path east offers spatial grounding but the nexus itself does not charge the closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.1)
    The shadowed workshop, velvet, resonator sculpture, and starlit sky are vividly rendered and anchor the reader early. Sensory detail (cold clasp, copper hum, dust on cheeks) is specific and filtered through Elara's sensibility. Yet the environment does not constrain a single choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—she never lacks a tool, improvises under spatial pressure, or adjusts tactics due to the setting. The fireworks timeframe remains ambient backdrop rather than a live clock that tightens decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.1)
    The treetop village supplies vivid anchors (rope bridges, homes like moss, dawn light gilding canopy) and the olfactory environment drives Elara's choices throughout (ozone tang, sweet-earth scent, anticipated stench). The sacred groves' soil and the pot function as micro-setting that constrains cultivation technique. However, the village itself remains postcard-pretty and does not apply spatial pressure to the central conflict; the balcony could be any contemplative perch. Sensory selection is purposeful and POV-filtered through her herbalist's nose.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    The inversion hour provides a vivid, high-concept frame: gravity inverts, water streams upward, roots reach skyward. Spatial choreography through floating arches and the woven-willow skiff remains coherent. The broken arrow tip functions as micro-setting, warming in Kael's palm and constraining his navigation by accelerating toward life concentrations. The Cradle Arch and First Tree roots anchor the closure image, charging it with the pulsating radiance that transforms the withered twig. Sensory selection is strong—silver bark, luminous ribbons, emerald waves—though the "whirling silence" (a conceptual oxymoron) occasionally substitutes poetic abstraction for concrete sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    The container labyrinth is vividly rendered with selective detail: "steel canyons," "22-knot gust accelerating through narrow gap," "twisted steel groaned," mist diffusing light. Setting constrains movement and discovery—Venturi effects between containers 441 and 442, resonant frequency at Bay Seven. The patch extraction amid "splintered wood and torn netting" uses micro-setting to charge the closure moment. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities (wind data, structural schematics) over tourism.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ice cavern is vividly described with "vaulted ceilings," "sweeping arches," and prismatic light effects, and the aurora's colors filter through spatial constraints. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or force a tactical trade-off; Elara performs her ritual without spatial friction. The amber sheet and bell are handled but remain static props that don't evolve under pressure. Micro-setting is present but ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.1)
    The canyon setting and the driftwood markers provide concrete spatial anchors and charge the ritual frame. The gilded flute as micro-setting object shapes the closure image directly. Sensory detail ("sun-warmed sandstone," "canyon dust") is selective and purposeful, though the "avalanchingly quiet" descriptor is repeated without evolving sensory texture.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.1)
    The topaz workshop, brass lever, velvet cushion, and crystalline dome are vivid and selective, establishing tone and anchoring the single-scene frame. The halo fragment functions as a tool (lens to perceive emotional residue) that recurs, though its physical handling is minimal after the initial paragraphs. The "vanishing stars" and "Between" timeframe are atmospheric but do not alter tactics or constrain a choice; they remain descriptive backdrop. The final image (single new star pricking the darkness, halo fragment glowing gold) charges the ending thematically but does not reshape options or pressure on the page, missing the higher band's gate for micro-setting that constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway, frost-rimed stones, and celestial fire establish vivid setting early. Sensory detail is purposeful ("scent of pine and cold stone") and filtered through Kael's familiarity. The pendant as micro-setting object constrains the peak action (its hum triggers germination) and charges the final image (the glowing plant). However, the ridgeway itself functions more as backdrop than active constraint; no environmental feature pressures a tactical choice. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

    The quartz arbor and frost-etched windshield provide concrete anchors; mist, damp soil, and crystalline branches establish atmosphere. The prism is handled twice (raising it, lowering it) and the frost patterns constrain Kael's interpretive choice. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. However, the setting primarily stages revelation rather than forcing tactical adaptation—Kael does not navigate obstacles or resource scarcity. The arbor "hums softly" at closure, a lyric touch that charges the final image but does not alter options.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.7)
    The forgotten orchard and bamboo forest are evoked through selective, purposeful detail ("weeping moss," "heartwood of the oldest tree") filtered through Elara's perceptual priorities. The loom, amber bead, and moss ground spatial choreography; the setting constrains her work (raveling silence leaches color, thinning reality) and the final sapling charges the closure image with specificity. However, the bamboo forest functions primarily as atmospheric frame rather than an active pressure on choices—she never navigates it, uses it tactically, or has her options altered by its geography. Micro-setting (loom, bead, moss) does more causal work than the macro geography.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard planet, floating arches, and mine-shaft setting are vivid and consistent. The silk, river stones, and root-pierced cavern constrain Kael's ritual choices, and the restored arches charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Kael's priorities (glow-moss lantern, damp mineral walls, phosphorescent fungi). Spatial choreography is clean throughout the descent and emergence. The setting meaningfully shapes the protagonist's tactics and the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.1)
    The repair bay is anchored early with concrete details (permacrete, rusted durasteel, dead conduits) and the green shard functions as a tactile micro-setting element. The parallel-universe shifts (verdant vines, star-flecked void) provide vivid sensory contrast. Yet the bay itself does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it serves primarily as a backdrop for the sensory-mapping frame. The shard is handled across beats but its warmth and glow remain largely atmospheric rather than forcing a trade-off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lantern room is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (cold brass, extinguished wick, moonlight through the Fresnel lens, spectral rainbows). The setting pressures Elias's choices by providing the cairn, the sea glass, and the legacy space that demands continuation. Spatial choreography is clear (windowsill, iron grating, door). The micro-setting of the stone stack constrains the ritual and charges the final image, qualifying for high-band entry under the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    The emerald lighthouse, glass lantern wick, and star-charts constrain Kael's method throughout; the setting is not postcard but functional—total internal reflection requires the crystalline facets, the spiral stairs frame the ascent/descent bracket, and the final beach glyphs charge the closure image by making the shadow-work visible and transient. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though some descriptors ("wind-scoured cliff," "infinite velvet sky") drift toward stock lyricism. The micro-setting (glass wick warming, lighthouse vibrating) alters tactics and anchors the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tea house, sun trail grooves, and morpho wing function as micro-setting that constrains Elara's method and charges the closure image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "dust motes," "spiderweb strung between posts glittered like a necklace of diamonds," "liquid-gold path." The valley mist frames the opening and closing, creating spatial coherence. The sun trail is not mere backdrop—it is the mechanism that reveals the wing's truth, thus earning integration credit. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stormlit tower, leaded glass, moonlight column, and labyrinth below are vividly rendered and provide atmospheric coherence. The sextant as recurring object charges the final image when it becomes the conduit for tree memories. However, the environment does not constrain Elara's choices—she waits passively for moonlight—and the pin's fall, while specific, is coincidental rather than a tactical use of setting. Spatial choreography (corridor, window, labyrinth below) remains clear. The setting supports tone and concept but does not force a decision or alter tactics, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    The alchemical greenhouse is vividly rendered with copper alembics, glass vials, mica window, and perpetual twilight. The mica window constrains perception (layered panes, frozen breath) and charges the final image (blazing dawn spectrum, prismatic tears). Spatial choreography is clean—Elara kneels, wraps, sings—and the setting's endless night pressures the ritual. Sensory selection (starlight, moss, spider-silk, dewdrop) reflects urgency and integrates into action.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Athenaeum is vividly rendered with concrete sensory detail (moonlight, dust motes, beeswax, aged paper) and the "nestled paradox" of hidden-in-plain-sight creates spatial logic. The library actively shapes Elara's choice: she uses its ritual mechanics and the invitation tucked within its atlas to achieve presence-while-absent. The final image of candle flame reflected as a "second, gentler moon" charges the closure, and the shelves "leaning inward like guardians" subtly personify the space as witness. Micro-setting (reading desk, atlas, chamber) constrains and enables her method throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    The overgrown palace courtyard is vividly rendered (marble statues, wild clematis, dry fountain with sparrows) and constrains Elara's action—she must uncloak ivy to reach soil. The body-as-micro-setting (kneeling, fingers in earth) charges the planting ritual. Spatial choreography is clear across the courtyard and tea-house interior, and the mossy bench serves as a functional stage for the bread's revelation. The setting directly shapes the guerrilla-gardening method and the final image of green defiance behind the ivy curtain.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frozen library, ice-carved workbench, and quartz hush provide vivid, consistent atmosphere. The Resonance Analyzer and its brass gears ground the process in tactile detail. Spatial choreography is clean: Elara moves from aisles to workbench to archive crystal to window, each station purposeful. The micro-setting (the analyzer, the slide, the obsidian screen) constrains her method and charges the final image as she adjusts the calibrator for the next vow, elevating Q3 into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rotting pier, lantern light, and sea-glass details anchor the space vividly. The watch fob constrains Elara's goal (she must be present to record) and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the exact layout of stalls and Elara's movements occasionally blur during the three interventions. The blue-dye-on-cuff detail at climax is excellently specific and plot-relevant, lifting the setting's role in the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lavender bluff and aurora provide vivid, multi-sensory grounding (violet blooms, floral perfume, electric hum, jade and violet rivers). The standing stones offer a spatial destination that anchors the convergence moment, and the ring's warmth against luminous skin creates tactile specificity. Sensory selection reflects Elara's shifting internal state—lavender taste signals alignment, the raindrop on her wrist echoes her grandmother's tears—allowing setting to charge the closure image. The forest elections remain somewhat abstract despite their bioluminescent votes, functioning more as atmospheric backdrop than actionable constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.1)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vividly rendered ("amethyst and sapphire veins," "auroral luminescence," calcite panel) and functions as more than backdrop: the "secret canvas" stone constrains Elara's method (she must sketch on translucent calcite for the crystals to reveal numbers) and the embedded crystals supply the mechanism that unlocks the compartment, directly shaping the climax. Spatial choreography is clear (cave → calcite panel → niche beside portrait → compartment within crystal matrix), and sensory detail is filtered through Elara's artist's eye (charcoal grit, damp stone taste). However, the cave does not evolve or pressure a trade-off—it remains a static, cooperative partner rather than an obstacle that alters tactics under stress, and the moss-lined compartment feels seeded for discovery rather than earned through environmental friction.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.1)
    The greenhouse city under toxic sky is vividly rendered and consistently present; the zinc fragment, oak table, and Northern Arch supply tangible anchors. The derelict arch with its feather-shaped slot constrains Elara's method and charges the threshold crossing. Spatial choreography remains clean across all moves, and the greenhouse veins metaphor weaves setting into theme without postcard detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    The whispering bluff, kinetic sculpture, and iceberg fragment are rendered with vivid, purpose-driven detail. Spatial choreography is clear (vanes, bells, silver cradle, granite), and sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's attunement. The iceberg fragment's glisten and the bells' chimes charge the final image. Strong work; one notch below 8+ because the environment does not visibly constrain a choice—Elara adjusts without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glass dome, desert roses, and focused sunlight constrain the ritual's method—Unit Seven harvests sap and uses the atrium's light—giving micro-setting a functional role. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "humid air," "gravel paths," "needle-thin beam." The dome as fragile enclosure charges the final image of life "tenderly held." Spatial choreography is clean. One limit: the desert beyond remains postcard backdrop; it never pressures a choice or alters tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    The vibrant courtyard at dawn is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (gilded cobblestones, bougainvillea, jasmine) and recurs as the emotional center. The wrought-iron bench, marigolds, and mailbox supply tactile grounding, and the spatial layout remains coherent across beats. The locket's ivy-etched surface and olive-branch key offer specific object detail that charges the closure image. The setting does not constrain a choice under pressure—Elara's actions would succeed in any location—capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.9)
    The sunken lab is vividly anchored early (flooded lower level, air pocket, rusted consoles, pressure gauge). Spatial choreography is coherent and the gauge chime becomes a constraint that enables the climax. The valve, dice, and journal are handled on-page across beats. However, the setting mostly provides atmosphere; it pressures choice only at the valve moment. The "ocean's ancient pulse" final image recharges the lab as cradle rather than tomb, meeting the micro-setting standard.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The salt crystal chamber is vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (moonlight fracturing through the dome, prismatic shards, fluctuating gravity) and directly constrains Elara's navigation ("one step lifted her weightlessly while the next pinned her with crushing force"). The geode at the chamber's heart is the physical anchor for the memory's exhumation, charging the final image when the salt flows "like liquid glass" to seal the wildflowers. Spatial choreography is clear throughout both harbor and chamber settings. The body and the recurring object (wildflowers) function as micro-setting elements that shape the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.1)
    The nocturnal haven (moss, brook, roots) is vividly rendered and sustains tone across the piece. The origami wing anchors several beats (held, pulsed, brought to lips, dissolved), charging the final image. However, the setting remains postcard-descriptive; no environmental constraint alters Elara's tactics or imposes a trade-off. Spatial choreography is static (she kneels, remains seated, rises) without movement-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rooftop garden during the Perseid shower is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (steam curling, jasmine scent, meteor-illuminated parapet). The setting constrains choice subtly: the meteor flash reveals the preserved archway, making visible the "agreed upon lie" and charging Elara's realization. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The body and teacup micro-setting anchor perception effectively, though the garden itself could press harder on tactical decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.1)
    The velvet garden, quartz rods, and seashell are consistently present and guide the ritual choreography. Sensory detail (moss "like crushed velvet," "damp earth scent," "dawn light") is vivid and selective. The setting constrains the timing (waiting for Vega to fade) and supplies the resonance structures that enable the archive, charging the final image when the shell is buried beneath Kael's lilac bush. Spatial choreography remains clear across the ritual beats.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.1)
    The marble sanctuary, stalactite drips, and aurora are rendered with sensory specificity and filter through Kael's perception. The obsidian pool and the hairline seam on the marble rim serve as micro-setting that enables the ritual's mechanics (thorn press unlocks keyhole). The environment constrains the sequence and charges the final image (the blooming heritage rose, the resumed drip rhythm). Spatial choreography is clean; the sanctuary's eternal stillness contrasts with Kael's emotional shift, and the pearl twilight frames both opening and closure. The setting meets the 9+ gate by constraining the ritual and charging the final departure image.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.1)
    The serpentine nexus and starlight anchor the setting early with vivid, specific imagery ("stone ribs coiled," "tapestry of cold, watchful stars"). The whispering seashell half provides tactile detail that recurs across beats. However, the environment does not constrain Elara's movement or choices—she walks unimpeded, and the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than a pressure that alters tactics or charges the final image with spatial consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glacier shrine is vivid and purposeful: ice walls holding millennia, carved niches, pedestal of smoothed ice, candle-light refraction charging the final image. Sensory detail (misting breath, sacred cold, liquid gold flames, hushed blue silence) is filtered through Elara's reverence and shapes the closure when sunrise pierces the glacier to produce the rainbow. The melted snow globe as micro-object constrains her method (she must interpret its distorted form) and charges the ending. Economy is strong; every detail serves atmosphere and the final affirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.9)
    The whispering parapet after rain is vividly rendered with petrichor, moss-slicked steps, wet stones, and dripping water that create immersive atmosphere. The bamboo whisk and mended net function as tactile, recurring objects that constrain choices (tea preparation, net repair) and charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout; the micro-setting of body, tools, and ledge overlook drives the protagonist's reflective action and shapes the closure moment when moonlight catches the repaired knots.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.1)
    The orchard's impossible calm within the radiation storm provides vivid, purposeful contrast. Micro-details—dew on spiderwebs, earthworms, moss arrangement—constrain Elara's interpretation and guide her to the titanium container. The wasteland setting pressures the choice at closure: revealing truth would invite exploitation. Spatial choreography is clean. The apple's fall at the key moment charges the final image, establishing the setting as constraint and answer.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory's brass dome, churning clouds, and cobalt portico anchor early with vivid sensory detail filtered through Elara's visionary perspective. The cobalt glass constrains her method (transforming chaos into meaning) and charges the final image when it catches sunrise, casting "a long, hopeful shadow across the star charts." Spatial choreography across observatory, Oakhaven orchard, and citadel remains coherent. The orchard's willow and moss-stone constrain the climactic choice at solstice noon, elevating the setting from backdrop to active participant in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.7)
    The loft is vividly rendered with specific details (sandstone, sea grass, glass jars, beeswax), and the setting charges the opening and closing images effectively. The music box and jars function as micro-setting elements that constrain the poet's ritual method. However, the environment does not pressure a choice or alter tactics during the narrative—every action unfolds as the poet intends without spatial friction or resource constraint. The setting serves atmospheric and symbolic purposes but remains static through the single continuous action.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    The crypt keeper's key functions as micro-setting and charges the closure image: its star-iron composition, tuning purpose, and tactile evolution (frozen shard → warm hum) constrain the repair method and reweight the final peace. The drift-ice marina and crypt are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (frost, stone, water lapping) filtered through Elara's professional and spiritual priorities. Spatial choreography is clean across the descent and return, and the golden sunset → indigo twilight transition tracks consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly rendered with purpose-driven detail (hexagonal columns, obsidian mirror, rain-slicked surface). The viaduct's altered polarity directly enables the closure image by refracting moonlight onto the altar. Sensory selection is strong (frost-rimed stone, steaming moss, pearl moon) and filtered through Elara's professional attention. Spatial choreography remains clear across the ritual sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.7)
    The subway tunnel is vividly rendered (shallow streams, wet concrete, rust, cracked pipe) and the lantern's physical details (brass, compass rose, North Star) are specific. The setting pressures Elara's investigation through the slick algae and absent safety barriers, and the lantern's history adds atmospheric weight. However, the environment does not constrain the final choice or charge the closure image beyond thematic resonance; Elara's climb toward dawn is more symbolic than tactically shaped by the tunnel.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    The shop is vivid and selective: "dust motes," "lemon oil," and "soft tick" anchor the space with sensory specificity. The workbench, magnifying lamp, and light-through-rain all constrain Horvath's discovery and charge the climax. The environment subtly mirrors interiority ("vibrant hush," storm clearing) without heavy-handed symbolism. Spatial choreography remains clear. The recurring clockwork heart constrains the final image, qualifying as micro-setting that charges closure and pushing this into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.6)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop floating on acid sea is vividly established with sensory specificity (grinding cogs, hissing steam, pipes sighing, acid hissing critiques). Spatial choreography is coherent—Elara moves from brass fitting to kaleidoscope to Algorithm to resonator—and the environment is filtered through her playful yet reverent POV. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics at a key turn. The acid sea stills into a mirror at closure, a striking image, but one that reflects rather than pressures the protagonist's action, keeping this below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.9)
    The archive setting supplies concrete details (filtered oxygen, humming silence, console, deprecated terminal) and the patch functions as micro-setting, handled in three beats and charged at closure. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through Elara's professional lens. However, the setting does not meaningfully constrain a tactical choice—Elara's access to the terminal and Psi feels frictionless, and no environmental obstacle alters her approach. The final image (patch catching light "like a promise") reweights the object but does not show the environment pressing against her decision.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lighthouse orchard perched above shifting ice floes supplies vivid, purposeful detail—gnarled pear trees clinging to granite, salt-weathered door, vintage store mirrors. The gift shop setting constrains the method (mirrors scattered throughout), and the ice's transformation at closure charges the final image with environmental consequence. However, the orchard's "silent terror" is asserted more than shown through concrete sensory cues that would filter through the peacekeeper's professional or personal lens. Spatial choreography within the gift shop (three mirrors, their relative positions) remains sketchy, and the peacekeeper's movement from mirror to mirror lacks the tactile specificity that would anchor the sequence in lived space.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drift-ice marina constrains Elara's work (slush, broken nets, windborne cold) and the parasol tip functions as micro-setting, warming in her pocket and catching aurora glow at closure. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "deep-throated groan of ancient ice," "coarse hemp," "violet and rose gold twilight." The setting charges the final image (aurora, porcelain bud, Arctic quiet) and the ice's transformation from threat to lullaby reweights her stance. Minor: spatial choreography during the skiff scene is clean but the transition from marina to bunkhouse to cot compresses without clear movement cues.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.1)
    The amber pavilion and vineyard rootstock are vivid and purposeful, directly enabling Elara's parallel-drawing method. Spatial choreography remains clear (pavilion, stone steps, sloping vineyard, cottage path). The burned letter edge functions as both motif and constraint, charging the final paragraphs. However, setting does not pressure a choice at closure; it provides atmosphere and symbolic scaffolding rather than altering tactics or options in the reconciliation moment.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.7)
    The pavilion's sandstone arches, dunes, and kinetic parapet beneath the sand supply vivid, purposeful imagery. The conjured clearing—a circle of stillness—emerges as the ritual's anchor and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is abstract: Kael's position within the pavilion and the clearing's location relative to him remain vague, weakening immediacy. Sensory detail leans heavily visual and metaphorical; tactile grounding (boots on sand, palm on the clearing's edge) appears late and briefly.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.4)
    Lavender field and rusted factory are vividly established and recur across beats. The dove gray map case is handled (opened, emptied by the end), and the photographs are tactile anchors. Spatial choreography is clear, and the field functions as both gathering place and emotional container. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or force a tradeoff; it remains atmospheric rather than shaping Elara's tactics. The final image of vines climbing higher charges the closure metaphorically, lifting the score into mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    The library at dawn is anchored early with concrete sensory detail (pale light on oak, chandelier as frozen constellation). The crystal constrains the method and charges the final image when restored. Spatial choreography is clean (worn chair, ladder, chandelier socket). Micro-setting succeeds: the crystal functions as both tool and symbol, shaping the protagonist's access to knowledge and enabling the closure act. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Aris's scholarly attention.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.1)
    The fog sculpture garden supplies vivid, selective detail—"weeping willow," "vintage camera…a perfect circle of condensed sorrow"—and the driftwood markers anchor spatial choreography. The chalk and driftwood constrain Elara's ritual, shaping each placement; the mist-chair at closure charges the final image with the "gentle creak of wood breathing through decades." Sensory selection reflects urgency (the sound she seeks), and the garden's transient forms mirror her fractured memory. Minor slips: "hush of old videotapes" is metaphorical atmosphere rather than a physical constraint in the garden itself.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory setting is vivid and purposeful: "razor-edge of Mount Aethel," "endless sea of moonlit clouds," and the brass Chronometer ground the action. The bonsai's fallen leaf functions as micro-setting, constraining Elara's choice by providing the acoustic metaphor that unlocks the solution. Spatial choreography (viewport, obsidian floor, casing) remains clear. The moon's "changelessly constant" presence charges the final image, and the viewport frames both literal and thematic stakes. No occupation-depth issues; the repair tools and clockwork details read plausible within the scene's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    The hospice room is vividly anchored (mountain ridge, clouds below, liquid gold sunlight) and the vinyl shard is handled across beats, gaining tactile history. Lavender scent arrives as a sensory bridge that charges the closure image. The "radiant haven" frame holds coherent spatial logic (window, nightstand, bed, curtain), and the micro-setting (shard, sachets) constrains the memory work, though it does not alter a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.1)
    The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle is vividly rendered (brass telescopes, moonlight on star charts, stone chamber echoes) and the orrery's mechanics—crystal planets on brass rails, the amber sun-globe—constrain Elara's method. The corrected rune on the control panel and the shimmering veil are charged details that support the closure image. However, the floating isle itself and the "nebula-strewn void below" function primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than applying direct pressure to her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.1)
    The secret garden is anchored early and used as the frame for reflection. Specific plants (willow, rosemary, sage, lavender) are named and assigned symbolic purpose in Elara's plan, which charges the final image. However, the garden itself does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it functions as stage and metaphor rather than active pressure. The micro-setting (the tooth, the willow) does contribute to the closure image, lifting the score into mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.1)
    The serpentine grotto is vividly anchored (mist, dripping water, moss-cushioned stone, roof fissure) and sensory detail is well-filtered through Elara's purposeful attention. The brass scale and leather pad function as micro-setting that constrains and structures the polishing action. However, the grotto does not complicate any choice—it serves as backdrop for reflection rather than pressure. The cliffside jasmine at the end adds atmosphere but does not alter tactics or charge the closure decision.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    The moss garden setting is vivid and filtered through Elara's watchful attention ("emerald moss carpets," "honeyed shafts"). The icicle pattern on concrete constrains her ritual path, guiding the pendant placement. The environment charges the final act—moss as altar—though the setting functions more as backdrop to internal work than as a force that narrows tactical options. Micro-setting (the moss circle) participates in closure, lifting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.6)
    The "feral nexus" is rendered in vivid but generic Gothic terms—gnarled roots, pearlescent mist, swirling hush—without spatial choreography or constraints that shape the protagonist's movements. The seashell fragment is handled twice (temple press, final placement) and charges the ending image, meeting the micro-setting allowance. However, the mist and thickets remain postcard elements; they do not narrow options or supply resources that alter tactics. The cameo figures (child, old man, woman with telescope) float in undefined space with no distance, access, or proximity logic.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.1)
    The grove is vividly rendered (dewdrops, jasmine, moss, altar cracks) but remains postcard backdrop; no environmental feature constrains a choice or alters Elara's tactics. The vine tendril and altar are handled as ritual props without spatial choreography that pressures action. The harvest moon's light and the sun's ray function as timer elements (see Q9 H) but do not charge the final image with cost, missing the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting is vivid and selective: "skeletal testament," "violet twilight," "frozen earth," and the crater's geometry are purposefully deployed. The oldest tree's bark constrains her ritual (she must press palm to it for the heartbeat), and the crater's alignment enables the starlight descent, meeting the 9+ gate test. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. Minor penalty for atmospheric detail that occasionally stalls momentum ("bleached twigs shaped like forgotten letters") without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The marble cavern's geometry directly enables the diagnostic method: reflection angles, dewdrop magnification, shadow in the pool all constrain and guide Kael's approach. Sensory details (slanted light, hairline fracture, subterranean vibration) are filtered through his peripheral focus and integrated into action. The setting charges the final harvest beat by providing the acoustic resonators and unique frequency. Micro-setting (timer on altar, reflective walls) functions as constraint and tool, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bronze grotto, starlight, kerosene lamp, and whalebone shuttle anchor setting and atmosphere with vivid sensory detail (metallic walls, cool floor, lamplight bending). The whalebone shuttle constrains the method (its curves guide the weave) and charges the final image of renewal. Spatial choreography is coherent and the damp earth provides a tangible close. However, the grotto functions more as backdrop than pressure; no environmental detail alters Elara's tactics or forces adaptation during the weaving.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft is anchored early and sensory detail is filtered through Elara's craft-focused perception (walnut ink stains, sawdust ghosts, Leo's pipe tobacco). The ash wood blank's coolness and the carved shavings constrain her process; the kettle and skylight mark temporal rhythm. The final image of rust-hued wet cedar and the chipped Barcelona cup charge the closure by grounding the harvest metaphor in tactile objects. The environment quietly shapes the ritual's pace and sensory texture, meeting the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.1)
    The kinetic lagoon, carousel platform, and disposable camera wheel supply vivid sensory anchors filtered through Elara's scavenger attention. The camera wheel is handled across multiple beats and its physical interaction (turning, clicking) constrains her method of collecting fragments. However, the lagoon itself remains more atmospheric than spatial—its edges and center are described but never tested as resources or obstacles that shape her choices. The lead horse serves as a spatial anchor for the ghost but doesn't further constrain movement or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned spaceport is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: "cavernous silence," "collapsed directory pillar," "faded imprint of a carousel," dampness near Gate Seven. The sextant fragment—brass glint, celestial coordinates, etched edges—functions as micro-setting that constrains Elara's method (using it as protractor) and charges the final image (placed at water's source, bubbles dancing). Spatial choreography is coherent (directory pillar, maintenance hatch, fountain basin, oculus dome), and the setting guides choice through the blocked aqueduct and subterranean seepage. The oculus and fountain are not merely described but integrated into the climactic refraction beat, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    The crystal forecourt is vividly realized through selective sensory detail (quartz facets, droplets, embedded crystals) and directly charges the closure when the tuning fork activates the resonance. Petrichor weaves scent into memory and healing. The monastery gardens, moss-eaten archway, and rain-drenched stone anchor orientation early. The tuning fork as micro-object constrains Elara's final choice (leaving it in the crevice) and operates as setting-as-tool, meeting the 9+ gate.

    The twilight barge canal is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (moss-slick deck, obsidian surface, skeletal cranes, owl's hoot) filtered through Elara's contemplative stance. The canal's stillness mirrors her emotional state and the barge's groaning wood provides micro-setting texture. The sundial functions as a recurring object that constrains her focus and charges the final image ("warmed against her thigh, a quiet promise"). The shift from twilight to first stars tracks time and supports the thematic movement from darkness to clarity, and spatial choreography (deck → railing → stepping onto path) remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    The golden dock, snow, fog, and harbor create a cohesive sensory field filtered through Elara's patient perception. The third piling and carved hollow constrain discovery; the fulgurite's "smoky silica" and the acorn's "dark and gleaming" specificity charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (snow muffling sound, fog swallowing outlines). Minor slip: "oceanic hush" and "pale gold light" recur without evolving meaning, and the fog's retreat at closure feels convenient rather than causally tied to Elara's action.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    The garden is vividly rendered with sensory specificity: "frost-kissed leaves crunched like shattered stained glass," "scent of damp soil and decaying roses." Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (bench, willow, pond, oak sapling, sundial, archway). The setting does constrain Elara's method—she must be present in the garden to "project presence"—and the oak sapling directly charges the closure moment when Kael points to it. Meets the 9+ gate requirement that environment charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.1)
    The suspended palace, moon-bloom cradle, and celestial alignment are vivid and purposeful, grounding the ritual in concrete spatial choreography. The feather—warm, humming—functions as micro-setting that charges the final image and enables Kaelen's descent with a tangible anchor. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Kaelen's priorities (starlight-focused lenses, jasmine sweetness). The mechanical world below remains abstract backdrop rather than pressing environment, but at this length the palace itself constrains and charges the closure sufficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.1)
    The obsidian lagoon and black sand are vivid and specific, filtered through Elara's firefighter lens (volcanic glass, kelp, salt-scented calm). The setting provides the materials for the graft and charges the final image (kelp against black sand, red thread gleaming). Spatial choreography is clear: dune grass descent, lagoon shore, water's edge. The micro-setting (shore, sand, water) enables the ritual but does not constrain a choice with pressure—Elara moves through the space unimpeded. Sensory detail is balanced and purposeful, though occasionally elevated ("kelp-drift peace," "cloud-washed air") in ways that tilt toward lyricism over lived-in physicality.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    The city of forgotten fountains is vividly particularized (Serpent's Fountain, Weeping Maiden, mossy Orion's belt) and each location supplies concrete clues that constrain Elara's path. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, anchored in her perception. The basin-to-flowing-water transformation at closure charges the setting and makes the environment indispensable to the ending image. Spatial choreography across multiple fountains remains clear. The micro-setting (each fountain niche) alters tactics by providing the required objects.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.4)
    The nebula garden is vividly rendered with ionized gas blossoms, luminous petals, and sonar-mapped passages. Spatial choreography remains coherent across Elara's transit. The gear appears in multiple beats and constrains her approach (recursive fractals, alignment precision), charging the final image when it hums "like a heartbeat." Sensory detail is selective and atmosphere supports the tone, but the setting does not force a trade-off or alter tactics under pressure—Elara navigates successfully without environmental friction.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    The greenhouse is vivid and purposeful: "skeletal rose bushes," "moss-stained bench," "weathered glass panes" anchor the space with texture. The monarch migration functions as charged setting-as-metaphor, pressuring Elara's insight about collective grief. The woven ribbon roll and the family dinner table appear as micro-settings that enable memory and shape the final design. Spatial choreography is clean, sensory detail (jasmine, damp soil, rosemary chicken) is selective, and the setting participates directly in the closure image (monarchs as "living constellation").

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal obsidian ridge, volcanic gravel, and clock tower are vivid and purposeful; the pendulum bob constrains Elara's task (grit-seized pivot, calibrated force) and the rake handle is tactile ("ash wood smoothed to silk"). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her ethically diligent POV (dust motes, slanted light, cold railing). The body-as-setting test is met: her hands, the chamois, and the pendulum's weight are micro-settings that alter her tactics. The final image—obsidian pools mirroring the tower's shadow—charges the closure. Minor slip: the "gilded ridge" in the penultimate paragraph contradicts the opening "volcanic gravel" and "obsidian" without explanation, a small consistency flaw that does not break the scene but momentarily disorients.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt silo and tapestry are vivid anchors; the sovereign case tools (needle, lens) constrain Elara's method concretely. Sensory detail (scent of rain, burnt umber tension) is selective and purposeful. However, spatial choreography inside the silo remains static—kneeling, focusing, rising—without friction from the environment. The final spiral around Albright's stone charges the ending image modestly.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    The obsidian spire, frozen lake, and drowned pines are vivid and consistent. The quill and lapis-infused water anchor the final image with purposeful specificity (invisible until warmed). The desk, vellum, and spatial choreography remain clear. However, the setting mostly decorates rather than constrains: Elara could perform this interior reckoning anywhere. The lake is gazed upon but does not pressure her choice, so Q3 cannot enter the 9-band despite solid descriptive work.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ember alcove functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (the ember-light reveals "secretly luminous shimmer" in the ink), satisfying the 9+ gate for closure linkage. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—frost-veined window, mist, dial glow, charcoal-gray cloak—but spatial choreography is thin; we never learn room dimensions or adjacencies that might constrain movement. The setting supplies atmosphere and recurs purposefully (ember-light bookends the piece), yet it does not materially narrow Elara's tactical options during the transcription beats. Modern-world realism is plausible for the shortwave mechanics and the depicted ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.4)
    The gallery, rocking chair, and mask are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (worn floorboards, gold lacquer, luminous dust). The chair's diminishing arc provides a live clock that anchors the ritual's progress. However, the setting does not constrain a choice—Elara encounters no spatial limitation or resource scarcity that alters her tactics—and the final scatter is purely symbolic rather than logistically shaped by the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sewer tunnels, sedimentary layers, and Kael's workbench anchor spatial choreography throughout. The chronometer cog—handled twice, first as treasured object (line 63), then returned to the bench (line 244)—constrains the final choice by symbolizing empirical patience. Micro-setting (drip of water, collapsed archive chamber, oilcloth compartment) integrates into action and mirrors the accumulative pressure. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered; the "abrasive calm" modulates with emotional intensity without becoming a postcard tour.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.1)
    The velvet library, autumn light, and frost on windows are vivid and anchor the rehearsal space throughout. The rosette is handled twice (placement, final pocketing) and functions as a spatial anchor and thematic charge at closure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (dust motes, geese, crimson leaves), though the space does not constrain a tactical choice—it serves atmosphere more than action. The final image (moonlight on velvet, rosette warm against skin) charges the ending, lifting the setting into closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rusted greenhouse is vivid and recurs with purpose: "iron skeleton glowing," "groaning door," "shattered panes." Spatial choreography is clean (door, hook, rose cane, cleared earth, sapling). The greenhouse constrains access (he must enter, find tools) and its decay mirrors the thematic ruin-to-renewal arc. However, the celestial beam of "liquid starlight" introduces a convenient visual flourish that does not materially alter his tactics or the seedling's growth; it decorates rather than pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tower's obsidian lens and nectar-dusk refraction directly cause the drone failure, constraining the diagnostic mystery. Lacquer box and matchbox provide tactile anchors across beats. Spatial choreography (window, desk, door, stairs) remains clear. The nectar dusk charges both the inciting imagery and the riddle's answer ("golden tear"), satisfying the micro-setting test for choice constraint and closure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bay, cottage, and streetlights are anchored early with sensory specificity (damp cobblestones, cedar shingles silvered by salt, amber streaks of sunset). The orris root shard functions as micro-setting object that constrains the central choice: Elara must place it with intention to test her theory. The spring twilight setting and the cottage's garden gate provide spatial coherence, and the final image's "streetlights continued their gentle daydream" recharges the opening motif with accumulated meaning. Reaches mid-7s because the object-as-setting constrains the protagonist's method and the environment charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.1)
    The underwater city garden, Heartstone Spire fracture, and bioluminescent kelp are described vividly and recur across beats. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the fracture is a passive conduit rather than a constraint Kael must navigate, and the garden's transformation (coral flushing, fish shifting) is reactive scenery, not a resource or obstacle that alters his tactics. The ampoule's dissolution into the spire is the lone moment where environment and action interlock, earning mid-band placement.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The infinite staircase is vivid and persistent: pearlescent haze, cool worn stone, steps vanishing into light and shadow. Spatial anchors remain stable throughout. The staircase constrains all movement (boundless confinement) and the etched proofs form a recurring micro-setting element. The chipped die, handled across multiple beats, charges the final image ("catching the light / Perfectly imperfect"). The setting functions as both physical constraint and thematic canvas, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment must constrain choice or charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.9)
    The rooftop greenhouse is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (ferns, night-blooming jasmine, saffron quiet, smog-choked city hum) and constrains Elara's ritual to moonlit hours. The moon-tipped brush and saffron pigment function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across the greenhouse, bus stop, and Elara's watching vantage. The setting modulates tone and supports the closure image without becoming a static catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    The grotto city behind the waterfall is vivid and purposeful: mist, moss-slick paths, sun-warmed crevices near the waterfall's edge all constrain the harvest and anchor the climax. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's historical lens (water-smoothed carvings, emerald-tinted view, scent of baking bread). The opera glass functions as both tool and perceptual lens, charging the moment of discovery. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (cavern wall → oven stones → moss-slick paths → baking cavern). The waterfall's dual role as shield and shroud, then protective hymn, demonstrates setting evolution tied to emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse interior, workshop hum, and tidal flat are vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (brine, aged brass, wet granite). The yoyo and lens assembly constrain Elara's choices and the hunger stone's exposure under low tide creates urgency. However, the spatial choreography of the mechanism room and lamp room relationship is slightly vague, and some descriptions ("bruised twilight sky," "ink-black sea") lean generic. The micro-setting (yoyo, lens, stone) successfully charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.7)
    The funhouse is vividly rendered with layered sensory detail (rust, rot, candy apples, metallic tang) and recurring objects (mirrors, clasp glow, teddy bear). Spatial choreography is clear through the hallway sequence. The teddy bear and mirrors constrain the advisor's tactic (choosing the comforting lie), lifting the setting into functional use. Scope fits the single-location window; the glow charges the final image when it "flared" and "winked out."

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating orchard, driftwood circle, and xylophone mallet constrain Leeward's ritual choices and charge the final image when he tucks the mallet away. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through his prophetic attention (cirrus clouds, salt air, wet wood scent). Spatial choreography remains clear across the ritual circuit. The micro-setting (orchard as sanctified stage) functions well at this length, meeting the 9+ quick test's constraint requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    The World-Turtles' shells, coral spires, and tidal rhythms constrain Elara's method—she cross-references rust patterns with shell etchings and subsonic vibrations. The crack itself functions as micro-setting: its geometry and resonance properties directly enable the climactic whistle note. The salt flats' "crunchy crust" grounds the final walk with tactile specificity. Sensory detail is POV-filtered (a cartographer's eye for whorls and spirals) and the gate's transformation from barrier to archway charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ivy-swallowed station is vividly rendered and returns at closure ("gilded the ivy in amber light"), creating a lyric reprise that reweights the space from "haunted" to "peaceful." Spatial choreography is clear (moss-crusted platform, skeletal benches, frozen clock tower, overgrown path). The setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics, keeping it shy of higher bands, but the descriptive specificity and the final image's environmental charge lift it above purely ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    The submerged pavilion, drawbridge, and inkwell are vividly rendered with strong sensory specificity ("chains biting the dawn sky," "scent of iron-gall ink"). The setting pressures Elias's window of access (rising water) and the inkwell functions as both tool and covenant. However, spatial choreography of the repair work itself remains vague—where exactly he pries the cornerstone, how he seals the notes—and the pavilion's architecture beyond "ghostly marble steps" lacks the tactile constraint that would elevate setting from backdrop to active participant in choice.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sunken-city library is vividly rendered with selective detail: coral-veined stone, bioluminescent anemones, mother-of-pearl mosaic, salt and vellum scent. Sensory selection reflects Elara's archival focus (ink chemistry, fiber weave, watermark angles). The vault's spatial choreography remains clear, and the environment supplies the antique stamp, the Charter, and the blackout context. The blackout as constraint is signaled but not pressed—power returning at the end creates no urgency because "she felt no urgency." The setting charges the final image when "the dappled light from the ceiling anemones brightened as if in acknowledgment," but this moment leans symbolic rather than materially constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating island, tea garden, glass basilica, and workshop are established early with vivid sensory detail ("waterfalls cascading into misty voids," "crystalline walls," "silver-leafed blooms"). Spatial choreography is clean across moves: workshop → path → basilica → back to workshop. The gem and paper function as micro-setting elements that constrain action (polishing precision, folding geometry). However, the environment itself doesn't force a choice at closure—the physical world remains backdrop rather than active constraint. The recurring crane-filled windowsill charges the final image but doesn't alter tactics, keeping this shy of 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    The floating observatory, viewport, Earth below, and geode are rendered with vivid, selective detail (scarred fingers, cold steel, amethyst heart, "silent ocean"). The geode's warming and humming charge the closure image and constrain the experiment's success. Spatial choreography is clear (viewport, hatch descent), and the setting's latent energy and dead main systems create purposeful pressure. No occupational depth is required at this length, and the micro-setting (geode as tool/anchor) shapes the final stance, qualifying for the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory's moss-choked archway, weathered carvings, meridian line, and flagstone all supply concrete spatial anchors and the chip's micro-glyphs add specificity. The orrery's brass arms and golden light charge the final image. The setting does not constrain a mid-scene choice—Kael follows the drone's instruction without environmental friction—but the ceremonial space shapes the closure mood, narrowly meeting the 9+ gate criterion of "charges the final image."

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cobalt terrace and forgotten shore are vivid and purposeful, with sensory detail filtered through Elias's guilt (tiles "drank the fading light," moss-slicked steps). The watch hand carving constrains the final choice, grounding the vow in a tactile object whose "splinters biting his palm" charges the closure image. Spatial choreography (terrace → shore → return) is clean and the setting evolution mirrors internal shift. The shore functions as micro-setting that pressures the protagonist's stance, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    The storm-worn parapet, mist, and wind are rendered with vivid sensory detail and directly constrain movement and mood throughout. The waning crescent moon serves as the immutable signal that triggers the release, thus constraining the tactical choice. Spatial choreography (twenty paces, prisoners at center, figures vanishing into mist) remains clear. The antique drawer pull functions as micro-setting/object that charges the final image and constrains Elias's symbolic journey from failure to resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Setting is swiftly anchored (gravel launch, salt/kelp air, surf, Widow's Point cliffs) and the utility poles function as micro-setting that constrains his method until they end, forcing the climactic choice. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (scarred wood, humming wires, mist-shrouded wilderness). The kayak cockpit and compass in the bow charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the journey.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    The underground bioluminescent lake is vividly realized: "fragile strand of light could be snuffed by a careless breath, yet collectively, their glow had endured centuries" establishes the delicately robust ecosystem with sensory and thematic precision. Spatial choreography is clear (municipal archive → stairwell → river tunnel → three-way junction → rockfall → lake shore), and the phosphorescent moss spelling "E.R." constrains his path choice concretely. The lake's light charges the closure image by harmonizing with the baseball's signature and triggering the empathy integration. Minor slips: "dust-choked municipal archive" and "dripping water and the whisper of forgotten histories" trend toward stock underground atmospherics, and the transition from cityscape to subterranean is compressed into a single sentence without embodied descent.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.1)
    The fairy-tale orchard under permanent moonlight is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: moss "velvet-soft," moon-pale petals, oldest apple tree, and the silver mist with "nascent constellations." Sensory selection is strong (cinnamon warmth, void-chill mint, sweet sorrow) and filtered through Elara's priorities (decades of beast-whispering). The setting constrains the ritual spatially (stone altar, oldest tree) and the transformation directly charges the final image (two saplings rooted where Elara knelt). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the environment's tone—gentle, silver vigil—tensions slightly with the high stakes of metamorphosis, though it leans more toward consonance than productive friction.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.9)
    The midnight glade is vividly rendered—mossy floor, luminous fungi, starlight on ancient stones, clouds below—and the "choking beauty" of thin air is embodied through breath as conscious effort. Spatial choreography is clean (stepping from vapor, kneeling at root-formed altar, descending through clouds). The cracked saucer and locket function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image when Elara presses her thumb to the crack, consecrating it. However, the environment does not constrain choice or supply resources that alter tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.1)
    The recycled-ship hull, bioluminescent moss, and memory sanctum are vivid and purposeful. The dimensional lock manifests concretely ("vertical seam of absolute darkness"), and the photographs function as micro-setting that constrains method. Sensory economy is strong: "scent of rain on dry soil," "deck plating felt less certain." The setting charges the final image (golden light spilling forth) and reflects the protagonist's salvaged-hope theme, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment shape a choice or charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.1)
    The black sand beach, active volcano, and celestial alignment are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (obsidian grit, rhythmic rumble, crescent moon drifting toward Venus). The jars of lightning bugs function as a recurring object that charges the final image. However, the environment remains largely atmospheric backdrop; the sand and volcano do not constrain Elara's action—she could release the bugs anywhere. The setting pressures mood but not tactics, keeping this in mid-7s rather than higher.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.1)
    The luminous fort, crystalline walls, and half-painted sundial are vivid and specific. The sundial's gnomon and shadow constrain Kael's choice materially: the angle must be precise for the panel to open. Spatial choreography (courtyard, North Barracks window, Grand Lock) tracks cleanly. However, much description serves atmosphere more than tactical pressure; the fort's "luminous" quality is told repeatedly but doesn't alter a key move beyond the opening blackout setup.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal bluff, frictionless physics, and aurora are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (pebbles drifting on thermal sighs, waves like liquid mercury). Magnetic boots and basalt rocks function as micro-setting that constrains Elara's movement and ritual method. The final beat—stone gritting beneath her palm—charges the closure image and makes the restoration tactile. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the exact position of the eels relative to the restored zone could be sharper. The setting does pressure her choices (needing boots to walk, selecting specific rocks for sequences), meeting the 9+ gate, though the frictionless world remains more atmospheric backdrop than active antagonist in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.8)
    Observatory, storm, and darkroom timer supply vivid sensory anchors (lightning tableaus, cold window, brass tick). The timer returns with reweighted meaning at closure, charging the final image. However, the setting remains more postcard than pressure—Elara's choices are not constrained by altitude, weather, or spatial logistics; the storm softens on cue without altering her tactics. Micro-setting (timer, cabinet, workbench) does more work than the grand locale.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.1)
    The atrium and sundial are vividly rendered with concrete sensory detail (fractured sunlight, mossy threshold, faded ochre paint). The half-painted sundial constrains Elara's method and the needle card functions as a tool that enables her solution, satisfying micro-setting criteria. However, the environment does not evolve or pressure a difficult choice; the breeze is welcomed as "a variable to be integrated" without altering tactics. The quiet brook recurs but remains ambient rather than shaping the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rusted library setting is vivid and purposeful: skeletal ribs, rust-eaten beams, cracked concrete ground the rebuild action. Moonlight through the beam creates "luminous fracture," directly charging the final image and Kael's metaphor. The courtyard earth constrains the seed-planting choice—they must kneel and dig. The coffee tin's false bottom functions as micro-setting, enabling the seed's retrieval. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves from library interior to courtyard.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.7)
    The tidal arbor is vividly rendered (abalone bark, mercury leaves, lavender sky) and the flickering compasses guide Elara's path, but the environment functions more as backdrop than constraint—no wrong turn or spatial friction alters her tactics. The station terminal anchors the frame cleanly. The broken clock is handled across beats (bench, clutched during ascent, placed on the arbor piano) and charges the final image when its hands move, qualifying as micro-setting that participates in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ancient ridge, silver-veined blossoms, and standing stones anchor setting vividly and filter through Elara's role ("usually verifying cloud-whale buoyancy"). The moss-circled stones and the seed's burial site provide spatial coherence. The ridge's bioluminescence response and the rain amplifying the glow tie environment to the closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrains or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rain-washed islet, bonsai grove, and compass are rendered with vivid, POV-filtered detail that supports tone. The compass as micro-setting constrains the ritual and charges the final image when Elias rewraps it with the lace, its lesson "etched into his spirit." Sensory selection remains consistent and atmospheric throughout, and the bonsai metaphor integrates naturally with the character's practice.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    The greenhouse and the dust-patterned leaf function as micro-setting that constrains choice (leaving leaf untouched) and charges the final image; sensory details are selective, vivid, and filtered through the POV’s evolving perception.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    Setting is masterfully integrated and actively pressures choice. The canyon's "cold sandstone" and "profound hush" are not backdrop; the "intricate, branching patterns in morning frost" become the literal method for her retracing and realization. The environment constrains (stone embrace) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("lungs still tasted of smoke," "frost etched across the ledge like a frozen scripture").

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    The winterglass conservatory is vividly specific and functions as both sanctuary and essential tool. Its thermal-sensitive properties directly constrain Elara's method and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test of environment shaping choice and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    The underwater library is not merely vivid backdrop but a constraining environment that dictates decay and silence, then supplies the texts for transformation. The broken lens functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final beacon. Sensory selection (bioluminescent glow, water-stained paper) is filtered through Elias's professional reverence, tightly integrated with action.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is exquisitely woven into action and stakes. The terra-cotta arbor and the bell are not just backdrop but constrain and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Elara’s perception (sun-warmed tiles, amplified quiet). The ridge, the night, the sack—all are tactile and pressure-bearing.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting (twilight viaduct, blooms, moss) is vividly filtered through Elara's POV and constrains choice: the moss-veined railing holds the camera, the stone heart is revealed only there. Objects (camera obscura, Kwan Yin's tear) charge the final image and are essential to the revelation. Sensory details (scent of jasmine, cool aquamarine) are selective and purposeful, integrated into action.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    The living bridge garden is indispensable, functioning as both setting and mechanism. Its hyperbolic geometry directly constrains the ritual's method and charges the final image, making the environment an active agent. Sensory details are lush, selective, and filtered through Elara's expertise, creating a fully immersive and purposeful atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vivid and constrains choice; the abandoned carnival redemption center and piano bench function as micro-settings that charge the final image of revealed vault.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.5)
    Setting is indispensable, charged with meaning, and actively constrains choice (the forge) while mirroring internal state; sensory detail is selective and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    The emerald station and the flower arrangement function as micro-setting that directly constrains choice and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Elara's professional perception ("codes hidden in flower arrangements"). The environment evolves with the light and her action.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Setting is vividly specific (frost-rimed control room, thaw outside) and constrains choice; micro-setting (bookmark, torch) charges the final image where dome refracts light through cracks, meeting the 9+ test for environmental pressure on closure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is essential: the rusted library's decay triggers phobia, its "rust tears" guide the search, and the open roof becomes the escape. Sensory detail is selective and pressure-driven, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail, and the gold leaf booklet charges the final image, but the environment does not strongly constrain choice, keeping it from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.3)
    The frozen courtyard is not backdrop but a pressure chamber and catalyst. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("frost feathers," "sub-audible resonance"), filtered through Unit Seven's calibrated sensors. The ice violin—a micro-setting object—is indispensable, constraining the key choice (to pick it up) and decisively charging the final image of synthesis and dissolution. Environment and object are fully integrated into the causal and thematic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Vivid, purposeful sensory detail; the crystal forecourt and lens function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. The setting is integral to the plot and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vivid and integral, constraining choices (maze shifts) and charging the final image; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, mirroring theme.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.1)

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    The greenhouse is richly, specifically rendered—mud, shattered glass, spiderwebs, moss, roof breach—and these details are filtered through Aris’s scientific and emotional lens. The setting is not backdrop: its damaged, humid, light-struck environment creates the conditions for the dust patterns, decay, and his grief work. Recurring objects (the dusted leaf, broken roof, tarp) charge the final images and shape his choices. This environment could not be swapped out without fundamentally altering the story’s logic and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    The canyon and its frost are vivid, texturally specific, and tightly integrated with both plot and theme: the environment literally offers the “method” through its patterns and figuratively reframes her understanding. Sensory choices (cold sandstone, smoke in lungs, violet-softening night, shimmer and retreat of frost) feel filtered through a glass artist’s eye and priorities. The setting constrains options (she is isolated, in respite from the fire) and strongly charges the final image of her walking home with the canyon’s “lesson” embedded in her future work. This is a standout strength and clearly above typical submit-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    The winterglass conservatory is vividly rendered and functionally central: the thermally sensitive glass is the literal canvas for emotions and thus the stage for the story’s key turns. Details like pale light, mossy stones, and hardy snowdrops enrich atmosphere without feeling touristic. The environment constrains choices (this is the only safe space where Elara’s method works) and charges the final image of clear patches and glowing warmth. A slight tilt toward overt symbolism (“unshaken marvel”) keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underwater library is vividly realized—bioluminescent fungi, coral-crusted shelves, mechanical crab, obsidian door—and tightly married to the mood of drowned memory. Details like water-stained ledgers and ink bleeding into illegibility are not postcard flourishes; they directly set up the need for the lens-shard method. The environment subtly constrains what’s possible (decay, silence, depth, no surface contact) and charges the final image of the glowing archive. It stops just short of 9-band because the physical setting rarely forces specific tactical choices beyond atmosphere and premise.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ridge, sanctions-enforced night, and the terra-cotta arbor are vivid and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with “amplified quiet” and the bell as strong recurring anchors. The arbor and bell are not just scenic; they tangibly constrain choice (ring softly, protect the sanctuary of quiet) and charge the final image. Details like “sun-warmed tiles” and the hidden donation spots give the world texture without turning into a catalog. The setting is tightly integrated with theme and closure, though the broader world of sanctions remains mostly atmospheric rather than operationalized in specific obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    The twilight viaduct, flowers, moss, damp stone, and inverted world within the obscura are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with mood and action. The environment is not mere backdrop: the mossy crevice, carved stone heart, and blooming arches all feature as functional loci of discovery and transformation. The recurring objects (camera, viaduct, Kwan Yin’s tear) charge the final image, where the viaduct becomes “altar—a bridge of healed hearts.” While the setting shapes meaning more than constraining physical options, its specificity and symbolic logic are strong enough to nearly reach the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    The living bridge garden is beautifully realized and integral: mist, dew, willow arches, and the obsidian pond all shape mood and action, not just backdrop. Hyperbolic geometry is embedded in the maze’s physicality, and the nexus of three bridges as the ritual site directly constrains her choice and enables the climax. Sensory detail (velvet moss, cool mist, crystalline streams) is selective and charged, culminating in the final sunlight on bridges and scented air. The world’s rules are sketched economically but consistently; a touch more concrete interaction with the environment during the ritual (risk, difficulty) could have elevated it further.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned carnival prize redemption center is vividly and economically rendered—dust motes, faded tickets, glass-eyed bears—and the space feels specific rather than generic. Crucially, elements of the setting constrain and enable action: the piano bench hides the keys and arrow, the eastern wall houses the vault, and the room’s relation to the bulldozer creates the pressure. The manacle, bench, wall, and vault together function as a micro-setting that shapes tactics and charges the final image. Atmosphere supports theme, with the derelict site of forgotten prizes reframed as a place where genuine hope is redeemed.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse, shipwrecks, aurora, and paradoxically dry ashen forge are all sharply drawn and sensorially rich, filtered through Elara’s synesthetic and memory-haunted gaze. Setting is not mere backdrop: wrecks turning to reefs and the orchard’s lingering “spring’s memory” explicitly charge the final thematic reframing from graves to nurseries. The forge, in particular, functions as a micro-setting that centers the pivotal action and carries paradox into the emotional turn. The only small limitation is that environmental constraints don’t much alter tactics; they mostly reshape meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    The emerald station, ivy, amber sky, and forest path are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s attention to light and detail; the place never feels generic. Setting is not just backdrop: the flower arrangement, the platform vs. forest fork, and the moonlight vs. sunset all constrain what messages are legible and what paths are available. The jar of moonbeams and the floral display operate as charged micro-settings, directly shaping the key interpretive act. The only reason this doesn’t push into the 9-band is that environmental constraint on her choice is more symbolic than materially binding.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned control room is vivid, tactile, and specific—frost-rimed floor, grime-streaked viewport, rusted dials—and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility and craft. Environment and objects (control consoles, viewport light, scrap bin, furnace, annealing oven) are not backdrop: they actively shape mood and enable key actions, culminating in the glass dome over the bookmark transforming the decommissioned console into an altar-like safe zone. The “great thaw” outside mirrors and supports the internal shift without feeling purely decorative. A touch less overt symbolic mirroring would push this into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rusted open-air library under stars is vivid and functional: rust “tears” guide navigation, the hollowed pedestal is a concrete discovery point, and the vent and roof materially shape tactics and escape. The micro-setting details are filtered through Elara’s state (phobia, betrayal, childhood memory) in a way that tightens mood rather than decorating it. The final image on the roof under the “star-dusted sky” meaningfully recharges earlier star and rust motifs. A bit more sensory variety beyond the visual and tactile might have pushed this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ridge fort, sky, storm remnants, and coastal origin all feel palpably textured, and details like meltwater from a gargoyle and the lone star deepen both mood and world. Setting is consistently filtered through Elara’s sensory and professional priorities, especially acoustic ones, which makes the environment feel lived-in rather than touristic. The fort’s centuries of vigils and the weather’s subsiding violence meaningfully mirror her task of mapping silence and charge the final dawn image. While the terrain doesn’t tightly constrain tactical choices, it strongly charges the thematic frame and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.3)
    The frozen courtyard is vividly realized with purposeful detail—frost feathers, dormant oak, ice-locked fountain, and indigo twilight all support a hushed, contemplative tone. The setting evolves meaningfully: the recurring courtyard becomes, by the end, a sanctuary rather than a cage, with the first breeze functioning as a small but potent sign of changed temporal rules. The ice violin operates as a charged environmental object central to the climax and final image. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it does charge the thematic and emotional field in a sustained, specific way.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the rain-softened crystal forecourt, humming quartz spires, and moonlight projection are sensorially rich and tightly integrated with action. The environment doesn’t just decorate; the crystals and light physically enable Elara’s tactic and charge the final image of communal reconciliation. Weather and texture (rain, dew, slick stones) are consistently threaded without bogging the narrative. A slight excess of lyrical description in places keeps this just short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    The garden maze is richly realized—olfactory and visual details, the yew hedge niches, moss bench, and living, shifting paths all feel specific and lived-in. Crucially, the setting constrains and enables action: the maze physically traps Kael and responds to Elara’s marble, and the final resonance flows “from soil to soul,” charging the ending. The marbles function as a micro-setting embedded in the hedge, anchoring both ritual and climax. It falls just short of 9+ because the broader world of measurable luck is gestured at more conceptually than through concrete setting pressure in the environment beyond the maze.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    The canyon ridge, station, magnetic nexus, and twilight conditions are vivid and consistently filtered through Kael’s professional and spiritual attentions. Environment constrains choice: the nexus only shimmers at twilight, the ridge’s cold and thin air shape bodily perception, and the sacred canyon context charges the experiment. The recurring physicality of lever, coils, projectors, and roosting zephyrs culminates in the final shared image of wings mirroring the time lattice. Setting is not mere backdrop; it tangibly underwrites both the experiment’s possibility and the closing communion.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    The flooded opera house and lantern-lit darkness are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through a musician’s eye—submerged grand pianos, the pit as literal and metaphorical threshold. Environment materially shapes events: the water creates the score, the cold and depth constrain his movement, and the lantern’s instability governs when markings appear. The final images (wading to the exit, predawn mist, carrying the damp program) are charged by the setting’s transformation from void to bridge. This is near top-tier scene-setting, only shy of 9+ because the environment, while crucial, doesn’t significantly alter tactical choices beyond its conceptual role.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mountain weather station is sharply realized through tools (anemometers, barometer, logbook) and conditions (thin air, frost, aurora) that are filtered through Elara’s expert eye. The environment is not decorative: the past whiteout, current squall, and instruments define her calling and the nature of her mistake. The final image—palm on cold glass, squall and aurora braided outside—uses setting to charge her new stance and anchor the thematic pivot. Weather and altitude subtly constrain her options and emotional focus, making the setting integral to both conflict and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tunnel and its sensory texture (wet stone, rust, peeling ads, twisted rails) are vivid and consistently filtered through Leo’s exhausted hyper-awareness. The beaded valve wheel functions as a charged micro-setting object that constrains and focuses his choice, and it decisively charges the final image. The environment doesn’t offer much tactical constraint beyond atmosphere, but it is inseparable from the story’s logic and tone. Overall, setting and object integrate tightly with the emotional and thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is a major strength: the overgrown catacomb-library, subterranean river, and obsidian refuge are vividly rendered and integrated into action (the tremor, the burrowing, the erosion at the refuge wall, the sapling’s emergence). Details are strongly filtered through Elara’s attention—moss stitching flagstones, bioluminescent fungi on a fallen atlas, black sand and phosphorescent river—so world-building never feels like a neutral tour. Environment constrains and enables choices (she must relocate to the refuge when the river shifts; her path is literally mapped in the origami swan). The final images of sapling and glowing fungi reweight earlier decay motifs, charging the last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sage Ridge, the Heartwood Oak, the Listening Seat, and the sagebrush smell create a vivid, coherent micro-world that’s strongly filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The environment is not mere backdrop: the oak’s “dreaming roots” and the cradle-like seat concretely stage safety and stillness, and the eclipse-driven light/weather shifts shape the emotional and tonal arc. Recurring images (sage scent, roots, canopy) return at the end to charge the final sense of ongoing wonder “beneath dreaming roots.” A touch of lyric over-insistence (“dreaming roots,” “hush”) edges toward preciousness but doesn’t break clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    The reclaimed silo library is richly rendered (cylindrical space, rusted ladder, bronze light) and conceptually integrated as a former grain silo now “holding the harvest of human spirit.” Setting details are filtered through his archivist’s attention and recur in charged ways—the metal wall he listens to, the fireplace that yields diaries, the bronze light gilding the tapestry at the end. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, it strongly charges the final images and the thematic container/harvest metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Graystone Lighthouse and rocky island are vividly and efficiently rendered—granite teeth, tide’s whisper, lantern room, salt-stained study—and consistently filter through Silas’s perceptions. The environment shapes solitude and ritual (after last orders, dawn ferry, the path from shore to door) and charges the final image of the lighthouse door standing open as a metaphorical harbor. The recurring stone and gulls, tied to that landscape, deepen atmosphere without feeling like generic symbolism. The setting doesn’t heavily constrain tactical choices, but it meaningfully inflects tone and the story’s emotional geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and particular—“chapel woven from solidified silence,” stained glass flickering to a storm-wracked sea—and consistently filtered through the metaphysics of sound and stillness. The dimensional anchor is not just backdrop; its groaning and knitting mirror and raise the stakes of Elara’s internal struggle. Objects like the loop pedal and the palette feel embedded in the environment’s logic rather than pasted on. The world’s rules are sketched through action more than exposition, maintaining both atmosphere and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, and mirrored horizon are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elara’s ritual focus, with details like “the lake’s surface achieved perfect stillness” and the spire’s “upturned hush” doing triple duty. Environment and objects (spire, lake, nautilus shell) are not mere backdrop: dawn stillness is required for the horizon to manifest, the spire amplifies silence, and the shell channels her method, all of which directly shape the climactic vision. The final image of the barn and hawk in the reflected surface powerfully recharges the earlier setting work. At this length, the world feels rich without over-explaining its rules.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glowing, rain-slick viaduct and the surreal labyrinth built from “crystallized laughter” and “chambers of sorrow” are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s emotional state. The viaduct is not mere backdrop; it frames the story’s temporal rule (between drop and ripple) and returns in the ending image as a concretized sign of integration, while the tablet functions as a tool-object setting that literally shapes space. World rules around gravity defiance, runic generation, and suspended time are coherent enough to support the stakes without clunky exposition. A slight overreliance on visual and metaphorical description at the expense of other sensory textures keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cavern, instruments, and seasonal air are vivid and specific, with details like stone walls swallowing echoes and hanging hides doubling as both setting and tools. The environment is not decorative: the audibly muted space and the phonograph/drum apparatus directly shape how sound must be “heard” and thus how the ritual works. The needle and drum also operate as micro-settings/objects that charge the final image when the transformed needle is inset into the drum frame. A slight further tethering of physical constraints to on-page choices could push this to the very top tier, but as is it’s rich and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    The courtyard, dusk light, jasmine, flagstones, and weather station are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through a weather-professional’s eye, giving the piece a strong, atmospheric anchor. The micro-setting is not just decorative: it enables her calm, shelters her clandestine work, and returns at the end as a fortified calm that underscores her stance. Objects like the sundial, anemometer, olive tree, and the evidence vial subtly charge the final mood. The quarantine zone itself is more conceptual than spatial, but within this scene the physical courtyard is richly and purposefully used.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    The greenhouse of extinct flora, UV lamps, and “crystal shadows” is vivid, specific, and tightly interwoven with the memory/illumination motif. Environmental features (ultraviolet light, glass panes, preserved ghosts) directly charge key images: Silvershade patterns, tear-reflections, and the glowing inscription. Details are filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a lantern broker, so the setting feels both atmospheric and thematically integral rather than touristic. The space constrains the ritual frame more than concrete choices, which keeps this just shy of exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    The terra-cotta grotto under starlight is vivid and sensorially rich, with clay, vibration, and etched spiral all integrated into action rather than static backdrop. The environment constrains options (the fissure necessitating the rope) and charges the final image as a sacred site where time’s layers are palpably felt. Details like the “grotto breathed in response” and the clay’s cool grit mirror his internal shift without feeling like mere décor. There is a touch of lyric over-density, but it rarely muddies spatial or atmospheric clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the sunken orchard greenhouse, cracked glass, shipwreck ribs, ash, and sapling create a memorable, coherent world. Environment and objects matter: the dome shapes acoustics, the shipwrecks catch echoes, and the bowl-on-stone becomes the charged final image. Sensory detail (damp soil, charred wood, condensation drips) is consistently filtered through Elara’s acoustic and tactile awareness rather than reading like a catalog. The one limiter is that the setting guides tone and resonance more than it constrains concrete options or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    The amber grotto, fossilized resin walls, twilight shift, and static-charged air create a rich, sensorially specific environment that strongly supports mood. The dusk-to-night “transformation” parallels Kael’s inner shift, and the final image of amber resin holding his memory charges the ending. Setting is consistently filtered through his sensory priorities (static, scent, light) rather than as neutral scenery. It doesn’t heavily constrain tactical options, but it meaningfully infuses the thematic and emotional frame.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Celestial Library garden, sea air, and starfield are vivid and tonally apt, giving the story a strong sense of place. Details like “forgotten poetry volumes on wrought-iron stands” feel particular to Elias’s world. The setting lightly shapes action (Liam’s sentimental choice of address; the ability to linger and write by lantern), though it rarely constrains choice in a hard way. It reads as artful, atmosphere-rich grounding rather than an active pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    The crystalline orchard and starlit crater are vividly rendered with strong, consistent imagery that feels integrated with the mood and stakes. Details like branches of solidified light chiming and obsidian glass “drinking the light” are memorably specific and recur to charge the final scene. The environment frames the ritual and reweights the ending (the orchard’s new chord, the arbor against stone) even if it doesn’t heavily constrain physical choice. Overall, the setting is a major strength, rich without becoming incoherent.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rooftop canal system and Chronos Spire are vivid and specific, with details like frost on a raindrop and tension in a spider’s web deepening atmosphere and supporting the time-suspension conceit. The environment meaningfully enables her tactic—still canals and frozen city allow her to reach the Confluence in a time-bubble—but it rarely constrains or complicates her choices. The infinity pendant as object-setting recurs and charges the final image well. World rules around the giant’s nap and Silent Pause are consistent and well integrated without exposition bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cavern orchard and dripping stalactites are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with specific, sensuous materials (abalone, lapis, river stones, moss, silver leaves) doing thematic and atmospheric work. The environment is not postcard-static: the silence of the halted drip and the eventual single droplet actively charge and complete the final image. World rules for the magic are inferred through interaction with the setting rather than explained. This narrowly misses 9+ because the setting, while beautifully integrated, guides perception and meaning more than it constrains concrete options or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    The library is richly and specifically evoked—“sapphire hush,” dust motes, stained glass, crawl space, pipe chases—and consistently filtered through Elara’s lived familiarity. Environmental details aren’t postcard-only: the crawl space, false panel, and sunbeam at 6:18 all dictate where she can move and how she executes her plan, and the final image of dawn-lit dust motes charges the reconfiguration of the space from fortress to sanctuary. The citywide outage and flickering lights also modulate atmosphere and subtly echo the emotional “illumination.” A slight excess of descriptive flourish in places keeps this just shy of truly transcendent.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    The nursery, storm-soaked valley, and particularly the mossy trellis are vivid and sensorially rich, with rain, soil, moss, and light working through Elara’s perceptions. The environment doesn’t just decorate; it reframes her thinking (moss as collaboration, storm gaps allowing violets and ferns) and literally grounds the final image of her hand on the trellis. Specific botanical details (linden, willow, hostas, clover) feel chosen rather than generic. The setting constrains choice mostly thematically rather than through hard physical limits, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal island is richly and precisely rendered—mudflats, shipwrecks, radio towers, samphire, wild roses—and always filtered through Elias’s sensibility. Setting is not merely decorative: the storm and shifting tides expose the ravine and foundations that host the convergence, and the island’s isolation underpins his long vigil. Objects-as-setting (amber brooch, heartstone) are tightly integrated and directly charge the final image. If anything, a few descriptive flourishes approach the ornamental, but they rarely stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, tactile, and integrated: the musical crystals, amethyst spires, and twin-moon shadows all shape both mood and mechanics of the magic. The cave is not just decorative—it provides the necessary lattice for overlapping shadows and becomes a “permanent amplifier” of the story’s central magic at the end, charging the final image. Sensory detail is lush and consistent with Elara’s reverent perspective. At times the density of description edges toward ornamental, but it rarely stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: “ivory-quarried stones,” “pearl-gray sky,” the restored Harbor Archive, and the central pier all feel tactile and lived-in. Environmental detail is consistently filtered through Elara’s priorities as archivist and exile, and the recurring ivory stones at the end subtly charge the closure image. The trumpet as a tool/micro-setting also structures key actions (cleaning, playing, displaying). While the harbor’s physical layout doesn’t heavily constrain tactics, the place’s history as a site of exile and return deeply conditions the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Grand Meridian Station and the “starlit vault in mist” are rendered with rich, selective detail—wet stone, ozone, ghostly train echoes, ivy-choked booth—that strongly support atmosphere and theme. The setting is firmly anchored and filtered through Elara’s sensibility, and the vault’s starlight participates in the final image via the punched aperture. However, the environment rarely constrains or redirects her options; it functions more as an evocative stage than an active pressure source. The specificity and mood are publication-level, but the world could shape tactics more directly to push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stargazer’s open tower, the meridian line, sea, and whales create a vivid, coherent world that feels both tactile and numinous. Setting is always filtered through Elara’s priorities and profession, and the environment meaningfully constrains events (tile on the meridian, whales visible below, dawn shifting the atmosphere). The recurring sea/sky/tower triad strongly charges the final image of sanctuary and shared journey. It stops just short of 9+ because the environment nudges choices more than it overtly forces a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prismatic geode, bioluminescent fungi, and auroral solar storm are vividly rendered and feel specific to this story’s cosmology. Setting is integrated with plot: the mountain and storm enable the magnetic activation, and the crystals’ changed luminescence at the end visually register the internal shift. The library of solidified light and memory is striking, though it skews more conceptual than tactile. Environment rarely constrains choices, but it does charge and re-charge the images that bookend the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    The funeral home prep room is vividly realized through sound, light, material, and smell, and it’s inseparable from Elara’s emotional state. Details like “hum of refrigeration,” “stainless steel and porcelain,” and “scent of aged oak and iron-rich ink” feel filtered through her profession and grief. The setting constrains her choices (alone with the body, at night, dealing with tools of her trade) and charges the final threshold image. The ink pot functions as a micro-setting object whose presence clearly shapes process and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vividly and consistently rendered: bonsai labyrinth, mountaintop dawn, the stone workshop, the humming fluorescent lamp, and gold-leafed branches all feel tactile and lived-in. Details are strongly filtered through Elara’s sensibility—trees as “universes,” silence as “canvas”—which reinforces both atmosphere and theme. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices but absolutely charges the final images (the gilded bonsai forest and the mountain holding its breath). Economy is good for a lyric piece; nearly every environmental detail also carries conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    The port and container labyrinth are vividly, consistently rendered and filtered through the narrator’s sensibility (“industrial groan of cranes was not noise but punctuation”). Setting is not just backdrop: the tides reveal fragments, the maze offers shelter, and the fog/foghorn charge the final movement. Details are selective and purposeful, avoiding tourist catalogues while keeping sensory richness across sound, smell, and texture. The environment doesn’t quite force discrete tactical choices, but it deeply informs his vocation and the story’s last image.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the cliffside observatory, wind, sea, and dust all echo the themes of isolation, exposure, and time’s erosion. The half-finished cello and painted shell function as micro-settings/objects that charge the final image, especially when she leaves the shell as an “anchor for the wind and stars.” Details are well filtered through her emotional state rather than feeling like a tourist catalog. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain her choices tactically, which holds this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    The raft-city carnival is vividly, specifically realized, with sensory and cultural detail that feels lived-in rather than touristic (“rope bridges strung between candy-striped tents,” “oral history archives beneath the baker’s raft”). The environment meaningfully shapes tactics: the ubiquity of graffiti and layered paint makes the encoding strategy plausible and organic, and the foundation stone chip functions as a micro-setting object charging the final image. World rules—corporate takeover, privatization, guild culture—are consistent and delivered largely through action and viewpoint rather than raw exposition. A slight excess of descriptive density in the opening edges toward luxuriant, but it still serves a clear atmospheric and thematic purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is richly particular—the Meteor Crater, frozen gravel, crescent moon, pre-dawn chill, and later the implied bulldozers—and all of it is filtered through a field geologist’s eye. Environment meaningfully constrains tactics: the cold, darkness, and rim position require a chemical timing solution and a long, uncomfortable vigil. The crater and the small objects (camera rig, hourglass sand) converge in the final image, where billion-year-old rock layers blaze under “impossible gold,” charging the thematic clash of deep time versus industrial extraction. Description occasionally edges toward luxuriant, but always in service of atmosphere and theme rather than postcard cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mist-coated rail depot, cedar-and-oil repair shop, and central water feature are vividly evoked with strong sensory specificity, and the environment is filtered convincingly through Elara’s non-visual perception. Crucially, the basin and refracted light are not just decoration but functional tools that constrain and enable her actions, then charge the final image when she trails her fingers through the water again. The tone and atmosphere are cohesive, with weather, industrial sound, and water all reinforcing the contemplative, liminal mood. A slight excess of descriptive language edges toward ornament in places but does not break clarity or function.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rusted outpost and frozen lake are richly rendered and tightly integrated into action: the condensation on the grimy window is literally the method of discovery, the ice below is the site of the convergence, the dawn shadow will mark where to drill. Environmental details (frost-rimed planks, peat stove, wind through beams, stars over the lake) are filtered through Elara’s focused, cartographic mindset and steadily echo the theme of convergence and stillness. The setting constrains options (she must wait for dawn, drill through ice here, in this skeletal station), and the final image of stars over the frozen lake is thematically charged. It’s atmospheric, specific, and meaningfully bound to the story’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific—archway, cobblestones, apothecary, forge, dry well—rendered through a consistent sensory palette that supports the “wild hush” tone. Environment and objects are not mere backdrop: the archway focuses the ritual, the cobblestones transmit rhythm, and the town’s spaces respond (shutters opening, water rising, ember flaring). World-rules are clear in their own poetic logic and stay consistent. Setting strongly charges the final image of the town as a serene sanctuary with an internal heartbeat, though occasionally description edges toward luxuriant rather than lean.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    The forgotten underwater temple is richly realized—“colossal archway veiled in ancient coral,” bioluminescent fungi, obsidian dais—and the setting’s pressure (depth, silence, isolation) meaningfully shapes options and tone. The environment constrains him (no escape, dwindling oxygen) and the hush becomes a functional tool for his meditative tactic. Details feel purposeful rather than touristic, though occasionally the descriptive layering edges toward excess. The final image of his body and the vial in the temple’s deepened silence effectively charges the space as a character in its own right.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.3)
    The lighthouse prison on Serpent’s Reef, the copperlight, the iron stairs, and the narrow, scuffed door create a vivid, coherent micro-world that feels specific and atmospheric. Setting is strongly filtered through mood—“bruised horizon,” “jagged teeth of Serpent’s Reef,” the hovering moth—and supports the themes of isolation, witness, and impossible concealment. The environment constrains events more symbolically than tactically; the reef/prison could shape choices more concretely. Still, the door, scuffs, and beam become charged objects that materially participate in the action and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.3)
    The greenhouse, Heartwood, venom-thorn vines, and winter-cracked fields are vivid and specific, with sensory details tightly woven into action (“silver blossoms unfurled with a soft chime”). The environment materially shapes stakes and outcome: the alchemical orchard is the only cure, and the bead-root-Heartwood configuration charges the final image. At times the description edges toward density for its own sake, but it rarely stalls momentum. Overall, the setting is a major strength and feels integral rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    The red canyon labyrinth, tide pools, basin, and orchids are richly evoked and tightly interwoven with action and theme. Setting details are not decorative: stone fissures guide stitches, the collapsed arch and dust-filled basin define the site of ruin, and the canyon orchid literally anchors the final knot, charging the closure image. Sensory work (scent of ghost orchid, dust on cheeks, humming stone) is selective and immersive, consistently filtered through Elara’s reverent attention. The only thing keeping this just shy of elite is that physical constraints of the space rarely limit options in a pressured way; the setting is profoundly atmospheric but only modestly antagonistic.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly realized—roots “cradling bones,” apple blossoms, moss, constellations on the sundial—and consistently filtered through Elara’s perception. Setting is not decorative: the sundial’s placement, the alignment of light, and the intertwining of wood and bone all directly shape her choices and the final image of being “woven into the orchard’s eternal breath.” The environment functions as both constraint (she must work with this soil, this light, this base) and thematic engine. A hairline limitation is that the broader world beyond orchard/city remains abstract, but for this length the focus is appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is rich and purposeful: the golden arcade, nano-forged arches, brass mailbox, chalk, and holographic koi are not just décor but carriers of tone and theme. Crucially, the environment intervenes in the decision—the chalk codes on the floor literally change the pseudonym choice—and the brass mailbox anchors the climax. The recurring objects (ebony clipboard, chalk, dawn light) clearly charge the final images, particularly the chalk dust on her shoes. There is slight risk of over-ornamentation, but the world’s rules and textures remain coherent and integrated with action.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cobalt observatory, autumn ridge, and celestial machinery are vividly rendered and filtered through Elara’s vocation, giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine. The eternal candle functions as both setting object and tool, directly constraining her method of discovery and charging the final image when it dips in farewell. While the broader observatory and season are more textural than constraining, they consistently support tone and concept rather than feeling like postcard description. Spatial and temporal anchors (night into dawn under the dome) remain clear and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mangrove labyrinth, blackwater channels, spirits’ harmonies, and stilted hut all create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that supports the story’s liminal, grief-haunted mood. Setting is filtered through Kael’s emotional state, from entrapment to sanctuary, and this shift mirrors his internal arc. The gargoyle shard as a micro-setting object meaningfully charges the closing image. Environment and object both serve as more than backdrop; they shape how the healing is visualized.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mist-clad atrium at twilight, glass ceiling, and brain coral create a rich, coherent atmosphere with strong sensory presence. Details are filtered through Anahera’s perspective (Pacific shores vs. sterile hospital), and the environment subtly mirrors the emotional shift as the atrium becomes “sanctuary.” The brain coral in particular acts as a micro-setting/object that charges the final image when placed beside the cast. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, it does effectively charge mood and theme at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ruined orchard district and the “centuries of thick, pearlescent fog” are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Crucially, the fog isn’t just mood; it functions as “exposed film,” enabling the magic and charging the final image of a bridge through mist. The courtyard, wall, and stone-sparrow archway all matter to how she finds and uses the space rather than feeling like set dressing. A slight tendency toward decorative flourish keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Sound Wave Garden is vivid, original, and tightly integrated: chimes painting ripples, humming trees, and resonant stones all feel coherent with the central sound-magic. Setting is not postcard-only—it literally enables the inciting event (droplet, dewdrop reflection, acoustic prism effect) and shapes the final harmony image. Details are filtered through Elara’s professional attention to texture and pigment, giving the environment a strong POV bias. The coin’s niche and orientation to dawn light at the end shows the environment and object jointly charging the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse and city gardens are richly specific (“scent of nightshade and pinned morpho butterflies”) and consistently filtered through Aris’s scholarly, subversive lens. Environment and objects are not postcard decor: plants, soil, roots, and insect patterns literally constitute the communication system and the warp, and the final image depends on the buried gourd seed and glass ceiling showing a single star. World rules around surveillance, thought tax, and botanical ciphers feel coherent at this length. A slight tendency toward luxuriant description edges toward, but does not cross into, indulgence.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    The gargantuan shell, its pearlescent nacre, the off-key wind, and the dunes form a highly specific, atmospheric micro-world that feels lived-in and consequential. The environment doesn’t just decorate; it constrains options (self-exile in the shell) and directly shapes the climax as the shell becomes a luminous archive of his sorrow. The recurring postcard and galaxy patterns further charge the final image, integrating object and setting.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, original, and consistently integrated: the opal library, clouds, glass orchids, and master lens are all sensorially specific and functional. Environmental features constrain tactics—the sunbeam through the oculus and master lens is the only way to awaken the song, and the cracked tube plus orchids form a coherent ritual apparatus. The “museum of extinct feelings” and floating isolation meaningfully color the emotional stakes and final image. Description occasionally borders on lush for its own sake, but most details are purposeful and filtered through Elara’s caretaking priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)
    The extinct language archive, lamplight, dust motes, and Codex are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s expert gaze. The glass ink well functions as an object-as-setting, constraining method (truth-glow) and charging the final image when it warms under both their hands. Environmental details (pre-dawn window, stone ledge, sunbeam) meaningfully frame the before/after of their relationship. A slight bias toward visual imagery over other senses keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    The crumbling amphitheater inside a breathing volcano is vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the stakes: every choice Kael makes is in response to heat, stone, and the mountain’s “breath.” Environmental specifics (caldera light, stone tiers, carved reliefs, flex points) guide the engineering solution and charge the final image. The surveyor’s chain functions as a micro-setting object that constrains action and then becomes a symbolic bridge when left behind. Description is occasionally lush, but it remains purposeful and filtered through Kael’s professional eye.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.1)
    The attic setting—skylight, dust motes, ledgers, and the physicality of the bookshop—is vivid, economical, and always filtered through Elias’s obsessions. Environment and objects (dust patterns, meteorite, ledger) actively shape his tactics and realizations, culminating in the final image of chip-on-ledger under swirling dust. The attic’s atmosphere explicitly embodies the blooming/withering theme and reconfigures from “tomb of reinvention” to “sanctuary of testimony.” This micro-setting-as-crucible is integral to both the conflict and closure, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    The drifting prism terrace, fractured light, and the salvaged bench form a vivid, coherent environment that mirrors and deepens Elara’s internal state. The prism light actively interacts with objects (the logbook, the grain spiral), charging key realizations and the threshold imagery. Setting is filtered consistently through Elara’s sensibility rather than as generic spectacle. While it doesn’t enforce physical constraints, it clearly charges the final image of her at the terrace’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    The underwater facility and drowned city are vividly specific—bioluminescent anemones on consoles, kelp-choked corridors, the dome breaching the surface—and consistently filtered through her sensibility as a “landscape astrologer.” Environment constrains action meaningfully: the isolation of the deep, the narrow crack, and the dome’s access to air and horizon all shape what she can do and what she discovers. The setting mirrors and pressures her emotional state without feeling like mere allegory (a tomb becoming a threshold). It is rich but not over-explained, and every key environmental detail returns in the final movement.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    The iridescent geode cave, crystal facets holding memories, and Mnemosyne Finch ecology are concrete, sensory, and tightly bound to the story’s mechanics. Setting is not postcard-decorative; the cave’s behavior and tools (seeds, paths, glass) literally define what choices are possible and what “completion” means. The sea-foam shoreline work broadens the world and thematically echoes the cave without muddying orientation. At times the description leans lush, but it remains purposeful rather than indulgent.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tidal arcade under a star-dusted sky is vividly rendered and tightly integrated: the tide, the seventh arch, and Vega’s reflection are not just pretty but functional, directly shaping Corbin’s tactics and enabling the centerpiece moment. Weather, stone, moss, and sea all feel tactile and lived-in, and the environment’s predictability versus the sea’s wildness mirrors the story’s thematic tensions. The setting actively constrains choice (timing with peak tide, specific arch, seaward orientation) and charges the climactic image of light on the bishop’s mitre. This is a case where object-as-setting and macro-environment genuinely co-drive the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    The twilight garden and celestial canopy are richly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility (dew on spiderwebs, Lyra’s gaps, mossy threshold). Setting is not just backdrop: stars and garden architecture directly enable the ritual (observing gaps, archway for departure) and charge the final images. World rules around the nostalgia ban and the amphitheater relic are concise yet evocative, avoiding clunky exposition. A slight overabundance of lush descriptors edges toward ornamental in places, but spatial and atmospheric clarity remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pearl Bay, the mist, the prism atrium, and the pond are vividly rendered and tightly interwoven with Elara’s perception and vocation. The environment directly shapes the core images—the prism atrium refracting dawn, the rings in the pond, the salt-fogged windows she’ll mend. Weather and light meaningfully affect both the ritual and the thematic turn, especially when “mist clinging to the prism atrium ignited into a cascade of tangible rainbows.” At times the descriptive density verges on lushness-for-its-own-sake but generally remains purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ridge, moonlight, and celestial dance are vividly rendered and consistently threaded through (“moon’s silver arc,” “breeze stirred the pines,” the valley below). Setting and weather mirror his inner state—the “hard softness of the night” and stone/mood pairing are effective, if overt. The environment mostly supports atmosphere rather than constraining choices, but the final image of fractures “gleaming like starlight” shows strong object-as-micro-setting integration. Overall, specificity and tonal alignment are high even if tactical pressure from environment is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tide-polished grotto, shells, sea glass, and tide itself are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with Elara’s practice and the final image. The environment isn’t just postcard description; it supplies the tools for her equations and literalizes the “serene upheaval” thesis through erosion and polishing. The recurring tide and grotto frame the ritual as both constrained (she comes at low tide) and continuous (she leaves the pattern to be transformed). This level of specificity and thematic echo strongly charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ivy-veiled passage, softened stone, fireplace, ash, and green-draped quiet are vividly rendered and tightly fused with the premise of walls dreaming. Environmental details consistently echo the emotional stakes (climate-shifted world vs. sunlit garden on film) and the recurring objects (stone, ivy, film) charge the final image. The setting feels specific and atmospheric rather than generic, though it shapes tone and theme more than concrete tactical choices. Overall, the world is richly textured and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the “echoing terrace,” “prism parapet after rain,” and bells from the valley shape both the magic (light refraction) and the temporal pressure. Environmental details—wet stone, crystal facets, echoing bells—aren’t mere backdrop; they charge the ritual and the final benediction image. The spring setting and post-rain gleam dovetail with the theme of renewal without feeling like flat symbol. The terrace, mirrors, and prism clearly constrain what’s possible here, especially in how light convergence dictates his position and method.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ancient terrace, midsummer heat, and twin moons create a vivid, lived-in environment that is more than backdrop. The setting’s ritual and ancestral significance directly shape the choice to sign *here* and *now*, and the lunar alignment functions as a clock. The ebony clipboard and altar stone act as micro-setting objects charged with history, culminating in the final offering image. Description is selective and purposeful, with atmosphere reinforcing theme rather than stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    The salt flat and the cracked riverbed are vivid and specific, with the fissures functioning as both literal geography and a “map” that dictates where he must go. Environment shapes his pilgrimage (following the primary fissure, kneeling at the star-convergence) and charges the final image of the exposed egg in its “cradle of cracks.” Weather (the thunder-lull, faint breeze) modulates atmosphere and participates in the closing echo. Setting is inseparable from character, theme, and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    The silver courtyard, mercury-hued stone, snow, and prism sanctuary create a striking, coherent atmosphere that’s tightly tied to the action (time freezing, the chime, the prism’s dim watchfulness at the end). Setting is consistently filtered through the ritual’s demands and Elara’s perception; details like snow ceasing and resuming mirror the liminal timeframe and closure. The world’s rules (threads of time, the sanctuary’s response) are revealed through use rather than exposition. Environment and object (the prism) clearly charge the final image, though the snow/courtyard constrain mood more than concrete tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    The decommissioned radar dome is vivid and thematically charged: “meteor hush,” “steel ribs,” and its prior function as a listening device are all used to mirror and shape Elias’s realization about ethical listening. The environment isn’t just backdrop; it redefines his serenity as “the dome’s original purpose made manifest” and directly informs his new ethic. The campfire-bar contrast leverages setting to reweight the final plan—turning The Rusty Nail into “a sanctuary of witnessed truth” grows organically from the dome’s metaphoric pressure. This integration of place, theme, and choice is sophisticated and hard to swap out without breaking the story’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    The verdant grotto above the clouds is vividly rendered—moss, cloud-grass, starlight blossoms—and consistently filtered through Elara’s attentive, reverent gaze. Setting details are not just decorative: the moss cradles the resting monarch, the cloud-grass becomes her building material, and the spires give the butterfly a literal path to climb and signal from. Atmosphere (blushing stillness, rose-gold twilight) strongly supports theme and tone, though the environment rarely constrains her options in a way that would push this into the very highest band. Overall, the place feels singular, inhabitable, and thematically keyed to impermanence and elevation.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    The icebound sanctum and aurora are vividly realized and recur meaningfully: the aurora powers the ritual and later “paints her path,” while the ice walls literally house the voices. Objects like the ceremonial rope, punched card scrap, and ice-carved arch function as concrete, lived-in tools rather than decorative props. Weather and environment participate in the outcome—the aurora’s beam “unlocking the ice’s crystalline matrix” is a central mechanic, not just scenery. The only ceiling here is that the environment constrains mood and symbolism more than it complicates physical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rewilded forest, vine-draped bunker, and storm are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through Elara’s perception. Environment actively shapes stakes (window risk, humidity threatening the seal) and charges the final image of her walking a glowing, muddy path in the clearing storm. Physical textures—ivy, roots, grit, rain—play off the ethereal elements to sustain atmosphere. Setting is not mere backdrop; it frames and constrains her choices in meaningful ways.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    The reimagined Babylonian palace, ziggurat observatory, mudbrick and glazed-brick imagery, lamp oil, and night sky are vivid and sensorial, strongly filtering through an astronomer’s priorities. Setting details are integrated into action—his lamp, table, and tile work as lived tools rather than postcard description—and the observatory’s open night air directly frames the covenant moment. While the palace’s “between regimes” status is more thematic than constraining of choice, the micro-setting of observatory/table/tile meaningfully charges the final image (extinguishing the lamp for “truer starlight”). Overall, atmosphere is rich and coherent without derailing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    The soundless sanctuary, with its “pearlescent walls” and consumed sound, is vividly rendered and meaningfully shapes the mode of interaction (thought-communication, heightened inwardness). The surrounding shifting reality (“a library dissolving into a murmuration of starlings,” “a river of liquid light flowing upward”) creates an evocative, specific atmosphere that contrasts with the sanctuary’s stillness. The music box functions as a micro-setting/tool that charges the final image and constrains the possible actions (no music, only touch and memory). Setting details consistently support the emotional and thematic stakes rather than feeling ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ruined orchard and centuries-thick fog are richly realized and tightly interwoven with action—her breathing synchronizes with the environment, the fog luminesces and parts, frost marks the liminal hour, and the budding pear tree charges the final image. Details feel selectively filtered through Elara’s craft-focused perception (glass, light, reflections) rather than like a tourist catalog. The setting meaningfully shapes the method and closure rather than serving as mere backdrop. Only occasional description density keeps this from pushing into the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cathedral-orchard setting is vivid, original, and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with concrete tactile details (moss, blossoms, cherry branches) woven into action. Environment directly shapes tactics—the cherry branches become structural supports, and the ruined sacred architecture frames the thematic bridge between roots and growth. The final image of the ribbon in the cathedral’s “new heart” pays off the setting as more than a backdrop. Occasionally the description verges on lush for the emotional temperature, but it rarely stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    The astral orchard on asteroid 734 is vivid, specific, and integrated into action: artificial light, regolith crunch, low gravity droplets, and silver blossoms all feel lived-in rather than touristic. Environmental constraints (needing to suit up, vacuum outside, the habitat viewport) shape how she can interact with the orchard and cameo. The setting’s rules—nonlinear inheritance via blossoms as memory—remain consistent and culminate in the final communion under the oldest tree. While superbly realized, there is still some headroom for the environment to more aggressively constrain or endanger tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mountain-spanning bookstore is vivid, with moonpetals, sentient shelves, and the Threshold Warden all emerging organically from the environment rather than as bolt-on fantasy trappings. Setting consistently constrains and enables choices: moonpetals as a navigational logic, stone blooming into stairs only after the right truth-offering, the mountain’s “sentient pathways” as a system she must renegotiate. The final image of corridors and empty shelves as notes in a “melody of redemption” recharges the environment thematically. Description is lush but mostly purposeful, filtered through Elara’s linguistic/botanical sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned carnival ship in fog is vivid, particular, and tonally integrated, with details like the headless mannequin, frozen Ferris wheel, and skeletal carousel doing real atmospheric work. The environment meaningfully shapes the story’s logic—“trapped freedom” is embodied in the drifting-yet-imprisoned vessel and in Lyra’s choice to remain aboard. The recurring ship and water imagery also charge the final act of dropping the card into the bay. A touch more direct constraint from the physical layout (e.g., navigation limits) could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    The clock tower mechanism room is vividly rendered—stone steps, brass gears, oil, dust, timber—and consistently filtered through Elara’s professional eye, avoiding generic “cathedral of time” tropes by tying directly into her work and the ritual rope. The environment meaningfully shapes the resolution: the impossible door appears where blueprints say granite, the ceremonial rope is stored here, and the clock’s halt and restart bookend the decisive act, charging the final image. The rope in particular functions as an object-as-setting that constrains tactics. Description is dense but purposeful, rarely feeling ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.3)
    The harmonic caves and Glacial Heart are vividly evoked, and details (ripple-marks, resonant ice memory, shrieking light) are tightly woven into action rather than feeling like backdrop. The environment directly shapes tactics: he must go into the preserved ice-memory and use its fracture patterns as a map, and the final image of glowing ripple marks in ice charges the ending. Occasionally the description trends toward decorative lyricism rather than pressure, but the world feels specific and lived-in. Overall, setting is a strong asset.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.0)
    The glass humming pavilion, etched walls, prisms, and the post-collapse landscape are vividly realized and tightly integrated into action rather than sitting as décor. The hum versus the imposed silence of the shard of hush gives the environment agency in the drama, and the architecture literally channels starlight into the decisive act. The final image of scattered human lanterns answering the rekindled beacon recharges the earlier desolation into a charged, legible before/after. Setting is not just lushly described; it constrains and enables Elara’s choices and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is strikingly vivid and integral: the stormlit observatory, solid fog, lightning, and monuments all shape what Elara can perceive and conclude. Environmental detail is strongly POV-filtered (ozone scent, granite chill, crystalline expanse) and the world’s rules feel consistent without over-explained lore. Crucially, the environment constrains and charges the closure—the fog’s transformation from barrier to luminous forecourt-equivalent is the story’s final reconfiguration. Description density is high but purposeful, with setting and mood deeply intertwined.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    The blooming fortress, starless night, and jasmine-soaked air are sensorially rich and tightly integrated with Elara’s perceptions and task. Setting actively shapes tactics—the starless dark and specific courtyard mosaic are required for the message to appear. The fortress and its flowers mirror and reconfigure theme at the end, becoming “a cradle of resilient beauty,” which charges the closure image. Description occasionally edges toward lushness, but it remains purposeful and character-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    The grotto, tidal pool, crab, anemone, and exposed stone are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a chronicler; they’re not backdrop but the primary lens through which she interprets the conflict. The micro-setting (tidal pool under stars) directly feeds the metaphoric framework that enables reconciliation and charges the final image of the pool refilling as their conversation restarts. The jade cicada functions as a micro-setting object as well, anchoring her body in the space and reappearing at closure. The only limit is that the environment constrains mood and understanding more than concrete options.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    The xenial trellis above a cloud sea, gravity inversion, and silverwood seed create a coherent, sensorially rich environment that feels both strange and lived-in. Setting details (trellis groaning but holding, cloud ocean surging upward, roots and shoots growing in opposite directions) dynamically respond to the central event rather than sitting as backdrop. The micro-setting of the sprout and doll at the end charges the final image and silently encodes her new stance. Description is lush but still purposeful, avoiding white-room or postcard syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    The drifting prism terrace, liquid-light channel, crystalline spires, and storm glass together create a vivid, original environment that feels tactile and lived-in. Setting is not mere backdrop: refracted light and sound (“prisms kissing,” lark song amplified then fading) mirror the story’s exploration of silence as full rather than empty. The terrace as “sanctuary” and the storm glass’s final clarity explicitly charge the closing image. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, it deeply conditions perception and tone in a way integral to the piece’s effect.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is richly realized and central: the waterfall functions as a temporal and spatial gate, and the orchard and Heartstone Monolith are not postcard backdrops but the mechanism of action. Details like nano-forge ruins under silver-barked trees and “geothermal taps” humming with resurrected nightingales embody the futuristic nostalgia and Elara’s dual inheritance of tech and myth. Environment constrains choices—she must pass the waterfall before it crystallizes, work at the monolith, and speak to awaken the orchard—and the final image of the orchard as a “living library” meaningfully reweights all prior description. Occasional density skirts excess, but clarity and function are preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ashen sanctuary under starlight is vividly and consistently rendered; ash, charcoal walls, and trembling shadows are integrated into action rather than feeling like a backdrop. The threshold and door are spatially legible and directly shape the central choice, and the final image of sanctuary and starlight “breathing with her” reweights the space. At times, description edges toward density for its own sake, with layered metaphors that don’t always add new pressure. Still, the environment clearly constrains options and charges the ending rather than functioning as mere atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vivid and specific, with the pulsing fungal caps and Heartroot giving a strong atmospheric and visual identity. Setting is filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a survivor seeking sanctuary, which keeps it from reading like a mere tour. The environment does matter—the farm is the only place where Convergence and the Heartroot ritual are possible, and the final burial under a sapling uses the micro-setting meaningfully. It doesn’t quite constrain her options tactically, but it strongly charges the imagery and tone, especially at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sepia reading room is richly and consistently realized—beeswax, Persian rug, sagging shelves, celestial maps—and these specifics are filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Setting isn’t just decorative: the dust bands, shelves, and gramophone physically enable the discovery of the hidden panel and charge the final image as the “mausoleum” becomes a “cradle.” The environment shapes tactics (decoding dust as fossilized standing waves) and charges the closing action (extinguishing the lamp, stepping into the hallway). A slight overabundance of similar tonal descriptors (“sepia,” “golden shadows”) is the only thing keeping this shy of the 9+ tier.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is lush, specific, and integral: the alchemical night, dream-fruit, sorrowwood, mercury fountain, and obsidian pedestal all feel of-a-piece and filter through Kael’s sensibility. Spatial movement through the orchard—the patterned steps at specific landmarks—means the environment actively shapes tactics and not just mood. The final shift from endless night to star-dusted twilight charges the ending image and reweights the entire scene. At times the density of description flirts with overrichness, but clarity and coherence are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    The foster care file room is vividly realized—the “dying fluorescent tube,” “metal shelves,” and dust patterns are concrete and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The environment functions as more than backdrop, especially via the dust as a quasi-tool for revelation and the room’s final transformation in her understanding from “institutional coldness” to “sanctuary of whispered resilience.” Sensory balance leans visual and conceptual but remains purposeful. The setting could constrain her choices more directly, but it admirably charges the premise and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    The auric lagoon, hoofprint puddle, ironwood grove, and hidden phone booth create a vivid, coherent world whose rules are learned through use (reflection map, mineral amplification). Setting is not postcard-only: the lagoon’s properties are tactically essential for the broadcast and charge the final golden-water image. Sensory specificity is strong, especially in light and texture, though non-visual senses are lighter and the lyricism occasionally drifts toward decorative rather than constraint-driven description. Overall, the environment deeply supports both plot and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vividly realized and tightly integrated: fogged valley, moss curtain, bioluminescent grotto, and the prism atrium all shape mood and ritual mechanics. Environmental details are filtered through Elias’s ritual mindset, and the grotto’s crystals actively respond to his playing, then unify at closure, charging the final image. The “as dewdrops form” constraint and the dewdrop falling into the pool concretely bind time, place, and magic. Description is lush but mostly purposeful, avoiding the feel of a static postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ashen skyborne arbor, the hush, moss, bark library, and tiny monuments create a rich, coherent atmosphere with strong visual and tactile specificity. Setting is tightly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, so it reads as lived-in rather than touristic. While the environment doesn’t overtly constrain choices, it does meaningfully charge the final image of her as “memory’s humble custodian” in the ashen branches. This is strong, though the setting could exert a bit more functional pressure to reach elite levels.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the ruined manor, overgrown greenhouse, and subterranean waterfall all feel tactile and distinct. The environment constrains options and supplies tools (fallen curtain rod, hidden latch, waterfall mist, river stone) that matter to choices. Recurring objects (clocks, compass, river stone) meaningfully charge the final image of the workshop. Atmosphere and place consistently mirror the thematic movement from ruin/rigidity to fluidity and surrender without feeling like generic set dressing.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rain-washed foundry, stone hearth, anvil, and sapphire-flamed forge are vividly rendered and tightly bound to the action of the ritual. Environmental details like pooling rainwater and dawn gilding the cobblestones are not merely decorative; they echo and reinforce the thematic cleansing and renewal. The foundry and forge directly host and constrain the alchemical process, charging the final image of the mended crucible in its sanctified space. Description leans visual but remains purposeful and character-filtered enough to avoid feeling like a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Echo Gorge and the “hidden sunrise” are vividly evoked and tonally aligned with the piece’s quiet, numinous mood. The acoustics of the gorge implicitly justify the way sound and memory interact, integrating setting with the premise of echoed confessions. Details like moss, obsidian cliffs, and mist feel specific and filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The environment enhances atmosphere more than it constrains choice, so it stops short of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ultraviolet forest is sharply rendered and consistently filtered through Kael’s altered perception, with UV glyphs, indigo fractals, and Fibonacci bark patterns doing thematic and atmospheric work. Setting is not mere backdrop; it frames the “ultraviolet penance” and models nonjudgmental revelation, mirroring his project with mercy. The pewter strap and body awareness function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. A small deduction comes from occasional descriptive saturation that edges toward ornamental rather than strictly pressured detail.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and original—the market’s “lanterns of captured moonlight” and “bottled echoes” feel specific and lived-in, and Hemlock’s lighthouse/study details are equally concrete. World rules for this quasi-mystical milieu stay consistent and are revealed through action (using the shard with the painting) rather than exposition dumps. The environment and recurring objects (lens fragment, paintings, portrait niche) help charge the final image, even if they don’t strongly constrain tactical options. A slight bias toward decorative over constraining detail keeps it just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail (dust patterns, faded ticket stubs, the buzzing fluorescent, the hidden ceiling compartment). Setting is not merely decorative: the office’s past function explains Elias, the ceiling architecture holds the secret, and the failing light governs the ghost’s appearance. The environment directly shapes Leo’s tactics (dust reading, ladder placement, ceiling search) and charges the final reconfiguration of the room from “melancholy” to “serene stillness.” This is high-level scene grounding with thematic echo but stops just short of utterly transformational genius.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integral: the glass orchard library, cloud-sea, crystalline leaves, and frost-mapped temporal currents all shape both method and outcome. Environmental details are not postcard; the frost literally guides action, the glass trees manifest awakening, and the cloud-sea carries the final echo of the method. World rules feel internally consistent with the “negotiable reality” premise and are revealed through action rather than exposition. The only limitation is that physical constraints rarely complicate tactics beyond the conceptual, keeping it just shy of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    The baroque asteroid, Hall of Echoing Time, visible chroniton rivers, and velvet-draped mirrors create a highly specific, immersive environment that feels both tactile and thematically apt. Setting constraints directly shape tactics—the need to cover mirrors in a chroniton storm and then use them as projection screens is central to the plot and closure. Details are filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with the ornate sorrow of cherubs and weeping angels echoing her emotional state without feeling like mere decoration. The world’s rules (visible time, chroniton storms, object-memory) remain consistent and legible through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    The resonance chamber, underground city, and singing granite are strongly evoked and integral to the action—the chamber’s acoustics literally enable the tether. The philosopher’s stone chip and the music box function as tools/setting-micro-objects that constrain choices and drive the ritual. Atmosphere is rich and coherent, with the subterranean sacred-workshop mood supporting the thematic concerns. Some description leans abstract rather than sensorially varied, but it rarely stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting and atmosphere are outstanding: the absence of factory noise, the “resonant hush,” flowstone, and obsidian lagoon all feel tactile and charged. Details are strongly filtered through her sensibility as a scent collector, with “mineral cousin—the ghost of water meeting ancient stone” tying place to vocation. The environment constrains behavior (the stillness, geometry, and silence press her toward awe and renunciation) and charges the final image of her leaving empty-handed. A slight further integration of the mountain/factory contrast in the closing beat could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is a major strength: the storm-tossed archway, offshore turbines, rain, and stone all feel tactile and lived-in, and they’re consistently filtered through Elara’s craft-obsessed, tide-mapped attention. The archway and turbine hum directly constrain and charge behavior—they provide shelter, acoustic anchor, and the literal frame for the ancestral slide and final beacon. The environment evolves with the story (storm relenting at peace), deepening atmosphere and closure without slipping into generic weather cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vivid and thematically charged: the amber pavilion, honey-tinted glass, melting snow, and crocus all echo the story’s threshold logic. The cathedral window fragment and the way dawn’s “single golden ray” reveals its hidden layers directly constrain the pivotal moment and shape the outcome. Environment and recurring objects (glass, pavilion, snow) clearly charge the final images and cannot be swapped out without breaking the story’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.3)
    Both the zeppelin library and the obsidian lagoon are vivid, sensorially rich, and filtered through Elias’s archivist/activist sensibility. The lagoon in particular becomes a charged image—“where truth drinks the moon”—that anchors the core mystery and the climax. Setting constrains choice in the vision (he’s a phantom who can only move debris) and charges the final conceptual frame of “truth” being relocated from myth to record. The zeppelin itself is somewhat more atmospheric than functional, but it still frames the sanctuary-like stakes of his work.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: “salt-laden wind,” “tattered crimson lanterns,” pine resin, rice-paper work, and the great stone lantern post all read as lived-in and specific. Paper-Lantern Cove’s physical remnants—lantern posts, derelict workshop, central plaza—shape her actions and the symbolic reimagining (greenhouse echoing lantern curves, lantern ritual becoming flint-and-steel). The amber bottle as recurring object and micro-setting literally anchors her breath and then is buried as a cornerstone, charging the final image. Atmosphere and environment consistently mirror the thematic turn from decay to deliberate, human-made renewal.

    The orchard atop the Aethelburg Spire, Sentinel Tree, mossy stones, and the city below form a vivid, specific environment that’s consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Setting details are economical yet rich—the silent crimson apple and the final blossom are powerful environmental beats that charge the ending. The “listening stone” concept and the elevated, foghorn-haunted garden are inseparable from the story’s logic and theme. While the setting doesn’t physically constrain her options, it does metaphysically and thematically structure what’s possible, which is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    The icebound atrium under starlight is exquisitely realized, with crystalline ferns, ice-sheathed oaks, and frost-dimmed stars all feeding both action and mood. Environment meaningfully shapes events: ice groans under her knees, melts into geometric patterns, reveals steaming soil, and a frozen rose and final dripping branch charge the closure image. Details are sharply selected and filtered through Elara’s seed-saver sensibility, so the space reads as both cathedral and germination bed. The setting actively participates in the story’s final reweighting of winter from death to gestation, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mountain sanctuary, the cloud sea, and the instruments are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Elara’s meteorological eye, creating a strong sense of place. Environmental specifics (ice chimes, ibex behavior, laminar flows) are not mere décor but directly inform her judgment about the storm. The bell rope and the cured resin are charged objects that bracket the story and inflect the final image. Setting meaningfully underwrites both atmosphere and the logic of her choice, though it stops short of directly constraining physical options.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    The shooting star tracking station, great dome, dust motes, and dormant consoles create a vivid, specific atmosphere that strongly supports tone and theme. Details are consistently filtered through Elian’s reverent gaze, turning neglect into “flourishing stillness,” which charges the setting with meaning. The yellow lantern glass functions as a micro-setting object that decisively charges the final image. The environment rarely constrains concrete choices, though, so it’s more thematically than tactically active.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.0)
    The oasis and scorched wasteland are vividly evoked and thematically apt, with bees, hives, and stone walls all reinforcing ideas of labor, sweetness, and enclosure. The stained glass box functions as both object and micro-setting, charging light and color in the final images. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, it does frame emotional stakes: a fragile green scar of memory against desolation. Description is selective and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    The emerald silo, humming core, brass ribs, and sun-dappled garage sale table create a distinctive, tactile environment that’s tightly integrated with the time-texture concept. The silo’s green light and the fragment recur to charge the final image (Kael dissolving into the emerald glow as Elara steps in), so setting is not just backdrop but closure-charging. World rules—post-numerical time, textured seconds—are revealed through action and perception rather than infodumps. The physical handling of objects (urn shard, teacup, pocket watch) grounds the abstract premise in concrete space.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lagoon after rain, the cove, dunes, sea oats, and sky are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Setting and objects (lagoon, feather, kite, first star) recur and clearly charge the final images and thematic frame. While the environment doesn’t sharply constrain physical options, it strongly shapes perception and the story’s conceptual stakes, which is apt for this lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    The temple orchard, living stone pillars, and copper-veined patterns are vividly rendered and always filtered through Kael’s caretaker gaze, avoiding generic fantasy backdrop. Environment and objects (pillars, oaks, copper, diary) don’t just decorate—they dictate his methods and literally charge the final image when the network hums and glows. World rules (pillars as conduits, corroded channels) are consistent and revealed through his work rather than exposition dumps. This tight integration of setting with process and closure is a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is vivid and specific—“rainwashed” obsidian stones, overgrown sculpture path, moss-eaten guardians, “bronze quiet,” resin basin—and strongly filtered through Aris’s scientific yet lyrical gaze. The environment meaningfully shapes action: the choice to avoid the main gate in favor of the sculpture path, the hidden fissure behind jasmine, and the resin-filled chamber all constrain and direct what can happen. The recurring relation between stone, sap, and luminescence culminates in the final image of the glowing tower mirroring Aris’s skin, charging the closure. A few descriptions verge on ornamental repetition, but overall atmosphere and specificity are exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    The jetty, sea, dead reef, and flowers are rendered with vivid, selective detail that strongly support mood and theme. Setting is integrated into action—the thin soil, salt recession, pilings, and battlefield history directly guide where and how he plants. The final image of the green sprout in cracked wood is charged by all prior environmental setup. This world feels coherent and tactile without unnecessary exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rusthaven and the “wild hush” of the poisoned wasteland are vividly evoked through selective, character-filtered detail (wind through twisted rebar, groaning metal, skeletal vehicles). The setting’s tone of desolation and salvage-age decay strongly mirrors Kael’s emotional state and charges the final image of him walking into that silence. The micro-setting of the bench, leaf, and cylinder works almost as an altar that grounds the key turn. Environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactics in a concrete way, but it does meaningfully charge mood and thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: Chronos Station, the dormant singularity, warped starlight “like ink on wet paper,” and the time dilation deck all clearly shape what is possible and what she notices. The environment is not mere backdrop; the stabilized anomaly and observation equipment directly enable the key glimpse and her interpretive leap. The gilded compass rose functions as a micro-setting anchor that charges the final image and integrates the thematic “true north” idea. World rules around temporal distortion are consistent and learned through her perceptions rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    The icebound spire, wrong sky, and observatory of solidified moonlight are vivid and specific, with strong visual atmosphere and integrated magical rules (the board literally warps the heavens). Setting is filtered through Kael’s reverent gaze, giving it a lived-in, sacred quality rather than a generic fantasy tower. Environment does affect action—climbing, fissure behind frozen water, vertigo from ice reflections—but mostly as color rather than hard constraint. The pocket sundial lid and chessboard function as micro-settings that charge the final image, pushing this into a strong, if not quite transcendent, execution.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the ruined city, the whispering gallery’s acoustics, and the fractured light all support the mood and premise rather than feeling like ornament. The gallery’s physical properties (dome, curves, echoes) are crucial to the mechanics of “unbinding,” and the chessboard functions as a recurring object that charges the final image. Details are economically chosen and consistently filtered through the story’s solemn, ritualistic tone. The world rules are suggestive but stable enough for this lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mountain bookstore is vividly realized and does real work: its scale, sub-basements, and astronomy dome shape where and how events unfold. The environment participates in closure when the shelves grind open to reveal the path, reconfiguring the space from prison to cradle. Details like “chokepoints” of extinct dialects, star-charted darkness, and chasms of poetry feel specific to this world and this character. Setting is more than backdrop; it mirrors and then literally responds to her internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    The time-frozen village, hanging raindrops, suspended flour, and moss-crowned well are vividly rendered and constantly filtered through Kael’s sensibility, giving the setting strong atmospheric weight. The woven hush is not just decorative; it defines options (no falling tears, no moving villagers) and makes his decision to break it consequential. The platinum labyrinth and tapestry are spatially and functionally clear, and the resumption of sound/ motion at the end recharges earlier images. Only a slight sense of “pretty” description occasionally outpacing functional constraint keeps this from the absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    The canyon of bone and the echoing environment are vividly imagined and tightly integrated—especially the way echoes literally refashion language (“connect us… connect us…”) into communal feeling. The pale spire and mist recur effectively, and the final image of the spire as a “canvas awaiting truth” reweights earlier descriptions. Setting is not mere backdrop; the acoustics and monumental bones shape the ritual logic and Elara’s chosen method. A marginal step shy of 9+ only because the environment constrains tactics more thematically than through concrete logistical obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is strikingly specific and integrated: the gears-and-cogs workshop above an emerald acid sea both triggers the crisis and frames the stakes. The centuries-old statue and its pockmarks are not decorative—they directly determine the ritual’s mechanics and thus the sequencing of memories. Environmental change at the end (acid sea smoothing to a mirror) meaningfully charges the closure image. The descriptive richness occasionally borders on luxuriant, but it nearly always channels character and pressure rather than stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    The harbor, coastal path, and especially the cave network and hidden oasis are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory selection (bilge-water rainbows, bioluminescent algae, liquid starlight pool). Setting is tightly filtered through Elias’s painterly perception, making environment and object-as-setting (the shell, mirror) feel lived-in rather than touristic. The cave and pool constrain and channel the climactic act of offering the shell, charging the final image. A hair’s breadth from top-tier: a few descriptions verge on overt symbolism but still serve the story more than they stall it.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt lighthouse, dawn light, sea, and post-storm air are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s perceptions, achieving a strong, immersive atmosphere. The setting actively shapes tactics: the height, breeze, and coastal path make the scent’s travel and the contrast with the foghorn plausible and meaningful. The recurring cobalt tower and garden-scent images charge the final beam-and-boat scene with thematic weight. It stops just short of perfect because a few descriptions verge on ornamental rather than constraint-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    The starlit signal station, failed hydraulics, dome, and habitat module create a specific, atmospheric isolation that mirrors Elara’s internal state without feeling like a vague “space” backdrop. Setting details are filtered through her purpose (tools, wires, dome light, phone), and the recurrent object (censer foot) functions as a micro-setting tool that constraints her ritual and charges the final image. The final re-perception of the station as “home again” reweights the environment and proves setting is integral, not decorative. A touch more interaction between the broken infrastructure and her immediate tactics could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    The hanging orchard and storm-scarred ravine are vivid and specific, with details (horizontal trees, lightning-scarred quince, damp soil) filtered through Elara’s purpose. The environment constrains tactics (post-storm timing for the truffle) and charges the thematic frame of “fractured grace,” especially when she looks back from the ridge. The recurring physicality of orchard, truffle, and ravine meaningfully charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting work is vivid and purposeful: “opal dock,” “seamless bruise of violet and silver,” the circular study, and the lantern room all feel texturally rich and spatially coherent. Environment and objects meaningfully charge the ending image—the dock becomes a “sacred space,” the lighthouse beam a promise, the logbook a reliquary. Details are filtered through Silas’s sensibility as a keeper, not a tourist catalog, which keeps the world from feeling generic. It could push higher only if the environment imposed more concrete constraints on his choices rather than functioning almost entirely atmospherically.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting work is rich and specific: phosphorescent fungi, ghost orchids, willow-root arch, and the storm-fed creek all feel tactile and lived-in. Crucially, environment isn’t just decorative—the rising water, the narrow crevice, and the bioluminescence channel his options and allow the ants and chip to function as guides. The seasonal and temporal anchors (midsummer dawn, solstice creek, storm passing) support tone and thematic resonance without confusion. Occasionally the description edges toward lushness-for-its-own-sake, but it largely remains purposeful and integrated into action.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is vividly and consistently rendered—from the ridge’s spine and whispering pines to the cobalt grotto above clouds and azurite-lit chambers—and the environment shapes mood and action (the treacherous climb, the cold, the high altitude). Details are filtered through Lyra’s perception so they carry thematic weight (beauty interlaced with peril, high places as liminal truths) instead of reading like a tourist catalog. The grotto and altar materially constrain where and how the revelation can occur, charging the final image of “mending light.” The only minor limitation is that, at times, description borders on decorative excess rather than always tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ember nexus, twilight, pocket-sun, and nautilus shell create a distinct, sensuous environment that is more than backdrop—the embers “flare in sympathy” and the nexus becomes a beacon for future secrets. Setting details are selective and patterned (embers, twilight, moss bench) and are consistently tied to emotional beats. The micro-setting of tools—the pocket-sun, shell, and pigments—acts as a functional environment that constrains how Elara can intervene. The final image of ember-glow on the path and the pocket-sun warming her palm directly charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mountain ranger cabin, pine table, birch tree, and high peaks are rendered with specific, tactile detail that feels lived-in rather than generic. The environment mirrors and frames his inner state—the worn grooves on the table, the birch bark as “a piece of the land itself,” and dawn igniting the peak all echo his temporal layering and new clarity. Setting doesn’t strongly constrain choices so much as it charges objects and images, especially the scroll and final view of the mountains. That keeps this just shy of the very top band but still strong.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    The water clock shop, fog, brass, and tiny screw are vividly realized and tightly filtered through Elara’s altered sensorium, giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine. The recurring motifs—dripping clocks, fog lifting, clamp as tool—are not mere decoration; they charge the final images of “liquid symphony” and “unveil beauty in the broken.” The environment doesn’t radically constrain options (she could in theory repair this elsewhere), but the clocks’ rhythm and the fog’s occlusion are thematically and tonally integral. World rules and spatial relations are consistent and never confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    The floating rock tea platform, bruised-violet clouds, prayer flags, and volatile ink are vivid, selective, and consistently filtered through Elara’s attention. Setting and tools meaningfully constrain choice—the ritual is possible only in this post-storm hush on this platform, with this crystallizing ink and quill. Environmental details evolve with the action (storm receding, breeze returning, bell chiming) and directly charge the final image of her standing against new storm clouds. It stops just shy of 9-band because, while beautifully rendered, the environment shapes mood and ritual more than it forces hard tactical compromises.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sheet music archive and orchard are vividly rendered (“cathedral of suspended breath,” dust motes, leaded glass, “profound, aching hush”) and tightly tied to Valerius’s identity and the Nocturne. Setting details are filtered through Elara’s purpose and guilt, and the environment participates in the ritual (vibrations through floorboards and archived sheets). The orchard and archive both charge the final image: we feel the cost of the trees falling as the music and memory persist. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, it meaningfully charges stakes and emotional options throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ancient temple library, spiral ramp, and crystalline arches are vivid yet economical, and the setting is tightly bound to the action (the spiral physically enforces the ritual method, the shelves of unstable words define the work). The softcover dictionary functions as both tool and charged object, especially in the final image. The “library lost in time” and the convulsing cosmos beyond the arches are integrated enough that moving this scene elsewhere would break the logic of “last uncorrupted definitions.” A bit more sensory variety beyond visual and abstract (sound, texture, bodily strain on the ramp) could deepen atmosphere further.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    The fjord, granite platform, and horizon measurement station are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the premise: the environment both defines his vocation and literally supplies the horizon whose “clarity” is being measured. The hydraulic clock, droplet, and horizon line recur as charged objects that shape perception and the final image of stars “measuring the night.” Setting details are selectively chosen and filtered through his professional gaze, avoiding tourist-catalog excess. The environment also charges the closure, as the fjord quiet and aurora become macro-clocks against which his new understanding is measured.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vivid, sensorially rich, and filtered through Elara’s professional and emotional gaze, giving the setting genuine texture rather than postcard prettiness. Crucially, environment and tools (mycelial walls, glowing clusters, the beam) constrain and enable the core action of testing permeability and charge the final image of light passing through living fungus. Details like “the hour before the echo of morning birdsong” and “soft cerulean light” deepen atmosphere and mirror the liminal internal state. At moments the description edges toward lushness for its own sake, but it remains anchored enough in action and theme to avoid bogging the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.0)
    The settings—the rainwashed midsummer library, the humid subway, the sealed City Hall station—are vivid, sensory, and filtered through Elara’s grief and intellect. Environment and object-as-setting matter: the forgotten station and the lantern’s mica literally constrain what she can see, and the hidden door only exists under that specific environmental condition. Weather and season modulate tone without feeling postcard-like, and spatial choreography (library → street → subway → sealed station → active platform) is always legible. The final image of her on the train, lantern warm in her palm, is charged precisely because of this carefully built environment.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    The subway utility tunnel and scarlet phone booth are vivid, texturally rich, and immediately establish liminal, subterranean atmosphere. The recurring hum of streetlamps and the phone booth as a bolted red outpost charge the final image of vigil and beginnings “waiting in the wings.” The setting functions more as emotional/musical chamber than as hard constraint on action, but the micro-setting (booth + bulb + disc) does meaningful work. The specificity and sonic motif integration are strong enough to approach top-tier despite the relative lack of physical stakes tied to place.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: the blooming jetty, sea air, twilight light, and tools of her craft all filter through Elara’s sensibility and grief. The environment constrains and charges choice—the promised return “when the jetty blooms at twilight” makes this place and hour function as a vow-fulfillment and emotional crucible. The final images (jetty against dark sea, glowing cottage) reweight the landscape as both site of loss and of renewed purpose. Description is lush but mostly purposeful, supporting atmosphere and theme rather than becoming a catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    The disused, ivy-choked railway station is vividly rendered and tonally aligned with liminality and quiet rebellion against decay, and it’s consistently filtered through Elara’s shifting perception. The moon rock functions as a recurring object that charges the final image when passed on, and the setting’s evolution—from ruin to beacon—tracks her inner change. While the station doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, it does conceptually frame the choice to “take a permanent post” there. The sensory palette leans visual but is purposeful and not touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ultrasonic forest is vividly and economically realized through non-visual senses—hums, pings, thrums, bark textures—filtered through a blind cartographer’s priorities. Environmental rules stay consistent (sound/vibration as information) and culminate in the decisive silence of the stillpoint, so setting meaningfully governs the climax. The platinum ring also functions as a tool-like micro-setting that constrains choices. A slight tendency toward aestheticization over friction keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    The gravitational anomaly, void-like light, floating debris, and especially the pen function as micro-setting elements that are both vivid and functional. The anomaly is not just backdrop; it enables the temporal-web perception and gravitational glyph transmission, directly charging the closure. Sensory choices (fogged visor, humming metal, frozen tear) are selective and purposeful. This is strong enough for high-tier venues, though an added tactile interaction with the environment under pressure could push it even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    The harbor, moonlight, dock, and lighthouse are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s attention to breath, tide, and light. Setting and atmosphere strongly support tone and theme, with the luminous harbor mirroring his lyrical approach to silence. However, the environment rarely constrains concrete choices; it’s more stage and echo than obstacle or resource. Even so, the recurring harbor-moon-lighthouse triad meaningfully charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lost civilization archive and its sequence of artworks are vividly and specifically rendered—the dust-choked floor, abalone mosaic river, bronze bird, and moonlit circular chamber all feel tactile and purposeful. Setting is tightly integrated with action; the environment isn’t a backdrop but the mechanism by which Kael must navigate and decode meaning. The final image of dawn as he exits with the Canticle recharges the archive’s darkness as a chrysalis for redemption. A slight bias toward visual description over other senses keeps it just short of top-tier, but it’s still strong and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    The auric lagoon and sound wave garden are vivid, sensorially rich, and tightly woven into action—drumming alters light, scent, and sound, and the environment responds as an instrument rather than a backdrop. World rules stay consistent: sound produces physical and emotional manifestations. The setting directly charges the closure through the lagoon’s final latent depth and the lingering chime as a “seed of memory.” It’s lush, occasionally bordering on ornamental, but mostly purposeful and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    The port’s labyrinth of containers and the geomagnetic storm are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action: sound paths, an “acoustic triangle,” and the whispering gallery literally dictate tactics. Environmental details are filtered through Kael’s professional bias—maps, seams, rust patterns—creating a strong perceptual signature. The setting tangibly shapes options (where he stands, how he speaks) and charges the final image of the containers “humming in agreement.” A few descriptive phrases verge on ornamental but mostly earn their place by reinforcing atmosphere and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cobalt dock after rain, star reflections, and canal are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with mood and action; the wet surfaces literally transmit and reflect the starlight Kael uses. Setting details feel selective and purposeful rather than touristic, and the canal’s mirror-like quality charges the final image (“flawless reflection of stars and cobalt wood”). While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, it does meaningfully shape the story’s tactics and resonance. The result is a rich, atmospheric stage that feels inseparable from the piece’s effect.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt library, mist, and dawn are richly evoked and tightly integrated with tone and theme; the environment feels lived-in and specific, not postcard-like. The magnetic grotto within this setting becomes a charged micro-environment, especially when aligned “to greet the sun” and glowing at the end. Weather and time (mist, pre-dawn hush) subtly guide tactics—their choice to act before the town wakes depends on these conditions. Setting details recur and evolve, culminating in the mist lifting over a spiritually altered town.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    The settings—the rain-slick dock, the sublittoral fringe, the twilight kelp forests, and the bioluminescent volcanic island—are vivid, sensorial, and strongly filtered through Elara’s sea-attuned perception. The environment materially charges the story: the sea is both her past as pirate and present sanctuary, and the island’s appearance and dissolution structure the climax and the thematic final image. The scrimshaw as object-setting is tightly integrated with place and closure. The one constraint is that the environment, while beautifully rendered, doesn’t much limit her options tactically; it’s more mirror than obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the farmhouse, turbines, dust, and kitchen atmosphere are filtered through Elias’s history with the Mandate and grief rather than as neutral scenery. The turbines’ hum and moving shadow evolve from symbols of enforced happiness to part of his chosen sanctuary, directly charging the final image. Objects-as-setting—the bouquet, cedar block, pocketknife, carved sparrow—are tactile and recur with deepened meaning. Environment doesn’t overtly constrain physical options but meaningfully shapes his emotional choices and the story’s tone.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and humming quartz pillars are vividly and repeatedly rendered, with specific sensory details (hum, shimmer, ice singing) woven directly into the action. The setting isn’t just backdrop: the physical boundary between atrium and lake is the story’s central problem, and its dissolution is what closure literally enacts. Environmental elements recur and evolve—the colonnade shifts from warding to welcoming, the ice from inert to harmonizing—which charges the final image. This is rich, purposeful world-building that meaningfully shapes the narrative without bogging it down.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    The courtyard, with warped gate, ash, shards of glass, and tenacious plants, is vivid and thematically consonant with rebirth and broken beauty. Tools and objects (glass sphere, paperweight, windowsill with reed) function as micro-settings, charging key beats and the final image. Environment plausibly shapes action—the glassblowing workshop justifies Kael’s breath control and frames his identity. A touch more sense of temperature, sound, or constraint from the ruined space itself could deepen its functional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    The laboratory of lost sounds is vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with images like “vacuum-sealed fragments of a baker’s dawn call” anchoring the premise. The Great Resonator and the carbide lens work as micro-setting tools that shape action and directly charge the final image. World rules about sound as artifact versus seed remain internally consistent and learned through interaction rather than exposition dumps. A slight tendency toward aestheticized atmosphere over material constraint keeps it short of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory, its oak door, brass, “cold starlight,” and the curtains of intention are vivid and functionally tied to choice: she must physically and mentally part them to access Lena’s last gift. The valley, telescope, fungi grove, and later the workshop and hill all feel spatially coherent and are revisited or mirrored in the closing images (locket catching sun, observatory waiting). Tools and objects (telescope, locket, paper, wire) act as micro-settings that constrain or channel her actions. Description is rich but purposeful, with minimal white-room or postcard effect.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting work is a major strength: the rain-beaded skylight, scents of beeswax and ink, brass tape, and vellum create a lived, coherent space filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The environment recurs and evolves—rain to mist, moonlight through the skylight igniting the ink—charging the final image like a constellation and reinforcing thematic healing. Tools and objects (measuring tape, inkwell, journal) are integrated into action rather than museum-listed. The only limit on a higher score is that the environment shapes meaning more than it constrains concrete choices.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    The archive, fractured dome, twilight, and pagoda are vivid and purposeful, consistently filtered through Elara’s attention as a historian and ritualist. The bronze prism pagoda and twilight recur and are reweighted in the final image, charging the closure with a sense of possibility rather than distortion. The environment constrains the scene (isolation, silence, dust, ancient technology) and is inextricable from the story’s logic about lost civilizations and preserved memory. A hair more interaction between environment and tactical choice (beyond the pagoda itself) would be needed to push this into the absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Blooming Library and dream-vines are vividly imagined, with details (“shelves that breathed like living wood,” “each leaf a whispered memory”) that feel specific rather than generic fantasy décor. Setting is filtered through Elara’s occupational gaze, which keeps the lyricism grounded in function (how dusk reveals shifts, how vines record dreams). The river stone as an object-setting hybrid directly charges the final image and crystallizes theme. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, it deeply shapes what counts as a meaningful choice and how the climax is visualized.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting work is rich and specific: mist, log walls, oil lamp, lavender, owl, and terrarium all feel lived-in and tightly filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The workshop and surrounding night sky are not mere backdrop; they mirror and hold her inner process, and the chameleon’s tail/box function as a micro-setting object that strongly charges the final image. Environmental details evolve with the emotional arc—from dense night mist to dissolving dawn—supporting the sense of internal cleansing. There is some risk of over-lushness, but description remains legible and purposeful rather than static or touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tower at dawn, “meteor hush,” frost, and plants create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s tightly filtered through Elara’s sensory and conceptual biases. Recurring objects—the frosted hourglass, coffee ring, scar, and plants—are not just decorative; they each return at the end charged with new meaning and help carry the final image. The environment meaningfully shapes what’s possible (a still, enclosed, plant-filled space suited to listening and interior shift). The setting is economical yet textured, with the hourglass in particular constraining the temporal frame and symbolically reweighting time at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    The projection booth and the gas-lit London room are richly realized—dust motes, green-shaded lamp, rain-streaked window, lacquered box—and integrated with emotion rather than feeling like set dressing. The film strip, gaslight, and Orpheum all recur and charge the final image (spooling the strip, descending the stairs, stepping into the cool night) with a sense of earned release. The environment also plausibly enables her psychometry method and isolates her in a “hushed dark” that fits the tone. A slight trim of descriptive density in a couple places could sharpen momentum without losing the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.0)
    The aurora, the ancient archway, the cold night, and the astrolabe create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s strongly filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The environment is not just postcard backdrop—the archway “speaks,” its stone is physically touched in the closing beat, and the aurora’s shifting colors mirror emotional turns. However, the setting rarely constrains choice or creates practical friction; it mostly amplifies mood and theme. The micro-setting functions effectively as a ritual space but stops short of fully shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glowing dune, bioluminescent sand, and post-forest world are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through his mission. Setting is not mere backdrop: the dune’s paradox of sorrow/hope, the shadowed hollow, and blooming flora all directly frame and charge his choices. The chess clock and archive function as micro-settings/tools that constrain his path and heavily charge the final images. Atmosphere is rich and coherent without losing spatial clarity or world-rule consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mechanical rainforest is vividly and consistently realized—copper pines, mercury waterfalls, obsidian tree—and these details are filtered through Kael’s awakened perception. Crucially, setting isn’t just backdrop: the forest guides his translocations, the wind through specific trees shapes his route, and the obsidian tree plus socket/gear structure the climax and final image. The world’s rules feel internally coherent and thematically linked to mind and insight. A slight excess of ornamental description in later lines is the only thing holding this below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ridgeway, sea mist, standing stones, cliff path, and crescent bay are evocatively rendered and sustain a coherent liminal atmosphere. Setting is filtered through Elara’s emotional journey and the guides’ roles, and the environment (cliffs, mist, ridgeway heart, boat below) tracks consistently and gives the piece a strong sense of place. However, the landscape rarely constrains concrete choices; it mirrors and hosts the arc more than it pressures it. The final image of the bay and boat seen from the ridgeway’s heart nicely charges the internal decision rather than driving it.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt fortress and its snowbound isolation are richly specific and consistently filtered through Elara’s priorities—acoustic purity, dust, stairs, and cold all matter to her choices. The environment and objects (spiral staircase, secret chamber, piano, bolt) directly constrain action and charge the ending image of the fortress as “bones of a home.” Weather and architecture aren’t postcard backdrop; they shape protocol, danger, and memorialization tactics. A touch less descriptive density in a few lines would improve economy, but atmosphere and spatial logic are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Chronos Athenaeum and its “crease of eternity” are vividly and economically realized, with details like obsidian halls, the Font of Echoes, and the crystalline dome shaping both mood and the mechanics of Kael’s method. The timeless library is not mere backdrop: its temporal dislocation and magical resources determine how he can fight back and what it costs him. The dissolution of shelves and books into “motes of warm light” directly charges the final image and closure. A slightly broader sensory range beyond the visual and metaphysical would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the monitoring station’s recycled skeleton over drowned forest, the viewport, the consoles, and the moonlit water are all filtered through Elara’s ecological grief and professionalism. The environment directly charges the final images—the station as “sanctuary of sound,” the sea cradling the moon’s path, Elara cradling others’ paths. World rules (post–sea-level-rise, monitoring tech, AI overlay) stay consistent and are learned through action rather than infodump. The setting could constrain choice a bit more explicitly (e.g., operational limitations, physical hazards) to push into the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay and the ancient stone circle are rendered with vivid, selective detail that strongly colors mood (fractured dome’s “wound,” rusted carts, mossed granite, spirals). Setting is tightly filtered through Kael’s priorities: the machinery and slogans as failed rebellion, the stones as enduring authority. The opera glasses and the dome/star image recur to charge the final image, tying place to lineage and purpose. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, it decisively shapes context and thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Serpent’s Coil hot springs and volcanic terrain are richly sensory—obsidian paths, sulfur, turquoise pools—and consistently filtered through Elara’s plant-attuned perception. Setting directly shapes action and stakes: the springs create her telepathy, conceal the amber, and provide the heat needed to unseal it, while the reconstructed terraces ground the social context. The recurring amber imagery (physical resin and sunset light) elegantly charges the final image. A slight excess of descriptive flourish in places keeps it just below the absolute top tier, but the environment is deeply integrated and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    The arboretum, cliff, sea, and abandoned lighthouse are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s perceptions. Environmental elements (sea thrift, orchids, sea lavender, cypress bark, the sun-warmed bench) are not mere backdrop; they mirror and deepen her internal process and reappear in the final movements. The lighthouse and garden meaningfully charge the last images (“she was its new keeper,” “the cliff held the garden; the garden held her; she held the pearl”), though they constrain emotion more than concrete choice. A bit less explicit symbolism and more lived physical interaction could push this into the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lighthouse library and root cellar are vividly rendered through selective, sensory detail (salt-crusted glass, mildewed logs, pulsing threads) and tightly filtered through Kael’s artistic gaze. Setting is not just backdrop: the lighthouse’s warning function and the ocean’s indifference become the final knot he must reconfigure, and the tarot box under the lamp’s beam charges the closing image. Spatial movement—library → hidden door → cellar web → return—is coherent and purposeful. The environment meaningfully mirrors and constrains his choices without feeling like a mere symbol parade.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    The canyon encampment, wind, stone grooves, and ink are richly textured and integrated into action—the wind spills the ink, the stone receives the disappearing patterns, and the environment literally enables the climactic event. The final image of wind smoothing sand and a clean hearth stone charges the theme of transience and letting go. Setting is not mere backdrop; it constrains events and frames the meaning of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    The icy, subterranean library and snow weight are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s perception, with details like glacial halls, cryogenic vaults, and cartography panels integrated into action. The environment meaningfully shapes tactics (hidden panel in the oldest wing, dormant networks in the bedrock) and charges the final “catalyst for thaw” image thematically. Atmosphere is strong and coherent, though occasionally the descriptive density edges toward ornamental rather than pressure-driven. The setting feels specific and memorable enough for high-band, if just shy of truly indelible.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glass dome in the desert, crystalline roses, and the wrecked airship create a vivid, distinctive environment that is tightly woven with character and theme. The setting is consistently filtered through Elara’s perception (engraved quiet, howling winds outside) and clearly shapes the stakes as sanctuary versus ruin. Recurring objects—the dome, knife, and sandbag scrap—charge the final image of a fragile oasis built from remnants of violence. This is one of the story’s most polished aspects, with purposeful, not touristic, detail.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sound wave garden is vividly realized and integrated into action: harmonics as forests, dissonant thickets, and rivers of melody all physically constrain Elara’s path. The environment’s rules (sound as matter, transliteration of emotion) remain consistent and directly shape tactics, especially at the spike and vortex beats. The rail spike functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image when it cools to dull iron. A few descriptive flourishes feel ornamental rather than pressure-bearing, keeping this just short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mountaintop observatory above a sea of clouds is vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with details like the dome shutter and maintenance log doing functional plot work, not just mood-setting. The environment meaningfully constrains the logic of the supposed accident (locked shutter, no frost) and thus underpins the central contradiction. The recurring physicality of the chamber—its echoes, altitude, and isolation—supports the tone of lonely investigation turning to purposeful resolve. The rosewood nib as a micro-setting object further charges the final image, though the piece stops just short of fully integrating weather or physical hazard into live choices.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “laboratory of lost sounds” with reverse-ticking clocks, temporal scents, and haunted firmware is vivid, specific, and tightly integrated with the premise. The amber, desk, and letters function as concrete setting elements that also drive plot and thematic resonance, particularly the amber’s charged reprisal at the end. World rules—time folding, preserved cries as data—are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition dumps. The environment could arguably constrain her choices more overtly, but it already shapes mood and method in a purposeful way.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    The whispering grotto, its parabolic walls, moss, and lilac mist are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, giving the piece a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting is not postcard: the mist drinks into the walls, the tile comes from the gallery, and the environment literally begins dissolving the mandala, constraining both what she can build and how long it can last. The final images—the blurred mandala, the mist, the tile in her pocket—charge the ending with a concrete sense of impermanence and carried insight. It’s extremely strong, narrowly missing a perfect mark only because the physical constraints of the space never force a truly difficult tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the shattered sky, bone-fine ash, cracked cobblestones, and steel framework all accrue into a coherent, lived-in ruin. Environmental details are filtered through Elara’s priorities (reading negative space in the mosaic, treating the plaza as teacher), and the recurring sky/ash images mirror her internal state without feeling like a tourist catalog. The plaza and shelter architecture meaningfully charge the final image (sunlight on tessera, hand on cool steel), though they constrain mood and meaning more than concrete logistics or options. Overall, the atmosphere strongly supports the piece’s thematic aims.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, integrated, and functionally central: the hedge maze, orchard, and apple tree outside linear time are not postcard backdrops but the mechanism that permits echo-weaving and the final safeguarding of possibility. Details like apple blossoms falling upward and the orchard glowing at closure both mirror and enable the temporal reconfiguration. The tarot coin’s placement at the apple tree’s roots and the garden’s ongoing role as keeper of echoes clearly charge the final image. This is very high-level scene-as-worldbuilding work, only slightly shy of perfection because the environment rarely constrains specific tactical options beyond its metaphysical function.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    The light painting studio is vivid and functional: safelight, strobe, camera, long exposure, and darkness all shape what Elara can do and how. The muscovite sliver, safelight, and dawn light are used as recurring environmental/object details that charge the emotional beats rather than as static décor. The setting’s constraints—working in darkness, the 60-second exposure—mesh with the story’s focus on bodily guidance and unseen pathways. The final image of the studio in morning sun with the geode on the bench neatly ties environment into the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coastal cave network, treated kelp-paper, bioluminescent grotto, and tide-worn crevice are vividly particular and always filtered through Elara’s sensibilities as a sensory map maker. Environment is not postcard: the caves dictate her routes, the grotto houses the fossil, and the shore crevice becomes the story’s final tactical choice and charged image. World rules (cryo-sleepers, coastal erosion, mapping via emotional residue) feel internally consistent and deeply integrated with mood and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the amber warehouse, master hourglass, sandstone cliffs, and canyon echo jar all shape how Elara works and what’s at stake. Environmental pressure (the crack, falling dust, hovering grain of sand) meaningfully charges her realization and the final act of turning the master glass. Objects-as-setting—the buttons, the jar, the hourglasses—are not mere decor but the tools through which she reads and alters the situation. Description occasionally verges on lushness, but it remains purposeful and strongly supports the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: Zephyr Bluff, mist, last snow, and the “silver hush” are not postcard backdrops but tightly linked to Elias’s internal thaw and the theme of seasonal transition. The snow literally enables his code method, the mist grants “sacred solitude” and then stages Anya’s emergence, and the final sensory note of damp earth and pine charges the closing image. Details feel filtered through his state (burned spy seeking quiet and erasure) rather than neutral description. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactics beyond privacy and medium, it strongly shapes tone and thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    The fog-bound river crossing, ferryman’s cottage, ticking gutters, and Gloom Hill’s silhouette are vivid and consistently filtered through Silas’s mood. The environment is not just decorative: the fog and mist create the liminal space for his reckoning, and the gutters’ ticking and final silence literally structure the timing of his realization. The yarn needle as a recurring object, worked through fabric at the end, charges the final image as a lived-in, tactile setting detail. It stops short of 9+ mainly because the setting constrains mood and cadence more than concrete physical options.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and thematically integrated: scorched wasteland, stubborn lavender, skeletal hives, chimney smoke, and etched stones all reinforce the idea of a fragile sanctuary resisting entropy. Environmental details actively shape the action (sun-angle glyphs dictate where he must stand; the oasis’s persistence is the narrative question). The recurring objects—hives, well, lantern glass—charge the final image and his decision to carry the oasis’s lesson outward. This is strong enough to enter the high band, with the world’s rules feeling coherent and lived-in for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    The fire escape garden, alley, and moonlit harbor are rendered with tactile specificity, and the environment genuinely constrains choices: she needs the full moon over the harbor and the vertical drop to the alley to perform her ritual. The lockmaster’s gauge and rosebush operate as charged micro-settings/objects that frame both opening and closing, clearly reweighting the final image. Sensory details are lush but usually purposeful, with the harbor’s silver paths and alley moss echoing her thematic work of finding beauty in shadow. At times the visual emphasis crowds out other senses, but it doesn’t harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal library above a cloud sea, the lunar-governed tides, stone circles, and Sky Whales together create a striking, coherent atmosphere. Setting is not postcard decoration: the rising cloud tide and humming stones constrain timing and method for the ritual, and the library’s archives shape her response (choosing to write testimony). Details feel filtered through Elara’s sensibility, especially the tactile handling of brass and cloud-stone. The environment also charges the final image—the humming stones and reflective sundial—as more than mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, rain-cleansed air, and specific materials (stones, stems, petals) are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s contemplative gaze. The environment is not mere backdrop: the pond’s “offerings” literally supply the medium for her method, and the temple’s reflection and moonlight gilding charge the final images. Weather and water conditions (post-storm debris, dampness) directly enable the discovery of the twig spiral and the art-building. This richness is exceptionally handled, though the setting could shape tactical constraints even more strongly to reach the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.0)
    The basement radio station, oscilloscope glow, dust motes, and the view onto the protesting quad create a vivid, atmospheric micro-setting that feels lived-in and specific. The equipment and reinforced window aren’t just décor—they enable his interference and let him witness the change outside. Astronomical charts function as both tool and symbolic map, returning in the final image to charge the closing moment. Setting doesn’t radically constrain options beyond providing the transmitter, but it strongly supports tone and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    The nexus, twisting geometry, and narrowing starlight are intensely specific and integral, not decorative—the environment literally attacks orientation and then realigns under the organ’s influence. The organ, compass, and monolith function as tools embedded in place, and the nexus’s transformation (“starlight poured through newly aligned apertures”) charges the climax. Spatial choreography is coherent despite the surreal premise. A heavy density of atmospheric description occasionally threatens to overshadow action but does not break clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.0)
    The quarry setting is richly evoked (“mist clung to limestone cliffs like breath held too long”) and tightly integrated with action: moss, stone, and submerged ledge directly shape how Elara searches and what she can discover. Her tactile engagement with the environment (tracing moss-slick stones, lancing the moss veil) turns setting into an investigative tool, not mere backdrop. The recurring stone-and-water imagery culminates in the sun burning through the mist, charging the final image with conceptual and emotional payoff. Environment is inseparable from the story’s logic and its last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the damp, bruised sky, reinforced viewport, and reef-bound station all contribute to tone and stakes. Environmental details (barometric pressure plummeting, experimental models failing, physical placement over the Serpent’s Tooth) materially constrain choices and make the tsunami credible. The copper nail and journals act as micro-setting anchors that travel with Elara, carrying atmospheric and thematic weight into the final image. World rules around climate-shifted weather and seismic risk feel consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.3)
    The mountain scenic pullout, the visible new bridge and scaffolding, and the fluttering wraps are specific, atmospheric, and thematically integrated. The environment actively shapes perception—his vantage makes the scaffold pattern legible—and the recurring objects (glass flake, scaffolds, wraps) strongly charge the final images. Weather and light (“alpine wind,” “sun bled gold across the peaks”) support the threshold/epiphany tone without overwhelming clarity. A bit more tactile engagement with the physical space could deepen immersion, but what’s here is already strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    The abandoned circus train is vividly evoked (“rusted spine…weed-choked siding,” “dust motes dancing”) and consistently tied to Leo’s history, his father’s crime, and the company’s ghostly traces. The territorial markers and the foreign notes are concrete, recurring objects that charge both the middle and final images. The environment doesn’t physically constrain options, but it strongly shapes perception and theme, especially at the ending with the notes left on the velvet seat. Detail is selective rather than touristic, though the sensory palette skews heavily visual.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory is vividly evoked—“aged paper and polished brass,” the dome, the eyepiece—and the body-in-space is always legible. Setting details (Mira’s dimming, the dawn, the journal, the telegram as object) are not just decorative; they meaningfully charge the final realization and image. The environment underwrites the tone of “midnight solace” and supports the metaphor of watchfulness, though it doesn’t sharply constrain physical options. Overall, this is rich, economical, and integrated scene-setting suitable for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cursed lake, orchard vortex, and muddy shore are vivid, specific, and tied to action—the lake as failed scrying surface, the soil as the seed’s anchor, the vortex as the visible form of the curse. Environmental changes track the emotional arc (grey to gold leaves, ice to liquid light) and clearly charge the final image of the sapling guardian. The world’s rules feel coherent and are learned through the ritual rather than exposition. At times the atmospheric description leans into ornamental excess, but it still mostly serves mood and stakes rather than becoming a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cobalt glade, Sentinel Oak, lightning scars, and star-dusted twilight are vivid and consistently filtered through Elara’s bond to the land. Environment is not mere backdrop: trees and scars literally form the navigation system and healing mechanism, and the final sapling image charges the renewed covenant. The atmospheric palette (cobalt, violet, indigo, liquid twilight) is strong and thematically aligned with liminal change. At times the description approaches lushness for its own sake, but it rarely stalls momentum and it materially shapes the magic and choices.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    The catacomb orchard is striking and specific—roots threading bones, phosphorescent moss, the rib-vaulted corridors—and filtered consistently through Kael’s reverent perception. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the orchard’s heart holds the altar; the half-light, roots, and bones become witnesses and later “guides,” and the final exhale of the orchard charges the closure image. Environment and recurring objects (bones, roots, moss, card) strongly color the thematic atmosphere of death, memory, and restitution. It could press on his choices a bit more concretely, but as a charged ritual space it’s highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    The quarry office trailer and surrounding limestone cliffs are vividly sketched and recur meaningfully, shifting from barren isolation to “workshop of redemption,” so environment clearly mirrors his internal state. The micro-setting details (floorboard’s C-sharp, grimy window, amber cliffs) feel filtered through his sensibility as a sound-and-object person. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it does charge the final images and tone of patient strength and echo. The use of “echo valley” as an environmental/tonal motif integrated with place is effective rather than merely decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    The magnetic arbor above the clouds is vivid, tactile, and thematically apt, with ironwood, shimmering filaments, luminous moss, and consoles all integrated into action. Environmental elements (magnetic branches, nexus, hum, needles) participate directly in the core event and the final reconfiguration. The arbor’s glow around the planted seed charges the last image nicely. The setting could constrain choices more overtly, but it’s already doing meaningful work beyond postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tidal atrium, titan-gears, wintersun, and brine-scented air are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Environment directly shapes action—the tide delivers the fragments, the watermark dictates where the creel sits, and the gears’ turning is tied to time and her bond with the library. The recurring objects (gears, creel, moon) clearly charge the final image, though the piece occasionally lingers on beauty for its own sake rather than selective, pressure-driven detail.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    The crystal caves are vividly realized and more than decorative: the “latent radiance” and “resonant hush” are environmental forces that respond to his action and charge the final image. Setting is filtered through his inspector’s eye (blast doors, pressure tests) in a way that contrasts bunker sterility with the cave’s living light, reinforcing theme. The cave’s behavior at the climax (golden wave, harmonic vibration) makes place inseparable from the ritual’s stakes and outcome. Description occasionally skirts over-lushness, but it remains purposeful and grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    The station, ivy, bathroom, and river are vividly rendered with multi-sensory precision and always filtered through Elara’s perceptual biases as a river chronicler. The micro-setting (bathroom, tiles, accordion, map) functions as a crucible where the thematic realization is triggered and visualized. Environment and tools (accordion, map, tiles) clearly charge the final images and constrain the kind of closure available (quiet, internal, textural). A few symbolic echoes (ivy, river, erosion) veer close to overt mirroring but remain effective.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integrated—the mist, crystalline spires, glowing shelves, and shifting tomes all feel tactile and conceptually cohesive. The environment meaningfully constrains action: the way words appear and vanish, and the temporal rhythm of the library, dictate her tactics and reliance on the watch. The atmosphere supports the emotional tone of sacred, precarious pause without reading as generic fantasy décor. The world rules (propagation delays, cyclic reversals) are taught through her interaction with the space rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    The velvet observatory, midsummer heat, glacial ice violin, and potted mulberry create a vivid, atmospherically coherent micro-world that clearly belongs to this character. Setting details are not mere ornament: the observatory as private sanctuary allows defiance of the Archive, the ice violin’s physical nature shapes the time limit, and soil vs glass-case imagery literally grounds the thematic choice at the end. Sensory specificity (heat, velvet, luminescence, clear water on the floor) is strong and filtered through Elara’s concerns. The observatory itself doesn’t sharply constrain tactics beyond providing seclusion, which keeps this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    The skyborne grotto, floating granite, aurora, obsidian veined with silver, and crystalline steps are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the piece’s mood. The environment mirrors and amplifies the “radiant hush” rather than feeling like a neutral room. The aurora’s stilling and resumption visibly bracket the threshold and farewell, charging the final image. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, but it deeply shapes atmosphere and thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    The umbral grotto above the clouds, the ancient yew, the stone basin, moss, and dripping water are vivid, sensory, and consistently filtered through Elara’s ritualistic attention. Setting and object-as-setting (basin, hairpin, tree) clearly charge the final image and embody the rebirth motif. However, the environment mostly supports atmosphere and theme rather than constraining her options or tactics in a concrete way. Description is lush yet purposeful, with minimal white-room moments.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lighthouse, cliff, wind, dawn light, and chimes are not decorative; they shape meaning and action—especially the wind both as Elara’s “instrument” and as the force that carries away the cloak. The setting is filtered through vocation (lightkeeper, conscience-for-hire) in a way that makes environment and objects feel lived-in and thematically charged. The final images of chimes, light, and sea concretely reconfigure the emotional landscape at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grotto, levitating platform, magnetic field, pond, and sycamore form a vivid, coherent environment that is integral rather than decorative. Setting details are tightly bound to action and theme: the magnetic resonance shapes how the rings behave; the spiral in the water echoes the sycamore seed; starlight and hush frame the beginning and end. The world’s rules (levitation, magnetism, reverse aging) feel consistent within this slightly speculative register. Crucially, the environment charges the final image—he leaves the platform with the sycamore’s hush as cloak—so setting meaningfully underwrites closure rather than serving as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    The canyon of bone towers, endless echoes, and layered dust is vivid, specific, and tightly integrated with the premise of resonance and archival memory. Setting isn’t postcard décor: echoes, dust, and bone architecture all shape what’s possible (no disturbing bones, navigation via sound) and directly charge the final image of Corbin as a harmonic anchor seated on a bone throne. The stone arrowhead’s placement into the throne-as-archive is a strong object/setting fusion that reweights earlier details. A slight pruning of ornate description in favor of the most functionally charged elements would sharpen rather than merely beautify.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    The settings—the misted valley, the icebound spire with mercury-waterfalls and frozen laughter, and the cramped citadel window box—are vivid, sensorial, and tightly bound to Elara’s perception. Environmental details consistently mirror and charge her choices: the spire’s impossible stillness stages the keystone encounter, and the humble window box becomes the practical arena for her new ethos. The world’s rules (automation vs ancient methods, places that “accommodate impossibilities”) feel coherent and are learned through action rather than exposition. The final image of the moonflower’s “brilliant dimness” turning her room into a sanctuary confirms setting-as-theme integration.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting work is lush and purposeful: the mudflats, sunken Aethelstan, and drowned library are vividly and economically rendered in ways that mirror Elias’s interior state. Environmental details actively matter—the extreme low tide permits access, the lantern light through portholes literally illuminates the crucial text, and the library’s physical decay underscores the cost and persistence of vows. Recurring objects (lamps, lanterns, key, logbook) and the weathered harbor all charge the final images of him walking back under lit lamps. The only thing holding this shy of the very top tier is slight redundancy in atmospheric imagery, which edges toward ornamental in places.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting work is vivid and thematically integrated: the amber-encased observatory, the crystal dome, and the contracted universe as a “single luminous pearl” all mirror the story’s obsession with preservation and memory. Details are filtered through Elara’s vocation—telescopes frozen in resin, star charts entombed—so the environment feels lived-in, not touristic. The observatory and the pearl-image return at the end, explicitly charging the final image of her as “keeper of the light within the pearl.” The deck doesn’t strongly constrain physical tactics, but as a microcosm of a museum-turned-sanctuary it meaningfully charges her final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory, cliff, dusk light, and crystal prism are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action—the environment literally enables the magic (“only scattered light, fractured into possibility, could weave memory into matter”). Spatial and atmospheric details (stone arches, meridian circle, dust motes) feel lived-in and match the contemplative, elegiac tone. The setting also constrains choice via timing (dusk’s alchemy) and tools (the central stone table and prism), and the final image of him stepping into the “star-dusted night” is charged by having just left this sacred space. A slight bias toward visual detail over other senses is the only real ceiling here.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting work is rich and purposeful: the sapphire viaduct, condensation behavior, temperature specifics, and the silent cove all matter mechanically to the bell’s repair and emotionally to the tone. Environment constrains tactics (she must work at dawn, at a specific rail knot, under certain conditions) and charges the final image as the rebuilt bell gleams “with dew and purpose.” Details feel filtered through Elara’s focused, quasi-scientific attention rather than as tourist catalog; the world’s rules about magic and matter remain internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    The resurfacing town, Midnight Ridgeway, drained reservoir, and slick cobblestones are vividly realized and constantly filtered through Elara’s perception and purpose. Environmental constraints (receded water, slippery bank) and recurring objects (wind chime, bottle, firefly, reflections on the reservoir) meaningfully charge the mood and the final image. Setting and objects clearly function as more than backdrop, aligning with the memory/erasure stakes. A slight tendency to saturation in atmospheric description keeps this from pushing into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    The orchard behind the kaleidoscopic waterfall is vividly rendered and filtered through Elara’s attention, with strong, recurring images (waterfall, silver-barked trees, starlings, mossy stones) that create a coherent, sensuous atmosphere. Setting details are not mere backdrop; they fuse with action and theme, especially when the starlings beyond the waterfall give her the method and the waterfall later shifts to “joyful gold,” charging the final image. Tools and objects (copper lattice, brazier, crystal) function as micro-setting and are tactically used. The environment doesn’t quite constrain her options in a hard way, so its role is more symbolic and tonal than strictly tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    The nocturnal arbor above the clouds is vivid and specific—silverwood vines, frost, star-dusted sky—and consistently filtered through Elara’s pattern-focused perception. Setting meaningfully shapes action when she “uses the arbor itself as a corrective lens,” making environment a tool rather than mere backdrop. The vines and platform also charge the final sanctuary-of-vigilance image, tying world and theme together. Occasionally the descriptive density edges toward ornamental, but never at the cost of clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.5)
    The floating rock dojo, abyss, and rewriting world below create a vivid, distinctive atmosphere that matches the story’s metaphysical concerns. Details like worn planks, moss-carved altar, and wind at the end are well chosen and consistently threaded. However, the setting is more symbolic than constraining; it rarely shapes what Kaela can or cannot do, functioning mainly as a charged backdrop. Strong mood and imagery, but not yet using environment to meaningfully pressure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.0)
    The nocturnal haven and brook are vividly evoked and recur as a charged backdrop, with details like rain-washed stones and “storm-born silence” creating a strong atmosphere. Setting is tightly filtered through Elias’s creative priorities, functioning as a sanctuary for thought rather than a generic landscape. The brook’s “patient flow” and the quiet ground where he plants the seed meaningfully echo the story’s thematic concerns and final image. Still, the environment influences mood more than concrete logistics or constraint, which keeps it just short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    The root cellar as an “echo chamber tunnel” and the house above are vividly rendered and inseparable from the premise; the environment literally transforms sound into the core haunting. The leaf blower, pull cord, and tunnel function as a micro-world whose physical rules (sound swallowed and returned transformed) drive the central act and the fleeting laughter. Details like damp earth, dust motes, and specific architectural features are both atmospheric and functional. The setting’s properties clearly constrain tactics and charge the final image of the house feeling less empty.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    The frozen garden and mist are not just backdrop but actively charge and constrain choice: exile, monochrome light, and the “boundaries of light” all shape what is at stake in leaving versus staying. Recurring environmental details—the frost-ferns, ice-encased trees, mist recoiling and re-embracing—directly inform the guardian’s decision and the final image. The pendant and rift are integrated into the light/ice ecology, so the setting palpably charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting and atmosphere are rich and specific: ember nexus, ashen sky, “frozen bloom” embers, and precise tools all feel integral rather than scenic wallpaper. The environment constrains and enables action—the residual embers, obsidian slab, and frost patterns directly shape the process and charge the final image. Details are filtered through Elara’s alchemical and spiritual sensibility, giving the world a distinct texture. At times, the density of imagery edges toward decorative excess but rarely loses clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and particular—the suspended radio-tower city, abyssal gorge, and overlarge perigee moon all carry concrete sensory detail and tonal weight. Environment and object-as-setting (the fragment on the dial) actively charge the final image: the city becomes a “cathedral of resonance,” the fused shard her anchor. Worldbuilding is economically handled through Elara’s professional lens (receiver model, cables humming, ozone scent) rather than static description. It stops just short of 9-band because the physical environment lightly colors rather than decisively constrains her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ferry and the spectral grotto are vividly rendered, with selective, atmospheric detail (“ancient stone walls,” “constellations Leo had never seen”) that supports tone and concept. Setting ties into action through the radio console transforming into an hourglass and the starlight patterns functioning as a map for his solution, so it’s not mere backdrop. Environment doesn’t heavily constrain his options—he always moves fairly freely toward the right choice—but it does charge the final image of the warm hourglass in his palm. Sensory specificity is strong without drifting into confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    The optical illusion gallery is vividly and consistently rendered, with crystalline apertures, shifting lattices, and later “forests of forgotten promises” and a “river of flowing time” that mirror internal upheaval. Setting details are tightly filtered through Elara’s professional eye, so environment and concept are fused rather than touristic. The loom and gallery space directly charge the final image of her kneeling, gathering the sinew threads in a sanctified quiet. While the setting does not heavily constrain tactical movement, it absolutely structures the story’s logic and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    The benthic city and navigation spire are vividly realized—the “bioluminescent pathways” against “crushing dark” and the crystalflex viewport anchor us concretely in an abyssal environment. Setting consistently mirrors and supports theme (deep ocean vs deep space), and the anchor chain functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. However, the environment rarely constrains action or tactics; it shapes motive and mood more than immediate choices. The world-building is rich and coherent but slightly more atmospheric than operative.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mist-clad atrium at twilight, marble “veined like frozen rivers,” and the pearlescent glow at the end create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that suits the premise. Setting details are filtered through Elara’s role and ritual, integrating environment with action rather than feeling like a catalog. The atrium’s “ethereal fabric” strengthening and nearby artifacts’ whispers rising in clarity meaningfully charge the final image. While the space doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, it does function as a living system whose response matters thematically and texturally.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting and atmosphere are outstanding: the “concrete throat,” salt-thick air, “cathedral of forgotten science,” and the ocean’s “crashing hush” build a tactile, coherent world that mirrors his interior state. The environment is not just decorative; the ladder, narrowing corridors, and especially the tide and flooding facility constrain choices and define pacing. The Phase Transition Array is vividly realized and feels integrated into the physical space rather than info-dumped. A slight reason this doesn’t edge into 9+ is that the facility’s physical layout stays somewhat generalized beyond the main chamber, keeping spatial stakes more emotional than logistical.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    The opal observatory in snow, the crystalline dome, and the hum of the opal-veined surface create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s tightly married to the ritual. Setting details (snow mantle, server glow, opal hum) are filtered through Elara’s focus and mood rather than reading like a catalogue. The environment does some functional work—amplifying the ritual, isolating her, charging the final dawn image—but mostly in a symbolic and tonal register rather than via hard constraints on action. Even so, the recurring alignment of sky/opal/snow with inner state gives the final image real charge.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and purpose-driven: the canyon of endless echoes, tunnel, and bone towers all materially shape how sound behaves and why this location is the only viable site for her act. Details like “fossilized spines of leviathans thrust skyward like skeletal cathedrals” are striking yet functional, charging the final image of towers as instruments. Environment and object-as-setting (the tunnel, the bone staircase) constrain tactics and frame the ending, not just decorate it. A touch more evolution of how the setting pressures her would push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    The underground herbalist garden is vivid and textured—the foxfire mushrooms, hovering dewdrop, and responsive vines create a specific, coherent atmosphere. Setting is not postcard; it participates in the magic (responding to Lyra, exhaling at the end) and charges the final image. The arrowhead-as-seed and the crack in the wall with the phone cord feel integrated rather than decorative. A hair more tactile interaction between Aris and the environment under stress could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vividly rendered and purposeful: the sky-bridge, rusted bolts, sorrowful rows of trees, and granite sentinels all feel specific and charged. Environmental elements shape action—she plays from the bridge into the cables, moves through statues, confronts the monolith entangled in petrified vines—and the locust shell functions as a recurring, world-integrated object. Sensory detail (scent of jasmine, sound of the stream, fireflies like living stars) supports the emotional turn from oppression to renewal without becoming a generic catalog. The orchard’s transformation at the end is both spatially coherent and thematically loaded, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cobalt arcade is vividly and economically rendered as both physical space and emotional register, with the blue tiles and twilight “drinking” light giving the piece a strong visual spine. Environment and objects meaningfully constrain tactics: the arcade’s narrowness, the loose cobalt tile, and the bottle-storm all shape how Kael evades surveillance. World rules around drones and the border feel consistent and are learned through action, not exposition dumps. The final shimmer of the tiles charging the closing image ties setting directly into the thematic and emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting and atmosphere are exceptionally vivid and coherent: forest, mist, wind bells, and the abandoned circus train form a unified, tactile world filtered through a craftsman’s eye. Recurring objects (wind bells, stained-glass dome, halo) charge the final image and mood, even if they rarely constrain physical options. Weather and environment modulate tone and mirror internal change (rain stopping into “misting hush,” mist lifting to reveal a valley), integrating place with arc rather than functioning as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.0)
    The Scientific Poetry Library is vividly and economically evoked (“sonnets calculated orbital trajectories,” “Photosynthetic Haikus”) and sets an immediately distinctive atmosphere. Details are filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a librarian and geometer, integrating environment with character. The scarf functions almost as a micro-setting in the ritual space, especially in the Contemplation Nook under the green lamp. While the setting charges tone and theme, it does not heavily constrain her options, which keeps it shy of the very top range.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and textured—the whispering archipelago, wind-scoured cliffs, the library turret, and the darkroom all feel concrete and sensorially alive. Details like “wind threading through sea caves” and “mineral-stained fingers” are filtered through Elara’s sensibility and support the contemplative, liminal tone. The environment and tools (palette, camera, turret) also charge the final image, especially the descent back into the sun-warmed library with whispers shifting to “joyful chorus.” Still, the physical environment constrains her choices only softly; it feels immersive rather than structurally indispensable, which keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “shadowed nexus” with converging alleyways, ancient oaks, and starlight is vivid and specific, and the environment meaningfully shapes the action—Vega’s position and the moss-covered keystone determine how the lock is revealed and breached. Setting details are consistently filtered through a mythic, ritualistic lens and evolve (the menacing nexus becoming peaceful) in tandem with the central act. The keystone and fracture function as micro-setting objects that constrain tactic and visualize the abstract “lock.” This integration of place, object, and cosmology charges the final image strongly.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is richly particular and integrated: sunken orchard greenhouse, tidal pool, and ring of shipwrecks all recur and evolve in meaning. Crucially, the environment constrains the method—the shipwrecks and ruined greenhouse physically fracture star reflections, making the “broken constellations” possible. Sensory detail (salt, rot, ghost of apple blossoms) is filtered through Aris’s history, so description never feels like a neutral postcard. The final image of shipwrecks as “guardians” and the “mended constellations” fuses place, magic, and emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    The forgotten library, the single high window, and the drifting playground swing create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that permeates the piece. Setting details are specific (decaying vellum, shadow fossil, chipped cup) and consistently filtered through Kael’s reflective body and Elara’s exile. The environment meaningfully charges the final image—the widened swing arc and the trapped shadow echo the cyclical “Return” she names. The only slight ceiling is that the library rarely constrains concrete choices; it is more thematic container than active obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting work is vivid and sensorial—“verdant parapet,” “liquid silver” mist, and the orchard’s heart all feel specific and tonally unified. The parapet functions as a threshold into the luminous in-between, and the orchard returns as a charged space in the promised future blossoms and the final bud. Most details serve atmosphere rather than constraint; the environment rarely limits or forces tactical choices. Still, the recurring orchard/parapet imagery meaningfully charges the final image of the gold-green bud.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prism sanctuary, starlight, and obsidian dais are vividly rendered and tightly integrated into the action—the prisms chime in response to truth, and the starlight’s shift from fractured to pooled directly charges the final image. The net, needle, and crystal environment function as a micro-ecosystem of tools and constraints rather than postcard backdrop. The setting’s atmosphere (cold starlight, moss, prisms) is consistently filtered through Elara’s ritual focus and grief. This is near top-tier work; only a slight sense of decorative lushness in places keeps it from feeling absolutely indispensable to every line.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rain-scoured vault, wet limestone, blurred frescoes, and the henge’s relationship to light and horizon are vividly realized and tightly interwoven with theme. Setting is not backdrop: the fresco of Orion’s belt and the vault’s position relative to the henge are literally how the mystery is solved, and rain/light recur to charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara’s map- and pattern-obsessed eye. This is close to top-tier; the only small gap is that the environment shapes understanding more than it constrains difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    The deep-ocean library is vividly realized—the “shattered oak doorway,” waterlogged shelves, and ghostly anemones are specific and atmospheric without devolving into a catalog. Setting is consistently filtered through Aris’s professional eye (rebreather, dive light, tape, telegraph wires), which sharpens plausibility. Crucially, the snow globe functions as an object-as-setting that charges the final image and directly embodies the thematic physics he’s seeking. The environment doesn’t overtly constrain choices, but it suffuses tone and meaning in a way that feels necessary to this particular story.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “misty courtyard above the clouds” is vividly drawn and tonally apt, with vapor, flagstones, and storm-light all integrated into action. The environment and tools (stones, bolt plate, weather) interact meaningfully with the premise: she has only the storm-window, the stone’s depth versus the rain’s surface-wash, and a literal height above the city whose needs she encodes. Sensory detail remains strongly visual but is specific and purposeful rather than touristic. The setting feels lived-in and thematically charged, though it rarely constrains options beyond the time window.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    The icebound spire, elevator, and clouds are vividly rendered and filtered through Kael’s sensibility; the refracted light and crystalline imagery align well with the theme of beauty in cold and fracture. The goggles and scattered light function as micro-setting tools that materially affect what can be seen and known. However, the spire itself mostly serves as an evocative backdrop rather than a constraint on choice, so its role remains more atmospheric than decisively functional. The world feels rich and coherent but slightly more postcard than pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sky gondola, star-dusted void, specific cloud types, and “dusty starlight” create a vivid, lived-in atmosphere that is both concrete and stylized. Setting details are tightly filtered through Aris’s professional lens (altocumulus, lenticular, fallstreak hole) in a way that feels both plausible and thematically charged. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactical choices in a plot sense, it does constrain perception and options (isolated altitude, no immediate escape) and profoundly charges the final image of absence-as-form. The world-building is just enough to sustain the lyric mode without white-room vagueness or excess cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    The World Tree library is vividly realized through smell, touch, and light, and the setting is fully interwoven with Elara’s perception (navigating by texture, curved bark walls, embedded shelves). Environment and objects (the condemned tree, the hidden book, the coin) all constrain choice and directly charge the final image of her walking away with “the entire sky” in her hand. The demolition context and living-wood atmosphere reinforce the theme of impermanence without feeling like generic backdrop. Any more description would risk overloading, so this is near the top of what the piece can support.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the tarnished brass, slack silk balloons, teak deck, and murmuration of starlings create a strong atmosphere. Crucially, environment and objects are not mere backdrop: the hopscotch board, the starling shadows, and the crystal orb all directly shape discovery and closure. World rules around the aether-lamp and airship feel internally consistent at this length, and the final image of the revived *Whispering Atlas* recharges earlier details. A heavier use of non-visual sensory texture could push this even higher, but as is it’s a strong asset.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.0)
    The frozen library above the clouds, hoarfrost, mirrors, and the ice-domed ceiling all feel lived-in and sensorial, with selection that clearly follows Elara’s priorities. Environment and tools constrain action: she must clear frost to find the prophecy, navigate glacial corridors, and use light refracted through the mirrors and crystal lens to read wear patterns in the gear. The hall of mirrors and the celestial clock form a micro-setting that directly charges the final image of restored, reflected motion. Weather, altitude, and architecture aren’t just decorative; they shape what’s possible and how the thematic insight about light and repair manifests.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and functional: floating rock arches, twin suns, and jewel-toned fruit are not mere ornament but become tools (climbed, aligned, used as conduits for the nebula’s light). The orchard environment and bell, moss, and butterflies all evolve with the plot, culminating in the golden wave of purification and butterfly eruption that charges the final image. World rules (ghost writes in chalk, nebula visible through atmosphere, arches float with humming stone) are coherent and learned through action. The environment constrains tactics and literally enables the resolution, satisfying the highest-band requirement for setting-as-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “hidden lighthouse perched on a cliff forgotten by maps and memory” is vivid, and the text consistently uses environment and tools (steps, lantern room, lens, pane) as lived-in parts of the ritual rather than backdrop. The pane of hush and lighthouse together function as a micro-setting that literally shapes her choices and the mechanism of salvation/ending. Details like sea-mist, “whitewashed stones weeping salt tears,” and the silent beacon interacting with the dusk build an atmosphere that closely mirrors and charges the thematic stakes. It just stops short of absolute top-tier because the environment constrains mood and method more than it forces hard tactical trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the cliffside, shifting cursed orchard, frost, and mechanical birds all tightly constrain tactics and directly shape the solution. Details like gravel crunch, violet twilight, and frost sparkling on branches are sensory and purposeful rather than decorative. Environment and specific tools (altar, blueprint device, birds) strongly charge the final image of ticking patrols as “a quiet promise kept,” satisfying the object-as-setting gate.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ravine, braided streams, and foam patterns are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through his chemist’s and “symphonic” perception, with multisensory detail (mist, mineral scent, wet stone) supporting atmosphere. Crucially, setting is not postcard; the braided waters and foam patterns directly generate his insight and charge the final image when he glances back from the trailhead. The chrysalis on the stone and the returning sunlight on the foam function as recurring objects that reweight meaning at the end. A slight tendency toward overt symbolism is the only thing keeping this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting—the glass orchard library floating above a swirling cloud-sea—is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through the story’s aesthetic. Environmental elements meaningfully charge the ending: the bottled moonlight’s eruption, the glass branches chiming and releasing “prismatic showers,” and the entire library “leaning in” all reweight Elara’s act as cosmically witnessed. Details like the luminous manuscripts as fruit feel purposeful rather than touristic, and the world’s rules, though fantastical, are internally consistent. The micro-setting of the shop (stones, papyrus, slates) also functions as an embodied philosophy of beginnings.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    The desert fortress after rain, mirrored puddles, dunes, coral, and ice are sensuously rendered and consistently filtered through Aris’s sensibility. Environment meaningfully charges the action: tidal pools function as emotional maps, coral-and-ice embody the paradox of preserved remorse, and the final melted drop is a charged closing image. Weather and terrain don’t strongly constrain physical choices, but they deeply shape symbolic and emotional stakes. Description is rich yet mostly purposeful, with only minor risk of ornamental excess.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    The astronomical clock tower and valley of talking grain elevators are vivid, specific, and tightly interwoven with action—the gears, star projector, resonance governor, and the beam of “borrowed starlight” all directly mediate cause and acknowledgment. Details are filtered through Elara’s sensibility as “harmonious choral librarian,” so instruments, languages, and mechanical parts dominate her perception in a focused way. The recurring cuckoo weight and starlight function as micro-setting anchors that charge the final image of descent and pocketed weight. A minor limitation is that atmospheric lushness sometimes outweighs concrete constraint (the environment rarely blocks or complicates tactics), but spatial and rule coherence remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    The moonlit canyon is strongly realized as both physical space and psychic archive, with the “layered sedimentary walls” as a “physical chronicle” that justifies the premise. The environment shapes the method (stone as memory-holder, ledge as nexus) and charges the final image as she looks back at the canyon “bathed in fading moonlight.” The broken periscope mirror works as a micro-setting object, constraining how she accesses the memories. Description skews visual and conceptual but is selective and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: misty cliff path, gravity-inverted grotto, and vigilance-seed fungi actively shape what is possible and how she navigates. World rules (inversion hour, threshold effects, bioluminescent markers) are learned through her task rather than dumped. Environmental details (salt-laced mist, ascending droplets, impossible geometry) deepen atmosphere without losing clarity, and the inversion mechanics directly constrain choice. The setting also charges the final image by contrast when she emerges to an ordinary dawn still carrying an extraordinary interior light.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    The siskin alder grove, moss, ferns, hedgehog, and light are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Elara’s reverent attention. The environment shapes the ritual’s tone and meaning—the hedgehog’s uncurling marks sacred time, the alders’ cracks are her score, and the siskin’s song completes the piece’s final chord. The porcelain insulator and sculpture function as micro-setting tools that constrain how she can make sound. This setting feels specific, textural, and integral to the final image rather than a generic pretty backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integrated: magnetic nexus hum, basalt monoliths, twilight sky, and geomagnetic anomalies all feel tangible and charged with mood. Details are filtered through Elias’s attentiveness and chess-trained mind, so the environment and celestial phenomena mirror his internal recalibration. The worry stone functions as micro-setting/body-object, constraining perception and charging the final image. While the environment does not constrain physical tactics, it decisively shapes perception and thematic stakes, which suits this lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    The workshop, sky, fireworks, and resonator are sensuously rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, giving the piece a strong, unified atmosphere. The environment and objects (clasp, resonator, wind chimes, fireworks) meaningfully charge the final image, especially the contrast between external noise and internal quiet. Details are economical yet vivid—“cold, watchful stars,” “worn stool,” “violent crimson light”—and avoid feeling like generic backdrop. The setting feels both tactile and thematically aligned with isolation vs connection.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    The treetop village and “wildflower hush,” rope bridges, and canopy light are vivid and sensorial, especially filtered through her acute smell. Setting tone supports the thematic calm-in-motion nicely and recurs in the final view over Sylvan Canopy. However, the environment rarely constrains her choices or tactics; it’s atmospheric rather than structurally decisive, which caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and original—gravity inversion, water flowing skyward, floating arches, and the First Tree all feel tactile and coherent, and are tightly woven into action (navigation by water, arches as waypoints, inversion affecting the climax’s timing). Details are filtered well through Kael’s attention as a pilot of this world rather than as a tourist. The environment also charges the final images (inversion waning, arches at dawn, orchard’s memory) and underpins the central concept of resilience as rooted in place. The only thing keeping this below 9 is that environmental constraints at the ending could press a bit harder on his actual options.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “towering labyrinth” of containers is vividly realized, and the port’s mist, wind corridors, and steel canyons are not decorative—they directly shape the investigation and the causal explanation of the collapse. Details like the Venturi effect, vortices, and the “wind…singing the metal to failure” are filtered through Kael’s technical sensibility, integrating setting with character. The final image of sun and “sharp shadows that mirrored the wind patterns he’d mapped” tightly charges the closure. There’s little to fault here; it stops short of 9+ only because the setting, while excellent, doesn’t impose a decisive tactical constraint at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ice cavern and aurora are rendered with vivid, selective detail that’s tightly fused to Elara’s perception—“cathedral of frozen time” and the fissure admitting northern lights are both atmospheric and functional. Environment directly shapes the action: the sculpted hush, resonant ice, and the aurora’s colors are the literal medium of the ritual, and the final image of the cavern “humming a permanent testament” clearly charges the ending. World rules remain consistent and are learned through action (ice begins to sing, amber light unfetters), without exposition dumps. The setting is not just backdrop but the primary instrument on which the story plays.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Serpent’s Throat and Thunder-echo Range are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Kael’s perception (sun-warmed sandstone, hidden aquifer’s whisper, canyon hush). Environment and objects (driftwood markers, juniper limb, gilded flute) are not decorative: they shape his ritual tactics and charge the final images (glowing markers left as testament, the quiet canyon as companion). The canyon’s silence and enclosing stone materially structure the experience of entering the weave and the closure tone. This is rich, economical world-building that feels lived-in and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    The topaz workshop, captured starlight, and crystalline dome are vivid and consistently filtered through Elara’s attention, giving the piece a strong, coherent atmosphere. The halo fragment functions as both tool and charged object, constraining how she perceives emotion and directly shaping the crisis and ending image. Environmental details (vanishing stars, starless dark, then a new star) evolve with the emotional arc and charge the closure. The setting influences experience more than concrete tactical choices, but it’s tightly integrated rather than postcard-like.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway is richly realized, with weather, light, and elevation woven through Kael’s perceptions and the magic system (the aurora’s pulse echoing the pendant and plant). The luminous plant and pendant function as micro-setting objects that heavily charge the final image and thematic field. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choice, it consistently frames the experience as liminal and mythic, and details feel selective rather than touristic. Overall atmosphere is cohesive and strongly supports the piece’s lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    The quartz arbor, mist, frost, and sedan are vivid and consistently filtered through Kael’s focused attention, giving the setting a tactile, numinous quality. Objects-as-setting (frost, prism, glass) effectively charge the final images: melting frost into droplets as prisms, the arbor holding the memory of change. The environment doesn’t much constrain physical choices, but it strongly charges perception and theme, meeting the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    The orchard-in-bamboo setting is lushly realized and specific, with the loom carved from the oldest tree, moss, blossoms, and graying color all tied tightly to stakes. Environment meaningfully shapes the story: the orchard is both sanctuary and fuel, and its dissolution is the price of the message. The amber bead as recurring object charges the final image, and the emerging sapling is a strong spatial and thematic echo. Description occasionally verges on density, but remains purposeful and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    The orchard planet, floating arches, and root-laced mine shaft are vivid, sensorial, and integrated with the conflict—the broken arches are the problem, the mine is the access point, the roots transmit the awakening. Details like glow-moss, mineral-streaked walls, and phosphorescent fungi feel purposeful rather than decorative. The environment meaningfully shapes tactics (he must go underground via specific shafts) and charges the final image (arches casting “shadows of resilience”). It stops short of 9-band only because the environment rarely constrains his options moment-to-moment beyond serving as a ritual stage.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting and atmosphere are vivid and integrated with character—“cataloged the scent of rusted durasteel” and later vines and void create a rich, accumulative spatial and textural map. The green shard and the bay function as charged recurring anchors that reweight meaning at the end. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical options, it deeply colors perception and theme and stays consistent across universes. The final sense of the bay as sanctuary offers a strong environment-charged closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse and lantern room are vivid, specific, and filtered through Elias’s maritime sensibility—fog, brass, Fresnel lens, and the stone cairn all feel lived-in rather than touristic. The environment directly charges key choices and the final image: the dead lamp, moonlight through the lens, and the ledge as message-site all shape what’s possible and how meaning accrues. The sea glass and stones operate as micro-setting objects that constrain his ritual and closure. A minor note is that weather and physical danger don’t much affect tactics beyond mood, keeping this just shy of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.0)
    The emerald lighthouse, storm, and sea are not mere backdrop; they constrain what’s possible (isolated height, need for the beacon, storm as both threat and material) and charge the final images (glyphs in the sand, fisherman’s calm). Details like the crystalline facets, obsidian wick, and etched shadow-glyphs are vivid and integrated into action. The environment evolves with the conflict (stars vanish, clouds bruise, then part) and participates in the covenant-like merging of North Star and emerald beam. Setting clearly meets the “object/setting charging final image” gate for the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is richly imagined and tightly integrated: misted valley, floating rock tea house, sun trails on worn stone, all filtered through Elara’s observant, craft-based gaze. Environment concretely constrains action—the ritual depends on the stone floor, the eastern archway, and patient tracking of light. The final images of valley, mist thinning, and the vanished tea house reweight the whole piece and charge the closure. Description is lush but purposeful, with repeated environmental elements (mist, light, stone, wing) shaping both meaning and method.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stormlit tower, labyrinth below, and ancient oaks are rendered with vivid, selective sensory detail that feels purposeful rather than touristic, and weather meaningfully shapes the beat by delaying then enabling the moonlight. Objects-as-setting—the sextant, the sewing pin, the leaded glass window—constrain what can happen and charge the final image (moonlight through the window into the mending brass, the pin as temporal trigger). The environment is consistently filtered through Elara’s attentiveness to stone, root, and dust, strengthening POV bias. This richly atmospheric integration that also affects outcome supports a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is richly specific—the alchemical orchard greenhouse, copper alembics of “distilled starlight,” mica window, and endless night all feel integrated and character-filtered rather than touristic. Environmental elements meaningfully charge and constrain action: she must work within this greenhouse “sacred loom,” the Heartseed and mica window both respond to her song, and the dawn’s return is literally mediated through glass, soil, and tools. The world rules (mirror world, bound light, alchemical tools) remain consistent and are learned through Elara’s interaction, not exposition. The final images (mica blazing, dewdrop sunrise) strongly reweight these objects and spaces, making the environment inseparable from closure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Athenaeum is textured and specific, with moonlight, dust motes, beeswax, and chained atlases grounding the atmosphere in lived-in detail. The setting is not decorative: the hidden-in-plain-sight library, floorboards, and atlas directly host and shape her ritual and final decision. The environment mirrors and frames the theme of nested paradoxes—public archive with secret core, sanctuary that is both refuge and self-imposed cell. The final images of shelves, doors at dawn, and the moon as a “second, gentler moon” clearly charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tea house and overgrown palace courtyard are richly realized and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with tactile details like moss, ivy, and the dry fountain holding sparrows. The setting is not just decorative; it enables guerrilla gardening, frames the sacred/ordinary tension, and charges the final image of “green defiance” after winter’s sleep. The bakery is also evoked economically through sensory memory, deepening both loss and the bread’s later return. A slightly heavier sense of physical constraint (weather, decay) affecting her actions could push this toward the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    The frozen library above the clouds is vividly rendered and integrated into the action—ice-carved workbench, quartz hush, obsidian screen, resonance analyzer—and consistently filters Elara’s perception. The setting’s chill, altitude, and crystalline stillness all mirror the tension between preservation and loss and culminate in the closing contrast between indifferent clouds and “small salvation.” While the environment doesn’t drastically constrain tactical options, it does meaningfully charge the final image and defines the entire job’s conditions. Detail density is high but mostly purposeful and POV-inflected rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rotting pier and pirate market are vividly rendered—salt, lantern light, black water, mossy pilings—and the atmosphere of “comforting unease” is consistent and textured. The setting meaningfully shapes behavior via the truce of hush, the density of traders, and the looming dawn, rather than reading as backdrop only. Environmental details like the crate of sea glass and the crowded aisles become tools in Elara’s tactics and in Silas’s public accusation. The setting doesn’t quite constrain specific physical options at the climax, but it does heavily condition social stakes and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly particular—lavender bluff, aurora rivers, sentient forests holding elections—and tightly integrated with the premise. Environment and objects function as micro-setting constraints: the aurora powers the ring, the stone circle localizes the personal rain, and the forest’s bioluminescent vote for compassion directly charges the closing realization. Sensory detail (taste, light, weather) is vividly deployed without losing spatial clarity. The final images—the dawn-dimming aurora, whispering spring forest, and her private rain—reprise and reweight earlier setting cues in a satisfying way.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.0)
    The subterranean crystal cave is richly realized and functions as more than backdrop: its calcite “canvas,” pulsing veins, and hidden compartment directly shape the action and the revelation. Environmental details are filtered through Elara’s grief and artistry, reinforcing atmosphere without feeling like a tourist catalog. The final image of auroral crystals shifting from sorrow to “quiet, enduring hope” charges the ending. The cave’s physical properties and emotional history both constrain and enable the story’s core choice.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    The greenhouse city under a toxic sky is vivid and integrated: bruised domes, hydroponic farms, thorny jasmine, the dry basin where the last drop fell. Environmental detail is consistently filtered through Elara’s priorities (truth, water, growth), and the dried oasis meaningfully charges the final realization that honesty is the “deepest oasis.” The world’s rules (water scarcity, toxic air, greenhouse corridors) feel coherent and are learned through movement and work rather than exposition dumps. Setting doesn’t strongly constrain minute-to-minute tactics, but it decisively shapes the story’s metaphoric stakes and ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bluff, cloudline, wind, and kinetic sculpture are vividly realized and functionally integrated: the wind powers the mechanism, the altitude suggests isolation/sanctity, and the ice and bronze materially shape the ritual. Sensory details (temperature, light, vibration) are selective and purposeful, filtering through Elara’s craft-trained perception. The recurring objects (ice shard, bells, vanes) charge the final image when the fragment goes dull and she touches it. Setting is not mere backdrop; it constrains how truth can be composed here.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glass-domed desert rose farm is vividly and economically realized, with sensory detail (humid air, crystallized sap, focused dawn light) tightly tied to action. Environment actively constrains and enables choices: Unit Seven uses the dome’s focusing glass and the desert rose sap to engineer the miniature controlled burn, and later scatters ash to feed the plant that gives the closing image. The final bud of “rose to molten gold” recharges earlier environmental details with thematic weight. A small deduction only because atmosphere, while lush, is sometimes stated rather than further complicated by environmental resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.3)
    The courtyard is richly rendered—bougainvillea, jasmine, cobblestones, wrought-iron bench—and feels like a specific, lived-in place rather than a generic backdrop. The mailbox as an environmental fixture is crucial to the stakes and final image, and the setting naturally accommodates the gathering of neighbors and the bureaucrat’s intrusion. Details are integrated with action rather than given as a static tour. Dawn light and atmosphere support the mood, though the time-of-day itself doesn’t significantly constrain choices beyond tone.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sunken laboratory is vividly realized—flooded lower levels, rusted consoles, pressure gauges, valves—and these aren’t just décor; they actively shape options (the chime as key, the valve as mechanism, the buoy as escape vector). The environment interacts with her body and perception (sediment-drift movement, cold salt-crusted metal, emergency lights) in a way that both grounds and mirrors her internal state. The recurring objects (dice, journal, valve, buoy) are spatially coherent and evolve in meaning, especially the dice and the buoy’s ascent. This is richly atmospheric without lapsing into white-room vagueness or world-rule inconsistency.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is richly specific and tightly integrated: the harbor, the whale, and especially the salt crystal chamber with gravity pockets feel tactile and lived-in, not generic. Environmental constraints (gravity fluctuations, cavern vastness, moonlight fracturing through salt) shape how she moves and what she can do. Recurring objects and micro-settings—the lanterns, the locket, the crystals—charge the final images and theme. A slight overindulgence in lush description in places edges toward decorative, but it rarely stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    The nocturnal haven and brook are vividly rendered and tightly integrated into the magic system (she merges with the brook’s current; the haven becomes a shield against discord). Environmental details consistently mirror and support the internal and thematic states, especially the “terrestrially cosmic” fusion of earth and sky. The final images—the motes kissing the water, sunrise on the brook—recharge earlier setting motifs with a sense of earned peace. The only minor limitation is that the environment rarely constrains tactics beyond providing a perfectly attuned space.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rooftop garden, meteor shower, antique objects, and architectural details are vivid and purposeful, consistently filtered through Elara’s fixation on buildings and legacy. Setting and small objects (sugar bowl, seal, parapet arch) meaningfully charge the thematic turns and the final image. Sensory detail is strong without feeling like a tourist catalog, and the environment quietly mirrors the emotional state. The one constraint is that the setting rarely limits physical choices; its role is symbolic and atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    The garden and twilight are richly evoked through multiple senses (velvet moss, night-blooming perfume, damp earth, dew, peach and lavender dawn) and are consistently filtered through Elara’s emotional state. Setting is not postcard-only: the exact soil where Kael planted the seed, the lilac bush, and the dawn threshold all materially charge and constrain her choices (timing the ritual to the last star, burying the shell under Kael’s lilac). The recurring garden imagery meaningfully reweights the final image—tending the space as an analogue to tending memories. A slight excess of lush modifiers edges toward decorative, but clarity and purpose remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, stalactites, and obsidian pool are vividly rendered and consistently integrated with the emotional arc (drips as time, pool as receptacle, aurora and rose as luminous grace). The environment doesn’t just decorate; it literally houses the mechanism of forgiveness (hidden keyhole, silence, resumed dripping) and charges the final image of the blooming heritage rose. Details are selective and purposeful rather than touristic, with the same elements returning in altered form at the end. The only thing holding this just short of top-tier is that the setting rarely constrains tactical choices; it frames and charges them instead.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    The canyon, serpentine nexus, solstice stone, and starlit atmosphere are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s sonic attention, creating a strong, immersive sense of place. Environmental details (stone ribs, coiling curves, the monolith) are not mere backdrop; they’re integral to how echoes manifest and to the final transformation where “the stone itself seemed to exhale.” The recurring objects-as-setting—especially the shell and solstice stone—charge the final image and directly interface with the emotional stakes. A slight decorative tendency (stars and cosmic hum) doesn’t undercut the overall precision and purposefulness.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glacier shrine and its ice-etched names, beeswax candles, and warped snow globe create a vivid, tonally unified environment that strongly supports mood. The Christmas Eve study in the dream is equally concrete, with tactile, lived-in warmth that contrasts the glacier’s cold. The setting doesn’t significantly constrain physical choices, but the snow globe as a recurring object-as-setting directly charges the final image (the refracted rainbow) and closure. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elara’s reverent perspective rather than reading like a tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.5)
    The parapet after rain, river, moss, and fireflies are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail that consistently tracks with his craft-sensitive attention. Environment and objects (parapet, net, whisk, fireflies, moonlit river) recur and directly charge the final images—the mended net gleaming like stars, the whisk as future ritual, the moon paths guiding him home. The setting feels lived-in and cohesive, not a backdrop, and its atmosphere tightly supports the contemplative, mystical tone. While it doesn’t create hard physical constraints, it meaningfully shapes what he can witness and thus what realizations are possible.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    The radioactive wasteland versus serene orchard contrast is vivid and specific—dew on spiderwebs, earthworms, titanium container, ochre storm—anchoring both world and mood. The environment constrains choice conceptually: the orchard as rare sanctuary makes her decision to protect it weighty, and the storm-choked horizon charges her departure. Setting details are consistently filtered through her investigative eye, not as generic scenery. It could press her physically a bit more (e.g., suit limitations under the storm), but as-is it strongly supports the story.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stormlit observatory above the cloud ocean, the cobalt glass portico, and rain-slicked Oakhaven all feel concrete and atmospheric while staying economical. Setting does real work: the storm’s static and captured lightning shape her broadcasting method, and the observatory’s altitude underlines her isolation and vantage. The recurring portico, catching both lightning and later sunrise, charges the final image and ties environment directly into closure. A slightly broader sensory palette beyond the visual and sonic could deepen immersion, but what’s here is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “feral loft beneath the dunes,” sandstone walls, sea grass, gulls, and sunlit jars create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels lived-in and particular. Setting and objects are well-integrated—jars as a “library of love,” the loft as “cathedral,” dunes as threshold for leaving jars. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain options, but it deeply charges tone and the final images. Sensory detail is rich without losing spatial or situational clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    The drift-ice marina, granite pier, crypt, and lighthouse are vividly rendered with strong, selective sensory detail that feels filtered through Elara’s professional and emotional lens. Environment and objects (ice tremors, ice-locked crypt, lighthouse beam, Chime cradle) matter to the stakes and reappear meaningfully at the end when the marina lies “serene under starlight.” The world’s rules around spirit-born tremors and the Chime’s function are consistent and discovered through action rather than exposition dumps. At times the descriptive richness nears excess, but it rarely stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.1)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen obsidian lake, magnetic viaduct, and ice altar are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the ritual’s mechanics. Environmental conditions (cold, frost, magnetism, the frozen surface) directly constrain what is possible and shape the final image of the crack and moss. Details feel filtered through Elara’s vocation and temperament, not like a tourist catalog, and the setting’s stillness mirrors and pressures her internal transformation. The world rules (magnetism, light refraction, sigil activation) are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    The subway maintenance tunnel is vividly evoked through water, rust, wet concrete, and the cracked pipe’s drip, and the environment interacts with action (algae on the ledge, the shaft, the climb to the street). The lantern functions as a charged micro-setting tool, shaping perception and deeply coloring the final image. The drought-breaking rain mirrors Elara’s internal thaw without feeling purely symbolic, and the sense of underground confinement vs dawn above reinforces the thematic arc. A slightly heavier tether between physical constraint and tactical choice could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.0)
    The shop is richly and efficiently rendered—“vibrant hush,” dust in slanted light, lemon oil, ticking clocks—filtered through Elias’s reverent, guilt-laden gaze. Environment is not just backdrop: the storm outside and the precise shaft of light that reveals the fracture materially shape the discovery and charge the moment with quasi-sacred significance. The clockwork heart and box themselves function as micro-setting, intimately handled and visually central from first to last. The final image—heart pulsing under glass as he steps out into a storm-cleared world—clearly depends on this environment for its charge.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    The "gears-and-cogs" workshop floating on an acid sea is richly realized and consistently filtered through Elara’s attention (pipes "sighed like old philosophers," the sea "hissed corrosive critiques"). The environment is not just backdrop—it furnishes key materials (volcanic glass from the acid shore) and reconfigures in the ending as the sea becomes a "perfect mirror" reflecting a transformed sky. World rules feel stable within this fabular physics, and recurring objects (the Algorithm, stylus, resonator) charge the final images. The only limitation is that the setting rarely constrains real-time choices; its influence is more atmospheric than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    The Chronicle Social Network Archive is vividly and economically evoked (“filtered oxygen and old secrets”) and remains the functional arena for every major choice. The mission patch serves as a micro-setting object whose properties directly shape the climax (micro-etched key, encryption serial, final image). World rules about “deleted” files and hidden directories are consistent and discovered through Elara’s actions rather than exposition dumps. A bit more tactile interaction with the archive’s physical or UI environment under stress could deepen immersion, but what’s here is precise and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice, the gift shop, and the specific mirrors are vivid, textured, and consistently filtered through the peacekeeper’s task. Environment and objects materially shape action: the cliff, roots, ice floes, and mirrors aren’t just backdrops but the medium through which empathy and change operate. The final image—orchard blooming above calmed ice—recharges earlier details effectively. At an elite level, one might want slightly more interactional constraint (e.g., physical danger or access limits) rather than almost purely symbolic pressure, but the atmospheric integration is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Arctic drift-ice marina, skiff among slush, bunkhouse, and aurora are vivid and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility; the ice’s groan in particular anchors both opening and closing. Setting and weather aren’t mere backdrop—they’re thematically fused with memory, endurance, and her quest for the “sound” of endings. The parasol tip functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. The only limit at this tier is that the physical environment constrains mood and imagery more than it concretely constrains her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.9)
    The amber pavilion, sloping vineyard, grafted vines, and distant vacant station are all vividly drawn and thematically charged rather than generic. The specific image of Cabernet rootstock with Viognier graft elegantly mirrors the “mismatched” relationship without feeling purely ornamental. Environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options beyond the missed bus, but it does shape emotional and thematic stakes and the contemplative tempo. The final images of the sleeping vineyard and cottage light nicely reweight earlier details without overcomplicating geography.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.9)
    The desert, murmuring pavilion, and buried kinetic parapet are vivid and consistently filtered through Kael’s ritual attention. Environment constrains method—sand and stone transmit vibration; the parapet can only be felt indirectly; the circle of stillness is literally carved out of shifting dunes. Setting evolves with the action (parapet stilling, pavilion’s hum softening) and directly charges the final image of stars over a humming sanctuary. Minor touches are slightly conventional, but overall atmosphere and specificity are strong and functional, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lavender field and rusted factory are vividly realized and repeatedly integrated, with tactile and visual detail that consistently frames the emotional stakes. The environment isn’t just backdrop: its juxtaposition (ruin vs. bloom) charges the core concept and directly shapes the ritual of gathering and the final open-air gallery. The recurring imagery of vines climbing the ruins and lavender swaying is effectively used to charge the ending’s atmosphere and thematic shift. A slightly stronger sense of how the physical constraints of the site affect specific choices could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    The library at dawn, the chandelier, the oak beams, and even the gutter’s drip are vividly rendered and all serve theme and action rather than feeling like scenic wallpaper. The environment directly shapes his method (the hush window, the chandelier crystal, the architecture’s creaks) and charges the final image of the crystal restored and the library “breathing a sigh of contentment.” The sensory balance leans visual and auditory in a way that fits the sonic premise and contemplative tone. Setting is not only atmospheric but structurally integrated into the story’s stakes and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    The fog sculpture garden, tidal flats, driftwood, and unwatched tapes form an unusually vivid, integrated micro-world that constantly interacts with her goal (the fog literally manifests memory-objects in response to her chalked markers). Environment and objects decisively charge the final image: the garden coalesces into the grandfather’s chair and the glowing markers remain when memory again fails. This is excellent work; the only thing holding it just below absolute top score is that the environment constrains mood and image more than tactical options in a concrete, choice-limiting way.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observatory above the clouds, the bonsai, the Grand Chronometer, and the moon itself are vividly rendered and feel lived-in rather than touristic. Setting is filtered through Elara’s professional and emotional lens (e.g., the Chronometer’s behavior, the moon as “changelessly constant”) and not just described. Crucially, the environment shapes action: the bonsai leaf’s fall catalyzes the solution, and the moon’s constancy orients her stance. The final image of the observatory humming as a “sanctuary above the clouds” in harmony with the moon closes the loop in a charged, concrete way.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mountain hospice room, clouds, liquid sunset, and lavender are vividly rendered and tightly fused to mood. The broken record shard works as a micro-setting object that constrains attention and charges the final image; the room as a “radiant haven above the clouds” frames the scene as liminal. Details generally arise in motion (tuning the guitar, breeze through curtains) rather than as static catalog. The atmosphere sometimes leans toward overt symbolism, but it remains coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory, orrery, and pocket dimension are vividly rendered with purposeful, distinctive detail that suits the tone. Setting is well integrated into action: the orrery’s design and the rune panel are not just backdrop but the mechanism of change. The broader “floating isle of Aethel” and nocturnality are more atmospheric than constraining, but the micro-setting of the orrery functions as an effective environment-tool hybrid. Overall, atmosphere and specificity are strong and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    The secret garden, willow, herbs, and hedge maze are evocative and well-integrated; the garden functions as a micro-setting that hosts the closure and literally receives the tooth. Environmental details (dew, filtered light, specific plants) are selective and thematic without feeling touristic. The space actively charges the ending image as a place of transformation (“Lyra’s Compass”) rather than mere backdrop. That said, the hedge maze’s potential as a physical constraint or pressure point remains untapped—it’s more framing than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grotto, mist, dripping water, and cliffside jasmine are vividly and economically rendered, with sensory detail tightly filtered through Elara’s contemplative focus. Setting and recurring objects (sea glass, grotto, jasmine, village lights) all converge to charge the final image of her ascent toward the village. The environment meaningfully frames the act of polishing as ritual and sanctuary, not mere backdrop. While the grotto doesn’t impose hard logistical constraints, it strongly shapes tone and thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    The abandoned data center turned moss garden is vividly rendered and integral to meaning: moss, rusted racks, skylight shafts, and the icicle pattern all shape her tactics and the possibilities of the ritual. The environment does real narrative work—guiding her path, offering an “altar,” and embodying themes of reclamation and slow transformation. The recurring objects (moss circle, amber pendant, water-etched pattern) charge the final image with layered resonance. This is setting operating at full strength rather than postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “feral nexus,” mist, roots, spiderweb, and light create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that clearly belongs to this story and mirrors his internal search. The seashell as a recurring object is tightly woven into setting and final image, though it functions more as symbol/ritual than hard constraint on choices. Environmental details (web, dust motes, mist) are carefully selected rather than generic, and they evolve with his gathering of hopes. The setting supports theme and tone strongly, even if it doesn’t materially limit tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is a major strength: the verdant arbor, dew, spiderwebs, jasmine, and moss-carpeted ground all feel sensorially rich and specific. The environment is not mere backdrop; dawn light, harvest moon position, altar, and plants actively participate in and respond to the ritual, charging the final image of a restored grove. Details are woven into action rather than dumped, and the world’s magical rules stay consistent. The density of description edges toward lush, but it remains legible and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    The subarctic crater orchard is vividly realized—violet twilight, withered trees, frozen earth—and consistently shapes both mood and mechanics (starlight pooling in the crater, the cold biting at her body). Setting details are tightly integrated with action (kneeling on frozen ground, breath pluming, alignment of roots to cardinal directions). The oldest tree functions almost as a micro-setting, its bark-pulse and later bud directly charging the final image. The environment constrains and enables the magic without feeling touristic or over-described, though the descriptive density occasionally risks saturation.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    The marble cavern, wounded spring, and shifting light are vividly rendered and deeply integrated into action: reflections and fissures literally determine diagnostic method and success. The environment’s physical properties (polished marble, acoustic memory, fissures admitting light) meaningfully constrain and enable Kael’s choices and the final harvest. The seasonal “wounded lull” and chill outside also charge the ending image with emotional weather. A slight tendency toward ornate description keeps it just shy of flawless, but the setting work is elite-level.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    The bronze grotto, snowmelt, and starlight are vividly evoked with a strong sensory palette and consistent tone, and the environment feels lived-in through the shelves of burdens and the lamp’s behavior. Setting details are well-filtered through Elara’s craft-focused perception (whalebone, eaves, carvings). While the grotto mainly supports atmosphere rather than constraining options, the shift from starlight to dawn and the cooling earth subtly mirror the release and renewal arc. The world’s rules are implied through action, avoiding clumsy exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    The loft, rain-beaded skylight, ash blank, tools, and Leo’s objects are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s perception, creating a strong, lived-in atmosphere. Setting details actively charge the final image: the rain’s “here and gone” quality, the kettle, and Leo’s whistle and cup all reappear with deepened meaning. The environment and tools also function as micro-setting constraints—this is a high, quiet loft made for contained ritual, not an abstract stage. Description is purposeful and avoids touristic cataloging, earning its density.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    The kinetic lagoon, mercury clouds, and halted celestial carousel are richly imagined and consistently filtered through Elara’s perspective, supporting the surreal emotional stakes. Setting images like “islands of solidified emotion” and the frozen horses echo the core theme of arrested ambition without feeling purely decorative. The environment lightly constrains action—this can only happen in this suspended, time-thin, cloud-top world—and the final stars and parted clouds reweight the ending with a sense of earned clarity. At times, the density of imagery verges on ornamental, but it rarely stalls comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned spaceport terminal, with its post-carnival traces, fountain, aquifer, and oculus, is richly specific and consistently filtered through Elara’s engineering sensibility. Environmental features directly constrain action: the blocked aqueduct, maintenance hatch, gradients, and oculus light all shape her tactics and culminate in the refracted “liquid constellation” on the dome. The sextant and water become quasi-micro-settings that charge the final image. There’s minimal dead description; almost every detail is in play, even if a few are more atmospheric than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vividly rendered and deeply integrated: the quartz forecourt, rain droplets, and “soundless sanctuary” shape both atmosphere and the mechanics of the climax. Environmental details (petrichor, light on wet stone, falling droplets) evolve across the scene and directly charge the final image of golden, whispering crystals. The sanctuary and crystals constrain her actions—where she kneels, how she offers the fork—and enable the miraculous resonance. This is exemplary world-building at this length, filtered closely through her sensibility as a clock scribe.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    The twilight canal, silent warehouses, and retired barge are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s attention, creating a strong, moody atmosphere. The environment subtly shapes action (she wades into the canal to salvage the sundial, uses the barge as a contemplative refuge) and mirrors the thematic salvage/reckoning. The sundial works as a charged recurring object that anchors the setting and decisively loads the final image. The canal itself exerts more atmospheric than practical constraint, but the integration is still unusually tight for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    The harbor, golden dock under snow, fog, and pilings are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s contemplative stance, creating a strong, unified atmosphere. The dock and third piling are not just postcard details; they matter structurally as the hiding place and anchor the action. Weather and fog evolve meaningfully, shifting from concealment to revelation in tandem with the story’s thematic turn. Sensory specificity is high without losing spatial clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is richly realized and POV-filtered: “frost-kissed leaves,” yew hedges as “silent sentinels,” the koi pond, sundial, archway, and oak all accrue meaning rather than serving as décor. The garden materially structures the thematic map of healing, and specific features (oak, forget-me-nots, sundial) charge the queen’s choices and the final image. The autumnal environment affects tone and stakes, making solitude and lateness palpable. This environment is inseparable from the story’s logic and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    The suspended palace, mist, stalactites, and mechanical world below are vivid and strongly atmospheric, with selective sensory detail (crystals humming, jasmine, smoke-choked machinery) that deepens mood without clutter. Setting meaningfully charges the final image: the palace shifts from prison to sanctuary and the descent into the smokey world below reframes his mission. The environment’s rules (mechanical world can’t sustain physical rebirth) directly shape the outcome of the ritual. While physical constraints from the architecture don’t drive moment-to-moment tactics, the macro-environment is tightly woven into theme and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vividly rendered and integrated: dune grass, obsidian lagoon, black sand, and sea-kelp form a coherent physical and symbolic environment. The obsidian lagoon and black sand in particular charge the final images by tying fire and wound imagery directly into place. Sensory detail is selective yet lush, with scent (“salt, damp stone”) and sound (“lap of water, cry of a gull”) deepening atmosphere instead of feeling like a checklist. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, but it meaningfully charges the ritual and ending.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “city of forgotten fountains” is vividly and economically rendered—dusty basins, stone nymphs, chipped rims, moss tracing constellations—and these details are not mere ornament but active components of the puzzle. The environment meaningfully constrains and enables choices (waiting for moonlight at the Sun Dial Fountain, retrieving objects from specific statues), and the final image of water returning recharges nearly every prior setting detail. Sensory variety (stone, dust, water, light) supports the mood without devolving into cataloguing. This is a strong, integrated use of setting as both atmosphere and mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    The nebula garden is vividly and economically realized, with petals, ionized gas, and luminescent blooms all filtered through Elara’s practical and emotional aims. Environmental rules (volatile gas, no fire, dense medium for sonar) shape her tactics and the form of “light” she can safely share. The gear and petals function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image of a “fireless dawn” and the quiet aftermath. A slight tendency toward lush repetition is the only thing holding this back from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    The greenhouse, dusk light, damp soil, and monarch-filled sky are richly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility as someone escaping stone dust. Setting moves beyond postcard: the greenhouse is tied to family rituals and spectral visitations, and the butterflies’ migration directly informs her understanding of grief’s shape. The final images—the greenhouse as sentinel and the monarchs as a “living constellation of hope”—recharge earlier details and charge the closure. A slight excess of atmospheric description in the middle risks saturation but doesn’t blur clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: tidal obsidian ridge, volcanic gravel, clock tower, and ocean are all integrated into action (obsidian grit seizing the pendulum, the ridge path, the tide answering the clock-strike). Details are filtered through Elara’s professional and ancestral lens, emphasizing time, tools, and sea. The recurring objects (pendulum, rake handle, ridge/tide) explicitly charge the final images and closure. Environment and tool function as micro-setting constraints on what matters: cleaning grit, restarting the pendulum, and carrying the warmed rake handle away.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting work is vivid and purposeful: “velveteen gloom,” cobalt silo, open roof with stars, cemetery soil, and the memorial tapestry all create a coherent, atmospheric world. Details are filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a gardener and tender organizer of both graves and threads, which deepens character while building place. The environment and recurring objects—silo, tapestry, stars—charge the final images (spiral in the sky, spiral of forget-me-nots) even if they don’t tightly constrain physical choices. This is strong, publication-ready setting and atmosphere, with just enough restraint to avoid feeling like a tour.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    The obsidian spire, frozen Lake Veridia, and submerged pines are vividly realized and tonally unified, with strong sensory specificity and a consistent, slightly mythic atmosphere. Crucially, the environment is not just backdrop: the ice shelf, geothermal fissure, and harmonic vibrations are central to the plan and thus to the story’s logic. The final image of the frozen lake shifting from “prison” to “sleeping giant” recharges the setting with thematic significance. A minor limitation is that the setting constrains future action more than it constrains this scene’s immediate tactics, since everything remains contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ember alcove, frost-veined window, and omnipresent mist create a dense, coherent atmosphere that’s both tactile and symbolic. Setting constraints—secrecy in the alcove, muffled radio under a cloak, empty hall with dust motes as audience—directly shape tactics and the final image. The world’s rule of a “story famine” is conveyed through setting detail (silent concert halls, dust on empty chairs) rather than abstract exposition. Environment and small objects (embers, dust, radio) clearly charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Vanishing Point Gallery, the worn floorboards, angled light, and especially the rocking chair function as more than décor—they create a precise, ritual chamber that shapes how the action unfolds. The chair acts almost as an environmental metronome, charging the final stillness; the gallery’s name is thematically integrated without feeling purely clever. Tactile details like porcelain dust, wood grain, and velvet keep the space from becoming abstract. The setting is tightly bound to the final image and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    The sewer tunnels, sunken city, and sediment layers are vivid, specific, and filtered through Kael’s scientific bias. Details like plague ash, flood silt, and compacted clay both ground the world and mirror his methodical worldview. The environment constrains tactics—his work must be hidden, slow, and physically embedded in ruins—without ever becoming static description. The recurring cog and the “abrasive calm” of the deep effectively charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    The velvet library in autumn is vividly realized—dust motes, leaded windows, frost, and moonlight are all filtered through Elara’s contemplative lens and reinforce the theme of "traveled stillness." The setting meaningfully shapes the method (quiet, listening, subtraction of noise) and the library’s stillness becomes a vessel for their shared breath. The rosette functions as an object-as-setting, anchoring the circle and charging the final image. Description is rich but purposeful, rarely feeling like a tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rusted greenhouse, iron bones, dead vines, and celestial light create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that clearly mirrors and pressures the action. The environment constrains tactics (he must prune, clear space, work with decay) and directly charges the final image (“its rust now framed by green,” “no longer looked broken, but breathing”). Sensory texture is strong and purposeful, especially in the interplay of rot, stubborn life, and starlight. World rules are consistent, and the setting’s transformation is central to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is rich and purposeful: “nectar dusk,” the lightning collection tower, obsidian lens, and drone beehive all interlock both visually and causally. The environment is not postcard texture—the unusual dusk and the tower’s lens directly cause the incident, and the tower’s “cathedral of sky and science” identity charges the thematic stakes. Objects-as-setting (the lacquer box, matchbox, paper) are woven into action and closure rather than dumped. A touch more non-visual sensory grounding could push this even higher, but as is, the atmosphere is striking and integral.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    The quiet bay in spring, streetlights "daydreaming," and the Fisher cottage are rendered with strong, selective sensory detail across sight, smell, and texture. Setting is filtered through Elara’s sensibility, and recurring elements (bay breath, streetlights, garden soil, displaced objects) return to charge the final image. The environment supports tone and theme more than it constrains choices, but it does meaningfully frame the ritual and its effect. This is rich, purposeful atmosphere just short of environment-as-active-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    The underwater city garden, Heartstone Spire, bioluminescent kelp, and silt mandalas are vivid, integrated, and consistently filtered through the piece’s contemplative mood. Setting is not mere backdrop: the structural weakness, hydraulic-organ function, and ocean rhythms explicitly constrain method and meaning. Environmental changes (bleached coral flushing with color, fish shifting patterns, stones humming) track with the story’s turning point. The only minor limit is a slight drift toward tableau over tactile navigation; we see more transfigured scenery than how it physically shapes Kael’s movement under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    The infinite staircase is vivid, tactile (“boots whispering against cool, worn stone,” “pearlescent haze”) and functions as a real constraint: there is nowhere to go but up/down and nothing to do but climb and carve proofs. The staircase’s unchanging, boundless geometry directly shapes her tactics (etching on risers, measuring time in steps) and charges the final image where it shifts from prison to “canvas” and “testament.” The dice operate as a micro-setting object, further charging the closure. The world’s rules are consistent and learned through her action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rooftop greenhouse, smog-choked city, and moonlit brush are rendered with vivid, selective sensory detail and clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The greenhouse-as-oasis versus the city’s haze is thematically and atmospherically central, and the brush and saffron pigment function as charged micro-settings/tools. Environment and objects constrain what’s possible (her nocturnal practice, the secret placement of canvases) and strongly charge the ending image. A slight tendency toward lush description over functional constraint keeps it just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    The grotto city behind the waterfall is richly and economically rendered, with mist, thunder, moss-slick paths, and dormant ovens all contributing to atmosphere and action. Environment materially constrains tactics—the silver-leaf growing near the thawing waterfall, the hidden city’s protection/shroud, the cold ovens that must be rekindled—and the final image of the waterfall’s thunder as a “protective hymn” strongly charges the ending. Details are consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility (carvings, oral histories) rather than feeling like tourist catalog. A tiny step shy of 9+ only because the physical constraints never quite force hard tactical improvisation under pressure; they mainly enrich rather than endanger.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is outstanding: the lighthouse, rocky island, low tide, and hunger stone are sensorially rich and tightly woven into the story’s stakes and final image. Environmental elements don’t just decorate—they constrain timing (low tide), provide tools and symbols (mechanism, Fresnel lens, stone), and charge the final transformation of “weep” to “awake.” Details are filtered through Elara’s technical, time-obsessed gaze, giving the world a lived, specific texture. This is publish-ready atmospheric work that directly underwrites theme and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    The abandoned carnival funhouse is vivid and specific—peeling clown murals, candy-apple rot, mirrored corridors—and the environment directly shapes tactics and options (the curse and the entity both hinge on mirrors and reflections). Sensory detail is rich and well-integrated, with smell and texture supporting the “repulsive allure” tone. The setting meaningfully charges the final image: when the monster is gone, the same space becomes “just wood and glass again, silent and sad,” reweighting everything that came before. The opera cloak clasp’s light interacting with the environment (dust motes, warped glass) further ties setting to the central mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating driftwood orchard is vivid, specific, and consistently integrated with action (waves slapping, blossoms torn away, the Heartwood as ritual focal point). Environment and tools (driftwood, trees, mallet, clouds) actively shape tactics and the final image: the circle conducts resonance, the trees are instruments, the sea is interlocutor. Sensory detail—salt air, wet wood, bruised-purple clouds—supports atmosphere without over-explaining. The only thing holding this just shy of top tier is that physical constraints of the setting never push choices as hard as they could.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, strange, and coherent: world-turtles, coral spires, rusted gate, salt flats, and Watchers all contribute to atmosphere and logic. Environmental elements actively matter—the rusted gate and crack are the primary obstacle, and the turtles’ rings and celestial alignment feed her pattern work. The world’s textures (sun glare, salt crust, obsidian Watchers drinking light) charge the final image of her crossing the flats. A slight reason it doesn’t push higher is that the city-on-turtles premise, while beautiful, influences mood and symbolism more than concrete tactical options beyond informing her pattern language.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: ivy, moss, the frozen clock, and the disused station all mirror the themes of overgrowth, concealment, and eventual revelation. Environmental details are POV-filtered (historian noticing parallels between gold-leaf vines and ivy, the station as "witness"), and the recurring ivy/rose imagery clearly charges the final image. While the station doesn't strongly constrain physical choices, it deeply shapes mood and thematic resonance, which is enough at this length and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and active: the drawbridge, lake, mud, submerged pavilion, and stones all constrain options (short window, wet foundations) and charge choice. Weather and water encroachment meaningfully press the ritual, with the final reclamation of the steps tying directly into the closure image. Details feel filtered through his professional and emotional lens (erosion, foundations, mortar) rather than catalogued. The inkwell and stones function almost as micro-settings that charge the last beats.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    The underwater library and sunken city are richly realized through tactile, sensory details (coral-veined stone, bioluminescent anemones, mother-of-pearl mosaic, salt and vellum scents) that are consistently filtered through Elara’s archivist attention. Setting meaningfully constrains and charges choices: the blackout, geothermal hum, pre-Submersion paper, and watermarks all arise naturally from the world’s logic and directly affect her investigative method. The environment returns in the final image (brightening anemones, bioluminescent tendril, “reclaimed stillness” now “woven with truth”), giving the setting thematic and emotional weight rather than mere atmosphere. There is a slight risk of over-lushness, but it rarely stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating island tea garden, glass basilica, and hanging lanterns are vividly and economically rendered, with strong visual specificity and a consistent rule-set for dream recording. Setting is not just backdrop: the ascending island and glass basilica charge the ascent/descent motif and inflect the final image of the cranes. Details feel filtered through Elara’s priorities (her workshop among tea bushes, the basilica’s function) rather than a tourist catalog. The environment doesn’t much constrain tactical options, which keeps it just short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    The floating observatory, wounded Earth, dead systems, and the geode all work together to create a precise, atmospheric setting that mirrors and pressures the internal stakes. The environment is not postcard-like: the powered-down systems and cooling breakers literally enable the experiment, and the vantage over Earth charges both the backstory and the final image. Details are selective but vivid (cold steel, humming latent energy, “wounded and beautiful” Earth), consistently filtered through her state. The world’s rules feel coherent, with the observatory and geode functioning as a micro-setting that meaningfully charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    The observatory is vividly rendered—the stone arches, zodiac mosaics, brass orrery, and dusk light all feel tactile and specific, and they’re consistently filtered through Kael’s professional gaze. The environment actively shapes the story: the meridian line, the specific flagstone, and the vacant socket in the console are all spatially coherent and necessary to the action. The orrery as environment-object charges the final image beautifully once lit. The only thing holding this below the highest band is that the setting seldom constrains options or imposes real difficulty; it is more sacred stage than obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cobalt terrace and forgotten shore are vivid, sensorial anchors with purposeful color imagery (“deep blue tiles drank the fading light”), and the physical descent and return map cleanly onto the inner arc. The shore and driftwood carvings are not just décor; they generate the key object (watch hand) that turns the story and charge the final threshold-return to the terrace. Atmospheric choices (dusk, first stars, “vast, forgiving dark”) support theme without collapsing into generic mood. A slight overreliance on abstracted metaphor (“tides of time”) keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    The storm-worn parapet, mist, wind, and waning crescent are vividly rendered and consistently refracted through Elias’s sensibility, creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. Environmental details are not mere backdrop: the neutral, wind-lashed ledge and shared view of the moon literalize the theme of forces larger than pride, and the final sky image charges the closure. The drawer pull also works as a micro-setting object that anchors his body and the abstract stakes. A touch more functional constraint—weather or terrain actively affecting tactics—would push this toward exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the coastal launch, Blackrock Shoal backstory, Widow’s Point cliffs, and the sea’s sensory texture are all filtered through a professional navigator’s eye. Environment and objects constrain choice: the literal end of the utility poles forces the crisis, and the astronomical compass functions as a charged tool that shapes the ending. Weather, light, and seascape reinforce tone without slipping into generic postcard detail. A slight further elevation could come from even more tactile interaction with the kayak/sea under stress, but what’s here is already very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting work is vivid and purposeful, from the dust-choked archive to specific clue sites in the tunnels, culminating in the underground bioluminescent lake. The environment shapes both mood and action (hidden stairwell, "E.R." crawl space, phosphorescent moss, the lake as the only viable crucible for his choice) and the lake/baseball interaction charges the final image. Atmosphere is sustained without turning into a static postcard, and the micro-setting of light threads both mirrors and enables the thematic transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    The orchard and permanent moonlight are richly rendered and omnipresent, from “moss velvet-soft with dew” to the altar beneath the oldest apple tree, and they directly charge the final image of intertwined saplings. Setting isn’t postcard-like; it constrains and defines the ritual and the exact form of the closure (she becomes the orchard’s consciousness). The sensory details (scented spices, silver fox, frozen-lightning antlers) are selective yet dense and always viewpoint-inflected. The environment clearly functions as both stage and transformed self.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    The midnight glade above the clouds is vividly rendered and tonally precise, with details like “luminous fungi,” “ancient stones,” and the thin, choking air. Micro-setting via the saucer and locket is tightly integrated, and those objects charge the final image (“seam of light,” bridge between generations). The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, but it does function as a liminal, sacred space that meaningfully frames her repentance and ascent/descent arc. Overall the specificity and integration with theme and closure are at a very high level.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    The recycled spaceship, memory sanctum with bioluminescent moss, and dimensional lock all feel tactile and specific while never bogging down the scene. Objects-as-setting—the photographs, Kwan Yin’s tear, the seam of darkness—directly constrain her choices and are crucial to the final image. World rules (her changing gravity, the lock’s behavior) are consistent within the story’s poetic logic. A bit more sensory range beyond sight and touch could deepen atmosphere further, but what’s here is already strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    The black sand beach and active volcano are vividly and economically rendered—ash-dusted trail, obsidian grit, the mountain’s rumble—and they infuse nearly every beat with atmosphere. The environment is not merely decorative; the volcano’s calming is the visible external consequence of her act, and the beach/volcano combination is core to the prophecy and final image. Celestial alignment above and the ground’s texture below bracket the scene, giving a strong sense of place and scale. The only reason this doesn’t go higher is that the setting influences stakes and meaning more than it constrains tactical choice moment-to-moment.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and thematically active: the luminous fort, blackout, half-painted sundial, and cave-moss all shape how the characters act and how the revolution must proceed. The sundial geometry and blackout conditions directly constrain tactics, turning environment into mechanism rather than backdrop. Details are well-filtered through Kael’s professional focus on locks, angles, and silence. The final images—fort sleeping in darkness, silent dawn in its stones, warmed quill holder—are strongly charged by the established world.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: frictionless physics (pebbles drifting, waves like mercury) actively constrain movement and risk, while magnetic boots, sliding children, and migrating villages render world rules concrete. The tidal bluff and aurora are not postcard backdrops; the aurora supplies focused energy and visibly dims as cost, and the bluff physically bounds the restored friction circle. Environmental details (drifting eels at the circle’s edge, wind regaining “gentle resistance”) charge the final beats and reinforce the reknitting of reality. Sensory focus is predominantly visual but thematically apt for a “borrowed dawn” world.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory above the storm, the curved glass, and the darkroom paraphernalia are vivid and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Setting and objects (storm, darkroom timer, clouds as “sea”) mirror and intensify her inner state without collapsing into outright allegory. The environment meaningfully charges the final images—particularly the softened storm and dawn over the cloud sea as she resumes writing. The one limitation is that the observatory mostly functions as atmospheric isolation rather than an active constraint on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    The glass atrium, brook, and sundial are vividly rendered and consistent, with light and shadow functioning as active constraints on the decoding process. Environmental details (the breeze, solar angle, half-painted face) are not mere backdrop but integral to how she works the puzzle. The setting’s tone—serene yet intricate—mirrors her inner state without feeling purely symbolic. The sundial and atrium also charge the final image of unified shadow and departure, though the brook and broader architecture are more atmospheric than tactically constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rusted Carnegie library, twilight sky, and moonlight through eaten beams are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the derelict library under stars *is* the crucible and constraint, and details like the fractured moonlight “mosaic” directly trigger Kael’s luminous-fracture speech. The courtyard earth and industrial skyline tangibly frame the act of planting the seed and the notion of “blooming resistance.” A slight over-abundance of lyrical description edges toward decorative, but it mostly remains purposeful and tied to character and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    The settings—Aethelburg Terminal and the tidal arbor—are lushly rendered with specific, character-filtered images (worn ivory keys, vaulted glass, abalone bark, mercury leaves). The environment is not just decorative: the piano as locus, the arbor’s path, and the embedded compasses all guide action and constrain how she reaches Leo. The broken clock functions as a micro-setting object, heavily charging the final image and concretizing theme. The balance is slightly more postcard-lyric than tactical at times, but atmosphere and symbolic pressure remain integrated with choice.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the Serpent’s Spine ridge, silver-veined blossoms, liquid-gold seed, monsoon air—and consistently filtered through Elara’s practical-yet-awed perspective. Environment genuinely constrains and charges choices: she must climb the ridge before the storm, plant within standing stones, and the ridge becomes a conscious participant whose glow defines the final image. Sensory detail spans smell (petrichor), touch, sound (stone hums), and light without feeling like a checklist. The only reason this doesn’t cross into 9+ is that occasional descriptive density edges toward ornamental rather than purely pressure-bearing.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.0)
    The islet, bonsai grove, post-rain atmosphere, and harbor memory are vividly rendered with strong sensory specificity, especially visual and tactile. Setting details are clearly filtered through Elias’s bonsai-tutor sensibility, and recurring elements like the sea and weather echo his emotional tides without feeling like blunt symbols. The environment, however, mostly supports tone rather than constraining choices; his key actions would be similar in another quiet, natural setting. The ghost ship’s compass and lace function as a kind of micro-setting/tool that charge the central ritual nicely.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, tactile details ("damp scent," "iridescent powder") that ground the abstract concepts in physical reality. The greenhouse acts as an active force, its decay providing the friction necessary for the protagonist's shift. The imagery is specific and supports the mood, though occasionally veers into romanticized description.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is described with heavy-handed personification ("stars that held their breath," "frozen scripture") that draws attention to the prose rather than the place. While the canyon provides a backdrop for reflection, it lacks tactile grit or environmental pressure that forces the character's hand.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.5)
    The winterglass conservatory is a vivid, specific container that grounds the magical realism effectively. The sensory details ("mossy stones," "silver-leafed herbs") are distinct, though the emotional color-mapping occasionally feels like an abstract overlay rather than an integrated atmospheric element.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Exceptional integration of setting; the coral-crusted shelves, whalebone tweezers, and bioluminescence ground the fantasy in tangible detail. The library itself charges the final image, transforming from a mausoleum to a beacon, making the environment indispensable to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is anchored well with sensory details like "sun-warmed tiles" and "violet" dawn. However, the descriptions occasionally drift into "purple" territory ("ghost of celebrations," "kiss the silver bell") that softens the intended harshness of the sanctions context.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sensory details are lush and specific ("moss-veined railing," "scent of aged timber"), effectively grounding the magical elements in a tangible environment. The camera obscura provides a distinct, tactile frame that integrates well with the viaduct setting to shape the visualization of the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is established with vivid, sensory-rich imagery ("obsidian pond," "living willow bridges") that effectively grounds the magical realism. However, descriptors like "dew-kissed" lean toward cliché, and the "hyperbolic geometry" of the hedges is asserted more than it is visually demonstrated in the spatial choreography. The environment supports the tone well but functions largely as a static backdrop for the ritual rather than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with vivid sensory details like "dust motes," "glass-eyed stuffed bears," and "warped floorboards" creating a distinct atmosphere. However, the juxtaposition of the carnival and the high-tech seed vault feels arbitrary, grounded more in aesthetic contrast than narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is visually arresting, with strong imagery like the "skeletal apple branches" and the aurora’s interaction with the water. However, the logic of the "dry" underwater forge strains suspension of disbelief without sufficient grounding, acting more as a symbolic convenience than a tangible place.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is vivid but leans heavily on ornamental description ("liquid jade," "amber sky") that feels static rather than lived-in. While the visual tableau of the station is clear, the environment functions like a stage set for the flower puzzle rather than a source of pressure or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, effectively grounding the abstract theme in the distinct visual contrast between the industrial control room and the delicate glasswork. However, the description is occasionally overwrought ("skeletal consoles," "liquid metronome"), calling attention to the prose rather than the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is vivid ("rust tears," "skeletal ruin") and integrated into the puzzle solution, which is a strength. However, the description often leans into melodrama ("indifferent stars") rather than specific, grounding sensory details that deepen the scene's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established with vivid, if slightly generic, high-fantasy imagery ("granite ramparts," "bruised sky"). However, the environment operates as a static backdrop rather than a force that constrains the protagonist's choices. The "ridge fort" provides atmosphere but does not actively pressure the narrative action.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is established with vivid, specific imagery (“frost feathers,” “ice-locked fountain”) that effectively mirrors the protagonist’s frozen temporal state. The transparent ice violin serves as a strong, surreal micro-setting element that anchors the scene’s sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting relies on ornamental descriptors ("crystal whispering," "ethereal luminescence") that create a static, fable-like stage rather than pressuring choices. The "era after words" concept is asserted but barely affects the mechanics of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and tactile, effectively grounding the contrast between the organic maze and the sterile luck technology. The description of the "emerald curtain" and the sensory details of the garden create a strong, immersive atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory details like the "sky bleeding from amber to deep violet" and the "lattice of copper coils." The environment effectively grounds the technological and mystical elements, though the visual focus dominates over other senses.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.8)
    Atmosphere is vivid and specific, but the scene suffers from physical implausibility; playing a cello while standing waist-deep in water ignores the instrument's mechanics and weight, breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong sensory grounding with specific details like "frost-rimed anemometers" and the "ghost-scent of pine resin" establishes a vivid atmosphere. The setting successfully mirrors Elara's internal isolation. However, some descriptions veer into atmospheric cliché ("crystalline air," "star-dusted sky") that slightly dulls the specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sensory detail is vivid and specific, particularly the "cobalt-blue glass beads" and the "scent of wet stone." The environment effectively mirrors the protagonist’s internal state, grounding the "drowsy alertness" in the physical setting.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is vivid and lush ("ferns sprouting from cracked encyclopedia spines"), successfully establishing a specific atmosphere of decay and regrowth. However, the environment functions primarily as a static backdrop for observation rather than a source of constraint or pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.1)
    Descriptions are vivid but heavily ornamental, relying on adjectival stacking ("dew-jeweled," "sun-dappled") rather than details that constrain action. The setting acts as a passive, decorative backdrop rather than an active force that pressures the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    The silo library is established with evocative, if slightly familiar, sensory details like "aged bronze" light and "rusted ladder." The atmosphere is consistent, though it relies on standard post-apocalyptic tropes rather than specific, surprising textures.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is evocative, using the "granite teeth" and "salt-stained study" to ground the mood effectively. While atmospheric, the lighthouse primarily serves as a backdrop for isolation rather than providing specific physical constraints that shape the tactical choices in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.1)
    The "solidified silence" and "loop pedal" sanctuary offer vivid, inventive imagery that grounds the metaphysical stakes. However, the setting functions primarily as a metaphorical backdrop rather than a physical environment that constrains Kael's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively utilizing the "glass spire" and "mirrored horizon" to anchor the surreal concept. Sensory details are specific ("lavender," "rose-gold"), though the environment feels somewhat static—a stage for the ritual rather than a source of friction.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.5)
    The inverted viaduct and "bruised twilight" create a vivid, surreal atmosphere that grounds the opening. However, the setting becomes fluid and responsive to the character's emotional state ("walls of crystallized laughter"), reducing its ability to provide concrete resistance or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cavern environment is vivid, with details like "hanging hides" and the "audibly muted sanctuary" establishing a strong atmospheric baseline. The mechanical specifics of the drum-etching device—copper wires, needle, membrane—ground the metaphysical healing in a satisfyingly tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and serves the mood well, contrasting the "serpentine alleys" with the "sanctuary." Sensory details like the "rust-colored residue" and "violet-hued twilight" ground the scene effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sensory details like the "violet light" and "silver veins" effectively ground the magical realism setting and mirror the protagonist's internal state. While atmospheric, descriptions occasionally drift into abstraction ("captured starlight," "wicks of spun moonbeam") rather than concrete, tactile interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is established with clear imagery ("terra-cotta grotto," "spiral pattern"), though some descriptions lean toward standard atmospheric tropes ("liquid silver," "hummed with... resonance"). The physical space grounds the action, but the sensory details often feel decorative rather than constraining the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    The "sunken orchard greenhouse" ringed by "skeletal shipwrecks" is a striking, specific environment that effectively grounds the acoustic premise. However, the atmosphere is occasionally choked by adjectival clutter ("chronic hush," "profound emptiness") that tells rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    The "amber grotto" provides a vivid, thematic container that mirrors the preservation of memory and emotion. Sensory details—amber light, static hum, and moss-carpeted hollows—effectively ground the magical realist elements in a tangible atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is anchored clearly with sensory details like the "salt-kissed breeze" and "wrought-iron stands," effectively establishing atmosphere. However, the description leans on romanticized tropes ("forgotten poetry volumes," "tapestry of stars") that border on generic poeticism rather than constraining the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting is vivid but leans into ornamental abstraction ("solidified light," "liquid starlight") that creates a "white room" effect despite the adjectives. However, the contrast between the fragile marsh reeds and the eternal obsidian arbor at the end provides a grounded, effective image for the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and integral, with the "giant's nap" providing a unique atmospheric pressure that shapes the physics of the scene. Micro-details like "frost patterns on a raindrop" effectively filter the high-fantasy concept through the protagonist’s observational POV.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cavern orchard is vivid and atmospheric, with the dripping water serving as an effective rhythmic anchor. The sensory details are lush, though they occasionally veer into purple prose ("wept light"), but the physical space successfully grounds the metaphysical ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmospheric details ("charcoal light," "aged paper") effectively ground the scene, though the specific phrase "sapphire hush" feels slightly ornamental. The sensory work is strong, but the setting largely functions as a backdrop rather than exerting active pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and serves as a functional mirror to the protagonist's internal state ("moss... collaboration"). Sensory details like "boots sinking" and "damp linden leaf" effectively ground the abstract theme in physical reality, anchoring the inciting incident well.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong sensory grounding with specific flora and textures ("samphire," "thrift," "crushed coral") that effectively establish the tidal atmosphere. The setting actively constrains the character via the tides, integrating well with the narrative rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is visually distinct with "selenite forests" and "violet and silver" hues, though it leans toward a generic crystal-fantasy aesthetic. The active element of the crystals responding to the magic helps integrate the environment with the plot, though some descriptions feel ornamental ("velvety pools").

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The atmospheric details ("pale ivory-quarried stones," "sea-green verdigris") effectively ground the story in a specific post-rain mood. The setting participates in the tone, though the "Ivory Harbor" concept feels slightly generic. The sensory work is the story's strongest asset.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, effectively grounding the story in a "derelict" and "legendary" space ("collapsed iron-and-glass dome," "swirling fog"). While strong, the description occasionally prioritizes poetic effect over sensory immediacy, with phrases like "hummed with ghostly echoes" slightly distancing the physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with sensory details like the "salt-laced wind" and the "obsidian" tile grounding the magical elements effectively. The tower and the oceanic imagery create a cohesive atmosphere that supports the tone. Specificity in the environment helps anchor the more abstract magical concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is vividly described with high-fantasy elements ("bioluminescent fungi," "prismatic escondite") but leans on decorative lists rather than tactical constraints. While the "geode" and "library" are distinct, they function primarily as static backdrops for the character's internal monologue rather than pressuring his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the juxtaposition of the sterile prep room with the "deathly vitality" creates a vivid, specific atmosphere. The sensory details—fluorescent hum, aged oak, iron-rich ink—effectively ground the abstract internal conflict in a physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.1)
    While the atmosphere is cohesive, spatial logic is confusing; a workshop "nestled between" bonsai trees implies surreal scale or dollhouse physics that are never grounded. The "blooming labyrinth" feels more like a poetic construct than a navigable space, and the abundance of abstract descriptors blurs orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is the piece's strongest element, with the "labyrinth of shipping containers" and the "rhythm of the tides" acting as effective constraints on the protagonist's movement and routine. The sensory environment is vivid ("moss-streaked," "salt-laced"), grounding the abstract concept of erased memories in a tangible, decaying industrial reality.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=3.9)
    A significant physical credibility failure occurs with the "neckless" cello; a cello without a neck cannot hold strings under tension to be bowed, breaking the reality of the scene. While the atmospheric details of the observatory are competent, this specific technical impossibility undermines the grounding of the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.2)
    The floating carnival setting is visually distinct and imaginative ("salt-bleached wood," "nautilus shell"), providing a strong aesthetic anchor. However, the description sometimes feels like a static list of features rather than an environment that constrains the protagonist's movement or tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.2)
    The specific geography of Meteor Crater and the mechanical details of the chemical trigger provide solid grounding. However, atmospheric descriptions rely on familiar phrasing ("biting pre-dawn chill," "ethereal silver light") rather than fresh sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.7)
    The sensory translation of refracted light into "warmth and shadow" is a specific, grounded detail that anchors the protagonist's perspective. However, the description often relies on adjective-heavy abstraction ("perpetual pearl-gray," "ordered warmth") rather than interaction-based setting details.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid ("rusted outpost," "splintered floorboards"), providing a solid grounding for the brief scene. The condensation on the glass serves as a functional micro-setting that constrains the protagonist's attention, fitting the requirements for short fiction. However, the reliance on adjectival stacking ("crystalline ice dust") occasionally clutters the imagery rather than sharpening it through action.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.2)
    The atmospheric details, such as "ghosts of chamomile and rosemary," provide a pleasant sensory grounding. However, the setting often feels static, relying on standard fantasy tropes like the "ancient archway" and "cobblestones" until the magic activates them. The environment responds to the character, which is a strength, but the initial description is somewhat generic.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    The underwater atmosphere is vivid, utilizing bioluminescence and sound effectively. Some descriptions drift into abstraction ("woven tapestry of stillness"), but the physical environment generally anchors the action well.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.2)
    The atmosphere is thick and vivid, though the reliance on "copperlight" becomes repetitive. However, the spatial geometry is confusing—if the door has been ajar for decades, the concealment of the bodies is hard to visualize, undermining the setting's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    Setting details are vivid ("starless dome", "cracked obsidian"), effectively grounding the magic in a specific atmosphere. The contrast between the frozen fields and the greenhouse provides a solid spatial anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.1)
    While the setting is visually colorful, descriptions rely heavily on cliché ("thirsty sand," "liquid mirror") and abstraction ("scars of erosion") rather than concrete, grounding detail. The environment acts as a passive backdrop for the metaphor of sewing rather than a physical space that constrains the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "catacomb orchard" is a compelling, specific setting that grounds the abstract themes, offering vivid imagery like the "child’s skull nestled in bark." However, atmospheric descriptions occasionally drift into over-adornment and pathetic fallacy ("hopeful anticipation").

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with the chalk codes in the arcade effectively integrated into the plot's resolution. While the description occasionally leans into flowery abstraction ("breath between eras"), the physical grounding of the arcade and the mailbox is clear and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting is established with vivid color words, but the description is repetitive ("cobalt" appears five times). Sensory details are often generic ("deepening twilight," "crimson leaves") and ornamental rather than constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is established with vivid, atmospheric details ("blackwater channels," "damp wood," "sage") that ground the mystical elements. While effective, some descriptions veer into pathetic fallacy ("mud accepting his boots without judgment") that feels slightly heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sensory details like the "watercolor haze" and the texture of the brain coral establish a distinct, albeit slightly romanticized, atmosphere. The setting frames the mood well but remains a passive backdrop; the "mist-clad" environment does not exert pressure or constrain Anahera's choices in a meaningful way.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with evocative details like "gravel softened by centuries" and the "stone-sparrow archway" grounding the scene. However, elements like the "knowledge network" feel like expository flavor text rather than lived environmental texture. The visual of the light developing memories in the fog is vivid and anchors the setting well.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Sound Wave Garden is vivid and integral, acting as a dynamic force rather than a static backdrop. The "hobo nickel" serves effectively as a micro-setting and tool that anchors the fantastical elements. However, the "magical physics" of the sound beam feels convenient rather than grounded in established rules.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, offering vivid, specific details like "damp soil," "nightshade," and "pinned morpho butterflies." However, the world-building regarding the "surveillance drones" and "taxable thoughts" relies on told attributes rather than interaction with the environment. The atmosphere is tangible, though occasionally cluttered with list-like descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.2)
    While descriptions are lyrical ("pearlescent walls," "nacre"), the setting lacks spatial concreteness or constraint, functioning more as a metaphorical white room. The "universe beyond the shell’s curve" remains abstract. The environment does not pressure the character or force tactical shifts; it merely reflects his mood.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the imagery is vivid, it relies on generic high-fantasy adjectives ("pearlescent," "crystalline," "iridescent") that create a decorative backdrop rather than a constraining environment. The setting enables the ritual perfectly rather than pressuring the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is functional and anchored, but relies on generic fantasy tropes ("dust-moted silence," "shadowed corridors"). The glass ink well serves as a central prop but functions more as a magic wand than a grounding element of the world. Sensory details are often filtered through adjective-heavy abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is vivid but rendered in overwrought "purple" descriptions (“shifting coins of gold,” “visual echo”) that distance the reader. The anachronistic clash between "antique surveyor's chain" and a "spectrometer" destabilizes the world-building logic.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and active; the skylight and dust motes function not just as atmosphere but as the causal trigger for the climax. The "pitted chip" and "yellowed ledgers" provide excellent tactile grounding that reflects Elias's psychological state. The environment successfully constrains his world to focus the internal drama.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "drifting prism terrace" is an evocative image, but the setting remains abstract and unmoored, lacking concrete physical constraints that affect the character's movement or choices. The sensory details ("emerald light," "ozone") are vivid but function more as ornamentation than as environmental pressures that shape the scene's outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.5)
    The underwater facility is evocative, with strong imagery of the dome and debris. However, the presence of fireflies—terrestrial insects—hovering over the open ocean strains credibility and breaks the naturalistic logic established by the "astrologer" role.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific, with the "iridescent cave" and "crystal facets" grounding the magical realism effectively. The sensory details are strong, though occasionally the adjective density ("colossal," "pearlescent," "luminous") slows the pacing without adding new information.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is utilized excellently as a causal engine; the specific geometry of the arch, the timing of the tide, and the angle of starlight are integral mechanics of the plot. The environment actively constrains the protagonist's choices and timing rather than serving merely as a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.5)
    The garden setting is atmospherically cohesive and vivid, effectively establishing a mood of solemn magic. However, the reliance on high-concept abstractions ("leached the world of emotional color," "sacred soil") sometimes distances the reader from the immediate physical reality of the space.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Setting details are vivid and specific ("moss-furred dock pilings," "obsidian mirror"), effectively grounding the abstract themes in physical space. The interaction between the mist, the prism atrium, and the dawn light creates a strong, cohesive atmosphere. The environment actively participates in the protagonist's ritual, functioning as more than just a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is vivid but functions primarily as a pathetic fallacy ("compassionate moonlight") to mirror the protagonist's feelings. While the imagery is consistent, it lacks tactile interaction that constrains the character's choices. The environment feels like a backdrop for thought rather than a physical space with resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.1)
    The grotto is vividly realized with sensory specifics ("liquid gold," "abalone shells") that establish a cohesive atmosphere. The setting effectively anchors the ritualistic tone and provides the tools for the method.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    The atmospheric details of the ruin ("ghost of a slammed door," "black mouth of ash") are evocative and ground the scene well. However, the "climate shifts" backdrop remains a generic tag without influencing the immediate physical constraints or choices in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is established with vivid, if slightly generic, high-fantasy imagery ("obsidian," "ancient stones"). The "prism parapet" serves as a functional tool that anchors the magic visually. However, the environment acts largely as a passive stage for the protagonist's success rather than a source of constraint or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    The physical elements—heat, limestone, obsidian-like wood—create a solid atmospheric baseline. The "Iron Peaks" and "Sunken Coast" feel like generic fantasy placeholders, lacking specific cultural texture that would deepen the stakes of the treaty.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    The salt flat is vividly realized and actively constrains the protagonist's search for the "perfect star" of cracks, grounding the abstract goal. While the atmosphere is strong, descriptors like "impossible blue" and "weathered steel" lean on generic imagery that slightly dulls the specific texture of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "silver courtyard" and "prism sanctuary" are established with vivid, specific sensory details ("crushed pearls," "mercury-hued") that ground the magical realism. The setting effectively establishes the atmosphere, though the description occasionally prioritizes ornamentation over interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.5)
    The decommissioned radar dome is an effective, integrated setting that mirrors the protagonist’s internal shift from broadcasting to listening. The environment actively supports the theme, though the narration tends to explicitly decode the symbolism ("not emptiness; it was the dome’s original purpose") rather than letting it resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is vivid but leans into "purple" description ("diamond dew," "starlight blossoms") that feels more like stage dressing than a lived-in environment. While the moss and wind are used functionally, the "cloud-grass" and grotto feel somewhat generic in their fantasy aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting of the glacial sanctum is vivid and atmospheric, integrating well with the rope and light mechanics. The sensory details ("liquid dawn," "whisper of fiber") establish a strong tone, though the description occasionally drifts into static reverence rather than interacting dynamically with the character's struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.4)
    Strong sensory anchors in the bunker (pine sap, grimy window) ground the opening, but the climax drifts into generic abstraction ("luminous sand," "clockwork sparrow"). The shift to the dream state unmoors the reader from the gritty physical reality established early on.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.7)
    The atmospheric details ("dust-scented night air," "indigo sky," "mudbrick bones") effectively ground the scene in a specific place and time. The ziggurat setting provides necessary context for the action, though the "reimagined" aspect remains slightly abstract and visual rather than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.2)
    The "soundless sanctuary" is an interesting concept, but its rules are inconsistently applied; characters "speak" via thoughts, yet the sensory details of sound (rasping, mother's voice) muddy the constraint. The setting feels like an abstract "white room" filled with shifting special effects rather than a grounded place that pressures the characters’ choices.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    The atmospheric details are vivid ("skeletal pear tree," "tweezers of polished bone"), establishing a strong mood. However, the setting acts largely as set-dressing rather than a source of pressure; the "ancient spirit" of the orchard cooperates too easily. The sensory work is high-quality but feels static, supporting a tableau rather than driving a scene.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific imagery ("sunlight fractured by a thousand blossoms," "skeletal rafters"). The quartz-eye perspective adds a unique textural layer to the description, though the atmosphere remains somewhat static and does not significantly pressure the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid, with the "astral orchard" providing a strong, if slightly purple, backdrop. The reflection in the sanitation module's steel sink serves as a strong micro-setting that grounds the ethereal concepts in physical reality. The contrast between the sterile habitat and the organic/magical orchard works well to frame the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is atmospheric and lyrical ("grammar in the grooves," "syntax of shadow"), effectively supporting the magical realism tone. However, the imagery leans heavily on abstract metaphors that occasionally distance the reader from physical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is atmospheric and distinct, with the fog and decaying carnival ship effectively mirroring Lyra’s internal state. The distortion of the ship’s features (fractured mirrors, fading candy cart) actively pressures the protagonist, making the environment integral to the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with specific, tactile details ("scent of oil and aged timber," "colossal brass gears") that ground the magical elements in a physical reality. The clock tower and the ceremonial rope are integrated well into the action, acting as necessary tools rather than just backdrop. The atmosphere successfully evokes the "cathedral of measured time."

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sensory details like "whispering boots" and "shrieking light" effectively ground the high-concept setting in physical experience. The specific focus on acoustic topography ("frozen history," "sonic stress") is vivid and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.5)
    The glass pavilion is a vivid, atmospheric setting that effectively anchors the story's tone. Details like the "glass humming," "obsidian dais," and "shimmering walls" create a strong sensory texture. The setting functionally constrains the action by dictating the timing and placement of the prism, integrating well with the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and central to the concept, with "solidified fog" and "obsidian balcony" creating a strong, if slightly ornamental, atmosphere. The environment successfully pressures the protagonist's isolation, though the mechanics of the "solid fog" remain somewhat vague beyond their visual impact. The sensory details are rich but occasionally crowd the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vividly rendered through the protagonist’s unique fireworks-designer lens, grounding the abstract quest in concrete sensory details like "lapis and terracotta." The environment actively creates the obstacle (darkness) and the solution (the mosaic), integrating well with the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is anchored with vivid, sensory details ("damp stone etched with spirals," "faint, glistening trails") that ground the scene. However, the descriptions occasionally drift into "purple" territory ("dusted with cold, unwavering stars"), distancing the reader with stylistic excess.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is imaginative and vivid, with the "cloud sea" and "gravity inversion" providing a strong atmospheric anchor. Specificity is high, though it occasionally drifts into ornamental description ("honeyed light," "blooming starlight") rather than tactical constraints. The gravity shift is well-integrated as a physical reality that shapes the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is vivid and established early ("liquid light," "prism terrace"), creating a consistent atmosphere. However, the descriptions verge on purple prose ("cerulean vastness") and the environment functions largely as a static backdrop for the lesson rather than an active force constraining tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.3)
    The specific mechanic of peeling paint layers to reveal history provides a strong, tactile focus for the setting. However, descriptors like "liquid light," "silent symphony," and "cool silk" lean into generic purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is evocative but leans on heavy adjective modification ("ashen charcoal," "cold, indifferent") rather than sensory precision. While the "ash" motif is consistent, the descriptions often drift into interpretation ("monument to deliberate solitude") rather than observation.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is visually vivid but relies on generic "wonder" tropes ("swirling aurora," "pulsing like a captured nebula") that lack tactile grounding. While the mushroom farm provides a backdrop, it functions more as a passive stage for the magic system than a pressure-cooker environment that constrains the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.5)
    The atmospheric consistency is strong, effectively using a "sepia" and "golden" palette to establish a nostalgic, heavy mood. Specific details like the "faded celestial maps" and the "silent gramophone" anchor the scene well. The setting successfully mirrors the protagonist’s internal state of suspended anticipation.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively using "crushed pearl" and "phosphorescent moss" to establish a distinct mood. However, the description sometimes veers into the ornamental, functioning more as a lush backdrop than a source of constraint or resources that force specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.3)
    The setting is established with specific, atmospheric details ("dying fluorescent tube," "metal shelves") that ground the scene well. While the description occasionally leans into romanticized pathetic fallacy ("room held its breath"), the environment effectively mirrors the themes of silence and preservation. The physical space feels lived-in and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting contains vivid visual elements ("auric lagoon," "ironwood grove"), but they feel like a collection of disparate aesthetic concepts rather than a cohesive world. The "ancient oaks" and "moss-covered stones" clash tonally with the sci-fi elements of satellites and data streams without a unifying texture.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is visually distinct but leans on high-fantasy adjectives ("bioluminescent," "radiant") and standard tropes like glowing crystals. While the environment reacts to the character, the description feels ornamental rather than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric ("ashen skyborne arbor") but remains largely ornamental; it provides a backdrop rather than constraining Elara's choices. The "hush" and "arbor" set a mood but do not exert pressure on the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.4)
    Atmospheric details like the "soft ticking" and "obsidian pool" are vivid, though the geography (waterfall beneath a greenhouse) feels like dream logic. The setting supports the tone but doesn't rigorously constrain the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.2)
    The foundry setting is established with vivid sensory details ("liquid obsidian," "rain-washed cobblestones"), though the atmosphere leans heavily on abstract telling ("profound silence," "sanctity"). The physical space is visualized, but the reliance on "luminous" descriptors flattens the specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is evocative, with sensory details like "obsidian cliffs" and "moss-cushioned ledge" effectively establishing a lyrical atmosphere. The acoustics of the gorge are integrated into the action, though the environment functions mostly as a backdrop rather than an active constraint on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "ultraviolet forest" provides vivid imagery ("swirling indigo fractals"), but the setting functions largely as atmospheric wallpaper until the final beat. The UV constraint does not significantly pressure the character's physical tactics or choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.0)
    The "alchemist’s market" is imaginative and visually distinct, providing a strong atmospheric backdrop. However, descriptions often lean into ornamental listing ("moth wings," "comet dust") rather than constraining the character's choices. The setting decorates the scene but rarely exerts pressure on the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    The fluorescent light serves as an excellent functional constraint, integrating the setting directly into the plot mechanics as a timer for the supernatural. While this is strong, the description elsewhere leans heavily on generic atmospheric tropes ("dust-choked sanctuary," "sickly greenish glow") rather than fresh, specific detail.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    The "glass orchard library" is a vivid, imaginative conceit that effectively grounds the abstract action. While the imagery is strong, the setting occasionally feels static, serving as a backdrop for the magic system rather than a source of physical resistance or unexpected constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    The baroque setting is vivid and functional, effectively integrating the "weeping angels" and "ornate mirrors" into the plot mechanics. The atmosphere of "visible time" and "gilded cherubs" supports the tone well, though the description is occasionally heavy.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting is atmospherically described ("singing granite," "roots cradled forgotten stones") but functions largely as a passive backdrop. The environment facilitates the ritual rather than offering resistance or constraining Kael's choices in a meaningful way.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sensory details are vivid and specific ("obsidian water," "cold brass," "flowstone walls"), effectively grounding the surreal elements. The environment actively contributes to the "resonant hush" and supports the mood of the pilgrimage.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.3)
    Setting details are vivid and specific ("granite rib," "whalebone frame"), creating a distinct atmosphere. However, the environment functions more as a static backdrop for reflection than a source of active pressure, and the "magic lantern slide" feels somewhat impractical for the survival context.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    The amber pavilion and etched glass provide distinct visual anchors that focus the scene. However, sensory details often lean into abstraction ("gentle insistence," "nostalgic glow") rather than concrete grounding. The setting effectively enables the resolution mechanism, even if the descriptions are occasionally flowery.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the "celestial library" and "obsidian lagoon" offering vivid, distinct atmospheres. Sensory details like "ink stains," "violet sky," and "salt and fear" ground the reader effectively, though the description occasionally veers into the ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sensory details are vivid and specific ("scent of pine resin," "thump-thump-thump of rice paper"), effectively grounding the abstract theme in tangible history. The environment actively informs the protagonist's mental journey, though the "internal light" image at the end drifts slightly into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, effectively grounding the "listening stone" concept in sensory details like "mossy stones" and "damp earth." The setting actively participates in the theme and constraints, providing a vivid backdrop for the internal action.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is vivid and atmospherically consistent, anchoring the reader in the "icebound atrium." However, the description occasionally drifts into static "purple" prose ("glittering like captured constellations") rather than interacting causally with the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmospheric details are strong, particularly the auditory imagery of "ice crystals tapping like distant chimes." The setting feels distinct and grounded, effectively supporting the "solstice hush" tone, though the spatial relationship between the bell and the instruments is slightly vague.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.6)
    Atmosphere is established with some success ("warm amber glow," "cold elegance"), creating a consistent mood of solitude. However, the setting remains largely abstract—a backdrop for contemplation rather than a tangible environment that constrains the protagonist’s actions. The specific mechanics of the "overlooked era" or the station's technology are glossed over in favor of poetic generalization.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific imagery ("skeletal apiaries," "brittle ghosts of lavender"). The atmosphere is cohesive, though occasionally dips into purple prose ("fragile scar of green memory"). The environment effectively mirrors the theme of preservation amidst decay.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific, with the "emerald silo" and "brass ribs" grounding the abstract concepts. The atmosphere of the garage sale effectively contrasts mundane commerce with the high-concept sci-fi elements.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.8)
    Descriptions are vivid but lean heavily into ornamental &quot;purple&quot; phrasing (&quot;liquid obsidian&quot;) that distances the reader. The introduction of a &quot;drake&quot; feather with mythical properties feels like an ungrounded genre shift within a realist shoreline setting.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and integral, with the "living stone pillars" and "copper-veined patterns" grounding the fantasy elements effectively. The sensory details ("warmth blooming," "soft click") do excellent work in establishing the orchard's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is established with vivid, atmospheric details ("obsidian stones," "blooming lilac"), effectively grounding the scene. However, the descriptions occasionally veer into "purple" territory, and the sensory details often feel decorative rather than constraining the characters' tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is vivid and integral to the premise ("blooming jetty," "sea lavender"), though the description occasionally leans into purple prose ("defiantly cradling," "groaning planks") that prioritizes atmosphere over momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong atmospheric grounding in the "wild hush" and "skeletal vehicles" creates a vivid, consistent backdrop. The sensory focus on the leaf and cylinder anchors the scene well, though the "poisoned landscapes" feel slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.3)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with specific, vivid imagery like starlight "smeared across minutes like ink on wet paper" effectively grounding the anomaly. The "gilded compass rose" and the distorted starfield serve as solid physical anchors that mirror the thematic focus. However, the "echoed silence" is a slightly abstract descriptor that tells rather than shows the station's void.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting is established with vivid, if slightly generic, high-fantasy imagery ("icebound spire," "acidic green"). The "wrong sky" serves as an effective visual anchor for the stakes. However, the environment functions more as a static backdrop for symbols than a physical space that constrains the character's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "whispering gallery" is well-integrated as a functional tool for the story's mechanics, grounding the sound-based magic. However, descriptors like "skeletal streets" and "sunlight bled through fractures" lean on generic post-apocalyptic imagery. The setting supports the mood effectively but feels more like a stage set for the ritual than a lived-in environment exerting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is atmospheric, with "towering canyons" and "chasms of poetry" effectively establishing the magical tone. While the imagery is vivid, it leans on standard "magical library" tropes without specific, tactile constraints that force unique tactical choices beyond the ritual itself. The environment serves as a backdrop rather than an active pressure cooker for the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmospheric description of the frozen village is the story's strongest element, with vivid images like the "ghostly cloud" of flour and "scattered diamonds" of rain effectively grounding the fantastical premise. The setting details reinforce the theme of stasis, though the "platinum labyrinth" feels somewhat disconnected from the rustic village aesthetic. The sensory environment successfully creates a mood of suspended anticipation.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "towers of bone" and "ossuary labyrinth" provide a distinct, evocative visual anchor. However, the setting primarily serves as a passive backdrop for the acoustic plot device rather than forcing difficult tactical decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, grounding the fantasy in "tortured brass" and an "emerald acid sea." The specific detail of matching the sparrow's fractures to the statue's pockmarks adds excellent tactile texture.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sensory details are vivid but lean heavily on romanticized clichés ("liquid starlight," "perfect stillness") that feel like a generic fantasy set-piece. The setting serves as a passive backdrop for the epiphany rather than a source of friction or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting is obscured by "purple prose" ("cerulean sentinel," "bruised purple dawn") that draws attention to the writer rather than the world. While sensory details are present, they prioritize ornamental adjectives over grounding physics or spatial clarity. The lighthouse functions as a postcard backdrop rather than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sensory details like "scent of rosin" and "verdigris" effectively ground the surreal premise. The physical setting participates in the ritual, though descriptors like "indifferent stars" lean toward generic pathetic fallacy.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "hanging orchard" is realized with vivid, specific details like "rain-slicked stones" and trees growing "horizontally," grounding the reader effectively. While atmospheric, the setting functions primarily as a backdrop rather than a source of active pressure or constraint on the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.1)
    Atmosphere is the story’s strongest asset, with specific sensory details like the "opal dock" and "salt-stained logbooks" grounding the abstract themes. The setting actively frames the mood, though the focus remains visual and textural rather than constraining the protagonist's physical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, offering vivid, atmospheric details ("phosphorescent fungi," "ghost orchids") that ground the quest. While the "glowing cave" imagery leans toward genre tropes, the sensory execution is immersive and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sensory details are vivid and consistent with the high-fantasy genre ("sapphire archway," "cobalt grotto"), establishing a clear atmosphere. However, specific required descriptors like "lacy menace" are inserted awkwardly, functioning as ornamental labels rather than organic elements of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sensory details are vivid ("warm stone," "violet bleeding"), establishing a clear atmosphere. However, the setting remains a passive backdrop that facilitates the ritual rather than providing constraints or distinct environmental pressures that force tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sensory details are the story’s strength, with the pine grooves and birch scroll providing necessary tactile grounding. The physical link between the scroll and the specific tree outside effectively anchors the prop in the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the "liquid time" of the water clocks and the "fog blurring the street" effectively creating a cohesive atmosphere. The constraint of the fog forcing reliance on tactile memory ("wear patterns on the brass") is a specific, grounded detail that enriches the scene. The sensory details of the shop integrate well with the protagonist's altered perception.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is established with vivid sensory details ("disc of ancient granite," "bruised violet") that effectively ground the fantasy elements. While atmospheric, the environment leans into standard lyrical fantasy tropes ("prayer flags," "floating rock") without adding specific, gritty texture to distinguish the world.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the "cathedral" archive and the "aching hush" of the orchard effectively grounding the mood. The sensory details—dust, cracked leather, cold crystal—create a tangible atmosphere that supports the ethereal subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    The "softcover dictionary" (line 2) provides excellent tactile grounding against the more generic "crystalline arches" and "star-dusted periphery." The setting effectively mirrors the internal journey, though the cosmic imagery leans toward familiar genre abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is active and integral; the horizon, the specific "razor edge" of the light, and the hydraulic mechanics constrain the protagonist's focus and fuel the realization. The transition from the "surgical" line to the "watercolor wash" mirrors the internal shift perfectly. Atmosphere is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific details ("Mycena chlorophos," "woven mycelium") that ground the sci-fi premise. However, the description sometimes drifts into purple prose ("cathedral of release") and treating the environment as a static set-piece for the metaphor rather than a source of dynamic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sensory details are consistent and establish a cohesive atmosphere ("damp wool," "mica pane"). The setting specifically constrains the climax, as the "sealed-off" station section necessitates the use of the lantern, integrating environment with action effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmospheric and specific ("dripping pipes," "captured moonlight"); the surreal setting is the story's strongest asset, successfully grounding the fable-like tone in concrete sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is vivid and firmly anchored, effectively grounding the ritual in a specific place and time. However, the description leans toward overwriting ("fragrant waterfall," "salt-kissed," "violet and deep indigo"), occasionally prioritizing atmospheric density over narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is vivid but leans into purple prose ("sunlight fractured through centuries," "time pooled like spilled ink") that calls attention to the writing rather than the place. The timeline of "centuries of emerald vines" strains credibility for a "disused railway station" unless the genre is high fantasy, which conflicts with the logistician persona.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.5)
    The ultrasonic forest is the strongest element, with specific sensory details like the "granite’s grit" and the translation of topography into music ("dewdrop's *ping*"). However, the setting operates largely as a pathetic fallacy, perfectly mirroring her internal state and offering no resistance, which flattens the atmosphere into a supportive backdrop rather than a distinct place.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    The "gravitational anomaly" is atmospheric ("spacelled ink"), and the pen is described with excellent specificity ("iridescent void-metal"). However, the setting primarily serves as a passive backdrop for reflection rather than an active pressure cooker. The "Weaver's Loom" appears late as a metaphor-turned-object, which slightly destabilizes the established reality.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.9)
    The setting is established with heavy adjectival stacking ("pearl-bright," "liquid silver," "salt-kissed") that creates a generic romanticized atmosphere rather than a specific, lived-in environment. While visual, the sensory details feel decorative and "purple," failing to constrain the character's choices or create necessary atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with specific details like the "crushed abalone shell" and "collapsed shelf" grounding the scene. While the descriptions effectively guide the protagonist's path, some phrasing verges on decorative rather than strictly functional for the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "sound wave garden" and "auric lagoon" are established with vivid, multisensory imagery that actively constrains the method (drumming on specific textures). The setting is integral to the plot mechanics, as the environment itself is the instrument. The atmosphere is lush, though it occasionally drifts into "white room" territory where the physical constraints of the Institute outside the garden feel vague.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory details like "rust-streaked" containers and the "emerald and violet" storm. However, the "acoustic triangle" and "whispering gallery" feel like stage props designed solely for the solution rather than organic parts of a working port. The atmosphere is cohesive but leans heavily on adjectival stacking ("metallic void," "violent ribbons").

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is established with vivid, albeit heavy, imagery ("cobalt paint," "profound azure"). However, the spatial geometry of the climax (using warehouse shutters to frame a specific star for an observer on a dock) is confusing and lacks grounding. The atmosphere is consistent but static, prioritizing description over interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.9)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with the "cobalt library" and "clinging morning mist" creating a consistent, dreamlike mood. However, the reliance on adjective-heavy description ("deep twilight blue," "star-dusted dome") occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.2)
    Descriptions are vivid and colorful ("emerald shards," "silver-leafed palms"), effectively establishing a dreamlike atmosphere. However, the reliance on visual splendor occasionally drifts into "postcard" territory, and the physics of the underwater sequence are glossed over for convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    The wind turbines providing a sweeping shadow that cloaks the table is a strong, dynamic environmental detail that interacts with the action. However, the "dust motes" and "kitchen heavy with absence" are somewhat generic markers of grief that lack the specificity of the turbine imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is visually evocative ("cobalt walls," "quartz colonnade") but functions as static ornamentation rather than a source of pressure or constraint. The "lantern-moth hush" establishes atmosphere but repeats verbatim, and the environment yields instantly to the protagonist's will without offering resistance or defining the tactics used.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.4)
    Atmosphere is established with adjectives, but physical logic wavers; "shards of molten glass" is a contradiction (shards imply solid, molten implies liquid) and "molten" glass among green shoots would burn them, breaking verisimilitude. The setting serves as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraints or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "Laboratory of Lost Sounds" is a compelling concept, and the "miner’s carbide lamp lens" offers a grounding, specific detail. However, the setting is often obscured by heavy-handed descriptions like "liquid amber" and "cathedral of absence" rather than lived-in sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    The observatory setting is anchored well, and the bioluminescent fungi offer a distinct visual payoff. However, the literalization of "curtains of intention" as actual velvet drapes feels forced and lowers the immersive quality of the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sensory specificity is a strength, with details like "mineral tang of onyx ink" and "metallic whisper" grounding the concept in a tactile reality. However, the setting remains a static backdrop that illustrates the theme rather than exerting pressure on the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.0)
    The "bronze prism pagoda" and the "atoms of nostalgia" offer vivid, specific imagery. However, the broader "lost civilization archive" feels somewhat generic ("silence was a physical presence"), and the sensory details primarily reside within the magical memories rather than the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "Blooming Library" is visually evocative but relies on familiar high-fantasy tropes ("woven light," "shelves that breathed") that distance the reader. The setting functions as a static backdrop for the theme rather than a pressurized environment that constrains the character’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is established with vivid, if flowery, sensory details ("scent of drying lavender," "cool mist"). While atmospheric, the environment functions mostly as a backdrop/mood enhancer rather than a constraint that forces specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sensory details like the frosted hourglass and coffee ring are vivid and anchor the scene effectively. However, the "stone tower" context feels slightly generic and abstract, acting more as a stage set than a lived-in environment.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with specific sensory details like "developer fluid," "lavender soap," and the tactile "braille of lost time." However, standard tropes like the "green-shaded lamp" and "dust motes" swirling prevent the setting from feeling entirely fresh.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy markers ("ancient stone archway," "velvet blackness") rather than specific, tactile details that constrain the character. The central action involves a technical impossibility—tracing fleeting meteors with an astrolabe designed for fixed stars—which breaks credibility without establishing a clear alternative magic system. The atmosphere is heavy with adjectives but light on grounding sensory friction.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is established with vivid but generic imagery ("bioluminescence," "obsidian," "emerald canopies") that feels like a standard sci-fi aesthetic. While the "glowing dune" is visually clear, the sensory details are often filtered through abstract nouns ("paradox of sorrow") rather than concrete, grounded interaction. The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a constraining force.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "mechanical rainforest" is vividly described with specific sensory details (wind sounds, brass texture) that facilitate the method. However, the setting offers no resistance; it is a passive backdrop that yields immediately to the protagonist's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting ("veiled ridgeway," "misty shore") provides a consistent atmospheric backdrop but operates as a generic dreamscape rather than a physical space that constrains action. While sensory details like "sea foam" and "violet sky" are present, they function mostly as ornamentation rather than obstacles or tools that shape the narrative outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting acts as a constraint throughout, with the "acoustic purity" and "obsidian floors" enforcing the oppressive silence that Elara must break. The sensory details—cold, dust, the sound of the bolt—are vivid and purposeful, charging the final image with texture.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "titan... no larger than a sparrow’s egg" and "spider-silk thread" are vivid, specific details that ground the fantasy elements. However, the wider setting leans on generic high-fantasy tropes ("obsidian halls," "crystalline dome," "ancient suns") without enough sensory specificity to make the "crease of eternity" feel lived-in. The environment serves the plot but lacks a distinct atmospheric pressure that complicates the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.5)
    The physical description of the station and the "skeletal structure" is evocative and grounding. However, the atmosphere is marred by the repetitive, forced insertion of prompt phrases ("periodically eternal") that break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.4)
    The juxtaposition of high-tech decay and ancient stones is visually striking, but the description often slides into abstraction ("monumental decay," "suffocating stillness"). While atmospheric, the setting largely serves as a backdrop for reflection rather than a source of physical constraints that force tactical decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sensory details like "cracked obsidian" and "sulfur's sharp bite" effectively ground the scene in a tangible physical reality. The hot springs are integrated well as a necessary tool for the resolution, though the "reconstruction" context remains largely atmospheric rather than pressuring choices.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.6)
    Sensory details are present (salt spray, rough bark) but often serve as heavy-handed symbols explicitly decoded for the reader (e.g., the lighthouse explanation). The setting functions more as a thematic backdrop than a physical space that constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.0)
    The lighthouse library setting is established with some vivid, if adjective-heavy, sensory details ("salt-crusted glass," "mildewed logs"). However, the environment dissolves into an abstract "root cellar" of glowing threads, reducing the setting to a convenient allegorical stage.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with vivid tactile and visual details like "wind-polished stone" and "whispering tunnels" that ground the mystical atmosphere. The canyon feels lived-in and distinct, though the presence of a high-tech workbench in a primitive camp creates a slight jarring note in the world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong, atmospheric setting with specific details ("faded iron-gall ink," "glacial ice") that ground the narrative. The "frozen memory" metaphor coheres well with the physical environment.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is visually coherent but generic ("glass dome," "endless sands") and filtered through abstract descriptors rather than sensory immediacy. Key atmospheric phrases ("engraved quiet," "tranquil blaze") act as repeated tags rather than organic, grounded details.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.1)
    The "sound wave garden" is visualized with vivid, synesthetic detail that effectively constrains the protagonist's movement (the "zigzag"). While imaginative, some descriptions drift into abstraction ("celestial loom," "crystalline forests") that distance the reader from the physical danger.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is rendered with sharp, sensory specificity ("thin, cold air," "brass chart table," "indigo ink") that effectively grounds the intellectual conflict. The atmosphere of "crystalline loneliness" supports the theme well.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with evocative details like "scent of yesterday’s rain" grounding the surreal setting. However, the description occasionally lists sensory inputs ("tomorrow's ozone," "beeswax and sorrow") rather than integrating them into active constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory details are vivid ("parabolic stone walls," "wet stone"), establishing a strong atmosphere. However, the description leans into adjectival stacking ("perpetual lilac-tinted mist") and repetitive imagery that blunts the specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is established with high-intensity descriptors ("sky shattered," "bruised violet") that lean toward purple prose rather than grounding specificity. While the visual of the plaza is clear, the atmosphere feels constructed from adjectives rather than sensory interaction; the environment does not constrain the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory detail is vivid but decorative, relying on a density of synesthetic adjectives that creates atmosphere without constraining character choice. The setting serves as a passive backdrop for the magic system rather than an active environment that pressures the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    The studio setting is well-utilized, with the darkness and safelight constraining the action and focusing attention on the light painting process. Sensory details like the ozone scent and the tactile warmth of the geode effectively ground the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with specific, grounded details like "treated kelp-paper," "whalebone brush," and the "damp contour" of the caves. The environment effectively constrains the protagonist’s method and mood, though the "bioluminescent algae" is a somewhat standard trope.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific imagery like "rust-hued sandstone" and "petrified-wood bench" grounding the magical elements. The atmosphere of the amber warehouse is palpable and consistently maintained. However, the description occasionally leans into density that slows momentum ("honeyed gloom," "distilled resonance").

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.2)
    The atmosphere is cohesive but suffers from pathetic fallacy, with the weather perfectly mirroring the internal state at every turn. The setting details are often filtered through heavy adjectives ("sacred," "profound") rather than concrete sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the atmospheric "gloom" is established, specific elements feel forced or misused, particularly "spindrift" (sea spray) in a river context. The setting functions largely as a backdrop for internal monologue rather than a source of concrete obstacles or tools. Sensory details are filtered through heavy adjectives ("whispering," "weathered") rather than immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with sensory details like "scorched wasteland" and "silent wooden hives" grounding the scene. While some descriptions lean toward the generic ("bruised twilight sky"), the environment successfully frames the central concept, though the "oasis" feels more like a static stage set than a source of dynamic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting specificity is the story's strongest asset; details like the "rust-flecked iron," "emerald moss," and the specific "lockmaster’s bitting gauge tooth" ground the scene vividly. The spatial arrangement (fire escape vs. alley) effectively constrains the action and enables the central mechanic of reflecting light.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting of the tidal library is vivid and imaginative, with details like "solidified cloud-stone" effectively anchoring the scene. However, descriptions often rely on adjectival stacking ("crystalline spires," "boundless cloud sea") rather than environmental interaction that forces tactical changes. The rising tide acts as a mild atmospheric clock but doesn't severely constrain movement.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is rendered with vivid sensory details ("wet stone," "mud-brown nest") that ground the ethereal tone. However, the environment primarily serves as a passive resource for materials rather than a source of constraint or difficulty that shapes the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting is effectively grounded with sensory details like the "green glow" of the oscilloscope and "dust motes," creating a convincing atmosphere. The contrast between the "humming sanctuary" and the "battlefield" outside serves the story well.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is the strongest element, with vivid sensory details like "star-dusted chill" and "carved lines writhed." The "spatial mutiny" is visualized effectively as a physical compression of space. However, the atmosphere is occasionally generic ("ancient stone arches," "silent sentinel"), preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.5)
    The quarry setting is established with vivid, atmospheric sensory details like "emerald moss" and "dripping water." While "furrowed hush" is slightly purple, the physical grounding of the environment is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.8)
    Atmospheric details like the "bruised sky" and "crimson stain" are vivid, but the station itself feels generic ("reinforced viewport," "metal walls"). The setting functions as a backdrop for the plot but rarely constrains choice or action in a specific, tactile way beyond the dampness.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.9)
    The setting is a generic backdrop ("alpine wind," "gravel") serving only to house the prompt items. Sensory details are presented as a checklist cataloged by the protagonist's "nature" rather than a lived, atmospheric experience.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the train's physical details (the "SV" carving, the user map) ground the abstract history effectively. The atmosphere is established quickly, though the descriptions occasionally veer into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    The observatory setting is established with vivid, atmospheric details ("cold, sharp stars," "scent of aged paper") that ground the abstract premise. The environment effectively mirrors the theme of solitary vigilance, though the interaction with the setting remains largely observational.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is constructed from emotive metaphors ("storm of sorrow," "bruised twilight") rather than concrete sensory geography. The reliance on abstract, atmospheric descriptors obscures the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting ("cobalt glade," "violet and indigo") is established with vivid, if adjective-heavy, imagery that grounds the scene visually. However, the environment functions mostly as a static backdrop for the ritual rather than a tactical space that constrains the character’s movement or choices. The description leans into purple prose ("bleeding," "scar") without creating distinct physical texture.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "catacomb orchard" provides a distinct, if static, visual anchor for the scene. However, the description relies heavily on stacked adjectives ("rib-vaulted," "phosphorescent") that create a "white room" effect decorated with words, rather than an interactive environment that constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is a standout strength; the "solitary sentinel" trailer in the limestone quarry effectively mirrors Leo's isolation. Specific technical details (Fane Acoustics, Cambrian limestone) add excellent texture. The pathetic fallacy of the sunset changing the cliffs from barren to amber is effective, if traditional.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    The magnetic arbor is a vivid, functional setting that actively participates in the narrative, reacting to the protagonist’s actions with hums and stabilization. Sensory details like "brass dials," "woven ironwood," and "luminous moss" ground the metaphysical concept in tactile reality. The environment effectively constrains and enables the central ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the "titan-gears" and "tidal atrium" providing a strong sensory backdrop. However, the environment feels static, serving as a stage for the ritual rather than exerting active pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    The contrast between the industrial austerity of the bunker world and the organic luminosity of the caves is effective. However, the cave descriptions occasionally veer into purple prose ("light lived not as invasion but as inherent truth"), reducing the vividness of the physical setting.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is the strongest element, with specific sensory details ("ivy-choked," "silver duct tape") effectively mirroring the theme of ruin and repair. The atmosphere is tangible and grounds the scene well.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is established with clear atmosphere, but relies on generic fantasy tropes ("crystalline spires," "glowing," "mist"). While the "library of unspoken words" is a strong concept, the sensory details often lean into purple abstraction ("shadows that whispered") rather than grounding texture.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting creates a distinct atmosphere ("crimson walls," "midsummer heat"), though the "velvet observatory" feels somewhat like a stage set rather than a lived-in space. The environment functions adequately as a container for the ritual but does not deeply constrain the tactics used.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is vivid and visually cohesive, anchoring the reader in a high-fantasy aesthetic with "obsidian veined with silver" and the "watchful aurora." However, occasional overwriting ("silent ballet," "celestial luminescence") pushes the atmosphere toward generic grandeur rather than specific, lived-in texture.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is described with vivid but generic fantasy imagery ("clouds drifted like forgotten dreams," "ancient moss"). While the physical space is clear, the atmosphere leans into purple prose, and the specific descriptor "vineyard hush" feels forced and repetitive within a grotto context.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.8)
    Specific details like the wind chimes and hollow shard provide good visual anchors. However, the setting primarily functions as a pathetic fallacy to mirror internal states (wind as instrument, dawn as hope) rather than a resistant environment that pressures choices.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    The magnetic grotto and ripple mechanics are inventive and essential to the scene's progression. Specificity is marred by reliance on stock literary descriptors ("obsidian pond," "liquid silver," "star-dusted") rather than fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "towers of bone" and "canyon of endless echoes" are vivid, specific, and functionally constrain the protagonist’s method (stillness). The sensory details—fused pelvic bones, iridescent feathers—effectively ground the abstract metaphysical concept in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with vivid, specific imagery ("mercury-waterfalls flowed upward," "snowflakes hung motionless") that actively reinforces the theme of "accommodating impossibilities." The contrast between the sterile citadel and the organic spire is palpable and grounds the magical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the "cathedral of drowned knowledge" and "sleeping sentinels" creating a vivid, distinct atmosphere. The environment is tangible and atmospheric, though occasionally the description shifts into meta-narrative summary ("The setting transformed with the timeframe") which distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the imagery of the amber-encased observatory and the "luminous pearl" of the contracted universe is vivid and conceptually cohesive. The environment effectively traps the character, enforcing the mood of preservation, though it functions more as a backdrop than a source of active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is established with vivid, atmospheric details ("dust motes," "slanted amber rays," "lead-lined chest"). While some descriptions lean toward generic fantasy tropes ("swirling vortex," "ancient observatory"), the interplay of light and stone anchors the ritual effectively. The physical environment supports the central mechanic well.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    The integration of setting and magic is excellent; the mechanics of the sapphire viaduct weeping condensation at specific temperatures ground the fantasy in a tactile reality. This specific environmental constraint actively shapes the protagonist's tactics, elevating the scene beyond generic description.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.1)
    Setting is the story's strongest asset; details like the "violet bleed of dusk" and "cobblestones slick with algae" create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. The environment actively constrains the protagonist's movement, grounding the abstract memory work in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.4)
    The setting relies on generic, high-fantasy clichés ("kaleidoscopic waterfall," "dew-kissed leaves") rather than specific, grounded sensory details that constrain choice. The description is ornamental and static, creating an aesthetic distance that prevents the environment from exerting tangible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.7)
    Atmospheric descriptors ("star-dusted velvet," "obsidian floor") establish a clear visual mood, but the setting feels like a generic sci-fi/fantasy backdrop. The specific mechanics of the "crystalline platform" and how the vines function as instruments remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.2)
    Imagery is vivid ("mountains flickered," "cerulean fluid"), but the setting functions primarily as atmospheric wallpaper rather than constraining the action. The clash between the mystic dojo and corporate "BioGenesis" font feels unintegrated and jarring.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.2)
    The "nocturnal haven" is described with adjectival density but operates as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraint or resource. The sensory details ("storm-born silence," "rain-washed stones") establish a mood but do not pressure the character's choices or interactions with the object.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sensory details of the root cellar and the mechanical roar are vivid and effective. The contrast between the damp, stone space and the industrial machine creates a specific, memorable atmosphere that grounds the magical realism.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    The frozen garden is vivid and plays a causal role; the specific beauty of the "frozen rose" and "ice-encased willows" provides the rationale for the protagonist's choice. Sensory details are specific (ink-stained claws, beeswax polish), though occasionally list-like.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sensory details are vivid but often ornamental and adjective-heavy ("twilight bled violet," "paradoxical frozen bloom"), setting a mood without constraining the character's choices. The "ember nexus" functions as a passive backdrop rather than an active pressure on the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Atmosphere is a strong point, with specific, evocative details ("Aethelred Mark VII," "ozone and aged wood") grounding the abstract quest. The setting actively participates in the narrative, transforming from a desolate tower into a "cathedral of resonance."

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.8)
    The shift to the "spectral grotto" creates a distinct, if somewhat generic, atmospheric change. While the sensory details are vivid ("low hum," "cold silver light"), they often lean into purple description rather than grounding the supernatural events in a tactile, pressure-filled reality.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is described with abstract nouns ("rational enchantment," "grace") rather than grounded sensory details. While the "crystalline apertures" offer a visual, the climatic transformation ("walls melted into forests of forgotten promises") breaks spatial logic with mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.4)
    The benthic environment is established with some sensory detail ("crystalflex," "bioluminescent pathways"), providing a functional backdrop. However, the premise that a rusted chain link's geometry perfectly matches a specific star angle relies on convenient magic rather than grounded setting logic.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is atmospheric and established with vivid, if occasionally florid, imagery ("marble veined like frozen rivers"). However, the environment serves primarily as mood lighting; it does not impose constraints or force tactical adjustments on the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is the strongest element, with specific details ("copper coils," "frosted glass") grounding the "cathedral of forgotten science." The atmosphere effectively blends industrial decay with the natural threat of the tide.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.0)
    The atmosphere is evocative, utilizing the "opal" and "snow" imagery to create a consistent, hushed mood. However, the setting functions primarily as a backdrop; the observatory's specific properties do not constrain the protagonist's choices or drive the plot mechanics. The sensory details are vivid but occasionally ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is integral and vivid; the "tunnel of echoes" and "towers of bone" are not just backdrop but the mechanical tools required for the resolution. The environment constrains the method and charges the final imagery effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively using the "cathedral of roots" and "foxfire" to ground the magical elements. Specific details like the "damp stone" and the lighting create a cohesive mood. The environment actively supports the tone of the transformation scene.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is grounded with vivid sensory details like "rusted bolts" and "living statues," effectively visualizing the contrast between the mechanical and natural worlds. However, the geography of the descent and the scale of the orchard remain somewhat vague.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "cobalt arcade" is rendered with vivid, if slightly ornamental, imagery ("liquid sapphire," "hand-glazed tiles"). While the atmosphere is established quickly, the setting serves more as a backdrop for the prose than a constraint that forces specific tactical choices. The twilight visual anchors the scene well.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with specific details like "obsidian eyes" and "walnut flanks" grounding the scene. However, the description leans toward the ornate ("pearlescent veil"), and the placement of "wind bells" in an abandoned train feels like set dressing rather than organic world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with specific, evocative details like "Photosynthetic Haikus" and "Calculus of Longing" effectively establishing the atmosphere. While the environment is vivid, it serves mostly as a backdrop rather than an active constraint that forces difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.3)
    The setting is established through heavy adjectival layering ("wind-scoured," "whispering," "weathered") rather than grounded interaction. While the sensory details of the palette ingredients are vivid, the broader environment feels like a painted backdrop for the aesthetic rather than a pressure-cooker for the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is atmospherically consistent but relies on generic fantasy markers ("ancient oaks," "moss-covered keystone") rather than specific, grounding details. The "nexus" feels like a stage set constructed for the concept rather than a lived-in space that pressures the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the shipwreck-ringed greenhouse serving as a functional mechanic for the ritual. Imagery is vivid, though occasionally leans into standard adjectival phrasing ("beached leviathan’s skeleton").

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is established with specific, evocative details like the "shadow caught in glass" and "decaying vellum," creating a consistent atmospheric pressure. The library feels tangible, and the visual link to the playground swing provides a solid anchor for the story's metaphysical concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting relies on generic high-fantasy adjectives ("verdant," "emerald," "liquid silver") rather than specific, tactile details that constrain the character's actions. The environment acts as a passive backdrop rather than an active force.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with strong sensory details like "silent rivers of sapphire" and "salt-bleached fibers." The imagery effectively supports the tone, though the descriptions occasionally lean toward purple prose ("accumulating silence," "interlaced hush").

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.7)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid details like "scent of wet limestone" and "watercolor memories" grounding the reader. However, the description sometimes verges on static museum-tour observation rather than an environment that actively pressures the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, offering a vivid, atmospheric backdrop ("ghostly anemones," "waterlogged shelves"). However, the description occasionally leans on clichés ("silent sentinels," "timeless embrace") which dull the specificity of the environment. The space feels physically grounded, even if the historical timeline is murky.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "misty courtyard" is atmospherically described but remains a static stage set that facilitates rather than pressures the action. The connection to the "city below" is purely conceptual, lacking the sensory immediacy required to make the setting a true constraint on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sensory details like "fabric whispering of starch" and "sunlight fracturing" create a vivid atmosphere. The setting is well-rendered, though it serves more as a backdrop than a source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the specificity of meteorological terms (altocumulus, fallstreak hole) grounds the abstract theme in concrete reality. The physical constraints of the gondola and the "velvet dark" atmosphere are vividly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with the hollowed World Tree offering excellent tactile opportunities that serve the protagonist’s condition. The sensory details—wood grain, beeswax, the cool silver—are specific and grounded. The environment actively constrains and shapes the narrative focus.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is established with clear, if somewhat generic, steampunk imagery ("brass fittings," "aether-lamp"). Spatial anchoring is adequate, though the atmosphere relies on adjectives ("cerulean," "majestic") rather than interaction. The starling murmuration is a vivid visual element.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "frozen library" and "hall of mirrors" are visually distinct and atmospheric, grounding the fantasy elements well. However, the setting functions largely as a static backdrop; the cold and height do not actively constrain Elara's choices or force tactical trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is visually vibrant ("sapphire and amber," "floating arches") but leans on "prompt salad" adjectives rather than sensory grounding that constrains choice. While the arches are eventually used for the mirrors, the "gravity tricks" serve mostly as ornamental backdrop until that moment. The description often drifts into purple prose ("impossible hues," "silent stone sentinels") rather than lived-in texture.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.5)
    The "pane of hush" is an inventive, specific element that anchors the setting and mechanics. The lighthouse atmosphere is established quickly, though descriptions like "weeping salt tears" lean into cliché. The setting successfully constrains the action to a single, critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is exceptional, with specific details like "tarnished brass," "foxfire fungus," and the "Sentinel Tree" grounding the fantasy. The environment acts as a pressure cooker (frost, cliff) and a resource (dust, crevices), integrating perfectly with the plot. The sensory details are vivid and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is vivid and serves the central metaphor well, though descriptions sometimes feel static or "postcard-like" ("ancient granite," "sun-warmed stone"). The environment functions more as a thematic diagram than a lived-in space challenging the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory detail is vivid and atmospheric ("liquid marble," "glass branches"), effectively grounding the high-fantasy concept. The setting actively participates in the climax (light flooding the shop), though the lush description occasionally slows momentum rather than constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sensory details regarding taste (metallic abandonment, salt-tears) effectively ground the fantastical elements. However, some visual descriptors ("bruised twilight," "liquid sky") lean toward ornamental "purple" prose rather than purposeful specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is vivid and imaginative, effectively grounding the fable-like tone in the specific mechanics of the clock tower and the grain elevators. However, the description occasionally drifts into "purple" territory ("hush of borrowed starlight") that prioritizes aesthetic accumulation over narrative pressure. The environment serves as a beautiful backdrop but offers limited tactile resistance to the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.3)
    The setting is described with vivid, sometimes purple imagery ("sliver of polished bone"), but it remains a passive backdrop rather than an active force. The environment does not constrain the protagonist’s choices or apply pressure, serving only as a stage for the internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting of the inverted grotto is visually distinct and imaginative, with specific details like the "liquid stars" and "bioluminescent moss." However, the description often relies on heavy "telling" through abstract noun phrases ("impossible geometry") rather than grounding the reader in immediate sensory experience. The environment functions well as a puzzle box but less as a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "siskin alder grove" is established with specific sensory details ("damp leaf litter," "emerald moss"), though descriptions lean towards the generic and ornamental. The setting functions as a backdrop rather than a source of constraints or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and integral, with the "magnetic nexus" providing a strong physical anchor for the internal work. Specific details like the "iron-rich surfaces" and "basalt monoliths" ground the piece, though some phrases ("forgotten pockets") drift into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established with sensory competence ("shadowed workshop," "copper wire"), but the details largely serve to reinforce a generic "magical artisan" aesthetic rather than constraining the protagonist's choices. The atmosphere is consistent but relies on clichés ("watchful stars," "violent crimson light") that lack the specificity required to ground the fantastical elements in a tangible reality.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.8)
    Atmospheric details like "rope bridges" and the "wildflower hush" successfully establish the setting. However, the environment serves primarily as a backdrop rather than a source of constraint or resources for the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    The inverted gravity orchard is vividly realized and directly enables the plot mechanics (water flow navigation). Specific details like "silver-barked trees" and "floating rock arches" ground the fantasy effectively, though the descriptions occasionally veer into the ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "steel canyons" and wind dynamics are integral to the plot and solution. The environment actively constrains the investigation ("narrow gap," "choke point") and provides the mechanism for the collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is established with vivid but overly ornamental description ("cathedral of frozen time," "swirling silver mist") that often pauses the narrative flow. While visual imagery is strong, the environment does not exert pressure or constrain the character’s choices; the cold and ice are aesthetic backdrops rather than physical realities that complicate the action.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.0)
    Specific details like the "sun-warmed sandstone" and "driftwood" establish a solid physical ground. However, the recurring, clumsy phrase "avalanchingly quiet" feels mechanically inserted and disrupts the atmospheric immersion, drawing attention to the writing rather than the world.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "topaz workshop" and "captured starlight" provide a vivid, consistent atmosphere that grounds the abstract premise. While effective, the descriptions occasionally drift into generic "purple" territory ("velvet blackness," "crystalline dome") rather than constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting relies on "purple" descriptors ("rivers of shimmering celestial fire," "symphony of light") that create a generic high-fantasy backdrop. The environment is visually loud but inert, failing to constrain the protagonist's choices or provide physical resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.5)
    The imagery of the "quartz arbor" and "frost-etched surface" is vivid, establishing a distinct, somewhat surreal atmosphere. The setting details effectively mirror the theme of clarity and crystalline structure, grounding the esoteric premise.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.8)
    Descriptions are lush but rely on generic, adjectival phrases ("whispering emerald labyrinth," "weeping moss") rather than tactile specificity. The inclusion of a box from a "rummage sale" creates a significant tonal breach in the established high-fantasy setting, confusing the world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.7)
    The setting is established with vivid but generic high-fantasy descriptors ("floating rock arches," "glow-moss," "eternal azure light"). While visually distinct, the environment acts merely as a backdrop rather than exerting pressure or constraining the protagonist’s choices. The "rubble" is described as unforgiving but offers no physical resistance to the character's progress.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sensory details ("scent of rusted durasteel," "grit-strewn permacrete") are vivid and align well with the protagonist's skill set. The atmosphere is tangible, though the "parallel worlds" remain somewhat generic sketches compared to the repair bay.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.1)
    Atmospheric detail is the story's strongest asset, using sensory specifics like "cold brass," "dust motes," and "cobalt blue" to anchor the abstraction. The setting actively participates in the ritual, though some descriptors ("spectral rainbows," "forgotten promises") veer into lush over-description that risks distancing the reader from the gritty reality of the tower.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and active; the lighthouse and obsidian wick function as constraints that shape the protagonist's options. Sensory details like "wind-scoured" and "salt-lines" ground the fantasy elements, though the initial description is slightly adjective-heavy.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is vivid and atmospherically consistent, with strong sensory details like the "sun-warmed cedar" and "liquid-gold path." However, the description leans toward the flowery ("valley-mist wonder"), and the environment functions more as a static backdrop for contemplation than a pressure cooker for choice.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stormlit tower provides a solid atmospheric backdrop that supports the "gothic/magical" tone. However, the setting details remain largely visual ("leaded glass," "dust motes") and do not constrain the character's tactics beyond forcing her to wait.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with strong sensory details like the "mica window" and "distilled starlight" effectively grounding the high-fantasy tone. The environment feels cohesive and actively contributes to the mood, though some descriptions verge on purple prose ("dewdrop... of condensed song").

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting is established with evocative sensory details ("dust motes," "scent of aged paper"), creating a solid atmosphere. However, the description occasionally drifts into abstraction ("shelves that held centuries of whispered secrets") rather than grounding the reader in the immediate physical reality. The magical elements (the ritual) are introduced abruptly without sufficient grounding in the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on generic "secret garden" tropes (ivy, old statues, silence) rather than specific, constraining details. While sensory imagery is present ("scent of yeast"), the environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than forcing choices or shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "ice-carved workbench" and scientific specifics ("480 terahertz") ground the setting effectively, creating a vivid atmosphere, though the "quartz hush" descriptor is over-relied upon.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with sensory details like "splintered bones" and "whiskey-scented air" grounding the action effectively. The environment feels distinct and places genuine pressure on the characters' interactions.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sensory details are vivid and specific, effectively grounding the "emergent compass" concept in the physical sensation of taste (rosemary, ozone, honey). The environment charges the final image (the personal rain), though the color palette leans heavily on repetitive purples (lavender, violet) which slightly dulls the visual distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is vivid and central to the plot, with the crystal panel serving as a functional tool. However, the description suffers from purple prose ("breathing silence heavier than granite," "soft, auroral luminescence") that prioritizes flowery adjectives over sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.1)
    Veridia’s atmosphere is vivid and immersive; details like the "toxic sky stained... ochre" and "thorny jasmine" ground the fable-like tone. The setting’s oppressive dryness effectively mirrors and pressures the thematic thirst for truth, constraining the protagonist's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.7)
    Specific imagery, particularly the iceberg fragment cradled in silver, provides a strong sensory anchor for the piece. However, the setting functions primarily as a static stage for the ritual rather than an environment that exerts pressure or constrains Elara's tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is vivid and functional; the use of desert rose sap as a lens is a strong, specific detail that grounds the ritual in the environment. The atmosphere is consistent, though some descriptors lean towards the ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on generic "idyllic" markers (bougainvillea, cobblestones, jasmine) and heavy adjectives ("crimson life," "gilded") rather than specific, grounding details. While the atmosphere is coherent, it feels like a stage set for a parable rather than a lived-in space where the grit of sixty years of silence would actually be felt.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with details like "sediment settling" and "salt-crusted" valves grounding the scene effectively. The environment provides the necessary pressure (air pocket, deep sea), though the "hourly chiming" pressure gauge strains mechanical plausibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is vivid, with specific sensory details like "salt-heavy air" and "forests of salt crystals" grounding the fantasy. However, the "gravity pockets" are introduced as a physical hazard but resolved too quickly to feel like a genuine part of the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting consists of generic fantasy markers ("indifferent stars," "ancient roots," "soft moss") that provide atmosphere but do not constrain the protagonist's choices. The environment is a passive backdrop rather than an active force or specific place; "nocturnal haven" reads as a label rather than a lived-in location.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.5)
    The rooftop setting and meteor shower create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that supports the contemplative tone. The visual resolution of the "penitentiary archway" within the brick pattern is a strong, specific detail that anchors the history physically, though some descriptions ("star-dusted sky") lean toward the generic.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.0)
    Descriptions are lush but repetitive ("moss... like crushed velvet," "velvet garden," "blue velvet") and ornamental rather than constraining. The setting acts as a compliant backdrop that facilitates the ritual perfectly, failing to exert pressure or force the protagonist to adapt her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is vivid and establishes a consistent high-fantasy atmosphere ("marble sanctuary," "emerald waves"). However, the descriptions are often ornamental and flowery ("frozen tears," "liquid starlight") rather than tactile or constraining to the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.7)
    While phrases like "stone ribs" and "scar against her skin" offer some visual grounding, the setting functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint. The "serpentine nexus" provides no physical obstacles to shape the protagonist's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is vivid but relies on "perfumed" descriptors ("liquid gold," "sacred cold") that distance the reader rather than grounding the scene in sensory reality. While the glacial shrine is established, the atmosphere feels constructed and ornamental rather than lived-in or pressuring.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.3)
    While the setting is established (parapet, river), the description relies heavily on "purple" adjective-noun pairings ("whispering parapet," "liquid affirmation") rather than sensory specificity. The environment functions as a static backdrop for philosophy rather than a source of constraints or resources that shape the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong atmospheric contrast between the "mechanical hiss" of the suit and the "impossible calm" of the orchard creates immediate intrigue. The "patch of moss arranged with unnatural precision" is a specific, effective detail that grounds the discovery in observation.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.8)
    Visual descriptors are vivid ("churning cloud ocean," "cobalt glass") but function as a static backdrop for a monologue rather than an interactive environment. The setting does not constrain action or force tactical shifts beyond the initial setup.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting is established with vivid but conventional literary imagery ("dust motes," "sunlit shelf"). While the "feral loft" is a promising container, the environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a pressure cooker that constrains the protagonist's options or forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "drift-ice marina" is established with vivid, specific imagery ("granite pier," "molten amber") that grounds the fantasy elements. The physical environment actively pressures the character (cold, vibration), integrating well with the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.3)
    The setting is vivid and integral, with the basalt sanctuary and viaduct acting as necessary tools for the ritual rather than mere backdrop. The imagery ("obsidian mirror," "emerald moss") effectively grounds the fantastical elements in concrete sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting is established with competent sensory details ("wet concrete," "cold seep," "faint glow of dawn") that ground the scene physically. The post-drought tunnel provides a coherent backdrop, though the environment functions more as atmosphere than as a source of active constraints or tactical obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sensory details like "lemon oil" and "rosewood" effectively anchor the "vibrant hush" of the shop. However, the atmosphere leans heavily into the "magic shop" trope without contrasting textures to ground it in the grit of the prison backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid ("furious green beast," "moon-metal," "acid sea"), creating a strong, cohesive atmosphere. The environment actively responds to the climax, though it functions more as a backdrop than a constraint on tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting is established, but the description often slips into mixed metaphors ("tasted of... secrets") or generic sci-fi tropes ("humming silence," "filtered oxygen"). The sensory details are present but feel ornamental rather than constraining the character’s choices or creating tangible atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is visually distinct ("gnarled pear trees," "salt-weathered door"), creating a cohesive atmosphere. However, the environment serves largely as a passive backdrop for the magical ritual rather than pressing on the character; the "shifting ice floes" are mentioned as a threat but do not constrain tactics or force a difficult trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.4)
    The Arctic setting is clear but rendered through derivative, sentimental imagery ("violet and rose gold," "star-dusted sky"). Descriptions often lean into "purple" adjective stacking ("grief-shadowed eyes") rather than sensory specificity that constrains the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.5)
    Setting descriptions are vivid but lean heavily into ornamental purple prose ("liquid honey," "unhurried grace") that stalls momentum. The environment serves as a static backdrop for the lesson rather than a source of physical pressure or constraint on choices.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "kinetic parapet" beneath the dunes provides a specific and imaginative grounding element that contrasts well with the surface setting. However, the atmosphere relies heavily on abstract descriptors ("whisperfield calm," "timeless flow") rather than concrete, sensory immediacy that forces interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is established with clear, albeit romanticized, imagery (lavender, ruins). While the juxtaposition of nature and industry serves the theme, the descriptions often slide into generic "ruin porn" rather than providing specific, grimy textures that would ground the healing process. The environment feels more like a stage set than a lived-in space constraining the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.4)
    The atmospheric details ("shadowed library," "polished oak," "frozen constellation") effectively establish a mood of reverence, though they lean toward standard "magical library" tropes. The specific sonic textures (creaking beams, dripping gutter) add necessary sensory specificity. However, the setting primarily serves as a static backdrop for reflection rather than a pressure cooker for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    The "fog sculpture garden" is a vivid and atmospheric setting that supports the themes of transience and memory. Sensory details like "damp gravel" and "scent of rain" ground the scene effectively. However, the spatial relationship between the garden and the "unwatched videotapes" remains abstract, creating a slight "white room" effect where the tapes feel like metaphors rather than physical objects in the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively blending the archaic (brass, obsidian, bonsai) with the technical (data stream, telescope). The "razor-edge of Mount Aethel" provides clear orientation and mood, though some descriptors ("endless sea," "sacred covenant") veer into standard lyrical phrasing rather than fresh, specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is established, but the description is heavily overwritten ("liquid gold," "clouds drifted like silent rivers"), creating a stage-set atmosphere rather than a grounded reality. The "radiant haven" feels idealized to the point of detachment from the gritty reality of a hospice room.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and specific, with "moonlight silvered dust motes" and the "nebula-strewn void" grounding the scene effectively. The description of the "shadow sanctuary" with shadows as coiled serpents or origami is a standout moment of atmospheric specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.7)
    The garden setting is established with functional sensory details ("dewy grass," "weeping willow"), though the imagery leans toward standard pastoral tropes. The "star chart" planting plan provides a moment of specific, character-driven interaction with the space.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sensory details are vivid ("scent of wet stone," "rhythmic sigh"), effectively establishing the atmosphere of the grotto. However, the setting remains a passive backdrop that does not constrain tactics or force choices.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting—a data center reclaimed by nature—is vivid and integral to the ritual, providing specific constraints like the "toppled console" and "moss circle." Details like "ferns sprouting from rusted server racks" ground the scene effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.1)
    The imagery is vivid ("pearlescent mist," "gnarled roots") but relies on standard dreamscape tropes that feel disconnected from a tangible reality. While the metaphorical overlap between the study and the nexus is established, the setting functions largely as a static backdrop for the visions rather than a source of friction.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.4)
    Atmosphere is established but relies heavily on generic high-fantasy markers ("verdant arbor," "ancient oaks," "moss-carpeted") rather than specific, lived-in detail. The setting serves as a static backdrop for the magic rather than an active force that constrains choice or shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    The subarctic crater and withered orchard are rendered with vivid, specific sensory details like "violet twilight" and "frigid air." The setting actively grounds the magic, providing the physical materials (stones, twigs) necessary for the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting integration is the story's strongest asset; the cavern's marble walls and specific lighting angles are not just atmosphere but active tools required to solve the puzzle. The "wounded season" provides a functional, if slightly abstract, constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "shingled hush" and "bronze grotto" create a vivid, tactile atmosphere that deeply informs the tone. The sensory details—meltwater, metallic gleam, whalebone—are specific and immersive, effectively grounding the metaphysical action in physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmosphere is a strength, with specific sensory details ("ghosts of sawdust," "rain-beaded skylight") grounding the loft. The setting actively supports the mood, though some descriptors ("silent potential") lean toward generic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.4)
    Imagery is vivid but relies heavily on abstract simile ("clouds pooled like liquid mercury," "joy like amber") rather than concrete physical grounding. The setting functions more as a metaphorical backdrop than a tangible environment that pressures choices or constrains movement.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is established with vivid sensory details ("soil-stained boots," "gray dust"), though the specific alignment of the fountain and oculus feels contrived for the finale. The atmosphere of abandonment is effectively rendered, but the spatial logic bends to serve the plot rather than constraining it.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is vivid and plays an active role in the plot, acting as the catalyst for the climax (the crystal amplification). However, the description is overly reliant on adjective stacking ("moss-eaten," "rain-drenched," "infinitesimal"), which creates a dense, static atmosphere that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is established with vivid, albeit slightly purple, sensory details ("sky bleeding," "obsidian surface"). While the atmosphere is coherent, the environment functions primarily as a backdrop for reflection and does not constrain the protagonist's choices or exert pressure on the action.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.8)
    Atmospheric descriptions ("aged honey," "oceanic hush") are vivid and establish a strong mood, though the setting remains a static backdrop that does not pressure choices.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is vividly rendered with specific sensory details ("decaying roses," "moss-flecked bench") that establish a strong, cohesive atmosphere. The environment effectively mirrors the theme of healing and decay, though the description occasionally slows momentum. The garden feels lived-in and serves as a functional container for the narrative's meditation.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is established with vivid, if slightly standard, high-fantasy imagery ("velvet doublet," "colossal stalactites"). The contrast between the suspended palace and the mechanical world effectively grounds the central conflict, though the "mechanical world" below remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.0)
    Sensory details are vivid but often filtered through abstract metaphors ("drifting like memories," "whispered apology") rather than concrete observation. Phrases like "scented of... resilience" break the physical reality of the setting, prioritizing poetic affect over grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is a generic fantasy pastiche of "forgotten fountains" and "dusty stone," lacking specific, grounded sensory details that would make it lived-in. While the atmosphere is consistent, the physics of the world (frozen geese vs. moving celestial bodies) confuse the spatial and temporal anchoring. The environment serves as a passive container for clues rather than a pressure cooker for choices.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is visually consistent but relies on generic ethereal tropes (glowing, crystalline, luminous) rather than tactile, grounding details. The description often drifts into mixed metaphor (shedding petals "across the quiet sigh"), obscuring the physical reality of the space.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory details are vivid ("scent of rosemary chicken," "damp soil"), though the atmosphere leans heavily on standard poetic tropes ("dusk bled indigo"). The setting effectively mirrors the theme of migration.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting of the "tidal obsidian ridge" and the mechanical details of the clock tower are vivid and specific, grounding the story well. However, some descriptions (e.g., "bruised purple sky") lean towards ornamental overwriting that distracts from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the "cobalt silo" and "tapestry" offer distinct imagery, the setting functions more as a static backdrop than a source of pressure. The repetition of "velveteen gloom" diminishes the atmospheric impact, turning specific description into a recurring tag.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with vivid, specific details ("drowned pines," "obsidian spire") that actively constrain the protagonist's method and tools. The physical environment (ice thickness, geothermal fissure) is well-integrated into the plot logic rather than serving merely as a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "ember alcove" and the contrasting "silent, swallowing mist" create a vivid, claustrophobic atmosphere that grounds the abstract stakes. The sensory details ("slow, orange heartbeat," "frost-veined window") are specific and evocative, effectively constraining the protagonist's world to the illuminated dial and the parchment. The environment actively pressures the character, forcing the use of the cloak and shaping the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    The rocking chair serves effectively as both a micro-setting and a pacing mechanism (a dying metronome), grounding the scene in time. However, the broader gallery descriptions rely on static, somewhat "purple" adjectives ("hushed expanse," "precise angles") that create distance rather than tactile immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the stratigraphy of the archive (ash, silt, clay) actively structures the narrative and grounds the protagonist's method. Atmospheric details like "abrasive calm" and "filtered water" effectively mirror the protagonist's internal state. The physical environment constrains the action and shapes the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmospheric details—"dust motes," "amber light," and the "velvet library"—effectively establish a sanctuary tone that contrasts with the outside cold. The sensory work is specific and grounds the scene well, though the repeated "velvet" descriptor becomes a slight crutch by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.2)
    Sensory details in the greenhouse (scent of decay, crunch of gravel) establish a solid atmosphere initially. However, the setting becomes a backdrop for abstract thematic assertions rather than a source of physical resistance, and the "liquid starlight" imagery leans into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the strongest element; the specific optical properties of the tower and the "nectar dusk" actively drive the plot (causing the drone failure). The environment acts as an antagonist, satisfying the requirement for setting to constrain action.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with vivid, specific details like the "silvered cedar shingles" and "sea-glass wind chime" effectively grounding the scene. However, the personification of the streetlights ("daydreaming of daylight") borders on twee, and the atmospheric description occasionally stalls momentum rather than constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting offers vivid visual details ("bioluminescent kelp," "mandala") but functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraint or tactical pressure. The "structural weakness" acts as a convenient keyhole for the plot rather than a feature Kael must navigate with difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting functions as a generic "white room" backdrop with limited sensory interaction beyond "cool stone" and "pearlescent haze." While functional, the environment does not offer unique constraints or resistance that force specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is established with vivid, albeit heavy-handed, sensory details ("smog-choked," "rose-gold," "saffron quiet"). While the greenhouse provides a clear atmospheric contrast to the city, the environment serves largely as a static backdrop for the internal monologue rather than a pressure cooker that forces adaptation. The "glass-walled embrace" feels ornamental rather than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.4)
    The grotto setting is rendered with sensory detail ("moss-slick paths," "damp air"), though the "emerald-tinted" opera glass functioning as a magical decoder lens feels slightly contrived. The atmosphere is established effectively, but the descriptions sometimes veer into static ornamentation rather than constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    The lighthouse and hunger stone provide a strong atmospheric anchor ("bruised twilight"), but physical credibility is strained. The discovery of an "ancient" wooden yoyo in a tidal zone that remains mechanically viable defies basic material logic (wood rots in seawater), breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.9)
    The funhouse setting is rendered with vivid, if slightly standard, gothic details ("sweet rot," "metallic tang") that ground the surreal elements. The hall of mirrors is functionally integrated into the plot's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting of a floating orchard on a driftwood circle is evocative, specific, and spatially grounded. Sensory details like the whalebone mallet and the scent of wet wood effectively charge the atmosphere and constrain the action.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific details like "coral spires," "petrified heartwood," and the "fractal lacework" of rust. The integration of the turtle shells’ growth rings into the magic system is clever and grounds the fantastical elements. The atmosphere is tangible, though occasionally the description leans into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is vivid and atmospherically consistent, effectively using the ivy as a thematic mirror. However, the description is static and ornamental, setting a mood but rarely constraining action or forcing choices.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established with vivid, albeit overwritten, sensory details ("chains biting the dawn sky"). While the submerged pavilion provides a functional backdrop, the mechanics of the drawbridge controlling the water level remain vague. The atmosphere leans into "purple" abstraction ("mud met memory") which distances the reader from the physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vividly imagined, with strong sensory details like bioluminescent anemones and coral-veined stone anchoring the sunken city atmosphere. While the description is evocative, it occasionally drifts into overwriting, with adjective-heavy phrasing that slows the pacing. The environment supports the mood but does not actively constrain the protagonist's choices beyond providing the initial opportunity.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is vividly described with strong visual imagery ("misty voids," "fractured through the glass dome"). However, the environment functions largely as a static backdrop; the specific elements of the tea garden do not constrain Elara’s tactics or force choices.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting of the floating observatory is established with decent sensory detail ("cold steel," "hummed"), though the "wounded Earth" remains a generic backdrop. The geode functions well as a grounding object, connecting the abstract physics to the physical scene.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sensory details are vivid ("moss-choked archway," "violet sky like scattered diamond dust"), creating a distinct atmosphere that blends sci-fi and fantasy elements. However, the setting primarily serves as a backdrop rather than a source of constraint; the environment yields its secrets too easily to generate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is established with vivid, if slightly purple, sensory details ("cobalt terrace," "moss-slicked steps"). The environment offers some tactile grounding ("splinters biting his palm"), though the terrace feels more like a static stage set than a dynamic space pressuring the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is atmospheric and well-integrated, with the mist, wind, and "storm-worn stones" providing a tangible texture that mirrors the internal themes of weathering and resilience. While impactful, some descriptions lean into adjectival density ("brutal edges," "tattered banner") that borders on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is effectively integrated into the plot; the utility poles act as a tangible constraint that drives the narrative logic and forces the climax when they disappear. Sensory details ("salt and kelp," "splintered giant") establish the atmosphere well. The environment functions as an antagonist, which elevates the score.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.5)
    The bioluminescent lake is described with vivid, if slightly generic, sensory details ("shimmering with soft, pulsing light"). However, the setting primarily serves as a passive backdrop for the epiphany rather than an active environment that constrains Kael's choices or forces a tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting is established with high sensory density, but the imagery leans heavily on generic fantasy tropes ("ghost-pepper dust," "dying star’s echo") that feel like a checklist of magical aesthetics rather than a grounded reality. The atmosphere is consistent but monochromatic, lacking the contrast or gritty specificity that would anchor the ethereal elements. The description acts more as decoration than as a constraint on the character’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    Atmospheric details like "luminous fungi" and "swirling vapor" create a cohesive visual palette, but the setting functions primarily as a static backdrop. The mentioned "choking" quality of the air is stated rather than dramatized as a physical constraint that pressures the protagonist's movements or focus.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established with vivid, though adjectival, details ("bioluminescent moss," "recycled vents"). However, the environment serves primarily as a static backdrop and does not enforce meaningful constraints or influence tactical choices until the gravity shift, which is treated more as a magical effect than a spatial reality.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sensory details are vivid and specific ("obsidian grit," "ash-dusted"), effectively grounding the physical setting. However, the description occasionally drifts into ornamental metaphors ("silent waltz," "mountain exhaled") that distance the reader from the immediate reality of the beach.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and integral to the plot; the "twilight geometry" and the interaction between the sundial's shadow and the fort's architecture are inventive. Specific details like the "half-painted sundial" and "dawn-colored wax" ground the scene well, though some descriptions lean toward the ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    The physical constraints of a frictionless world are used effectively (magnetic boots, pebbles drifting). The atmosphere is strong, though occasionally the description favors poetic abstraction ("borrowed dawn") over concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is established with atmosphere, but the description often favors poetic abstraction ("storm-kissed wonder," "sea of cloud") over tactile grounding. While the observatory provides a backdrop, the details feel like set dressing for the metaphor rather than a gritty, constraining reality.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is established with vivid, if slightly florid, detail; the atrium and sundial serve the plot mechanics well. However, atmospheric descriptions rely on stock literary phrases ("liquid gold," "ancient, patient song") rather than fresh, specific observation. The sensory environment is functional but feels curated for the puzzle rather than lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with vivid details like "skeletal ribs" and "scent of rain-washed metal" effectively grounding the surreal premise. Specific touches like the "vibrant yarn" on mended chairs add necessary texture, though some descriptors veer into ornamental "ruin porn" that distances the reader from the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid, with specific sensory details ("polished abalone," "liquid mercury," "rose-gold") establishing a strong atmosphere. The contrast between the terminal and the arbor is effective. However, the description occasionally drifts into decorative lists that feel static rather than constraining the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is lush and atmospheric, successfully establishing the "fragrant air" and "silver-veined" ridge, though the imagery leans on generic fantasy tropes. The descriptor "liquid" is overused (gold, starlight, sunlight), which flattens the specificity of the sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sensory details are vivid ("granite paths steaming") but function primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice. The setting establishes a mood but does not exert pressure on the narrative arc.

    Funhouse is rendered through advisor’s body (cold fingers, choked sob) and tool (clasp glow revealing dust motes). Selective sensory triage—sweet rot vs. blood, nails-on-glass voice—keeps pressure high. Spatial choreography is clean: hallway of mirrors, one warped pane singled out, bear corner located. Setting constrains the final choice: only the mirror-null image can serve as bait, fusing environment to tactic and earning the 9− gate.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.0)
    The floating orchard, whalebone mallet, and salt-stained Heartwood are not backdrop; they delimit range of motion and supply the literal instrument of survival. Driftwood circle, wave slap, and apple thud supply tactile markers that charge the final silence. Setting constrains every beat—no drift into white-room vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    World-Turtle shells, coral spires, salt crust, and subsonic leviathan breath are never backdrop; they dictate Elara’s instruments, her angle of approach, and the whistle’s resonant frequency. The crack is micro-setting become plot engine—its angle, temperature, and mineral lattice are the lock she must pick. Sunwashed dread is rendered through ocular glare, razor shadows, and the tactile heat that warps the reed whistle’s pitch. Final image recharges every anchor: salt plain, obsidian watchers, and spiral growth rings braided into the new arch’s light.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.0)
    The station’s ivy-choked architecture is tactile and specific—moss-softened bench, frozen clock, amber light—while the letter’s gold-leaf vines echo the living ivy, charging the final image; environment constrains action (bench as altar, ivy as witness) and mirrors internal release, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    The antique inkwell functions as micro-setting: brass temperature against ribs, scent of iron-gall, final click—each constrains timing and charges the exit image. Sensory hierarchy follows Elias’s surveyor gaze (mud, lime, wisteria ghost), anchoring the submerged pavilion without tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sunken library is not backdrop but instrument: salt-thick air warps vellum, anemone light angles reveal hidden watermarks, mother-of-pearl serpents guide footfall toward the vault. Every sensory note is filtered through Elara’s indexer priorities—fiber weave, ink chemistry, marginalia—so setting constrains her tactical choices. The final blank-end press of the stamp is charged because the coral-seagrass watermark has already fused environment and evidence. Micro-setting (the lectern stone, the lectern’s angle to light) directly enables the climax; meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment, body, and tool converge: the floating tea garden supplies the fragrant paper that will later absorb the dream; the glass basilica’s fragility mirrors the lantern’s brittle quartz and Elara’s own cracked composure. Space is coherent—waterfall mist, ascending air, dais—every distance tracked. Sensory hierarchy follows her crafter’s eye (silver-leaf, quartz clarity, crease tension). The crane on the sill in final twilight recharges every prior image; only missing a 9+ is the lack of an explicit tactical constraint from setting during the recording beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    The geode’s lattice and the viewport’s cold steel function as micro-setting, constraining her hand and gaze; their recurrence recharges the final image. Stationary choreography is flawless—no teleporting props. Sensory hierarchy obeys trauma: sight narrows to Earth’s wound, touch to crystal warmth, bone-pressure replaces hearing. “Wounded and beautiful” is POV-colored, not tourist-tag. The floating observatory never becomes a white room because its silence (dead breakers) is the ticking clock that permits the vision.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Observatory at dusk is more than backdrop: the meridian line and specific flagstone constrain the drone’s final hover, while the brass orrery socket literally shapes the closing image. Sensory economy is tight—amber light, gritty stone sigh, cool chip weight—filtered through Kael’s tracker gaze. The setting’s mechanical logic (star paths, gear tolerances) is learned through action, not dumps, nudging toward 9 but capped by micro-repeat of “brilliant dimness.”

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    Cobalt tiles, salt-stung dusk, and the splintered watch-hand carving filter every beat through Elias’s tactile guilt; the terrace finally reframes from “monument to failure” to “threshold,” directly charging the final image. Selective sensory triangulation (sound of waves, rough wood, visual bleed of blue) keeps the micro-setting vivid without checklist bloat. Environment never forces a tactical constraint, so it stops just outside the 8.5 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mist and granite are filtered through Elias’s need for “raw honesty,” not tourist catalog; parapet edges guide cautious foot placement and dagger work. The owl pull functions as micro-setting, its cold brass constraining his grip and later his gait. Weather (wind, shifting mist) times the reveal of Kaela’s delegation, so environment actively stages the exchange. Only nit: no sensory echo of salt despite “salt-stung silence,” leaving the promised taste unparsed.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    The coastal launch, splintered poles, cliff-mist, and brass compass all filter through Arlo’s mariner gaze—selective, occupational, never touristic. Utility-pole #1’s “scarred…weather and time” mirrors his skin; Venus later becomes the “diamond needle stitching night to day,” recharging the same visual grammar. Environment forces choice: when poles end, the lack of terrestrial anchor obliges skyward reorientation. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the compass in bow-as-altar constrains final tactics and images.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Fungal-lit lake and tunnel geography are specific, tactile, and charge the final image; baseball as micro-setting constrains the pivotal surrender. No orientation debt; spatial choreography clean.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    The moon-drenched orchard is not backdrop but pressure system: petals must be laid on dew-soaked earth for the ritual to root, the oldest apple tree serves as altar, its roots the eventual shared vessel. Spatial choreography is flawless—fox, stag, sparrows arrive, witness, vanish—tracking Elara’s widening sensorium. Sensory hierarchy obeys her beast-whisperer bias: scent first (cinnamon warmth, void-chill mint), then touch (moss velvet-soft), finally cosmic scale. The final image of intertwined saplings is micro-setting as transcendence; remove the orchard and the metamorphosis has nowhere to anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glade’s thin air and luminous fungi act as micro-setting that literally constricts breath, mirroring her anxiety; the altitude becomes the final cleansing inhale. Spatial anchors are immediate and POV-filtered. The saucer itself serves as portable “setting” that constrains her ritual gestures, qualifying for the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ship is sketched through salvage textures and biolum moss; the photograph itself becomes the micro-setting that constrains every move. Spatial choreography is clean—she floats upward without collision confusion. While broader astrophysics are skipped, the piece meets the 9+ gate by letting the torn corner of one photo decide the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    Black sand, warm obsidian grit, and jar glass constrain every tactile beat; the beach’s thermal pulse against bare feet steers the kneel-and-release choreography and charges the final hush, meeting the 9+ gate of environment shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    Crystalline walls that “exhaled starlight” and the half-painted sundial as spatial cipher integrate setting into tactic; the fort’s blackout literally enables the revolution’s geometry. Micro-setting (gnomon angle, hidden seam) constrains the decisive move. Only the moss’s phosphorescence slips toward generic fantasy tech; still, the velvet-lined hollow grounds it tactilely.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tidal bluff, magnetic boots, and star-dust pouch function as micro-setting that directly constrain action: boots keep her anchored, pouch fuels the spiral. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—thermal sighs, liquid-mercury waves—never tourist catalog. The restored grit under her palm charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible drift of stones or body.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    The stormlit observatory is not backdrop but instrument: the lightning flashes provide the only moving light by which Elara reads scars on paper and skin, and the thinning air literalizes the rarefying motif. The brass timer’s tick becomes a metronome for emotional pressure; its final chime is the acoustic echo of her heart’s new rhythm. Spatial choreography is immaculate—cabinet, crease, envelope, window—every object handled in goal-directed motion that keeps bodies unlost. Environment charges the final image: her palm on the cold glass vibrates with the same storm that once “soundlessly” illuminated her isolation, now harmonized with breath.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.1)
    Glass atrium, brook, half-painted sundial filter through Elara’s precision gaze; light angles couple directly to decoding task. Micro-setting triumph: sewing card’s Nordic embossing becomes star-map, constraining finger placement to micron tolerance. Spatial logic tight—no floating props. Wind gust is only environmental feedback that alters tactic, earning 9-band gate pass.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rusted beams, starlight tessellation, and the dented tin are filtered through Elara’s poet-eye; every detail performs metaphoric work without overt symbolism. The library’s spatial ribs guide the final moonlit planting; the courtyard earth is tactile and choice-altering. Weather (rain-washed metal scent) lingers as honest texture, not backdrop. No geographic drift; props (tin, seed) tracked cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.1)
    Terminal glass and abalone-bark arbor are filtered through Elara’s musician’s eye; the broken clock constrains her grip and is charged in the final image. Spatial clarity never wavers; a second sensory channel beyond sight in the arbor would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ridge is not backdrop but actuator: its silver veins conduct the memory-flare, its stones’ hum supplies verifiable data Elara’s empirical side needs. Micro-setting—the seed—changes state from inert obsidian to living root system, literally underwriting the closure. Weather shifts from oppressive petrichor to soft drizzle, mirroring internal shift from anxiety to resilient watchfulness. Spatial choreography clean: she climbs, kneels, plants, rises; petals land “precisely where the seed lay.”

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.0)
    Steam off granite, salt breeze, juniper twig under fingertip—each tactile bit is filtered through Elias’s gardener gaze and steers his ritual attention. Micro-setting (lace in palm, compass dial) constrains the only real action: the finger-crawl meditation that ignites the compass. Weather lingers as after-steam, not backdrop, so place stays lived-in. Enough specificity to hit the 9-bar gate, but the islet never pushes back or endangers him, so environment remains decorative, not tactical.

    The rusted library isn’t backdrop—it constrains and enables: its skeletal beams cast the “luminous fracture” that reweights meaning, and its cleared courtyard becomes the site of ritual rebirth. Sensory detail (rain-washed metal, gravel crunch, dust motes in moonlight) is filtered through Elara’s poetic urgency, never touristic. The coffee tin, sunflower seed, and river rocks are micro-settings that directly charge the final image. Environment and object cohere as active agents in the thematic arc.

    Setting functions as micro-setting: the terminal’s vaulted glass ceiling and the tidal arbor’s mercury leaves constrain and charge key choices. The broken clock and moonwood piano are recurring objects that evolve in meaning and directly shape the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—lavender sky, silver roots, rose-gold dusk—all filtered through Elara’s wistful perception. The arbor’s environment actively pressures the outcome by guiding her via compasses tied to emotional truth.

    The Serpent’s Spine functions as micro-setting: its silver-veined blossoms, moss-circled stones, and bioluminescent roots directly constrain and enable the ritual. Weather (monsoon’s petrichor) and terrain (ridge apex) pressure timing and location. Final image—rain amplifying the ridge’s glow—charges the setting as active participant, not backdrop. Sensory detail is filtered through Elara’s professional attention (noting resonant stone hums) and emotional state (doubt shimmering like petals).

    The islet functions as micro-setting: granite paths steam, breeze combs bonsai, rain-washed air cools skin—all constraining Elias’s ritual and charging the final image. The compass and lace are tactile anchors that evolve from props to conduits. Sensory hierarchy reflects calm urgency—droplets glisten, salt-kissed wind lifts pine—and the harbor mist of memory mirrors present atmosphere without overt symbolism. Environment actively shapes tactics: only here, post-rain, can the compass activate.
