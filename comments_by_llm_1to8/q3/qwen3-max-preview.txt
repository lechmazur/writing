  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    The greenhouse functions as more than setting—its broken panes and evolving decay constrain Elira's experiments while charging the final image of transformation. Specific sensory details (wet rot and ozone smell, dust forming hexagons near humidifier) create lived-in texture that reflects POV priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    The canyon functions as active constraint and enabler—its silence teaches patience, its frost provides artistic patterns, its isolation enables healing. Sensory details ("cold stone," "grit of ash," "spectral alphabets") are selective and purposeful. The micro-setting of frost patterns directly shapes her artistic choices and ultimate revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    The winterglass conservatory functions as both setting and instrument, with frozen structures literally responding to the tuning forks and constraining the protagonist's method. Sensory hierarchy reflects the character's adapted perception post-silence. The thermal overlays and ice fractals create a unique sensory landscape that directly enables the story's central action.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    The underwater library setting actively constrains and enables choices—lens shards must be embedded in specific architectural features, books float in "brine-stilled currents," and the environment itself "remembered light." The drowned city's impossible physics ("places where time bent, where pressure didn't crush but cradled") directly enables the solution and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Terra-cotta arbor functions as anchor point for community gathering and bell placement, constraining movement patterns. Sensory detail selective ("frost feathered the ridge," "steam curling from clay bowls") and POV-filtered through Elira's nocturnal routine. Environment doesn't quite constrain the pivotal choice, keeping it below 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.9)
    The viaduct setting actively shapes the journey—its "stone worn smooth by centuries of barefoot seekers" provides both path and history. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "jasmine and scorched parchment," "bioluminescent vines," "weeping orchids." The camera obscura functions as micro-setting, constraining how the artist perceives (inverted images, "drowned stars") and ultimately reveals the tear's location.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    The living bridge garden functions as both setting and instrument, with hyperbolic geometry constraining choices (aging under archways, shedding memories). The halo fragment's prismatic shadows and the garden's symbiotic feeding create atmosphere while advancing plot. Strong integration of sensory details that reflect Elira's professional perception.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    The abandoned carnival setting constrains movement (chains, dusty gloom) and provides the specific piano-lock mechanism that shapes the central action. Sensory details like "dust motes that danced like pollen" and "the scent of dry soil and distant smoke" are POV-filtered and purposeful. The decaying arcade atmosphere charges the contrast between past entertainment and future survival.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    The greenhouse-forge-shipwreck setting actively constrains and enables her work, with the forge burning "absences" being essential to the story's logic. Vivid sensory detail filtered through her synesthetic perception ("violet of twilight as a whispering hum"). The environment participates in the closure as the "wrecks shifted—not physically, but sonically" when she succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.9)
    The emerald station with its "moss-cracked tiles and ivy-wrapped pillars" creates atmospheric pressure, while the jar of moonbeams functions as a tool constraining her methods. The flower arrangements actively shape outcomes through their coded meanings. Setting doesn't quite reach 8.0+ as the station could be more specifically leveraged in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    The melting ice and abandoned control room effectively constrain choices—she must work with salvaged materials and accept the building's decay. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (breath curling, drip-drip-drip, rainbow shards on metal). The glass spheres function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Some passages lean abstract when concrete detail would strengthen the world.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    The rusted library setting constrains choice effectively—the protagonist must navigate "past the collapsed astronomy section" to reach the projector, and the "iron rafters bowed like tired spines" create atmospheric pressure. Setting participates in closure as embers rise "toward the rafters, painting the rusted library in flickering gold." Some generic elements ("forgotten stars," "splintered floorboards") lack the specificity that would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ambered hush functions as micro-setting that constrains perception and shapes her method, with strong sensory hierarchy (silence over sound). The storm-fort contrast creates pressure, and the gold leaf booklet's physical decay mirrors thematic erosion. Setting actively guides her final choice to descend into mapped darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frozen courtyard functions as both setting and archive, with ice preserving thoughts that directly shape the protagonist's discovery. The melting violin at closure transforms from tool to symbol with earned resonance. Some middle passages drift toward generic "frozen" imagery without specific sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    The crystal forecourt's quartz veins and rain-pooled glyphs constrain movement and enable the lens's light-focusing function that catalyzes change. Sensory hierarchy privileges sound/silence ("metronomic rhythm," "resonant hush") over sight, matching the post-verbal world where "words became unnecessary."

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    The maze functions as both physical constraint and philosophical battleground, with vines "rewriting the map daily" in organic rebellion.

The marbles-as-micro-setting constrain her ritual choices and charge the final image when fireflies echo their arrangement.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    The magnetic nexus functions as micro-setting that constrains Elira's choice (she must pull the ancient lever to test her theory), with sensory detail like "air thick with the hush of beating wings" and "bruised violet and silver" sky creating atmosphere. The station's "titanium ribs groaning" and specific details like "comet-iron" lever ground the fantastical premise, though some occupational detail remains generic.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Exceptional integration of setting as active participant—water vibrates with resonance, murals lean forward listening, the pit "remembers its purpose." The flooded opera house constrains movement and shapes discovery (program floating, chairs as lily pads). Every environmental detail serves the accumulating pattern toward the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mountain station's harsh environment actively pressures choices—the wind forces Elira inside after pinning the illustration, thin air affects breathing, and the smudged orchid becomes the setting's emotional anchor.

Environment directly shapes the performance's possibilities.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    The twilight garden functions as micro-setting that enables the dance-inscription through its isolation and moss surface that receives blood. Sensory detail ("dew-laced moss," "velvet hush of petals folding") is selective and purposeful. The moonstone dust's properties (storing resonance) are specific to this world's nostalgia ban context, though more environmental constraint on choices would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.9)
    Setting functions as both constraint and resource: dawn's liminal hour enables his practice, mist softens edges for transformation, the pier's dampness grounds embodiment. The prism-as-micro-setting constrains his method and charges the final image of transforming "laundry lines and cobblestones into a gallery." Sensory hierarchy reflects his glazier's attention to light and fracture patterns throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    The moonlit ridge functions as altar and witness, with frost-dusted pine needles and moss-cushioned boulder grounding the scene. Setting constrains through isolation that enables his ritual. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. Missing deeper environmental pressure that would elevate to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    The grotto functions as active setting—a convergence point where timelines brush together, constraining the dreamer's work to this specific location. Sensory details (moonlight fracturing, salt hexagons, bioluminescent anemones) are purposeful and support the mathematical precision theme. The tide's rhythm structures the narrative time. However, some descriptions lean ornamental ("like silk scarves in a slow wind") without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ivy-veiled passage creates atmospheric pressure through tactile details like "cold flagstone" and "moss and shattered brick," with the environment constraining choices (locals avoid the bent corridor).

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.1)
    The glacier shrine is tactile, sensorial, and charged; the carved window recess materially shapes the final act. Candlelight against blue-veined ice, breath as incense—details filter through purpose and voice. The setting evolves at closure when “the ice around it ripples, not melting, but remembering,” explicitly charging the final image. Object-as-setting (snow globe) and place entwine to constrain choice and pay off thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is vivid and purpose‑driven: rain, slick stone, washed chalk, and harbor lanterns shape action and attention. The bamboo whisk and parapet environment charge the final image; sound behaves differently “after rain,” and the washed markings prompt a gratitude beat. Sensory filtering is profession‑specific (nets, knots, tides). Minor note: constraints are atmospheric more than tactical, but the object‑as‑setting meets the high‑band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.1)
    The orchard and dust storms are vivid and integrated; weather and radiation shape perception and the diamond’s test. The environment constrains and then alters options (the storm stutters; the air clears) and charges the final image. Detail selection is POV-driven (growth rings aligned with storm cycles). World rules are taught through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory, cobalt portico, storm, and radios are tactile and POV-filtered; weather and architecture shape tactics (the lattice enabling the carrier wave).
