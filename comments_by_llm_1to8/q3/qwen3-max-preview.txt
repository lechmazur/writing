== Grader: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (no reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    Canyon setting and frost patterns constrain the artist's medium and daily rhythm, anchoring the micro-setting effectively. Spatial choreography is clean (kiln, canyon floor, rocks), and the frost's crystalline filigree is filtered through the protagonist's craft-focused attention. The final image of glass sculptures "nestled among canyon stones" charges the ending by merging setting with purpose. Sensory selection leans heavily visual; other senses are underused in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    The conservatory is vividly rendered with frost-limned glass, frozen fountain, and suspended ferns. The ice's crystalline structure constrains the tuning-fork method and the skylight guides her final gesture, charging the ending image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her mission rather than catalog. Spatial choreography remains clear across rooms.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.1)
    The underwater library setting constrains choices throughout: burlap-wrapped package arrival, books floating in brine, cathedral-rib ceilings where he embeds prisms, marble statue's hollow eye. The lens shards become micro-setting elements that charge the final image—amber radiance pulsing through the library's bones. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: salt-crusted package, molars aching from resonance, silt brushing ankles. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from refuge to deepest stacks to archive of unsent letters, each location pressuring his mission.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.1)
    The terra-cotta arbor is visually anchored early and returns at key beats (midnight runs, soup gathering, bell placement). Sensory detail is selective—frost, mist, steam from bowls—and the ridge geography constrains movement (uphill carries, eastern huts). The arbor functions as micro-setting and charges the final image when the bell is left on the stone table. Spatial choreography remains clear across time shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    The viaduct's bioluminescent vines, orchid trellis, and ironwork arches create vivid sensory anchors that guide the artist's ascent. The camera obscura's aperture adjustment and the tear's trajectory shape her tactical moves (breath alteration, path following). Spatial choreography remains clear across the climb. The setting charges the final image (blooms brighten) and constrains approach (breath-based navigation), meeting the micro-setting standard for this length and nearly reaching the 7.0 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    The living bridge garden is vividly rendered with moss-slicked arches, yew tunnels, and grass that imprints chill; sensory detail is concrete and POV-filtered through Elira's textural obsession. The halo fragment and the garden's hyperbolic geometry supply spatial constraints—walk beneath one arch, age a minute; beneath another, shed a memory—that shape her exploratory moves and charge the final touch. The environment constrains her final gesture (reaching up to caress the fragment's edge) and the silver flowers sprouting from absorbed tears anchor emotional consequence in physical change, meeting the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint and closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.1)
    The carnival setting supplies vivid sensory anchors (dust-choked gloom, grinning clown mural, broken ticket counters) and the vault's cryo-tubes constrain her method. The piano-lock mechanism matters tactically, shaping her decoding sequence. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. However, the setting functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active constraint at closure—her final walk occurs "into the wind" without micro-geography that alters her path or forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.1)
    The greenhouse with cracked glass ceiling, skeletal shipwrecks, and phosphorescent algae supplies vivid anchors and the forge constrains her method (burns absences, not fuel). The environment charges the final image: she climbs through the shattered skylight onto a moss-slick galleon deck, reinforcing her departure. Sensory hierarchy reflects her neural grafts (violet as hum, crimson as cello), filtering perception through her augmented hearing. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the transition from kneeling among petals to operating the forge under the ceiling feels compressed. The setting meets the 9+ gate test: the forge, greenhouse, and wrecks all constrain choices and charge closure, lifting the score despite minor compression.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.1)
    The emerald station's moss-cracked tiles, ivy-wrapped pillars, and Platform 3 bench ground the setting with selective, atmospheric detail. The jar of moonbeams functions as a micro-setting object that enables the spectral vision and charges two beats. Spatial choreography (archway, escalator, western alcove) remains clear across moves. The station pressures the reunions by supplying proximity and the departure-board rhythm of crossings, lifting the score into the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    The abandoned control room supplies vivid, purposeful detail—rusted chair, cracked console, dripping eaves—that charges atmosphere and supports the thawing motif. The scavenged furnace and glass rods anchor her craft in tactile specificity. Yet the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; she moves freely through the space without friction. The final image (spheres catching light, chimes) enriches mood but does not hinge on spatial logic, capping the score below the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.6)
    The rusted library and starlit setting are vivid and consistently gothic in texture, but they do not constrain a choice or alter tactics—the protagonist moves through the space without friction. The projector and the reel are handled twice (discovery, burning), which charges the ending image, but spatial choreography is vague (three corridors, collapsed sections, mural) without affecting movement or tension. Sensory detail leans heavily on visual metaphor ("rafters bowed like tired spines," "embers rising") and lacks urgency-driven selection or body-based filtering during high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ridge fort, storm, and star anchor who/where/when early. Sensory detail is vivid ("salt-crusted stone," "peeled like sunburnt skin") and filtered through the oracle's priorities. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—waves crash, wind howls, yet the "ambered hush" insulates her completely. The setting functions as mood wallpaper rather than pressure, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    The frozen courtyard functions as archive and constraint: ice preserves echoes, flagstone cracks recur across loops, twilight frames each return. The violin is handled concretely (bowed, tuned to emotional frequency, melts purposefully) and its dissolution signals fulfilled purpose. Spatial choreography is clean (bench, archway, flagstones). The body becomes micro-setting in the final beat when the robot places manipulators on its chest and feels its own vibration—an embodied anchor that charges closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects synthetic perception (molecular lattice, harmonic frequencies) without postcard ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.4)
    The crystal forecourt, rain, fractured dome, and pooled light create vivid sensory grounding. The lens and doodles function as micro-setting elements that constrain Elira's method and charge the final image. Spatial choreography (keepers emerging from colonnades, kneeling beside the dais) remains clear. However, much detail is ornamental—quartz veins, liquid stars, metronomic drips—without altering tactics or choices. The setting supports atmosphere more than it pressures action.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    The garden maze constrains choice throughout: wild spirals pressure her defiance, the altar of river stones anchors her ritual, and the canopy parting to light the marbles charges the closure. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (damp earth, jasmine shiver, firefly spirals). Spatial choreography is clean; micro-setting (marbles, altar, vine) functions as setting by constraining her choices and charging the final image. Minor issue: the broader world (actuaries, botanists, drones) remains sketched rather than textured, though this fits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.1)
    The methane sea, titanium ribs, magnetic nexus, and twilight sky are vivid and consistent. The gantry climb and lever are handled concretely (magnetized boots, comet-iron glyphs), and the roosting xenomorphs respond to the nexus convulsion, so the environment reacts to pressure. However, the station functions more as atmospheric backdrop than constraint—no tool failure or spatial limit alters Elira's tactics. The final synth-tea moment is textured but does not meaningfully tighten the choice space, leaving the setting strong on mood but short of indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.1)
    The flooded opera house is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: ankle-deep water, drowned chandeliers, chairs floating like lily pads, mold-streaked walls. Sensory hierarchy (lantern glow, water vibration, warm skin) reflects the protagonist's reverent focus. The pit itself becomes a micro-setting that constrains her ritual (she must angle the lantern "just so," water pools in the program's creases to magnify stains). Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The environment charges the final image of exhalation and settling, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mountain weather station constrains Elira's choices—thin air, biting cold, the gantry's ice-glazed metal all press on her physically. The smudged botanical illustration (a micro-setting object) charges the final image when pinned to the railing with quartz. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "snowflakes stung her cheeks, sharp as regret," "wind gnashed against the reinforced glass." The station's obsolete instruments and cramped cot anchor the isolation that forces her internal confrontation. The setting is integral to both pressure and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tunnel is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: "mildew and rust," "damp gravel," "collapsed ceiling tiles." The valve wheel—brass, beaded rim, worn numerals—functions as micro-setting that charges the closure image when she twists it and "dust falling...like silent applause" seals her acceptance. Spatial choreography is clean throughout (car → tunnel mouth → alcove → wheel). Sensory hierarchy reflects her investigative focus (touch of cold metal, auditory focus on the radio crackle). The mill's spectral backstory enriches atmosphere without consuming present action, and the tunnel's physicality constrains her search, guiding discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.1)
    The overgrown library and obsidian refuge supply vivid, purposeful sensory detail filtered through a meditative POV. The origami swan and the refuge's surface constrain the keeper's method of entry, charging the closure sequence. Spatial choreography within the catacombs is impressionistic rather than mappable, but the POV's priorities (observation over navigation) justify the approach. The river's final mention reweights the refuge's interior vision with a grounding exterior anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sage Ridge is anchored with sensory detail (moss, junipers, crushed sage, cedar) and the setting frames the gathering effectively. However, the environment does not constrain Elara's choices or alter tactics—it remains a backdrop. The curl rests in her palm and later in the girl's hands, but spatial choreography and object handling are static description rather than pressure points. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) does not charge the final image with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The reclaimed silo is vivid and specific: "grain silo rusted into reverence," bronze lamp pooling "like liquid metal," walls humming with memory. The tapestry fragment constrains the final insight and the silo ash becomes a tool she packs, charging the closure. Spatial choreography is clean (fireplace, worktable, corkboard, walls) and the environment pressures her interpretation. The micro-setting (tapestry, diaries, ash) drives the turn and shapes the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lighthouse, kelp-wrapped island, and Fresnel lens anchor the setting vividly—"salt-crusted windows," "groaning iron stairs," "beam slicing the dark like a conductor's baton." The setting does constrain Elias's daily rhythm (winding lens, checking generator) and the tidal charts guide his fortune drops. However, the environment remains largely atmospheric rather than pressing a choice at closure; spatial choreography is clear but the island's physicality doesn't force a visible trade-off in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dimensional anchor is vividly rendered through purposeful sensory choices (static and incense, heat-mirage walls, velvet moss silence) that create a coherent otherworldly atmosphere. The indigo palette functions as micro-setting, appearing in three beats and charging the climax when its drop creates the "unasked" glyph. However, the environment largely serves as backdrop; spatial properties (vortex, frayed time) are described but don't materially constrain the priest's rhetorical moves or alter his tactical options during peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.2)
    The glass spire and frozen lake anchor the setting with vivid sensory detail (mirrored surfaces, frost feathering the floor, harmonic fissures in ice). However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop for interior reflection rather than constraining choice. The nautilus shell is handled across multiple beats and recurs at closure, providing micro-setting presence. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single location.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glowing viaduct is vivid but serves as backdrop rather than constraint—hovering bare feet and phosphorescent veins establish mood without altering tactics. The procedural corridors (childhood room, staircases labeled with dates) function as thematic echo chambers rather than spatial obstacles; no door is locked, no path narrowed by environment. The frozen raindrops in the climax charge the final image visually, lifting the score modestly, but the body and tablet remain props rather than tools that shape choice.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.9)
    The cavern is richly realized (cedar staves curved like ribs, resin and burnt sage, hanging drums, rear alcove) and functions as micro-setting: the drums shudder in sympathetic resonance during the backward-song experiment, directly affecting the students' physical response. Sensory detail is filtered through Elara's non-auditory perception (vibrations, dust motes dancing, palms on floor). The broken needle resting "like a relic" on the largest drum charges the final image. However, spatial choreography of the students gathering in the doorway and sinking to the floor could be sharper, and "turning seasons" remains atmospheric rather than constraint-driving.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    The courtyard is vividly anchored (wisteria arbor, stone bench, ivy, jasmine, loose brick cache) and constrains Elias's choice: the hidden cache enables his departure, the courtyard's tranquility steadies him before the decision. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (damp earth, jasmine, barometric drift). The rail yard gate in the final beat charges the ending image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout; the environment subtly mirrors internal states (quiet dusk versus "unseen tension"). Minor: occupational tools (monocular, barometer) appear but function primarily as props rather than constraining tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.4)
    The grotto's terra-cotta warmth and violet moonlight are vivid but postcard-static across repeated nights; the setting does not constrain a choice or shift tactics. The rope is handled in multiple beats (tracing, spiral layout, village uncoiling), which lifts the score, but spatial choreography in the village square lacks blocking—where the factions stand, how the rope "brushes both sides" physically. The energy beings' light "stitches" the rope, a strong lyric reprise that charges the final image and meets the 9+ gate for object-as-micro-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    The greenhouse-and-shipwrecks setting is vivid and purposeful: rusted hulls, fogged glass, moss, and the mendicant's bowl all constrain Lira's ritual space and charge the final image. Sensory detail (salt, ash, humidity) stays selective and POV-filtered. The recurring bowl and the orchid's unfolding petals participate in the closure beat, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting elements constrain choice or charge the final image—though the choice itself remains thin, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    The amber grotto functions as micro-setting that charges the closure: its "walls shimmering like captured sunset" and humming approval embed Vael's transformation in the environment's living breath. The petal's static electricity constrains her method of sensing, and the copper bowl of burning vials delivers sensory specificity (blue-then-gold flames, scent of rain on stone) that anchors the final turn. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (workbench, velvet case, sternum, bowl), though the grotto's breathing walls and amber pulses verge on ornamental metaphor in early paragraphs before the payoff at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "breezy library under stars" and harbor locale are established early with selective sensory detail (salt-kissed air, skylight constellations, signal lamps). The locket and envelopes function as micro-setting objects that constrain Elias's tactics (hand-delivery, hiding spots). However, the environment does not pressure a pivotal choice—Elias moves through it smoothly without spatial or social friction. Occupational detail (cargo broker, manifests, margins) is present but ornamental; it does not shape the central cycle-of-compassion conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.1)
    The crystalline orchard, shimmering crater, and obsidian arbor are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (quartz branches drip liquid light, amethyst paths). The arbor constrains Lira's final choice—she must press palms and whisper her name to join the web—charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear across locations. Minor: the moth-lashed child and storm-cloud weaver appear as catalog entries without distinct spatial anchoring in their brief mentions.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rooftop canals, moss-slicked stone, singing marble, and chamber pulsing with unborn sound are vivid and purposeful. The pendant's temperature shift (cold → searing) functions as micro-setting that tracks cost. However, spatial choreography blurs during the spiral aqueduct climb and chamber discovery; the relationship between the canal system and the chamber's location is unclear, and the giant's proximity/distance remains abstract throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.9)
    The cavern orchard is vividly rendered—stalactite drips, bioluminescent fruit, mosaic stepping stone, bark grooves—and these details recur with purpose: the stone guides her calibration, the tree shudders in recognition, the fruit falls as compass. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling at stone → deeper into cavern → oldest tree), and the setting's mineral drips and root-hum constrain her interpretive acts. The glow-moths and moonbeam-wink charge the final image, lifting Q3 into strong territory. No occupational or modern-realism issues apply here.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.1)
    The library's crawl spaces, pipe chases, and stained-glass windows supply vivid, selective detail filtered through the dweller's reverent attention. The tape fragment's "cold, angular" texture and "scent of ozone" embody micro-setting that constrains her handling and charges the closure placement. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the nest, ducts, rafters, and AV archive floor. The 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is nearly met: the microfilm reader's placement is deliberate, but the choice would survive in any similar archive space without structural loss, capping the score just below 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mossy trellis is introduced early and returns at closure, and the rain/storm weather tangibly affects the protagonist's actions (sitting cross-legged, rain soaking her). Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("veins glowing faintly under the overcast like living filaments," "subterranean whisper of roots"). The setting subtly mirrors internal state (storm as baptism), though the connection occasionally tips toward overt symbolism. The final image (trellis with new shoot, moss-woven cradle) charges the closure without becoming postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tidal island is vividly particular—skeletal pines, cathedral arches, the logic-defying fresh-water well, and "the place where the tide forgets to leave" create a charged, specific locale. The island's physicality constrains action: she follows rain trails across salt-crusted floors, walks barefoot to the eastern bluff, and places the driftwood box at the tide line. The brooch as micro-setting (pinned to her smock, pulsing in moonlight, casting fractal shadows) directly charges the final exchange and closure image when she unpins it for the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.1)
    The musical crystal cave is vividly rendered with "struck chimes," "prismatic shards," and overlapping shadows that respond to the pearl's glow. The cave's acoustics and resonance constrain dialogue and shape the final chord that stills the shadows. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the setting charges the closure image when "the cave sang on."

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ivory harbor, salt-warped ledgers, and customs house attic supply vivid, purpose-driven detail filtered through Elira's archival lens. The trumpet valve is handled across multiple beats (harbor silt recovery, attic layout, council presentation, town square placement), and the harbor's fog, gulls, and brine function as active collaborators in her method. The final image—valve under open sky, rust untouched—charges closure by embodying the town's new approach to absence. Micro-setting (attic archive, water's edge) constrains Elira's solitary work and grounds the ritual's spatial anchor at the quay.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.1)
    The starlit vault, mist, flagstone, and obsidian door provide vivid sensory anchoring. The phantom punch functions as micro-setting, appearing in multiple beats (pressing to air, to flagstone, to door) and its dissolution at the end charges the closure image. Spatial choreography through corridors and staircases remains coherent, though some description (mirrors reflecting doubts, arrows spiraling) leans decorative rather than constraining tactical choices in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tower's open arches, stone balcony, and spiral stairs are vivid and purposeful. The whale migration below and stars above frame Elira's work spatially and thematically, and the tile on the velvet dais anchors her action. The wind shift and humpback's song directly influence the tile's pulse and Elira's realization, fulfilling the micro-setting test: the environment constrains her perception and charges the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through her perceptual priorities (salt winds, low-frequency calls vibrating through bone), though some metaphoric flourishes ("rhythm, as if breathing") edge toward the decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prismatic escondite functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges: "walls breathing hues no mortal eye could parse" and "solidified aurora" anchor the immortal's isolation and amplify the spatial mutiny when "angles inverted" and "the ceiling became the floor." The amulet fragment is handled across multiple beats—traced, aligned, vibrating, spinning, shattering—and its jagged surface and dimensional awareness shape tactics (waiting for the storm, aligning with magnetic crescendo). The solar storm is not mere backdrop; its "magnetic tendrils" and "charged particles" enable the amulet's activation, and the storm's violence directly precipitates the gateway opening. The final "murmuring plain" where "every step echoed with the footfalls of those who'd left before" charges the closure image with tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.2)
    The funeral home prep room is vividly rendered with specific details (formaldehyde, refrigeration hum, stainless steel tray, embalming tools) that establish atmosphere. The child's active waiting—rearranging scalpels, timing footsteps—demonstrates spatial engagement. However, the setting does not constrain the central choice; the ink works identically regardless of location, and the prep room functions primarily as tonal backdrop rather than tactical pressure. The sensory hierarchy (burnt parchment, ozone, luminescence) is purposeful but the environment itself does not shape the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bonsai forest provides vivid, selective detail ("pines bent like scholars over scrolls") filtered through the protagonist's cataloging eye, and the fluorescent lamp becomes a micro-setting element that constrains her method (pressing ear to casing, transcribing sensation). Spatial choreography is clean: mountaintop path → bonsai canopy → bench beneath juniper → deeper into maze. The lamp's "orphaned, flickering" state and the moss-crowned bench create a tactile, lived-in space. The final image—trees bending branches to shield the notepad—charges the closure by making the environment an active collaborator. No occupational depth issues at this length; the setting participates in the ending's reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    The port labyrinth and tidal rhythm constrain movement (high tide forces upward, low tide reveals new cracks) and the poison label anchors his compass metaphorically. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Elias's archival lens ("salt-stung silence," "rust and rivets"). The child's shoe moment charges the micro-setting, and the final climb to the highest container uses elevation purposefully. The setting shapes choices and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.1)
    The abandoned observatory on a cliff is vividly rendered with shattered glass, cracked domes, wind as "choir of forgotten astronomers." The rusted tripod becomes a seat; the environment charges the atmosphere. However, spatial details do not constrain the protagonist's actions—she could perform the same ritual anywhere. The setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure, though the final dawn and cliff edge image do lend resonance to the departure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    The raft city is vivid and purposeful: "salt-stained wood and rusted railings," "trapeze platforms," "defunct carousel horse" constrain Lira's vantage and tactics. The foundation stone chip functions as micro-setting object, warming against her thigh and pulsing as she works, charging the final pocket moment. Sensory detail is selective and tied to POV priorities (cotton candy stalls aligned with wind, fortune tellers near exits). The carnival setting shapes the graffiti campaign's spatial logic and the community's hidden meeting coordinates, meeting the 9+ gate of environment constraining choice and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    The moonlit summit is vividly rendered with concrete sensory anchors (regolith crunch, visor fog, Sol's first rays, Mare Imbrium's rim) and the setting directly constrains action—the thermal spike at dawn triggers the final grain's fall at 05:00 LST, making the timeframe and location essential. The hourglass itself functions as micro-setting, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (knelt beside, turned toward lander, descended). The one weakness: some occupational/technical exposition (sodium metasilicate, ilmenite, ionosphere frequency) feels like scaffolding rather than lived expertise filtered through urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mist-coated depot, copper basin, and prism are vivid and filtered through Elara's tactile perception. Spatial choreography is clear. The basin and prism enable the repair method, meeting the constraint test. Sensory hierarchy reflects her blindness—touch, vibration, pressure—anchoring POV filter effectively. Minor density: some phrases ("iron bones slick with dew") trend decorative without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and grimed window are vivid and purposeful. The window functions as micro-setting: condensation becomes the divining tool, directly shaping the protagonist's method and the closure image. Sensory detail is selective (ice groaning, brittle air, salt and age) and filtered through the editor's priorities. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting constrains choice (kneeling at the lake's edge) and charges the final image (the seam of light beneath boots), meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cobblestones, archway keystone, fountain rim, and the ebony fork function as micro-setting that constrains choices: the third cobblestone's precision, the fountain as final platform, the fork as fulcrum. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (moss-slicked, eyeless windows, choked chimneys, air-born rain). The setting charges the closure when roofs seal and gardens burst. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    The underwater temple is vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (kelp "whispered like mourners," "velvet quiet," "basalt pillar") and the setting actively constrains choice—Elira's oxygen gauge and pressure force the decision to activate the vial now rather than flee. The temple's "gathered hush" functions as both atmosphere and quasi-physical force that responds to the vial, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (kelp forests → central atrium → dais), though the submersible's role becomes vague after the initial scrape. The body-as-setting (oxygen gauge, numb fingers, dimming vision) effectively narrows options under crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, and lantern room constrain the boy's ascent and supply the mechanism (lens, rotating beam) that enables the final act. Sensory details—"brine and candle wax," "salt-crusted stones," "barnacle and brine"—are vivid and filtered through urgency. The lattice as micro-setting (the confessional object pressed into the lens housing) charges the final image by reweighting trapped confessions into broadcast truth. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (iron gate → narrow door → third landing → lantern room), though "the scuffs on a narrow door" is an odd phrasing that momentarily obscures entry. The copperlight repose recurs at key beats and modulates the tone without becoming a static descriptor.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.0)
    Capped at 7.0 per the Orientation Test penalty applied in Q2. The greenhouse setting is vivid and atmospherically charged ("iron-boned ribs," "glass panes trembling"), and the final sequence leverages environment—trees, roots, fruit—to materialize the closure image. The mandrake, carved bead pressed to bark, and nectar dripping onto Elara's tongue all demonstrate setting elements constraining or enabling the ending. Absent the orientation debt, this would score higher; the descriptive work is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    The canyon labyrinth is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (dust that "tasted of forgotten hymns," walls that "curved inward like cupped palms"). The setting does not constrain a choice or meaningfully alter tactics—it serves as atmospheric backdrop. The plate as micro-object returns with reweighted meaning in the final image, lifting the score, but the environment itself remains postcard-level rather than pressure-shaping.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.0)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly realized—"gnarled roots threading between femurs and skulls," "petals fell upward"—and sensory details (scent of damp loam, glint of quartz, echo of dripping water) guide Elara's wandering. The sundial base and ancestor stones constrain her reconstruction work, shaping the middle beats. However, spatial choreography blurs: distances between niche, mosaic, and chamber are unstaged, and the orchard's layout never coheres into a navigable map that pressures her choices at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.1)
    The golden arcade is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (honeyed light, brass mail chutes, ticker tapes) and the dawn timing creates atmospheric coherence. However, the environment remains a backdrop; no spatial element constrains a choice or charges the final image. The ebony clipboard is handled twice (balanced on knee, tucked under arm) but does not alter tactics or participate in closure, limiting micro-setting elevation.

    The cobalt observatory and autumn setting are vividly described, and the eternal flame functions as a recurring constraint that shapes her synchronization choices. However, spatial choreography during the conspirators' seizure is vague—no legible staging of how they enter, what they examine, or how she remains undetected. The setting provides atmospheric texture but does not materially constrain a peak choice or charge the final image beyond decorative recurrence.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mangrove labyrinth is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail: moss-slick roots, aerial roots tightening, branches curling, water pooled black. The leaf-windows are a memorable micro-setting that constrains action (she must lean close, trace words) and charges the final image (new droplets, messages rearranging). However, spatial choreography occasionally floats—her movement deeper is asserted rather than tracked through specific turns or distances. The setting does guide choice (roots trip her, branches part to reveal a path), pushing into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vividly rendered (glass ceiling dripping condensation, moss-slick pillar, salt and silence) and the anesthetic hum provides a constraint on perception ("weighting her limbs, thoughts unspooling"). The coral fragment and child's cast function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. However, the atrium itself does not pressure Mira's choices—she moves through it without spatial friction or resource scarcity. The setting supports tone and atmosphere but remains a stage rather than an active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ruined orchard is vivid and purposeful: skeletal trees, moss-caked stone, fog as emulsion. The circular courtyard with three arches and fractured dome provides spatial grounding for the climactic projection, and the fog actively participates in the display mechanism ("fog acting as emulsion"). Sensory detail is strong—"amber laughter, cerulean whispers, the blush of apples never picked"—and filtered through Elira's artist's eye. The final image of fog curling "like a contented cat" charges the ending without overt symbolism. Minor: the orchard's geography (central ruin, collapsed chapel) is sketched lightly; deeper micro-setting constraint (e.g., lens placement dictated by arch angles) would elevate necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sound wave garden is vivid and purposeful: brass petals, stone benches, and archways supply the ricochet mechanic that unlocks the mural. Sensory detail is selective and tied to action (the nickel's warmth, the chorus from petals). The garden constrains Elira's method—direct touch fails, reflected sound succeeds—and charges the final image as it "rearranges itself" in a living cycle. Micro-setting (the nickel, her heartbeat in D-minor) extends the constraint into embodied consequence, meeting the 9+ gate criterion.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.4)
    The greenhouse provides vivid sensory detail (damp moss tiles, humid air, hanging wasp nests, surveillance moths on brass fittings) and the environment does constrain tactics—she must disguise her work as horticulture to evade drones. The gourd vine's visual sonnet "readable only at dawn when dew caught the angles" is a micro-setting detail that charges meaning. However, spatial choreography becomes vague in the final third when "neighbors" and "a child" appear without clear proximity or movement, and the leap to "the steps of power" loses concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    The gargantuan shell functions as lived-in setting: spiraled chambers, ribbed throat, bioluminescent canopy, calcium walls. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the poet's perception (barnacle-teeth, kelp-strings, tidepools where dreams swim). The shell constrains her physically (she ensconses herself in the innermost spiral) and its acoustics shape her work (verses fossilizing into frescoes, echoes whispering lullabies). The final image of the reef glowing and the shell's interior charged by the postcard's hum integrates setting into closure, though the reef itself remains more atmospheric than choice-constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    The opal library, cloud-floor, and cracked chime are vividly rendered and the wind's arrival supplies the immediate stimulus for action. The chime's fracture constrains the caretaker's method (she cannot seal it) and the skylight location shapes her daily climb. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the caretaker's professional lens (pearlescent floors, fox-glove hued light). The recurring chime charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for environment/object constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archive's vaulted ceiling, dust motes spiraling under resonant vowels, and the glass ink well's meniscus all ground the setting in tactile detail. The rotunda's acoustics directly enable the climactic singing, and the curator's ink-stained cuffs signal his institutional presence. The drowned monastery's bell-tower library and the scent of rain on stone add atmospheric depth, though some details (chandelier emitting a tone, dust falling like snow) risk decorative overreach without clear constraint on the linguist's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    The amphitheater's acoustic properties, geothermal breath, and physical layout (cracked marble, relief carving, amber fracture) are vividly rendered and specific. The surveyor's chain functions as both tool and micro-setting, constraining her method (aligning with the fissure, snagging on the carving). The final image—stepping into dappled light—uses the caldera's rim and shadow to externalize her resolve. However, the volcano's "breath" as a timeframe device (Q9H) is more atmospheric than constraining, and the chain's "calibration for memory" remains metaphorical rather than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    The attic setting is richly detailed (foxed paper, cedar, leaning shelves, cracked skylight) and micro-setting elements (the skylight, the floorboards, the meteorite placement) constrain choices: Elara maps dust motes under the skylight's specific light, discovers the meteorite behind a shelf. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Elara's archival priorities. The final image charges the space: "Dust motes settled on its creases like applause. The meteorite glowed. The pigeons cooed. The attic breathed." The skylight's role in mapping and the attic's transformation from reliquary to living archive push this into the high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prism terrace supplies vivid atmospheric detail (rainbow mist, glassine floor, violet dusk) and the bench's grain is handled repeatedly, but neither constrains a choice or charges the final image with tactical cost. Spatial choreography between terrace, valley, cockpit cliffside, and the appearing corn maze remains vague; no distances or access rules shape Elara's moves. The piece leans on symbolic resonance (prisms, fractured valley) without grounding how the environment limits or enables her decision to step off.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    The underwater facility is vividly rendered with concrete detail: algae-slick corridors, kelp lattice, cracked viewports. The setting constrains movement (crushing depths, pressure gauges) and the fireflies' appearance through the viewport charges the final sequence. The burnt feather functions as a micro-object that signals thresholds, satisfying the constraint test for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    The geode cave is vividly rendered with prismatic halos, phosphorescent moss, and violet quartz clusters that provide concrete spatial anchors. The crater glass functions as a micro-setting focal point, constraining her final choice to press palms and receive visions. However, the cave's sensory richness is more atmospheric than tactical—it does not block or enable specific moves under pressure, remaining closer to vivid backdrop than environment-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal arcade setting is vivid and purposeful: saltwater taffy metaphor, Polaris alignment, seagull intrusion, balloon drift. Sensory detail is filtered through Elias's performer frame (moon cue, coin clinks as variables, pebbles mirroring lunar phases). The bishop's placement "angled toward Polaris" charges the final image, and the velvet rug, buckets, and conch shell function as micro-setting tools. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves, and the liminal "between acts" frame subtly guides the performance structure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.2)
    The twilight garden is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (dew-laced moss, petals folding, velvet hush), and the moonstone speck functions as micro-setting that charges the closure. However, the garden itself remains largely atmospheric backdrop; it does not constrain her choices or supply resources that alter tactics. The lyric mode prioritizes texture over spatial choreography, which fits the lens but limits the setting's causal pressure. Because orientation debt was applied in Q2, this category is capped at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pearl Bay at dawn is rendered with sharp sensory specificity (fog "like breath held too long," cormorant droplets "like scattered coins") filtered through the glazier's professional lens. The prism functions as micro-setting, constraining his craft and charging multiple beats. Spatial choreography (pier, tide pool, atrium frame, satchel) remains clear. The setting does not force a choice, but the prism's role in his work and the widow's window errand link environment to his daily purpose, reaching mid-7s for functional integration without closure constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    The moonlit ridge path, frost-dusted needles, moss-cushioned boulder, and celestial dance supply vivid sensory anchors filtered through the firefighter's reflective stance. The ridge's spatial coherence is maintained across the walk, and the path "holds its silence...it hummed with echoes" charges the final image with accumulative weight. The setting does not constrain a choice in the traditional sense, but the ridge as altar and witness fulfills the micro-setting option for textural designs. Economy is strong; detail serves atmosphere without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.4)
    The grotto is vividly rendered with tide-polished stone, bioluminescent anemones, hexagonal salt lattices. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. The obsidian disc—warm, humming—charges the final cascade, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that an object constrain choice or charge closure. However, spatial choreography of the dreamer's position and the ceiling's role in balloon transit could be tighter. The setting feels more backdrop than active constraint on her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ivy-veiled passage, collapsed antechamber, and stone fireplace are vividly rendered and spatially coherent. The film negative strip—initially carried as talisman—shifts meaning when moonlight strikes it in the hearth, charging the final image with a sense of breathing presence. This micro-object recurrence constrains her choice to leave the sketch rather than capture the glow, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (ash brushed with trembling fingers, soot on knees), though the passage itself does not pressure a tactical choice beyond framing her solitary work.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.1)
    Vivid sensory particulars ("marble tiles still wept," "spectral ribbons," "tarnished" mirrors) establish mood, but the terrace functions as backdrop rather than constraint. No spatial detail narrows choice or alters tactics; the prism parapet is handled once without consequence, and mirrors respond without environmental friction. The dusky spring setting charges the final image lyrically, lifting the score into the mid-5s, but does not meet the 9+ gate of constraining a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.1)
    The terrace is vivid and purposeful: volcanic stone, central dais, triple-moon gaze. Sensory detail (burnt sage, distant rain, starlight shifting ink hue) is selective and POV-filtered. The terrace's ritual history constrains Elira's tactic—she resurrects the oath tradition anchored to this specific location. The ebony clipboard, meteorite ink, and dove-bone pen function as micro-setting elements that charge the final act. Spatial choreography (soldiers climbing, standing shoulder-to-shoulder) is clear. The triple moons and battlefield below anchor the moment without tourism.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.1)
    The salt flat is vividly rendered with mineral crust, bruised-purple sky, and cracked earth, and it constrains the ritual by being the site of Elias's first manufactured drought, making it both setting and thematic anchor. The egg's glow and the map's cracks are specific details that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. However, the map's mechanism—lichen parchment traced by hydrologists, cracks glowing blue—arrives late and reads more symbolic than tactile, reducing its constraining force on earlier choices.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    The silver courtyard, snow, and prism are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("snowflakes caught the vibrations, trembling midair"). The prism's facets and threads function as micro-setting that structures the central task. However, setting does not constrain a choice—threads yield to patience and breath without spatial friction, and the courtyard remains backdrop rather than pressure. The final image uses setting (snow, starlight, murmurs) to charge closure, lifting the score into mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.7)
    The decommissioned radar dome is vivid and atmospheric ("skeletal ribs of Cold War machinery," "rivets into eyes, girders into grasping fingers"), and the story stick is handled across multiple beats with evolving meaning. The setting constrains the protagonist's solitary rehearsal and the candlelit shadows charge the final image. However, spatial choreography within the dome remains abstract—no tactile interaction with the curved walls or machinery that alters a choice. The seedy bars (The Rusty Needle, The Unreliable Narrator) are named but not dramatized on the page, reducing their impact to backstory color.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.1)
    The verdant grotto is anchored early with vivid, selective detail (dew-slick stone, ferns curling, gold-green vapor). The setting charges the final image—the grotto "blushed deeper, as if proud"—and the ephemerality of the space mirrors the protagonist's method. The moth wing and moss-thread function as micro-setting elements that constrain her construction choices, meeting the 9+ gate partially, though the closure linkage is more atmospheric than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sanctum is richly textured: ice-prisms refracting aurora, permafrost preserving fibers, bedrock embedding the final artifact. The rope functions as both tool and micro-setting, constraining the work physically and charging the final image when it becomes "half-unraveled, half-reborn." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though the setting pressures choice more conceptually than tactically; the protagonist moves through the environment without spatial friction or resource scarcity altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The vine-draped bunker, rusted steel, ivy-choked vents, and corroded floor grates are vivid and consistent. The wafer seal's cracked surface and the storm's rhythm serve as micro-setting elements that anchor Elara's ritual. The forest as "guardians, softening steel with chlorophyll patience" and the bunker's collapse under roots constrain the final image and charge it with symbolic weight. Sensory selection (damp moss, dust shaken by thunder, rain sliding off shoulders) is filtered through the POV and reflects the character's priorities, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ziggurat terrace, obsidian floor, bronze door, and crumbling stair are vivid and anchor the action throughout. The tile's placement "aligned with Sirius's descent" and the chalk diagrams drawn on obsidian ground the ritual in tactile, spatial detail. The setting constrains choice (he climbs alone "between regimes") and charges the final image (the chamber "bathed in indigo twilight"). Micro-setting (the tile, the chalk, the dais) functions as constraint and resonance vehicle, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "soundless sanctuary" and shifting walls (stone/glass/nothing) provide atmosphere but do not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome. The music box is handled in multiple beats (thumb over jagged tooth, pressed to sternum, placed on moss) and the moss floor appears at the end, but these remain descriptive rather than tactical. Spatial choreography is vague—no sense of room size, distance, or layout that would pressure movement.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ruined orchard—gnarled trees, thick fog, rust and wet bark—supplies vivid sensory anchors filtered through the mirror maker's craft-focused attention. The sextant fragments and obsidian glass function as micro-setting tools that constrain her method and charge the final image. Spatial choreography (circle of shards, dream alighting on a fragment, glass pressed to flank) remains clear across moves. The frost's glow and erupting apple blossoms tie environment to action, and the fog's thinning and re-thickening bookend the piece, making setting an active participant in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cathedral-orchard hybrid is vivid and purposeful: vow-trees, honey-coated spoon, ivy ladder, and thorn-caught fabric all constrain or enable the mender's actions. Sensory selection (moonlight through fruit-laden boughs, dew on cheeks) reflects POV and pressure. The spatial logic of rafters, altar, and doorway tracks cleanly. The recurring tools (spoon, honey, silver thread) anchor micro-setting and charge the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.1)
    The astral orchard constrains and charges throughout: trees bearing scrolls, atmospheric bubble, petals etched with names that dissolve into skin. The maintenance alcove (biohazard-to-crescent-moon door, fogged mirror) functions as micro-setting that enables the breakthrough. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: ozone and petrichor, stardust motes glowing like pollen. The orchard's state change—blossoms drifting downward with names—directly shapes the final revelation and charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.2)
    The mountain bookstore supplies vivid images (shelves spiraling, books growing like vines, gravity stuttering) but these details rarely constrain choices or supply resources that alter tactics. The botanical diary appears as a handled object in two beats (tracing verb roots, placing it in the hollow) but its properties don't shape the outcome—any token could have served. The shimmering absence and hollow function as lyric setting elements that charge the final image without materially narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The abandoned carnival ship is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: carousel horses "frozen mid-gallop under tarps slick with mildew," ticket booths "choked with spider silk," oil-slick puddles reflecting "constellations that didn't exist above." Spatial choreography is coherent across the descent. The setting actively constrains choice—the emerald card reacts to proximity and guides her deeper, the valve wheel must be turned to reveal the staircase, and the garden's vine-hung names present a physical threshold. The garden itself functions as both setting and conceptual space, charging the final image. Sensory detail is balanced (visual, tactile, olfactory: "copper and cinnamon") and filtered through the protagonist's perceptual priorities. The foggy bay frames the opening and closing, creating a satisfying spatial envelope.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mechanism room is vividly rendered (brass oil, dust, ticking clock, bronze stand, coiled rope) and the rope's tactile presence—its braids, threads, frayed end—charges the climactic action. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The rope qualifies as micro-setting: it constrains her method and enables the resolution. The university and tower anchor the scene early, and the dissolving door provides a charged final image that reweights the space.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    The harmonic caves constrain tactics throughout: stalactites, ice walls, crack patterns, and thermal vents all shape Ripple-mark's method. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—"limestone throats amplifying subterranean winds into choral sighs"—and filtered through her cartographic attention. The ice wall melting "from release" charges the final third. Spatial choreography is coherent across the central chamber sequence, and the environment actively participates in the bloom of hush.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glass pavilion constrains action: fractured panes allow wind and light, the dais anchors the ritual, and the structure's hum deepens into chorus as the prism aligns. Sensory detail is selective and vivid—powdered silica, low resonant moan, cooling-honey air—and filtered through the custodian's purpose-driven attention. The prism itself functions as micro-setting, its fractured geometry requiring precise alignment. The pavilion charges the final image: it "sighed" and "softened to a lullaby" as she leaves, reflecting her transformed understanding. Post-collapse setting establishes stakes (civilization ended, she works alone) but remains slightly abstract; the drowned libraries and buried observatories are mentioned without spatial grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    The observatory, crystal forecourt, and solidified fog are vivid and sensorily dense, filtering detail through the archivist's professional lens (shadow measurement, vellum, quill). Spatial choreography is clear—spiral stair, forecourt, descent. The setting does not constrain a choice or alter the final image; it remains postcard description despite its specificity, preventing entry to the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.1)
    The blooming fortress is vividly textured—petals that "release phosphorescent dust," vines that "recoil from moonlight," mosaic tiles that sing—and these details shape Lira's path and her final ritual. The kerosene rag knot functions as a micro-object that charges the ending when laid on the central tile. Spatial choreography is clear across the hall and mosaic. The setting constrains her movement and charges the closure image, qualifying for the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (water dripping with metronomic precision, wind humming a minor chord, scent of salt and wet moss). The setting constrains the chronicler's method—she dips fingers into the pool, feels chill climb her wrist—and charges the final image: "The tide turned" reconfigures the grotto's rhythm as both natural fact and metaphor for the couple's suspension. Micro-setting (the jade cicada beside the pool, starlight on its curve) and body (her fingers, molars, wrist) function as pressure points that focus perception and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.9)
    The xenial trellis is vividly rendered ("lattice of woven starlight and drifting petals") and charges the final image when the doll's golden threads merge with it. The bunker's "low ceilings of reinforced steel" and "echoing drip of condensation" anchor the opening effectively. Spatial choreography during the upward flight is loose—"ventilation shafts loosened by the strange reversal, past rusted grates and startled rats"—but the body (breath, trembling knees, lips brushing porcelain) and the recurring doll function as micro-setting that constrains attention and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drifting prism terrace functions as micro-setting that constrains movement (thermal drafts, crystalline geometry, iridescent tiles humming in response) and shapes the operator's tactics (tilt toward chime-trees for subsonic lullaby, curve around upward waterfall). Sensory hierarchy filters through professional priorities (texture of sound: brittle snap, dull thud, shrill buzz). The setting charges the closure image—tiles hum "in approval" as he turns for the next passenger, and the storm glass "stills for a heartbeat, then began to churn" in the presence of new emotional weather.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.9)
    The hidden orchard, kaleidoscopic waterfall, and bioluminescent trees establish vivid sensory anchors, and the hatch/stairway sequence integrates setting into progression. The willow's "liquid starlight" droplets and the throne woven from "forgotten laughter and unsent letters" charge the final image with metaphorical weight. However, spatial choreography blurs—how the stairway "descended, boots whispering against echoes" coexists with "solidified memory" is never concretely grounded, and the protagonist's physical actions (kneeling, brushing petals, descending) feel more like stage directions than lived navigation. The setting supplies atmosphere but doesn't materially constrain a choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sensory detail is vivid but primarily visual and metaphorical: "starlight pooled thickest," "air thickened, tasting of burnt sugar and old tears." Spatial choreography is impressionistic—threshold, sanctuary, field of lanterns—without clear distances or physical constraints. The doorknocker ring and charcoal dust anchor one beat each, but neither constrains a choice or charges the final image with visible consequence. The setting functions as lyric atmosphere rather than a pressure that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vivid and specific (cerulean/violet halos, mineral-rich air, mushrooms "leaning in"), and it constrains the convergence choice by providing the grove as anchor. The bolt and mushrooms charge the final image when they hum together and the caps thread with iridescent crystal. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The subway-tunnel detail and the Cold War sub scavenging add texture, though the occupational mycology remains light.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sepia reading room is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (dust on leather, yellowed spines, bruised-violet sky) and the gramophone functions as both setting anchor and constraint—she must align the needle, crank at the correct harmonic ratio. The space subtly mirrors her mission (grandfather's signature site, mother's last poetry reading), charging the final turn. Spatial choreography remains clear; the recurring object (crank handle) charges the closure image when it becomes "no longer a tool, but a relic of awakening."

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    The alchemical orchard is vivid and specific: mercury-root, phosphor-bark, copper troughs. The greenhouse glass and nectar-flow reversal supply atmospheric detail but do not constrain a tactical choice or alter the knight's available moves. The final vortex and threads function as climactic décor rather than environment that the protagonist must navigate or work around. Spatial choreography within the greenhouse remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    The file room setting constrains choices (she uses dust patterns as evidence, the lamp angle reveals what daylight ignored) and charges the closure image (the button on her desk as compass). Sensory details are selective and purposeful: "dust motes danced in slanted afternoon light," "fluorescent hum," the tactile lifting with "gloved fingers." The micro-setting of dust as a readable text is ingenious and drives the investigation. Spatial choreography is clean (shelves, desk, adjacent surfaces). The setting earns high marks for functional constraint and closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    The auric lagoon, submerged hatch, and analog Archive Engine are vivid and purposeful. Sensory detail is selective: "water cool as forgotten truth," "dry air thick with dust and static." The lagoon's twin-moon reflection functions as micro-setting, constraining the timing of her entry and charging the final image when she vanishes into its glow. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the underground relay station.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto functions as more than backdrop: its walls pulse with the saxophonist's phrases, dewdrops hover mid-fall, and the prism atrium's shattering directly participates in closure. Sensory detail (moss-veined walls, condensation, fractured light) is filtered through the protagonist's focus and varies with urgency. The final dewdrop "catching the last of the dawn" charges the ending image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the setting constrains the ritual's mechanics (negative space, ambient hum).

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly rendered with specific sensory choices (petrified roots, petrichor and starlight, dew-glass beads) that establish atmosphere. However, the environment remains largely decorative: spatial choreography is vague (canopy heart, root-knot, arbor floor) and the setting does not meaningfully constrain Elira's choices or alter her tactics. The dust-specks and monuments are handled, meeting the micro-setting option, but their mechanics feel interchangeable rather than essential to pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting detail is vivid and purposeful: the rust-and-rainwater workshop, the neglected greenhouse with glass teeth, the phosphorescent cavern. The compass functions as a micro-setting object that constrains choices (leading him through the greenhouse, aligning runes). The subterranean waterfall charges the final third with sensory specificity (low harmonic thrum, moss-cushioned boulder). Spatial choreography remains clear across transitions. The environment actively guides Elias's path and the closure moment (leading customers through the greenhouse) depends on the greenhouse as a literal threshold, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    The foundry anchors early and provides concrete atmosphere (rust, broken skylights, puddled stone, warped anvil). The rain functions as both mood and witness, modulating from "drumming" to "slowed" in sync with the ritual's arc. The anvil and brazier constrain Elara's actions and the "single golden seam glowed faintly on the anvil" charges the final image with physical proof of transformation. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's alchemical lens, though the "cathedral of rust and silence" leans slightly toward stock grandeur.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.1)
    The gorge's "misaligned harp" and its geology-as-instrument function as purposeful constraint: she navigates by dissonance, plays to harmonize with brokenness. The crocodile's tooth and clay flute are handled across multiple beats and charge the ending. The sunrise timeframe anchors tone but does not tighten tactics. Spatial choreography is clear (rim, narrow passage, descent), and the setting actively shapes her method and the ghosts' emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ultraviolet forest is vivid and consistent: trees absorb light and re-radiate it, the soil ripples, the air feels like a membrane. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the protagonist's trauma-calibrated perception. The setting responds to pain with resonance, shaping the protagonist's path and enabling the discovery of the symbolic clearing. The forest constrains movement and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate test, but the clearing's symbols ("curvature of a held breath, angle of a lowered weapon") are described rather than used, slightly weakening the constraint's bite at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.1)
    The alchemist's market is vividly rendered with rope bridges, suspended lanterns, and crow-feather shawls; the lens fragment glows amber with "edges sharp as regret." Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the translator's professional lens. Spatial choreography remains clear across stalls and the attic chamber. The lens fragment constrains the historian's choice (he must hold it to see the triptych's hidden layers), meeting the 9+ gate's requirement that setting or object pressure a choice. However, the market itself functions more as atmospheric backdrop than as a space that narrows options or alters tactics during the quest.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Setting is vivid and specific: cracked plaster, popcorn/sawdust smell, water-stained tile, broken marquee spelling "C_R_U_." The mainspring barrel and ceiling tile become micro-settings that enable discovery. The abandoned ticket office constrains access and charges the final image ("keeping vigil"). Spatial choreography is clean (stool, counter, ceiling, door). The one miss: the environment never pressures a choice with consequence—it facilitates observation but does not force a trade-off or alter tactics under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.1)
    The glass orchard library, frost patterns, and bottled whisper are vivid and integrate into the operator's actions—frost as instruction, whisper as tool, library as the system she destabilizes. Spatial choreography (kneeling to trace frost, lifting the bottle, stepping into melting frost, reaching through the aperture) tracks cleanly. The floating library and swirling clouds supply atmospheric pressure but do not constrain a choice or alter tactics; they remain decorative. The final image (moment placed in "The Grammar of Collapse" on a shelf that hadn't existed) charges the ending, elevating the score slightly.

    The baroque asteroid salon is vividly realized—"marble veined with fossilized starlight," comet-tail silk drapes—and the setting constrains choice: covering mirrors creates "pockets of stillness" that enable the glyphs to stabilize, directly shaping the breakthrough. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (chrono-winds, violet/gold time-streams), filtered through the protagonist's priorities. The crystal shard functions as micro-setting, charged in the opening and returning to project glyphs at closure, meeting the 9+ quick test for constraint and closure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.6)
    The resonance chamber (copper pipes, glass bells) supplies sensory texture and the chamber "answers" his song with chimes, contributing to the Accumulative payoff. The stone chip and dancer function as micro-objects that constrain choice (chip wilts near dishonesty, forcing truth; dancer's reformation depends on embedded chip). Spatial choreography is mostly clear (workbench, windows, chamber walls), but the transition from attic space to metaphysical conflict (shadows at windows, light pooling at his feet) blurs physical grounding at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    The subterranean lagoon, limestone cliffs, and calcite curtains ground the piece with vivid, POV-filtered sensory detail ("iron, salt, and something older, like the first sigh after creation"). Spatial choreography is clear across descent, water's edge, niche, and passage. The petrichor itself—distilled memory, breath of earth—recurs with escalating charge and directly shapes the final choice to enter the warm passage, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3. Minor deduction: some descriptions ("indifferent rock," "ozone tang of unseen waterfalls") tilt toward generic placeholders rather than character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    The storm-tossed archway anchors space and recurs with purpose: Elara shelters under it, carves within it, and later it becomes a communal shrine. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("turbine-hum reverie," "rain needled her scalp"). The archway's stone ribs and the projection onto cliff rock constrain her final gesture, charging the closure image. Minor: spatial transitions after "Days later" compress without clear re-anchoring, but the core setting shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting is vivid and filtered through the artist's lens: turpentine and lavender, brittle leaves, cathedral incense, melting snow. The amber pavilion bookends the story and the cathedral's etched glass constrains her discovery method, charging the final mural image. Spatial choreography is clear across locations. The flowers in her garden at the ending constrain her nocturnal vigil, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement (environment shapes the final image). Minor deduction: the pavilion itself does not pressure a choice during the narrative; it serves primarily as frame.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.1)
    Vivid images (obsidian lagoon, saltbox, brass rivets, kelp braided into chains) are plentiful but function as lyric ornament rather than constraints. The zeppelin and lagoon remain postcard backdrops; no choice is altered by access, proximity, or physical property of these spaces. Spatial choreography is vague (rope-ladder descent, "waist-deep," beach arrangements) without clear distances or body mechanics. The Orientation Test is marginal but not penalized because the piece teaches its lyric mode early; however, the lack of concrete grounding prevents the setting from charging the closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    Paper-Lantern Cove is vividly anchored with tattered silk globes, sagging awnings, and cobblestones. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. The amber bottle and lanterns function as micro-setting elements that recur and gain charge across beats. The bottle constrains the alchemist's approach (he holds it nightly, never opens it) and the lanterns emerging from cobblestones supply the town's shift. The setting subtly mirrors internal states—emptiness pooling, dust settling—without overt symbolism, and the spatial choreography (workshop, crossroads, child's windowsill) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    The skyscraper orchard is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail: gnarled plum trees through cracked marble, roots drinking from rain-catchers shaped like forgotten gods, petals holding lullabies. Setting directly enables the climactic action—petals become vessels for the Field Trip memory, released to transform street-level affect. Spatial choreography remains clean across the elevator ascent, rooftop ritual, descent, and street release. The orchard's infrastructure (brass elevator, portable phonograph, copper-lined pouch) integrates smoothly into Elira's choices. Sensory detail is filtered through her archival lens without lapsing into catalog mode.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound atrium is vividly rendered (vaulted glass ceiling, constellations refracted through frost, frozen vines like shattered chandeliers) and micro-setting details—glacial floor, black marble dais with spirals—constrain Elara's path and charge the final image when the sapling appears where the egg had been. Sensory selection is purposeful: the low resonant tone "felt in teeth and bone," droplets rising upward, scent of loam. The atrium's transformation (ice weeping, vines uncurling, starlight pooling on petals) directly enables and visualizes the closure effect, meeting the 9+ gate criterion that environment or object charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sanctuary setting and the rope as micro-setting constrain the protagonist's work and charge the final image (rope "curled at her feet like a contented cat"). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (wind-polished stone dust, salt-thick rope, dew-point dips). The mountain's physical presence shapes the bell's mechanics and the spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tracking station is vividly particular ("wind-chime sensors," "analog dials"), and the yellow lantern glass anchors multiple beats with concrete handling. Spatial choreography is clean (deck, scope, console), and sensory details (star-dust whispering, embers, gravitational sigh) filter through the janitor's reverent attention. The setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics at closure, capping the score below 9.0, but the micro-setting (lantern glass as lens) charges the final image and the station's hum aligns with the thematic release.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.1)
    The scorched wasteland, ruined hives, fractured roof, and stained glass box function as micro-setting that constrains the recluse's ritual and charges the final image with refracted light. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "slants of ashen light," "grit," "dust at her feet," "honey-gold glyphs." The box's cobalt/amber/emerald panels return with reweighted meaning at closure, grounding the conceptual covenant in a tactile object. Spatial choreography is coherent; the eastern wall, honey press, and collapsed hive anchor ghost-stories without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    The emerald silo is vivid and recurs throughout, framing the space and charging the final image when its walls ripple and hum in harmony with the urn. Sensory detail is dense and purposeful: "refracted light," "glaze still warm," "scent of rain and old paper," "translucent figures." The salt flats and silo's curved walls create a contained, lived-in micro-setting. The urn fragment and capsule function as tactile anchors that constrain Vey's investigation and enable the climactic fusion. Spatial choreography is clean; the workbench, threshold, and core remain legible across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt lagoon supplies vivid sensory anchors ("spilled ink beneath a bruised sky," "wet sand") and the setting constrains Elira's perch and the boy's proximity. The feather functions as micro-setting, a tactile object that warms during the song and charges the closure by being laid atop the kite. Spatial choreography (shoreline → dune crest → water's edge) tracks cleanly. The setting modulates with pressure: storm memory → dune encounter → twilight resolution, each shift supporting the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    The orchard setting is vivid and purposeful: living stone pillars with moss-root hollows, copper-wrapped oaks forming archways and stairs, and the Whisper Arch all ground the world in tactile, recurring detail. The environment subtly constrains choice (Arlen climbs the Spiral Stair on his final month, ties the diary to the highest branch) and the spatial choreography of Pillar Seven, the moss bed between Pillars Three and Four, and the burial site under the Whisper Arch is clear and consistent. Sensory selection (mist at dawn, bees humming, auroras overhead) reflects Arlen's calm, unhurried focus, and the copper-wire method integrates into action rather than remaining decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.9)
    The rainwashed tower, mossy earth, lichen-etched walls, and amber at the polished center all constrain movement and charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the protagonist's scientific lens (petrichor, ozone, spectrometer hum). The tower's circular chamber and concentric rings become the site of her shift from measurement to immersion. Micro-setting (the amber, the worn stone) functions as both object and spatial anchor, shaping her final choice to leave it as a coordinate.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "sun bled orange into indigo," "jetty's moss-furred planks," "dust that smelled of monsoons and monasteries." The jetty as micro-setting constrains action (kneeling between slats, tide lapping at edges) and charges the final image of dark earth patches left behind. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The piece qualifies for the 9+ gate by making the jetty's texture and battlefield history shape the planting choices, though some descriptions ("blooming jetty") remain poetic rather than materially grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    The scrapyard is vividly particular: rusted transmission towers, tank hulls, stoves fueled by circuit boards. Spatial choreography is clear across beats, and the bunker discovery supplies a crucial resource. The wax leaf constrains Bracken's interpretive work (tinted shadows spelling truths), charging the final image with its glow "soft as breath." While the setting shapes tactics and the micro-object (leaf) recurs with purpose, the environment's pressure remains constant rather than evolving causally with events.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    The observation deck is vividly rendered with sensory specificity: breath misting, echoed silence, chronal hum as "memory of motion." The temporally stretched stars are concretely visualized (Orion "like taffy," Vega "smeared into a teardrop"). The sketchpad and compass applique function as micro-setting elements that constrain her action and charge the final image. The setting modulates from oppressive to companionable by the end, mirroring her stance shift. Strong integration of environment into character perception.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.4)
    The spire setting is vivid and sensory (frost-glazed stone, eerie luminescence, static-and-snow air), and the icebound environment shapes Elric's physical approach. The Obsidian Table and its pieces are described in tactile detail. However, the environment does not constrain a choice at closure; Elric completes his task without spatial resistance. Micro-setting (the board, the pieces) charges the final image but does not alter tactics, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.1)
    The whispering gallery is vivid and purposeful: its domed ceiling echoes silence, and the protagonist's walking patterns trace glyphs "only the architecture remembers." The space constrains choice—survivors walk beside the protagonist, adding their own patterns—and the gallery's echo absorbs the widow's unbinding gesture. The pawnless chessboard is placed "at the gallery's heart" and catches window-light, charging the final confrontation. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) drives multiple beats and the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mountain-bookstore supplies vivid, purposeful detail: shelves as tectonic plates, inverted atriums, the seventh sub-basement. The architecture "breathes" and rearranges in response to the seer's action, directly enabling the climactic threshold. Sensory selection (mercury slide, parchment whisper, feather texture) is filtered through the seer's craft. The recurring stone and feather constrain the ritual method. The final room's specifics (jars of laughter, pressed flowers) charge the closure image with tangible anchors, lifting the category into the mid-7s despite the abstract tone.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    The time-frozen village and platinum labyrinth ground the action with vivid particulars: cobblestones holding breath, tapestries with dangling threads, tarnished silver mirror. The tutor's interaction with the tapestry border (kneeling, tracing threads) constrains her choices and the mirror charges the final image. Spatial choreography inside the labyrinth is coherent (corridors, turns, heart). Minor gap: the village's thaw (leaves stir, coin clinks) lacks specificity about how her work causally triggers the release.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    Bone towers, canyon echoes, and the pale spire constrain every choice and charge the closure image. The towers hum with residual grief, the canyon refracts sound into altered meaning, and the spire's mist thickens/dims in response to her sessions—each detail applies pressure. Spatial choreography is clean: atop the tower, casting poems into the canyon, the elders gathered below. The child's silent music box and the final scent of rain and burnt sugar offer specific, non-generic sensory anchors. Micro-setting qualifies: the tower's cold ridge, the canyon's drowsy echoes at dawn, and the spire's face-like revelation all shape tactics and the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    The acid-sea workshop is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (green fumes, hissing waves, trembling iron floor) and applies immediate environmental pressure throughout. The sinking hull and corroding rivets create genuine spatial constraint that shapes the urgency of the alchemist's work. The key ring charm functions as micro-setting, warming and gleaming at closure to charge the final image. The statue's pockmarks serve as tactile anchor points for the ritual. Strong purposeful detail integrated with action; the environment directly enables and threatens the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.1)
    The coastal cave is vividly rendered (kelp-slick steps, salt crystals, dripping metronome, brine smell) and constrains her choice to paint on its walls rather than her usual quay easel. The painted seashell serves as micro-setting object, charging the final image when left behind. Sensory detail is dense and filtered through the painter's professional eye, though the cave does not evolve causally with events—it remains static backdrop after the painting act.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt lighthouse is vividly anchored with color, texture (peeling paint, cold railing, blistered fingers), and function. The cork object constrains the protagonist's action (pressed to lips, vibrating, warm in palm) and charges the final image when tucked into her vest. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's professional attention (beam pulse, scent blooming outward). Minor issue: the sea and ships remain somewhat generic despite the specific scent catalog; spatial choreography is clean but not pressured by environmental obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.2)
    The starlit signal station supplies vivid atmospheric anchors (rusted gantry, broken dish array, Junction 7 silt) and the censer foot's bronze hum offers tactile specificity. However, spatial choreography across locations (gantries, alleys, thresholds) remains vague, and the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it serves as backdrop. The censer's ghost-heat and hum charge the final image modestly, lifting the score within the capped range (Q2 orientation penalty caps Q3 at 7.0).

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ravine orchard is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail—moss-slick roots, swaying bridges, half-rotted fruit, mist—and constrains movement and choices (kneeling in damp earth, navigating swaying bridges). The glass eye as micro-setting object charges the final image when she places it in the lightning-split tree. Spatial choreography remains clear across all moves, and the mycelium/soil refrain grounds the ending's thematic weight without becoming ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    The opal dock, mist, and nautical twilight are rendered with strong sensory specificity and filter through Silas's eccentric perception ("sky bled indigo," "mist thickened like breath held too long"). The boutonnière functions as micro-setting: its crackle, texture, and scent anchor choices and charge the closure image when Silas pins it beside Elara's photograph. The lighthouse's lowest drawer and lantern beam also constrain the final gesture. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cavern setting is vivid and purposeful: phosphorescent fungi, midnight-blue blossoms, petrichor air, and the rising creek anchor the threshold space. The matrix chip—cold metallic, glyphs that shimmer and pulse—constrains Elias's path through the ants and charges the final image when it fuses to his skin. However, spatial choreography falters: the "rusted iron door he'd never noticed" appears without prior cues, and the shop's post-arch transformation (clean floors, open windows) lacks causal grounding. The creek's rise is mentioned but does not pressure tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cobalt grotto is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (mist "like crushed sapphires," veins of cobalt threading obsidian, scent of ozone and old roses). The fireflies and bleeding starlight shape the queen's path upward, constraining her route through brambles. However, the grotto itself functions more as symbolic backdrop than as environment that pressures a choice; the pool reveals scenes but does not alter her tactics in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ember nexus is sensory and recurring (pulsing warmth, molten crimson glow), and the columella's tactile spiral anchors multiple beats. However, the nexus functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice—its "approval" sigh is decorative. The vial of liquid twilight and phoenix-ash are invoked but not handled in ways that alter tactics. Spatial choreography (alchemist's position, Elias leaning on the monolith) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cabin is anchored early with vivid, selective detail ("pine resin and damp wool," "old timber sighs," "wind outside scrapes branches like quills against parchment") that reflects the chronicler's professional lens. The birch bark scroll functions as micro-setting and constrains a choice—its fibers "repel my pen, as if memory itself resists being tamed"—before the protagonist writes through the jealousy and it "darkens with script, absorbing my rage." The mountain setting charges the final image ("valleys I'll never hike sober again") and the scroll "hums against my thigh, warm as living skin," integrating environment and object into the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    The water clock shop grounds the piece with tactile specificity: damp counter, leaking reservoir, cracked escapement wheel, and the dismantled bronze ribcage. The birthing screw and broken clock function as micro-setting objects that constrain Elara's choice to sanctify rather than repair, charging the final image. The fog modulates from "hush" to "thinning" in step with her internal shift, and the therapy table at the end reconfigures the opening shop space. No occupational depth is required here; the recursive object-world does the work.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating rock platform suspended by geomantic currents is vivid and constrains the ritual—altitude, vibration, and mist-shrouded valley charge the ceremony. The crow quill, linen-wrapped wrist, and untouched tea are selective and purposeful, each anchored to her state. Sensory detail (wool-soaked-in-honey air pressure, midnight-moss ink, chalk sigils) filters through Elira's scholar-turned-superstition lens. The platform's resonant hum at the climax directly shapes the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate; spatial choreography (kneeling, quill to parchment, lifting cup) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    The archive setting (marble floor, Restoration Room, labeled shelves) anchors early and supplies the tweezers, brass lamp, and manuscript as tactile objects. The orchard timeframe recurs at closure, creating spatial and temporal brackets. The perfume bottle and copper coil constrain the reconciliation method, charging the final image. Sensory detail (jasmine, vanilla, smoke) is vivid and filtered through memory, though the golden-thread visualization reads slightly ornamental rather than a choice-altering resource.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.1)
    The temple library is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: "books shelved not by title or author but by resonance, their bindings humming in low, harmonic frequencies." The setting charges the final image and recurs with evolving meaning (shelves rotating, the domeless sky revealing eyes). Spatial choreography remains clear despite the abstract atmosphere. The dictionary and regret-bound volume function as micro-setting objects that constrain the witness's actions in multiple beats.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    Setting detail is vivid, selective, and purposeful: frost-laced gravel, hydraulic pistons sighing steam, horizon lenses refracting light, ice floes cracking in sympathetic rhythm. The station's mechanics and the fjord's isolation filter through the shepherd's professional priorities, avoiding tourist catalog. The station's "no windows facing land" and the basalt promontory constrain the shepherd's perceptual world, and the hydraulic arms' stilling at the climax charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects the shepherd's focus on temporal measurement over social context.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    The rainwashed library, mica lantern, and subway seats are vivid and purposeful: the lantern's "paradoxical glow" filters perception, the grate and bench-slat placement shapes Elara's scrawl tactics, and the father's rehab ward beeping "like slot machines" anchors character priority. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered. However, the lantern's constraint on choice is implied (she "gets close to truth" when it shimmers) rather than forcing a visible fork in action. The micro-setting charges atmosphere but doesn't lock a final image.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    The subway utility tunnel is vivid and purposeful: "damp concrete walls wept condensation," "air tasted of iron and ozone," retrofitted signal station with rotary dials and patch cables. The glass harmonica disc charges the final image by spinning on its own and absorbing the operator's voice. The timeframe "between the hum of streetlamps" recurs and brackets her shifts, anchoring the nocturnal rhythm. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (booth, switchboard, disc propped beside it). Setting and object work together to supply the story's atmosphere and constrain the operator's method, though the tunnel itself does not force a tactical choice—it serves primarily as immersive backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    The blooming jetty at twilight is vivid and sensory (salt-crusted planks, jasmine curling through cracks, lanterns, tide sounds), filtered through the archivist's reverent attention. Micro-setting elements—locket, journal, walnut ink—recur and are handled on the page. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the setting functions as atmospheric container rather than pressure source. The jetty's spatial choreography is clear but static, and no environmental detail forces a decision or shifts the final image beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.1)
    The disused railway station is vividly rendered with concrete, POV-filtered detail (ivy-draped arches, rusted rails, Platform 3, gravel and brittle leaves). The setting enables Elara's project spatially—the folding table, thermoses, chalkboard—and the final image of the station "teeming with mismatched souls" charges closure by reweighting the abandoned space. Sensory selection (crunching boots, lukewarm tea, wind smelling of rain) reflects Elara's priorities. Minor gap: the station doesn't actively constrain a choice during escalation; it functions more as stage than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ultrasonic forest constrains perception throughout—trees vibrating beyond hearing, moss chiming like glass bells, mushrooms pulsing C-minor. The platinum ring functions as micro-setting, guiding inward and glowing at closure when placed on moss. Sensory hierarchy filters through the protagonist's synesthetic perception: she reads emotional topographies through touch and sound. The stillpoint's "hollow sphere of silence" between oaks charges the final image by negating all prior sensory accumulation, making the absence palpable and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.1)
    The gravitational anomaly as setting is vivid in the opening ("light bent in lazy spirals," "ground rippled like water under parchment") and returns to constrain the editing action in paragraph three. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful but remains metaphoric rather than spatial—no clear layout or physical navigation. The anomaly's "tidal throb" and "membrane" provide texture but do not impose tangible obstacles or resources that alter tactics. The final image of "gentle curves" charges closure modestly. Micro-setting qualifies here: the pen and the anomaly together function as a constrained editing environment.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.1)
    The harbor setting is vividly rendered with "spilled mercury" and lantern flickers, anchoring who/where/when early. However, it remains postcard description; no environmental feature constrains a choice or charges the final image. The vintage camera is handled twice but never as a tool that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is clean, and sensory detail is selective, but the setting does not drive pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.1)
    The archive supplies vivid images—"petrified ink and salt," "obsidian and silence"—but remains a museum backdrop rather than a constraint shaping tactics. The tapestry fragment is handled in one beat, described in another, then solved without the environment resisting or enabling her moves. Micro-setting option (her body, tools) is underdeveloped; no object meaningfully narrows her choices or charges the final image beyond decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    The auric lagoon, sound wave garden, and sonic sculptures create a coherent micro-setting that constrains action—her drumming triggers harmonic chimes, vines tremble, pools ripple. The lagoon's reflection showing twenty-seven faces is a strong anchored image that charges her final acceptance. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through her entangled perception, though the "liquid light swirling" and "tendrils curling" lean toward stock lyricism. The garden's responsiveness shapes the climax directly, meeting the 9+ gate of environment constraining choice and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    The container labyrinth is established early with rust streaks, sodium lamps, junctions, and gantries that shape Lena's navigation choices (the gap "no wider than her shoulders" gates access to the keyhole). The storm's static interference disrupts her usual tool (listening for gaits) and raises the stakes. The keyhole bolted to the gantry charges the final discovery by positioning Lena to overhear Delgado's confession from above—environment directly enables the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt dock, iron shutters, and dental mirror supply tactile particulars. The shutter mechanism directly enables the guardian's method, constraining her toolkit to light-bending rather than speech. The canal's "stillwater tension" and "ancient and hungry" darkness frame the stakes spatially. The final unbroken starlight charges the closure image with environmental proof of the guardian's success.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.2)
    The cobalt library, mist, and windows are vivid and purposeful, anchoring the setting early. The grotto's glow and the phantom arbors create a coherent magical-realist atmosphere. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the library's stacks and courtyard do not constrain Elira's choices or supply obstacles. The sundial's alignment with Polaris is a functional detail, but spatial choreography across the town (bakery, barbershop, bus depot) remains abstract, never tested by on-page friction or proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sublittoral fringe, bioluminescent kelp, and tide-worn crates anchor the opening with sensory specificity. The scrimshaw's warmth and the glowing shore beneath Lira's feet charge two key beats. However, the "disappearing island" remains conceptual: it surfaces as light, not rock or reef, and imposes no spatial constraint on her wading or her final return to the docks—its presence feels symbolic rather than a lived environment that alters her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.1)
    The farmhouse, turbines, and dried bouquet create a coherent micro-setting. The turbines' "remade hush" and their brief stalls provide sensory anchors filtered through the protagonist's priorities. The whittling block and bouquet constrain the protagonist's choices—sealing the flowers enables compliance, and the turbines' pause allows the whispered "I miss you." Spatial choreography (porch, stove, Compliance Station, return to porch) tracks clearly across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cobalt atrium and frozen lake supply vivid, specific images (quartz hum, bruised twilight, glacial marble). However, the environment remains decorative—no spatial constraint shapes a choice, no tool or object alters tactics. The poet moves through space without friction. Micro-setting allowance is met (body/pillar interaction), but the final image (stepping onto ice) does not hinge on environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    The courtyard is vividly anchored (cobblestones, cracked birdbath, ash-patterns, overgrown flora) and directly constrains Elias's choices—he arranges plants by "stem stiffness, leaf serration, root depth" and wedges the reed beneath a slate tile "angled just so." The micro-setting (soil, specific plants, the kiln mentioned at closure) charges the final image when Marta rearranges charred sunflowers and green shoots push through. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's textural perception (moss as "damp velvet," maple as "brittle crackle").

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.1)
    The laboratory is vividly rendered with vacuum tubes, wire harps, and quartz pedestal—each detail serves the ritual and charges the sensory release at climax. The miner's lens as micro-setting object constrains the central action (refracting the tuning fork's vibration into prismatic echoes) and reappears in the final beat, glowing and transformed. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the lab's "breath in pulses" reflects Elira's reverent attention without postcard excess. The 9+ gate is narrowly satisfied: the lens and pedestal constrain the key choice (where to place the lens, how to angle it) and charge the final image. Minor deduction for the lab's rules (why vacuum tubes hum sympathetically) being asserted rather than discovered through goal-directed action.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.2)
    The observatory is evocative ("curtains of intention," dust-sheeted mirrors) but remains a backdrop; no on-page choice is constrained by the space, and the protagonist works alone at a bench with tools that do not alter tactics. The locket, stencil, and origami appear across beats, but their handling is ceremonial rather than pressured. Sensory detail is selective and poetic, yet the setting does not impose friction or resource limits that shape the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    The skylight loft is established early through rain glyphs, corkboards, shoeboxes, and drafting table; these anchors remain stable and return with purpose (vellum sheet, pinned maps, the tea offered to the visitor). The measuring tape functions as micro-setting, constraining her methodology and charging the final image. Thunder, rain intensity, and dawn's arrival modulate atmosphere in step with the cartomancer's progression from solo labor to shared recognition. The old stock exchange and university locations pressure the cultural mapping but remain off-stage; the loft itself does not force a tactical choice, which caps the band slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bronze prism pagoda constrains the climax (warm surface, shuddering response to song) and charges the final image when it cools, fulfilling the 9+ gate for environment participation. Archive details (fractured dome, tilting shelves, scrolls unspooling) are vivid and filtered through urgency, though the civilization's backstory (twin moons festival, scraped promises) leans expository. Spatial choreography is clear: kneel, move, place palms, rise, turn toward exit.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.7)
    The blooming library above clouds is vividly rendered with petal-chandeliers, floating shelves, and moss-textured books, filtered through Elira's vigil-focused attention. The river stone grounds tactile contrast (smooth, cool, dredged from water-world below) and its warmth at the end signals responsiveness. The stone constrains her final choice: she embeds it in the data-core, and its pulse ripples into the dream-feed, altering sensory texture (wind's bite, lavender soap). Spatial choreography is clear (reading nook, twin screens, western arch, central archive). The setting supplies both symbolic and functional resources that shape the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    The misty workshop is anchored early and returns at closure ("mist met sky"), bracketing the piece with purposeful atmosphere. Micro-setting elements—brazier embers, lantern glow, glass case—ground tactile choices (laying out tools, blowing out the lantern) and the workbench clutter signals her vocation. The tail tip itself functions as object-as-setting, constraining her midnight reconstruction and charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy is consistent (moss-stained floors, lichen pigments, starlight clarity) and filtered through her professional lens without catalog listing.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tower, cellar, and cathedral catacombs are vividly anchored with sensory specificity (moss-slick flagstones, dew, fossilized roots). Spatial choreography is clear across moves. The coffee-ring table and the hourglass on the windowsill/cellar floor function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice and charge the final image (sand resumes, rings rearrange). These elements elevate the score into the 7-band under the micro-setting allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    The projection booth is vividly rendered with specific textures (dusty velvet, ozone, rusted canister, oilcloth bundle). Spatial details constrain action: the hidden compartment under the projector's baseplate drives discovery, and the descent down the spiral staircase marks transition. The setting charges the final image through the theater's exhale ("walls lighter, shadows less burdened"). Sensory hierarchy reflects the gazer's priorities (touch dominates during psychometry, scent punctuates transitions).

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.1)
    The aurora-lit archway is vividly rendered and recurs across beats, but it functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint. The instrument is handled in the climax and "grew warm," yet its mechanics do not alter her tactics or foreclose an option. The setting charges the final image with auroral glow and frozen tears, meeting the micro-setting allowance, but the archway itself does not pressure a choice. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, filtered through her moonstruck lens, lifting the score into the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glowing dune in bloom anchors the opening with vivid, particularized detail (bioluminescent petals pulsing like heartbeats, petals encoding tree sighs) and the setting evolves causally—petals glow brighter after the sphere awakens. The archive's glass corridors and the dimly flickering sphere constrain the guard's search, creating spatial pressure. Sensory selection remains purposeful and filtered through the guard's mission focus, meeting the micro-setting test by charging the final image when the dune blooms brighter in his wake.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mechanical rainforest is vivid and purposefully textured (brass vines, copper leaves, turbine rocks, mercury waterfall). Sensory selection is selective and filtered through the philosopher's tuning-fork perception. The forest environment constrains movement (vines unspooling, roots retracting) and the Edge supplies the final spatial pressure. The mercury waterfall moment where the gear "remembers weight" charges a later choice, lifting the score into the high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.1)
    The veiled ridgeway, moss-slick railings, gnarled willow, and crumbling shrines create a vivid, purpose-driven environment that reflects the guides' reverent search. Spatial choreography is clear (ridge's crest, descent through switchbacks) and sensory detail is filtered through the POV ("salt and silence on their tongues," "moon-bathed ferns"). The recurring star-punch holes function as micro-setting, leaking quiet light to guide the way. The shoe and whistle—small objects half-buried in clover—charge the final image and constrain the guides' ritual response, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment shaping closure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cobalt fortress under snow, the dusty spiral staircase with its color-shifting stain, and the piano with the missing bolt all constrain choice and charge the final image. The stain functions as oracle and barometer, grounding his daily ritual; the bolt's removal and replacement drive the central turn. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (frostbitten hope, muffled howl, cerulean shimmer). The body and recurring objects qualify as micro-setting that shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ancient temple library is vivid and purposeful: "dust motes danced in starlight older than kingdoms," "books lined the walls like tombstones." The Celestial Alcove and sacred font beneath the throne are concrete locations that constrain the protagonist's approach and supply the mechanism for unmasking. The iron gall ink pellet functions as a micro-object whose properties (dissolved in water, reacts with skin) directly enable the climactic revelation. Spatial choreography is clean throughout (vaulted halls, gallery vantage). The "constellations outside the shattered dome paused mid-drift" motif recurs and charges the closure without becoming a checklist symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    The station on stilts, drowned mangroves, and waterlogged generator housing are specific and purposeful; the submersible descent through "silt and gloom" to bioluminescent coral directly charges the closure image. Sensory detail is filtered through Elara's professional lens (spectral graphs, dissolved oxygen) and the setting constrains action (wading through brine, using tweezers). Spatial choreography remains clear across beats, and the micro-setting of the console and viewport recurs with functional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.9)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay, shattered dome, and subsonic stone circle create vivid spatial anchoring and charge the final image through bioluminescent panels and the hum that syncs with the protagonist's breath. The opera glasses function as micro-setting (body/tool) that reframes perception twice (stars, then stones). However, the setting enables rather than constrains choice; the stones respond to attention without resistance, reducing tactical friction. The bay's details are atmospheric but do not force a trade-off or narrow options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.1)
    The volcanic hot springs supply visceral anchors (steam, sulfurous vents, obsidian stone) and constrain the grandmother's ritual space, satisfying the micro-setting standard. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through urgency (steam curling, warm stone, bubbling springs). The kite snagged in a skeletal tree returns at closure, charging the final image. However, the broader Reconstruction setting—temples as ration depots, rewritten songs—remains abstract and does not materially shape on-page choices or the unsealing attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    The arboretum's overgrown paths, ivy-swallowed benches, broken greenhouse panes, and storm-bent cypress are selective and filtered through the protagonist's attention to texture and survival. The cliff, gap in the fence, and daily dawn return create spatial constraint that charges the closure—"I climb through the gap in the fence like a secret kept between me and the cliff." The dewdrop-as-pearl and the way vines frame abandoned sketches show setting as active collaborator. Sensory hierarchy (barefoot on damp soil, moss spirals, gull cries timed to waves) reflects the protagonist's grounding practice without becoming a checklist.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    The forgotten library inside a lighthouse is signaled early and returns throughout: damp stone, salt-crusted windows, spiral staircase, shelves "leaning like drunkards." The setting constrains her isolation and provides materials (parchment, books, tarot box) that she handles across beats. The final beat—walls closing in "not to crush, but to cocoon"—charges the ending image with the location's pressure. Spatial choreography is clear (cross-legged on floor, barefoot on tapestry, staircase inverts above), and the lighthouse's crumbling state persists at closure, grounding the transformation in place.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    The wind-carved encampment is vivid and purposeful: erosion shapes structures, gusts funnel whispers, cracked clay holds shadow-traces. The setting anchors the tracker's isolation and her work with ephemeral materials. Ghostwing's micro-shadows interact with the ink, and the spilled droplet blooms on stone—environment constrains and enables her experiment. The body (temples, breath, pulse) functions as micro-setting when she applies ink to herself, charging the final disappearance.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.1)
    The library setting is vivid and textured—frosted glass, data-crystals, Resonance Table, neural echoes in marble columns—and the environment directly enables the archivist's choice by housing the dormant networks. Snow and cold recur with purpose, constraining movement and charging the final spectral image. The chrono-globe, fiber-optic veins, and "Silent Scandal Wing" ground the world in speculative plausibility. The body (trembling fingers, breath) and the cryo-wax shell function as micro-setting elements that charge key beats. One gap: the spatial choreography when guards arrive is clean but brief, and the detention moment bypasses physical constraint detail that would sharpen the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glass dome, red soil, ballast sandbag scrap, and knife are all concretely present and handled across multiple beats. The dome's "liquid gold" light and the scrap's "coarse weave" constrain Elara's choices (salvage, planting, gifting) and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The micro-setting (sandbag-lined planter, knife sheath ritual) functions as setting and directly shapes her present actions.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sound wave garden is vividly realized through "tones bloomed like iridescent kelp," "choral ferns," "chime-bloom shattered," and the sonic strata. The rail spike constrains the fisher's final action (conducts the bass note) and charges the closure image (cracked, tucked as tuning fork). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (kneeling, raising spike, standing). The micro-setting (body, spike, soil) shapes tactics and the ending, meeting the 9+ gate test, but sensory hierarchy could be sharper—urgency doesn't consistently narrow perception.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    The observatory, telescope, and city-below are vivid and specific. The modified scope with spy-satellite optics is a purposeful tool that constrains her investigative method and charges the final proof. The brass railing, iron ribs, cloud layer, and rooftop archive create a legible spatial frame. Sensory detail is filtered through her POV (cold metal, smoke patterns, mist-covered embers). The setting directly enables her surveillance tactic and the proof photo, satisfying the Q3 9+ gate's demand that environment constrain choice or charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lab is described vividly ("echoes of forgotten lullabies hummed beneath glass jars") but remains a static backdrop; no spatial constraint shapes her choices. The amber returns at closure and the cradle's resonance shifts, but these do not alter tactics—they serve as symbolic markers. The body and tools (needles, ink, wax) are mentioned but not used in ways that constrain her final action. Sensory detail is dense but ornamental, not integrated into decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.1)
    The grotto's mist, limestone scent, and dripping stone anchor the setting vividly and filter through the protagonist's sensory hierarchy (she notices "wet limestone and moss rising like a question mark"). The whispering gallery tile flake functions as a micro-setting object that constrains the mandala's center and triggers the climactic hum, satisfying the 9+ gate criterion. Spatial choreography remains clear (kneeling, finger-tracing, standing, brushing sand from knees). Minor deduction: the rain-on-glass rivulet mandala at the end feels decorative rather than a constraint on her next choice, and the grotto's walls "absorbing sound, then returning it in fractured whispers" is described but never leveraged as a tactical resource during the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.1)
    The shattered plaza, ash, fractured arches, and mosaic stepping stone are vividly rendered and consistently present. The tessera's physical properties (cobalt blue, fractured edge, sharp enough to bite) constrain Elira's gesture and charge the closure when she tucks it into her belt as compass. Spatial choreography of survivors emerging and stepping forward is clear. The chipped patterns guide her retroactively but their mechanics—how fractures "echo" voices—lean abstract rather than tactile constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.7)
    The orchard and maze are vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: upward-flowing fountain, apple trees with "forgotten birthdays," silver sapling with stage-light leaves. These images charge the final moment and reflect the ghost's synesthetic perception. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the ghost moves freely without spatial friction or resource scarcity. The setting functions as resonant backdrop rather than active pressure, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.1)
    The studio is vividly rendered—blackout velvet, resin-flecked floor, indigo LEDs, oscilloscope, analog synth—and the muscovite geode functions as micro-setting, its fractally precise layers both object and constraint. The geode pulsing "in rhythm with her heartbeat" and the walls blooming with "living constellations" charge the final image. Spatial choreography (cross-legged on floor, bare feet on concrete, moving through studio) remains clear and the setting pressures her method by supplying the light modulators and biofeedback tools she patches together.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cave network is vividly rendered with bioluminescent lichen that reacts to emotional heat, salt-crusted stalactites, and named chambers (Chamber Seven, Whispering Grotto, Tidal Sanctum) that guide her mapping work. The Tidal Sanctum's wet stone becomes the stage where the fossil floats, and the cave's "tidal rhythm" syncs with her breath at closure, directly shaping her final transformation. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional focus: thermal gradients, lichen color shifts, and damp stone textures dominate, filtered through her heat-mapping expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.1)
    The amber warehouse is vividly realized—resin, rust, high slits, shelves of jars—and the cliff underbelly creates a purposeful contrast to the "truth unraveling overhead." The buttons function as micro-setting objects that constrain her method (hue, wear, fracture cataloging). The canyon echo jar is handled across multiple beats and directly enables the climactic clarity moment. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the warehouse and crossroads scenes, and sensory detail (dust motes, bone-flute hiss) is selective and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bluff, mist, snow, and relay station are vivid and purposeful. The hatch and snowdrift become functional tools: the microfilm is hidden where spring thaw will carry it. The setting constrains her actions (testing footholds, calculating wind shifts) and the final image of mist swallowing her silhouette charges the closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her urgency, though the piece leans visual; tactile and auditory cues are present but less varied.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.1)
    The fog-bound river crossing is sensorily rich and coherent—"drip-tick of gutters," "submerged stones shifting beneath the ford"—and the environment constrains the coachman's navigation through ambient cues (fog whispers, axle creaks, rain-gutter ticking). The yarn needle functions as micro-setting, returning with reweighted meaning at closure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting charges the final threshold image, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that environment or object constrain choice or charge the final image, though the choice itself lacks dramatic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    The oasis is vividly anchored (cracked kiln, broken hives, wax pooling, dust) and sensory detail reflects urgency (smoke flattening, heat relentless, shadows stretching). The lantern glass and pot function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the glass only glows with gentle intent, the pot cradles time. Spatial choreography is coherent (kiln, hive stand, riverbed clay). The environment directly charges the final image—pot in dust, glass glowing—making removal impossible without collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    The harbor by moonlight, rusted fire escape, and prisms are vivid and purposeful; spatial choreography (northeast corner, alley below) tracks clearly. The prisms constrain her circuit and charge the ending image by casting light into streets, satisfying the micro-setting test for high-band entry. Sensory detail is selective (mercury shimmer, sapphire/amber light) and filtered through her focus. No occupation-depth penalty at this length; the setting integrates into action rather than stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal library above clouds is vivid and purposeful: vapor floods constrain Veyra's movement, brass sundials guide her ritual alignment, the stone circle's hum provides tactile feedback. The sundial in Chamber Seven—gnomon bent left, shadow pointing to woodpecker coordinates—charges the final image when Veyra realigns it toward genesis. Sensory detail (salt-crusted stone, damp knees, metallic tang of ozone) is filtered through her priorities. However, the spatial choreography during the flood sequence remains somewhat abstract; we don't track her path through the galleries with enough physical specificity to elevate past strong.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lotus temple and lily pond anchor setting vividly with sensory layering (petrichor, alabaster petals, water lilies as "green moons"). The reflecting pool and altar participate in the closure ritual, constraining Aris's final sequence. However, the environment does not force a difficult choice or limit options under pressure—it remains backdrop rather than crucible. Spatial choreography is clear (barefoot walk through shallows, placement on altar, stepping into pool).

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.9)
    The university radio station control booth—dim glow, yellowed charts, Cold War transmitters—provides resources (the jury-rigged counter-frequency box, the boosted signal) that enable Elira's interference. The oscilloscope and charts are handled across multiple beats and anchor her methodology. However, spatial choreography beyond the booth (campus barricades, quad seminars) is summarized rather than shown, and the setting does not constrain a choice or visibly narrow her options during the climactic counter-broadcast; it supplies tools but does not pressure her tactics under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    The nexus, arches, moving-star dome, and self-playing organ supply vivid, purpose-driven anchors. The narrowing passage constrains Elara's movement and forces her through claustrophobic pressure. The compass functions as micro-setting when its needle spins and warms. However, the sudden "openness" after the squeeze and the widened return passage feel convenient rather than causally earned; the environment shifts to accommodate resolution rather than shaping the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    The quarry is sensorially vivid (mist, limestone chill, collapsed crane, damp rock) and purposefully claustrophobic. Micro-setting details—pinning sketches to wet stone, lighting candles, the ribbon on the floor—charge the climactic confrontation. The sealed glass cases behind the foreman's office are a late spatial reveal but plausible within the location. Spatial choreography remains clear across all moves, and the environment constrains the emotional frame without becoming a postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    The experimental weather station and the copper nail anchor setting through tactile, recurring detail: the nail grows warm, the station's metal bones vibrate, the resonance board whirs. The environment pressures Elara's choices—emergency lamps, alarms, the fractured coast—and the nail's warmth charges the final act. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout, and the setting evolves causally (clouds unspooling backward, rain rising). Minor: occupational detail (resonance board, dials) is gestural rather than constraining, but at this length that's acceptable.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.7)
    The mountain pullout, glass flake, and scaffold flutters anchor the scene with vivid specificity: "ozone and mountain rain," "fractured image shimmer," ribbons "tugged by invisible hands." Micro-setting qualifies: the violin case, flutters, and rearview mirror all constrain attention and charge the final image when the flake floats toward the ridge. Sensory selection reflects the fiddler's artist bias—visual shimmer, aural spiraling notes—and the final light-strike on the flake reweights prior material. The pullout itself, however, remains a passive backdrop; no geographic feature (gradient, wind, guardrail) alters a tactic or decision.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    The abandoned circus train is vividly rendered with faded murals, sequined costumes, and rust; spatial choreography is coherent (boxcar, signal poles, tracks). The chalk arrows, ribbons, and Fibonacci spirals function as setting-as-tool, constraining choices (dissuasion markers) and charging the final image (lantern-lit train, scent of incense). Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through the protagonist's reflective stance. The train's decay mirroring his life is stated rather than discovered through action, slightly diminishing subtlety, but the setting remains essential to both escalation and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory, star charts, and parchment are handled concretely and return with purpose. The daylily-pressed telegram constrains the choice to enter the dream, and the astral temple ruins charge the climax. Spatial choreography (hunched over charts, opening envelope, kneeling in dust) tracks cleanly. Sensory detail is vivid but occasionally drifts into ornament ("velvet night," "liquid shadow") without altering tactics. The setting presses the protagonist toward lucidity and shapes the final ritual, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.1)
    The orchard vortex is vividly rendered with specific images (inverted branches, petals like stained glass shards, faces in ice) that sustain atmosphere throughout. The lake surface holding her weight and the ice pressing against her palm provide tactile anchor points that constrain movement. The environment charges the final image when "the lake drained into sky" and "orchard bloomed upward," meeting the 9+ gate requirement of setting shaping closure, though the spatial logic of walking on a vortex eye remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt glade supplies vivid sensory anchors (indigo canopy, bruised sky, night-blooming vines) and the maze clipping functions as both object and key, shaping the protagonist's path to the dais. The stone dais with half-eroded glyphs provides a concrete stage for the climactic ritual. However, the setting never constrains a choice—vines anchor her willingly, the glade "awakens" on cue, and all environmental elements facilitate rather than resist. Spatial choreography is clear (arrival → center → dais), but the environment operates as cooperative stage rather than pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered and purposefully specific: roots threading through femurs, oak roots coiling around a child's pelvis. The setting constrains Elira's method (she tucks moss into eye sockets, presses cards into resin) and generates the climactic moment when roots surge to bind Kael. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elira's priorities, avoiding catalog description. The environment directly charges the final image as the orchard "answers" and begins weaving the two characters together.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    The quarry setting and trailer furnishings (folding table, corkboard, grimy window) ground the scenes and reflect Jasper's isolation. The speaker cloth and harmonica function as micro-setting objects that constrain his attention and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and apt: "corrugated walls trembling," "valley's peculiar acoustics." The cloth placed in his breast pocket shifts from toolkit to heartbeat, a tactile choice that alters his stance at closure. The setting's acoustics ("wind humming through cuts in the rock") directly shape the ending's charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    The magnetic arbor is vivid and functional: metallic branches sway without wind, bent light creates halos, the field syncs with Elira's pulse. The "soil that wasn't soil but solidified memory" and magnetic stair woven into the trunk supply micro-setting constraints. Sensory hierarchy reflects her scholarly priorities (cuneiform signs, field resonance). The arbor participates in closure when tendrils rise and the hum deepens, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tidal atrium is vividly rendered with bioluminescent algae, salt-slick floors, and arching glass that shimmers with reflected tides; the marble plinth worn smooth by "centuries of salt and sighs" charges the space with history. The central pool of liquid moonlight functions as a micro-setting that enables the creel baptism, and the eastern alcove's shelves labeled by "emotional frequency" constrain her archival choices. The body and tool (creel, lunar-quartz spectacles) are present but their constraints on choice are modest. The setting charges the final image—"cathedral of salt and starlight"—lifting the ending's atmospheric cost.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.9)
    The crystal caves pressure the inspector's choices throughout: the prismatic facets, amethyst hollow, and calcite formation all ground the ritual spatially. The caves themselves shift from geological fact to "cathedral of compression," actively participating in the transformation. The nautilus shell functions as micro-setting, its spiral chambers constraining the confession method and charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through the inspector's reverent attention.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.0)
    The disused railway station is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (ivy as archive, rusted faucet, shattered skylight, porcelain sink) and the accordion as micro-setting constrains her ritual of measurement and music. The orientation penalty in Q2 caps this category at 7.0 per the rule. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the station's layout remains somewhat impressionistic. The ivy and Track 3 sign charge the final image, and the setting subtly mirrors her emotional topography, lifting the score within the allowed band.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.4)
    The glowing library, mist, and cyclically reversed stacks are vividly rendered with strong sensory specificity (bergamot and rain, warm book covers, floating punctuation). However, these details function primarily as atmosphere; the environment does not meaningfully constrain her choices or force tactical adaptation. The mirror at the lectern charges the final image moderately, but spatial choreography grows vague in the inner sanctum sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.1)
    The velvet observatory is richly textured (constellations as bruised mulberries, plush floor, wisteria tendrils) and setting constrains the final choice: the plants (moss, ferns, mycelium) become conduits for the violin's resonance, and the Chancellor's threshold arrival triggers the melt. Micro-setting qualifies—body (barefoot contact with floor) and recurring object (violin on pedestal) charge the closure image. Sensory selection is purposeful (starlight through crystal ribs, dew vibrating off ferns) and filtered through Elira's gift. The velvet itself becomes a living fabric by the end, fulfilling the constraint test for the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    The skyborne grotto is vividly rendered—stalactites of "condensed skylight," pooled radiance, aurora overhead—and the setting's otherworldly physics (floating continent, silence as "presence") are consistent. The grotto does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics, but the environment charges the final image and anchors the ritual's metaphysical logic. Spatial choreography is clear, and the body (her trembling hands, his fluttering eyelids) serves as micro-setting that grounds the abstract stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto is anchored early with sensory specificity (petrichor, moss-hung silence, cool damp air) and serves as micro-setting that constrains the climactic choice: the carved stone bench and veiled mist frame the moment of release. The hairpin—handled twice, first examined then placed in her hair—acts as object-as-setting, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography (tree → grotto → bench → edge → descent) tracks cleanly. Minor slip: the valley-below description reads postcard-observational rather than filtered through Elara's immediate stake, slightly diluting momentum before the descent.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lighthouse balcony at dawn supplies concrete spatial pressure: cold stone under her toes, wind-driven chimes, salt air that "prickles" her exposed skin post-cloak. The hollow mirror shard constrains choice by showing her fractured selves, and the cloak's physical weight ("bowing her shoulders") charges the unhooking moment. Micro-setting (body, shard, cloak) successfully substitutes for broader geography. The seashell at closure feels slightly ornamental but does not obscure the earned descent.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    The floating obsidian platform, magnetic grotto, and circular pond are vivid and purposeful. The platform's suspension "by forces even Dr. Elira Voss no longer tried to name" and the grotto's "temporal echoes no machine could replicate" anchor the world's metaphysical logic. The pond constrains the teaching method—Kael watches ripples that become symbols—charging the final image when starlight fractures through the canopy and he reads time. Sensory detail (cool stone, sycamore hush, cobalt and pearl light) is selective and filtered through the scene's meditative urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.1)
    The towers of bone and canyon are evocative but remain postcard description; no spatial choreography, no constraint on choice. The arrowhead is cradled and traced but does not alter tactics or charge the final image beyond symbolic mention. Sensory detail (dust, wingbeats, thermals) is vivid yet passive, never filtered through urgency or POV priority that would shape a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound spire is vivid and purposeful: "balconies glazed with rime that glowed faintly at dusk" anchors atmosphere and the "lingering luminance" motif. The keystone's warmth against the frost and the mist-path opening at the tower door constrain Lior's choice to step. The cloud-tree setting charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean and sensory detail is selective, filtered through Lior's awe and grief. The spire's isolation reflects his failure and the micro-setting (keystone in palms, mist at ankles) drives the peak turn.

    The sunken library constrains choice by forcing the underwater dive and supplies the ledger that charges the closure. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "pages blooming like anemones," "barnacles," "sediment," all filtered through the protagonist's focused attention. The pier and ship are handled as lived-in spaces with clear spatial choreography. The key tag functions as micro-setting—its weight and warmth recur to charge the final pocket-tucking gesture. The sky lanterns frame the time window and reappear at closure to bookend the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ambered observatory deck functions as a micro-setting that constrains and charges action: the honeyed light, cracked glass panels, and residual heat anchor sensory perception throughout, and the deck's edge becomes the spatial stage for her final choice. The coins themselves act as tactile anchors with distinct provenance (drachma/tides, yuan/breaths, doubloon/expansion) that filter her attention and shape her ritual. The only slip: "stellar doubt" as a bodily sensation ("pulsed behind her ribs like a dying pulsar") borders on abstract metaphor rather than concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory's fractured prism and cracked dome are not mere backdrop; scattered light through the prism enables the crystallization method, and the "broken teeth biting into twilight" charges atmosphere. The atlas page functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and reweighted at closure. Spatial choreography (balcony, spiral stairs, central chamber, stone table) remains coherent and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sapphire viaduct at dawn is vividly anchored—dew-slick stone, underside charcoal equations, morning runoff—and constrains the mage's methodology (he depends on condensation timing). The broken bell as micro-setting charges the final image: its fall into the sea triggers the breach. Sensory detail is filtered through the mage's professional obsession (dripping rates, humidity, wind shear). The viaduct's twin pedestals and river stones serve as tools that enable the repair, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ridgeway functions as more than backdrop—it's the staging ground for the impromptu shrine and frames the recurring twilight walks, constraining Elias's activity to this boundary space. Sensory details are selective and purposeful: "humid air," "cracked asphalt that remembered a different map," "mud" at the gazebo. The resurfaced town's objects (lamppost, schoolhouse steps, barbed wire) anchor the trail and enable the central action. Micro-setting qualifies: the folding table and arrangement of artifacts directly enable the closure beat, altering the state from erasure to commemoration.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.1)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall and silver-barked orchard create vivid atmosphere, but function as backdrop rather than constraint. The moss, blossoms, and chromatic mist are evocative yet do not pressure a single choice. The crystal and flame remain props handled rather than environmental forces that narrow tactics or charge the final image with spatial cost.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.1)
    The nocturnal arbor—trees growing sideways from floating moss islands, roots clutching sky—is vividly particular and constrains the protagonist's movement (sky-bridge of woven vines). The parachute buckle functions as micro-setting: its physical presence (cold metal, grooves, release catch) anchors the Watcher's signal code and charges the final image when she re-clips it. The setting details are filtered through the POV's professional priorities (bioluminescent vines, wind-chimes, trained moths as signal tools) and the spatial choreography remains coherent across moves. The piece meets the 9+ gate: the buckle (object-as-setting) charges the closure when she re-clips it as vow, and the arbor's trembling triggers the central action.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.1)
    The floating dojo over ink-black clouds and moss-slick stones establishes vivid setting early. The brain jar is handled physically (palms on glass, bioluminescent tendrils, fractal auroras) and charges the closure when the duplicate steps out "without breaking the glass." However, the levitating perches, temporal winds, and history-rewrite air remain postcard description—they do not constrain Kael's choices or supply resources that alter outcome. Spatial choreography is clean (center, underside perches, horizon), but the environment pressures atmosphere more than tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.9)
    The echo chamber tunnel is vividly realized—curved concrete walls, acoustic amplification, eastern/western arches—and it constrains the protagonist's ritual by providing the necessary resonance for his lullabies. Sensory detail is selective (the "mechanical wheeze of his breath mimicking motor-whine," "dusk bleeds into starless dark") and filtered through his grief-steeped perception. The tunnel's acoustic properties enable the "giggle ricochets" beat and the final "laugh—tiny, tinny, triumphant" that charges the closure. Spatial choreography is clear, and the setting functions as both cathedral and vessel, directly shaping his nightly pilgrimage and the story's central action.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    The frozen garden supplies vivid, selective anchors—frost-laced boughs, mist coiling like serpents, statues caught between curiosity and terror—that are filtered through the guardian's feral POV. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the garden, pendant, statues, and mist. The pendant as micro-object constrains the guardian's vigil and charges the closure when placed in the statue's hand; the garden's "breathing" ice directly shapes the final turn. Sensory selection (licking frozen cheeks, tasting salt and sorrow) reflects urgency and priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ember nexus functions as more than backdrop: its tectonic thrum responds to the chant, shadows peel, and the final ember flares in affirmation, all shaping the ritual's success. The crozier (object-as-micro-setting) constrains choice—its fractured base anchors the circle, its trembling signals progress. Sensory detail (frost petals, liquid twilight, heat whispers beneath cooled crusts) is vivid and filtered through Elric's alchemical attention. The setting charges the closure image when frost melts into singing light.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    Setting anchors early and vividly: rusted gantry, frost-glazed metal, skeletal towers, mist-choked gorge. The suspended radio tower city supplies atmosphere and spatial coherence throughout. The towers function as instruments at closure, charging the final image when "antennae straightened" and "capacitors glowed," meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain choice or charge the final image. Sensory selection remains purposeful (moon "honey-gold," fragment "oxidized chrome") without postcard enumeration.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    The spectral grotto supplies vivid sensory anchors (phosphorescent pebbles, ozone, coral arches pulsing with forgotten tides, stalactites dripping liquid starlight) and micro-setting details (the radio's glowing dials, the hourglass atop it) constrain the convergence ritual in the climax. Spatial choreography is clear across the grotto descent and surface return. However, the ferry deck and open water receive generic treatment ("salt spray," "brass railings") and the grotto's surreal properties (bioluminescent eels tracing equations, constellations rearranging) read as ornament rather than obstacles that shape the deckhand's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.1)
    The optical illusion gallery is vividly rendered with purposeful surrealism: "stairs descending into ceilings, doorways swallowing their own reflections" anchor the setting's logic early. Sensory details are selective and support the fever-dream tone without catalog excess. The gallery's responsive architecture (walls breathing, doors dilating) charges the final eruption image, and the "floor paved with half-remembered birthdays and unsent letters" in the closing beat uses micro-setting to extend the conceptual frame. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite the non-Euclidean design.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    The benthic city setting is vivid and specific: bioluminescent towers, abyssal plains, pressure-sealed glass, deep-sea vents. The pressurized dome classroom and the anchor chain link function as micro-setting elements that recur across beats. The power fluctuation beat uses darkness and imagined stars to charge atmosphere. However, the environment does not constrain a choice at closure—Elira's balcony reflection and final classroom lecture proceed without spatial or resource pressure. The anchor chain link is handled but remains symbolic rather than a tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atrium is rendered with strong sensory specificity ("glass ceiling wept condensation," "lilies floated like surrendered hands") and the mist-clad twilight atmosphere is sustained throughout. Spatial choreography is clean: colonnade, toppled planter, fountain, exit sequence. The hearing aid and photograph function as micro-setting objects that charge the final moment when their pulses synchronize and "the mist thinned." The setting subtly mirrors the girl's entrapment and guides the tracer's search.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    The forgotten research facility is vividly realized: rusted stairwells groaning "like a dying tide," salt-crusted spoons beside petrified sandwiches, and the tidal clock creating urgency ("water began its slow creep back"). The environment constrains the protagonist's window of access and the gold fleck reacts to residual energy fields, directly shaping her path. Sensory selection is strong—dust and salt on the tongue, the hum of phantom signals—and the cafeteria drawing charges the closure when it glows "as if lit from within."

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The opal dome, frost-feathered glass, three meters of snowdrift, and chilled marble create vivid, purposeful anchoring. The porcelain shard and the terminal function as micro-setting that constrains Aris's ritual (he kneels, places the shard, initiates the sequence). The western arch's snow-pressed glass charges the final beat when the blizzard ceases, mirroring the internal settling. Sensory hierarchy (cold on soles, ozone scent, ink bloom) reflects Aris's priorities. The observatory's physical constraints and the ending's environmental shift elevate this into the high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.1)
    The canyon and bone towers are vivid and purposeful, anchoring the acoustic logic early. The diamond constrains her method (must be fed noise to filter signal) and the flock's flight provides the syntax she needs, both shaping her tactic on the page. Spatial choreography is clear (canyon lip, towers, sky, flock overhead). The ending image—echoes peeling from walls, joining her voice—charges the closure by making the setting an active participant in the language's revival.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.7)
    The underground garden is vividly rendered with bioluminescent vines, temporal anomalies in clay pots, and tactile moss; these details constrain the arrowhead's activation (it vibrates on the bench, vines flicker, gravity hiccups). The setting charges the final image when "the garden walls dissolved into auroras" and grounds the metamorphosis spatially. Sensory selection is strong (wet moss, condensation on the phone, frostbitten vines), though the catalog occasionally stalls momentum with ornamental lists (chamomile, skullcap, mandrake) that do not feed present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sky-bridge, orchard canopy, statues, and apples are vivid and purposeful. The locust shell is handled twice (pressed to the violin, then turning to dust) and its texture charges the music's effect. Spatial choreography remains clear across the violinist's position on the bridge and the statues below. The setting pressures the protagonist by providing the marble sentinels as obstacles and the orchard's condition as the problem to solve, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cobalt arcade is vividly rendered ("ozone and burnt sugar," neon "flickering like dying stars") and functions as a smuggling hub, grounding the plan in Marla's rigged power grid. The thunderstorm bottle is handled twice (ribcage hum, placement in drone bay) with tactile specificity. The drone border's invisible lattice and the ventilation-shaft reroute show spatial constraint shaping tactics. Yet the disputed-territory geography remains abstract—no street names, ridge landmarks, or sector boundaries that would anchor the "neither nation dared claim" premise in physical reality. The setting charges mood but does not force a micro-choice that alters the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    The abandoned circus train is vividly rendered—sagging cars, moss-swallowed wheels, faded murals, caramel ghosts—and the carousel in the final car becomes the spatial anchor for the climax. The halo fragment, placed on the central pole, charges the ending image. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric (sawdust, metal sigh, wood creak), filtered through the carpenter's reverent attention. The rusted signpost and hidden oasis guide the discovery without becoming ornamental. The train's decay and the carousel's incompleteness constrain the work he must perform, meeting the 9+ gate of environment shaping choice and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The scientific poetry library is vividly particular (equations as sonnets, Non-Euclidean Lullabies shelf, hyperbolic tessellations), and the scarf as micro-setting object constrains the activation sequence. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (chalk-dust, silk ripple, story-core hum). The amphitheater's impossible geometry charges the closure image. The scarf's texture and the scroll's faint pulse under lamplight are tactile and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.2)
    The archipelago setting is lyrically evocative (salt-damp sand, fog-choked coves, tide-locked caves) but remains largely postcard description; it does not constrain the librarian's choices or supply tactical resources at closure. The palette itself—a recurring object—is handled across multiple beats and charges the final image, lifting the score, but the broader environment stays ornamental. The northernmost jetty and the coral sky at closure provide atmosphere without altering the protagonist's options or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "shadowed nexus," "arch of fractured moonstone," and "door woven from shadow and starlight" supply vivid atmospheric anchors, but remain postcard backdrops—no spatial constraint alters the locksmith's path or narrows his options. The moss "remembered ancient footsteps," yet no texture (tool, body, recurring object) forces a tactical choice or charges the final beat beyond ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sunken greenhouse setting is vividly particular—glass panes refracting undersea light, kelp and rust, iron sentinels of shipwrecks—and directly constrains the folklorist's detective work through broken constellations viewed through algae-flecked glass. The fairy ring mushroom placement "beneath the most distorted skylight" demonstrates how micro-setting (the specific skylight) enables the pivotal discovery. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven throughout: brine, silt, coral, the scent trigger of rosewater and pipe smoke that charges the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.1)
    The library's spatial choreography is coherent (rotunda, skylight, eastern alcove, spiral staircase, western window), and micro-setting elements constrain choice: the trapped shadow pulses when she misreads, the swing's hush signals when "the library listens hardest," and tea cups anchor the pedagogy. The fractured skylight and shard-mirrors charge the final image of multiplicity. Occupational detail (archival annotation, vellum handling) grounds her expertise without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.1)
    The verdant parapet beside the waterfall constrains the weaving (a seam where worlds whisper), and the spatial threshold directly enables the essence-capture that cracks the seed. Sensory detail—moss that "sighed," mist on skin, waterfall's breath—is vivid and filtered through Elira's reverent focus. The body and seed function as micro-setting, charging the final image when the tendril curls around her wrist and she tucks it against her ribs, grounding wonder in tactile presence.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prism sanctuary is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (starlight bending into "liquid whispers," pooling at ankles) and constrains action: the pulsing prisms react to the knot's unraveling, dimming as if bracing for storm. The net itself functions as micro-setting, each knot a tactile constraint that the protagonist must navigate. Spatial choreography remains coherent (kneeling, needle slipping between fibers, rising with stiff joints). The sanctuary's exhaled breath at closure charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vault, henge, and torn map create a tactile micro-setting that constrains her method (kneeling on cold flagstone, aligning lens with map fracture) and charges the final image when dusk light reveals the shadow-chapel. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "arches wept condensation," "moss bloomed in impossible symmetry," "cold flagstone." The map's physical tear becomes both spatial anchor and conceptual threshold, satisfying the constraint-on-choice test for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sunken library, trench "where ocean currents whispered like librarians," lab with sterile gloves, and cliffside all ground the narrator's journey with sensory specificity. The snow globe itself functions as micro-setting: its internal physics (flakes falling upward, temperature shifts) constrains the protagonist's investigation and charges the final image when it floats and vanishes. The lighthouse beam "stretched into a helix, then a spiral, then a single thread" anchors the closure moment concretely. Minor gap: the lab's spatial layout during the seventy-three nights remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.9)
    The misty courtyard above clouds, the moss-fringed terminal, and the bolt plate are vividly drawn with purposeful sensory detail (ozone, struck crystal, warm steel vibration). The setting constrains the encounter—only here does the ghost in code flicker—and the bolt plate serves as both cipher key and communion tool, charging the final image when she reaches for gold paint. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. Minor deduction: the courtyard's surreal elevation ("gravity felt optional") is never used to complicate a choice, remaining ornamental description rather than a pressure element.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.1)
    The icebound spire, elevator shaft, and observation deck are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (frost-rimmed seams, glacial bronze bell, whale-skin binding). Spatial choreography is clean across the climb. The goggles' cracked lenses and the light's prismatic scatter constrain the cipher's discovery, pushing this into the mid-7s. The frostbloom at floor three and the alcove at the peak charge the final image with environmental specificity. Minor issue: the cloud-sea and wind at the peak feel postcard-pretty rather than forcing a tactical adjustment.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.1)
    The brass telescope (salvaged, polished, warming in her hands) and the gondola (wicker floor, fraying cables, creaking suspension) constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered: "starlight that clung like powdered memory," "ozone and awe," telescope eyepiece fogging with breath. The sky-as-micro-setting functions as both literal environment and emotional landscape, with cloud classifications (Stratocumulus #47 as "resigned acceptance") shaped by the protagonist's professional and grief-driven priorities. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The recurring objects (telescope, ledger, gondola cables) evolve across beats and anchor the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    The hollowed tree trunk library supplies tactile anchors (bark-worn shelves, moss-crusted doors) and the demolition clock pressures every brushstroke. The coin's micro-topography—grooves, depressions, fissures—becomes a micro-setting that constrains her method and charges the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through her tactile bias (charcoal texture, bristle whisper, linseed oil). The painted ceiling reweights the space at closure, fulfilling the gate test: setting constrains method and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    The airship's brass fittings, stranded luminance, and teak decking are vivid and purposeful. The hopscotch board constrains Arlen's discovery method and charges the closure image when the crew enacts the larger grid. Sensory hierarchy (starling murmurations, lamp oil, chalk dust) is filtered through Arlen's professional priorities. The micro-setting (hopscotch board) functions as the story's pivot and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate tests, but minor descriptive stock phrases ("groaned like old bones") and one instance of postcard phrasing keep it just below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    The frozen library, ice-glazed marble, and glacial glass create vivid atmosphere. The Hall of Mirrors and the gear pedestal supply spatial coherence. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—she walks in, kneels, traces gears, and leaves without the setting altering her tactics or imposing cost. The body and tools (keys, apron) appear but do not shape the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    The orchard planet, floating arches, and Glass Canopy are vividly rendered with specificity (petrified root-veins glowing violet, crystallized pollen dome). Spatial choreography remains clear across beats. The butterfly garden watering bell functions as micro-setting and its mechanics (summoning memory of water, coaxing dew) constrain one choice (Kael lifting and ringing it). The environment does not evolve under pressure or shape multiple tactics, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lighthouse interior (spiral stairs, brass chronometer, curved glass) is vivid and the puppet's cracked porcelain recurs across beats. However, no environmental constraint alters a choice or tactic—the adjuster moves freely through the space executing his plan. The "pane of hush" thickens and the sea stills, but these effects are passive backdrops rather than pressures that shape action. Spatial choreography is clear, and sensory detail is abundant, but the setting never forces a tradeoff or charges the final image with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, moss patches, pebble clusters, and weeping willow are integrated into the rescue choreography and constrain the caretaker's tactics (heel-dragging on moss, pebble placement, whistle echoes). The nut as micro-object charges the ending when he hands it off and then resumes his path-building. Spatial choreography (switchbacks, ridge view, central grove) tracks cleanly. The birds' non-intervention (no alarms for the lost) subtly reinforces the orchard's cursed logic.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    The braided ravine's topography directly mirrors the chemist's fractured grief and constrains her pilgrimage. Foam patterns, canyon walls splitting "like braided DNA," and the confluence of three streams supply concrete images that charge the closure. The chrysalis placement "in moss beside a tributary's whisper" and the foam dissolving between her fingers are tactile and purposeful. The ravine's micro-setting (slick stones, current tugging boots) affects her physical navigation and the final turn—"the chrysalis was gone, swept into the symphony of currents"—depends on the setting's active participation.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass orchard library on clouds is vivid and sustained through sensory detail (ozone, pearlescent gates, glass petals, shifting shelves). The counter incisions and bottled moonlight function as micro-setting elements that constrain ritual action. The final image of seven incisions charging the ceiling links setting to closure, elevating the score. However, the clouds and orchard remain postcard backdrops; they do not alter the vendor's tactics or choices during transactions.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.9)
    The coral icebound pavilion is vividly rendered ("cathedral of calcified sea-life frozen mid-bloom") and the basin of liquid shadow is handled at the climax, charging the final image. Spatial choreography from fortress descent to pavilion interior tracks cleanly. However, the "analyzing tidal pool formations" method—though mentioned twice—never constrains a choice on the page; it reads as atmospheric detail rather than a tool that shapes her path. For 9+, an environment/tool/object must constrain a choice or charge the final image; the pavilion charges but does not constrain, capping the score at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.1)
    Setting detail is vivid and specific (spiral iron stairs, brass dials, copper wires, parchment scrolls) and the tower's acoustics enable Elara's method. The grain elevator's physical presence (metal ribs, creaking joints, dust puffing from seams) is evocative and the spatial choreography between tower and valley is coherent. However, the environment does not constrain choice—Elara's plan proceeds without environmental friction—and sensory selection does not shift with urgency; the lush descriptive register remains constant regardless of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.1)
    The moonlit canyon, shale, juniper, and owls create vivid, selective atmosphere filtered through the engineer's perceptual lens ("synaptic terrain"). The broken periscope mirror functions as micro-setting and recurring object, handled twice (traced, then angled toward the moon) and charged at closure. Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling, standing, walking the ridge). The setting subtly mirrors the interior work (canyon as neural map) without overt symbolism, and the mirror's coldness against her ribs anchors the ending physically.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto's phosphorescent moss, inverted gravity, and liquid-glass waterfall create vivid sensory anchors that guide Elira's path and enable the threshold effects. Spatial choreography is coherent—upside-down bridge, floating sigil carving through mist—and the environment directly constrains her route. The final chamber's glass tablets and suspended Seed charge the closure image. Gravity inversion functions as both atmospheric pressure and mechanical enabler, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain choice or charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    The alder grove is anchored early and returns throughout; the porcelain insulator's stress cracks constrain Silas's carving method and charge the final resonance. Sensory detail is vivid ("roots spiraled like frozen smoke," "bark shimmering silver") and filtered through Silas's sculptural attention. The insulator as micro-setting qualifies: its fractures shape the sculpture's design and enable the closure beat. Minor slip: the hedgehog's spatial position drifts without clear anchoring across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    The magnetic nexus is vividly rendered: "cold, humming stone," auroras stitching the horizon, and the field's oscillations felt as "pull and repel." The worry stone functions as micro-setting, its dent pressing into his thumb to anchor memory and meditation. Sensory detail is selective and mood-driven, and the nexus does constrain his choice—he must act "before the next phase" when the field peaks. Spatial choreography is clean (seated on stone, rising, walking to treeline), and the twilight palette (bruised violets, fading golds) charges the final image without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.1)
    The shadowed workshop is vividly furnished—tuning forks, music boxes, jars of petrified silence, copper coil, velvet cobwebs—and these objects recur across beats. The meteorite-iron clasp and archival case (felt spun from monk's robes and moonflower petals) charge the final image with specificity. The fireworks function as external pressure and timeframe marker, shaking the walls at closure. Spatial choreography is coherent; Elara's hands trace air above the clasp, she switches frequencies, packs vials. The micro-setting (workshop as archive) constrains her method and supplies resources, elevating the score toward the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    The treetop village, suspended greenhouse, and moss-wrapped shelf create a coherent micro-world. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "damp moss on her tongue before dawn broke" and "wet iron and distant lightning" ground perception in Elira's olfactory bias. The corpse flower's "velvet scream" and "infamous stench" charge the climax, and the wrapping-paper doodles function as recurring object. However, the village itself remains a backdrop—no architectural constraint shapes a choice. Spatial choreography is clean; the greenhouse setting enables the bloom but does not pressure Elira's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    The orchard planet is richly rendered with concrete, POV-filtered detail: floating rock arches, inverted dew-trails, moss-draped shelves that were ceiling. The arrow tip constrains Elira's final choice (jamming it into the Grandmother tree), and the gravity inversion directly shapes her tactical window. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the environment charges the closure image with the tree's pulse radiating fruit and petals.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    The container labyrinth is vivid, selective, and purposeful: "stacked, leaning, welded monoliths," shifting with tides, inventing microclimates. Wind vectors at Junction 7 demonstrate environment constraining investigation tactics. The final corridor anchors the closure image—wind testing resistance, investigator stepping into its path—charging the ending with spatial pressure. Sensory hierarchy (wind gauge readings, thermal updrafts, salt-crusted gravel) reflects professional priorities without catalog bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ice cavern, aurora, and prism bell are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (emerald veils, topaz tremors, candlewicks dipped in molten amethyst). The environment charges the final image: the hush "now lived in her bones, in the ice, in the aurora's afterglow." Spatial choreography is clear and the setting constrains her ritual (cathedral arches, suspended bell). Minor deduction: the outside world is referenced only in contrast, never tested on the page, so the setting's pressure remains largely atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Thunder-echo Range supplies vivid, selective details—ash-colored sand, bleached driftwood, scree-buried amphitheater—that ground the scholarly autopsy without catalog excess. Micro-setting (the driftwood compass, the floating marble slab in the between-place) charges key beats and the final image. Sensory hierarchy matches the protagonist's professional filter: she notices geomantic leylines and harmonic nodes, not tourist landmarks. The between-place's "gradient of forgotten hues" and suspended rivers offer lyric specificity that serves the conceptual stakes, though the piece does not demand that environment constrain a tactical choice in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.1)
    The topaz workshop supplies vivid mood ("amber glow," "spectral equations," "panels that refracted starlight") but never constrains a choice or alters tactics. Spatial choreography is absent—props float without fixed positions, and the press, workbench, and walls lack relational geometry. The halo fragment's glow and the vanishing stars function as symbolic décor rather than environmental pressure. Micro-setting credit: the press itself is handled once ("The press groaned as it rolled"), but this remains descriptive; the protagonist's interaction does not change based on the tool's state or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway is anchored early and its "hidden frequencies" constrain the courier's movement; the pendant functions as micro-setting, vibrating against her sternum and guiding the fork choice. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "frost that sang," "lanterns...flickered like dragonfly wings," "air...thick as pollen." The Hollow Market's moth-wing canopy and the final ridgeway bend charge the closure image when the pendant returns skyward. Spatial choreography remains clear across ridgeway, market, and descent.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.1)
    The quartz arbor, mist, frosted windshield, and prism create a vivid micro-setting that constrains the mystic's method (she must align the prism with the frost). Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric ("mist curling like breath," "velvet" hush). The car as object-setting charges the final image when the frost melts. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the prism's placement on her windowsill at the end provides closure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.1)
    The orchard, bamboo grove, and loom are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (moss-slick boulder, plum pits for dye, dew-laced petals). The loom itself constrains the final choice: she must rebuild it around the puzzle frame to send the message. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the transition from orchard to "city of glass towers" lacks grounding anchors. The micro-setting (loom as tool and workspace) charges the closure image when it becomes "just a frame" holding her afterimage.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.1)
    The orchard planet with floating arches and mine shafts is vivid and specific, anchoring the narrative in a fantastical yet coherent space. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: blossoms drifting, stone warming, tunnels humming. The silk and glyph function as micro-setting elements that constrain Arlo's work and charge the final image. However, spatial choreography in the shafts remains abstract—distances, tools, and movements are gestured at rather than precisely tracked—and the surface/below geography could be more legibly mapped for the reader navigating repeated descents.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    The repair bay is vivid and returns with contrasting states (ruined, then pristine in Sigma-7), and the green shard functions as micro-setting that charges multiple beats. Sensory hierarchy is strong: oily floor, dust motes, residual warmth, and the shard's pulse all filter through Elira's professional lens. The shard constrains her navigation and shapes the final choice, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. However, spatial choreography inside the sealed chamber is sketchy, and the "Archival Containment" label feels generic rather than lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    The haunted lighthouse, sea glass, and stone cairns create vivid micro-setting that constrains choices: the lamp's extinction forces Elias to his ritual objects, the western window hosts the cairn. Sensory detail is strong ("velvet dark," "cobalt blue," "river-smooth stones") and filtered through his grief-trained perception. The setting charges the final image when the lamp flickers back on behind him. However, occupational detail (supply runs, oil drums, wicks) remains mostly atmospheric rather than constraining a choice at the closure beat, keeping this just below the 9+ gate despite otherwise strong execution.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.1)
    Vivid sensory phrases ("salt-slick cliffs," "jade meteorite," "nest of storm feathers") anchor the tower setting with distinct texture. The glass lantern wick is handled and returns with thematic weight at the ending, charging the final image. However, environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—the setting remains postcard-vivid without forcing a trade-off. Micro-setting qualification (body/tool/recurring object) is partially met by the wick's reappearance but does not reach the 9-band threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    The floating tea house "tethered by ancient silk ropes to nothing but belief" is vivid and purposeful, though it functions more as atmospheric container than tactical constraint. The morpho wing as micro-setting is excellent—its physical properties (scales, ridges, oblique light response) directly enable her breakthrough about magnetism. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional lens: she tracks "sun trails," "microscopic lattices," "the way hands trembled near teacups." The valley mist recurs at closure to charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single location.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tower (leaded windows, spiral stairs, rain-slicked parchment) and forest (mossy root, wet grass, leaf veins) are rendered through purposeful sensory detail filtered by the worker's attention. Moonlight functions as micro-setting: it triggers the sextant's healing and charges the closure image ("Moonlight pooled around her like a blessing"). The constraint is implicit—moonlight enables revelation—and the forest environment (oak crevice yielding artifacts) directly shapes the final mapping action. Spatial choreography remains clear across the descent and forest entry.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    The alchemical orchard, mica windows, and moss-starred greenhouse are vividly rendered with consistent sensory detail. The mica windows constrain the realm's access to dawn and the keeper's palm-press against the largest pane launches the climactic turn. Spatial choreography (iron staircase, citrus tree apex) remains clear. The setting charges the closure image by releasing hoarded light, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3; minor descriptive drift and a few generic adjectives ("low and warm," "ancient, necessary truth") prevent full high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.1)
    The secret-society library is vividly realized through concrete details: ceiling frescoes of owls reading clocks, floorboards that creak only when truth is spoken, stained-glass windows showing rearranged constellations. The Paradox shelf and its nested objects (biography of a man who died before birth, atlas of an erased country, cookbook requiring tears) ground the conceptual stakes in spatial choreography. Midnight's approach and the moonlight pooling in the center aisle charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3. Minor penalty: the library's rules (truth-triggered creaks, self-rearranging books) are introduced but never tested or constrained by Elira's choices within the scene, leaving them slightly ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    The overgrown courtyard—vines, moss, cracked fountain, wisteria—constrains movement (she kneels, doesn't rush) and the tea house's warped floorboards and spider-silk teacups charge the final ritual. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven: damp soil, jasmine scent, water dripping from a newly stirred spring. The bread and seeds function as micro-setting objects that anchor choices (offering, planting) and recur with reweighted meaning at closure. Spatial choreography remains clear; body, object, and place interweave without postcard excess. The environment subtly mirrors internal state—overgrowth as accumulated grief—without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The frozen library is vividly anchored (quartz hush, rime-glazed shelves, frosted marble, obsidian lectern, glacial chandeliers) and the sensory palette is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elira's reverent attention. The Resonance Array—a brass-and-crystal apparatus—functions as both tool and micro-setting, constraining her method (she must work swiftly as the slide dims) and charging the final image when twilight pierces the dome. The body is less present; Elira's breath fogs and tears freeze, but these remain atmospheric rather than shaping a tactical choice. The environment supplies resources (the Array, the cryo-capsule, the platinum cradle) and the library's groan and sigh create pressure, yet the space does not force a dilemma or alter her approach—she works uninterrupted to completion.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    The pirate market is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail: lanterns as "drunken fireflies," singing eels masking approach, shark-tooth coat, drowned men's nets. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the girl's movements from shadow to stall to crate. The watch fob itself functions as micro-setting, constraining her grip and charging the final beat when it swings over the deal. The sunrise timeframe creates atmospheric pressure but does not tighten tactics on the page as much as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lavender bluff, aurora, and forest election create vivid sensory grounding with purposeful detail (bioluminescent ballot-counters, mycelial votes). The tin ring hums and spins, anchoring micro-setting in the body. However, environment does not constrain a choice—the protagonist kneels, tastes, and moves ten paces, but these actions feel exploratory rather than forced by spatial pressure. The final image (lavender swaying, already forgetting) charges the ending with textural recurrence, lifting the score toward the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vivid and purposeful: auroral glow, cobalt quartz, geodes underfoot. The cave's "remembering imprisonment" and resonance with the lock charge the final image. The charcoal nub hidden in the lock functions as micro-setting that enables the climactic drawing. Spatial choreography is clean throughout; the cave constrains and reflects her internal state without postcard drift.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.1)
    The greenhouse city is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (ochre sky, ghost vines, UV orchids, condensation) that directly affects the protagonist's wilting and route choices. The toxic atmosphere and ambient untruths create embodied pressure ("pressed a damp cloth to her forehead"). The zinc fragment functions as a tactile compass; the map guides spatial navigation through named atriums. Environmental constraints shape every movement and charge the final return into "emerald haze."

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    The bluff, sculpture, and iceberg fragment are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (cobalt glow, prismatic shadows, glacial memory). The iceberg fragment constrains the child encounter (hand-on-ice moment) and charges the final image by persisting after the tuner's departure, qualifying as micro-setting that affects outcome. However, spatial choreography remains vague—no clear distances, tool placements, or movement paths are tracked across beats, and the "world below" is abstract backdrop rather than lived environment.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glass dome, crimson sand, and desert rose farm create a vivid, purposeful micro-environment. The magnetic shift affects systems concretely (scrambling sensors, throwing compasses into panic), pressuring the caretaker's choices. The roses—both internal (ribcasing garden) and external (rooted in soil)—bridge setting and character, with petals drifting from chest to sand as a charged closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (kneeling at dome, walking to irrigation node, turning toward nursery).

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    The courtyard is anchored with jasmine, dew, iron gate, and stoop; micro-setting (the mailbox, the locket warm in Elara's palm) charges the closure as the door swings open and Leo weeps beneath the jasmine. Sensory detail is purposeful and selective. However, Cedar Hollow Apartments and the interior of 3B remain unshown, and the mailbox's brass plaque and organic click are described but their mechanics never constrain a choice. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.7)
    The sunken lab is vividly rendered—silt-choked glass, corroded consoles, phosphorescent algae, drowned steel—and the setting constrains Elira's tactics (coolant vents to mislead drones, fissure for capsule launch, submersibles in Bay Theta). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through an operator's eye. The final beat, where water surges "not as destroyer but as veil," charges the closure image with the lab's transformation from extraction site to encryption chamber, lifting the score toward the 7.0 threshold. However, the body and props (dice, journal sheets) are described more than handled in tactile, lived-in ways, and spatial choreography blurs during the dance sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.1)
    The salt crystal chamber is vividly rendered—violet lamps, frozen chandeliers, cracking crystals—and constrains Elira's method (she works within this specific space). The wildflowers function as micro-setting objects that charge the closure: the aster placement triggers the pattern shift. The whale's skeleton serves as spatial anchor and causal pivot. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elira's investigative focus. The chamber's resonance and the gravity pockets materially shape her tactics and the final crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.1)
    Moonlight, brook, moss, and ferns are filtered through tactile and auditory detail that grounds the summoner's practice. The origami wing on water constrains the ritual and returns charged at closure, lifting the band. Spatial choreography (kneeling, placing, rising) remains clear. "Terrestrially cosmic" rhythm is evoked but not concretely anchored to a micro-setting choice; the environment supports atmosphere more than it pressures tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    The rooftop garden, meteor shower, and recurring objects (seal, key, tea) are vividly rendered and purposefully selected. The seal's patina "catching starlight like a promise" charges the exchange scene. Spatial choreography is clear (bench, fire escape, basement vault behind furnace), and the building's sentience is woven through creaks, sighs, and settling groans. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it provides atmosphere and symbolic resonance but remains backdrop rather than pressure. Sensory detail is strong (tea-stained receipts, velvet-lined cigar box, rusted key) and filtered through the protagonist's attentive lens, elevating the work into the 7+ range despite the lack of micro-setting constraint on closure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    The velvet garden at twilight is anchored early with vivid, selective sensory detail (petals that sighed, jasmine and damp earth, vines curling around ankles) and the willow functions as a micro-setting anchor for the shell's placement. The "last star fading" timeframe and the shell itself constrain her ritual sequence, and the final dawn light charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling, temple, lips, moss at base of willow), and the setting subtly mirrors the protagonist's internal quarantine motif without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.1)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, and stalactite drips create a vivid, purposeful setting that constrains the infiltration (vault of seamless marble, silence as guard). The key's mechanics—"responsive only to the frequency of a forger's remorse"—and the scroll's physical resistance ground the climax in object-pressure. Pearl twilight modulates from mourning to awakening, and the thorn embedding in marble supplies the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    The serpentine nexus, canyon walls, and twin moons create a vivid frame, and the shell is handled across multiple beats (pressed to temple, glowing, harmonizing). Sensory detail is rich but occasionally decorative ("salt-crusted silk," "dust-devils") without constraining choice. The spatial anchor holds throughout, and the final willow-root image charges closure. Setting does not meaningfully narrow options mid-scene—wind-carved hollows and coiled arches remain atmospheric backdrops—but the shell as micro-object qualifies and the nexus as nest-site matters at closure, pushing this into mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glacier shrine is vivid and specific: candle flames against blue-veined ice, the carved window recess, ice that "ripples, not melting, but remembering." The melted snow globe functions as micro-setting, constraining the final image when placed in the ice frame. Sensory hierarchy (warmth against glacial chill, borrowed starlight) charges the closure moment. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.1)
    The parapet setting is vivid and purposeful: wet stone, moss, silk banners, moonlight pooling after clouds. The bamboo whisk functions as micro-setting, handled twice and charged in the final image. Rain-washed chalk markings supply tactile history. Spatial choreography (barefoot on slick stone, eastward bend) remains clear. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her philosopher's lens, supporting the accumulative texture without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.4)
    Vivid sensory details ("peach blossoms glowed faintly," "gamma winds," "roots humming the frequency") establish atmosphere, but the orchard does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—she plants the diamond, watches the dust clear, then leaves. The wasteland is described more than inhabited; no spatial problem blocks her or alters tactics. The plaque discovery feels convenient rather than earned by spatial pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stormlit observatory is vivid and the cobalt portico returns with reweighted meaning at closure, constraining her broadcast choice through its harmonic lattice. Spatial choreography is clear (glass, radio console, storm outside), and sensory detail is selective. The "above clouds" setting isolates her, reinforcing the lonely-visionary frame, and the portico's mechanics shape the final act—genuine micro-setting work.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    The feral loft and dunes are vivid and specific; "salt-wind slipping through cracks," "dunes groaned under ice" anchor sensory detail in POV and season. The loft's evolution from smuggler's cache to sonic reliquary is purposeful. The frozen puddle in the climactic scene and the labeled jars throughout charge the setting with function. Spatial choreography is clean. The micro-setting (loft, jars, dunes) constrains the poet's isolation and enables the final gift to the child, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.1)
    The drift-ice marina and lighthouse setting supply vivid sensory anchors (pressure ridges, bioluminescent moss, mercury basin). Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; the ice "guiding" her steps and cracks sealing beneath her soles read as convenient rather than constraining choice. The Heartstone chamber's mercury and moss charge the atmosphere but do not alter her tactics at closure—she would sing/vibrate regardless of the basin's properties.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.4)
    The basalt sanctuary and frozen lake are vividly described with selective sensory detail (hoarfrost, bruised sky, iron bones). However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image in a way that would break story logic if removed; it remains atmospheric backdrop. Spatial choreography is consistent across moves. Micro-setting (the viaduct) recurs but is handled in summary rather than tactile interaction that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tunnel is vivid and purposeful: "grit and discarded bolts," "diesel residue," moisture beading "in unnatural patterns." Sensory detail is filtered through the investigator's professional lens (measuring echo decay, charting temperature drops). The lantern—inherited object—constrains her action (she kneels, places it on the rail) and charges the final image (its glow pulses "like a heartbeat syncing with hers"). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The subway setting shapes her method and the closure moment, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    The shop is vividly rendered (lemon oil, tarnished brass, silent ballerinas) and the workbench becomes a micro-setting that constrains Elias's attempts. The storm-light beam is a purposeful environmental detail that charges the climax. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the clockwork heart's physicality (robin's-egg size, brass cradle) grounds the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    The workshop's physical specificity is exceptional: floating anvils, magnetic looms, gyroscope-mounted Engine, acid sea hissing below. These details constrain Zeta's movements (she lands "with a clank," kicks open the hatch with her stabilizer fin) and charge the closure—the bell tower "bolted to the workshop's roof" becomes the site of the whispered promise. The micro-setting (the Engine's violet core, the copper horn, the kaleidoscope's mirrored facets) directly enables the transliteration action and shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive setting—server racks as mausoleums, frosted glass, decommissioned AI cores in the deepest vault—constrains her investigation and supplies the resonance-chamber concept that enables the climactic restore. Sensory detail is purposeful (hum of servers, flicker of screens, warmth of a spinning drive) and filtered through her professional lens. The Helios-7 patch functions as micro-setting, recurring with reweighted meaning at closure when a shadow reaches toward it. The "no window" detail and the vault's physical depth charge the final image. Gate met for 9-band consideration; no choreography breaks or implausible tech.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes is vividly rendered with sensory anchors (brittle frost, ancient-beast groans, salt-clouded glass). Spatial choreography is coherent across her ascent to the highest mirror. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint forces a tactical choice or alters her approach. The mirrors and crystal are handled on the page but their physical properties (weight, fragility, placement logistics) remain abstract. Orientation delay caps this category at 7.0 per the cross-rule.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly particular (black ice, rusted winch, groaning floes) and the parasol tip functions as micro-setting, constraining her ritual and charging the climactic chime. Sensory hierarchy is consistent (auroras, wind-borne frost, wet bell tone). The floe as final platform shapes her choice to drift rather than flee, and the setting's acoustic properties drive the core stake. Strong integration of body, tool, and environment across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    The amber pavilion, gnarled oak, and vineyard rows are integrated into action and perception throughout. The setting constrains choice: they meet "where tourists never wandered," the grapes "taut and purpled by frost" become a micro-demonstration that alters Mara's stance. Autumn and dusk modulate tone and urgency. Spatial choreography is clean (station → pavilion → oak → rows → return path). The final image ("her silhouette framed by amber light") charges closure by returning to the opening pavilion glow with reweighted meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the pavilion's "lattice of petrified vines," the kinetic parapet humming beneath, and the dune-rimmed horizon all anchor the ritual spatially and sensorially. The parapet's buried mechanisms respond to her touch, and the pavilion's murmur deepens in harmony—setting actively shapes her process. For 9+, the environment would need to constrain a choice or create friction; here it cooperates, limiting tension. Sensory detail is filtered through the line walker's disciplined perception, avoiding catalog exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.1)
    Lavender field and factory ruins are vividly described but function as postcard backdrop. The dove gray case is opened and closed without constraining choice. Spatial choreography is coherent, and sensory detail is selective, but no environmental element meaningfully shapes a decision or charges the final image—she simply leaves as she arrived.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    The library setting is vivid and purposeful: "dust-thick spines," "silence pooled like ink," "hollow knock of floorboards settling like tired bones." The crystal as micro-setting object constrains the scholar's method and charges the final beat when it catches her syllables. Spatial choreography is clean, and sensory selection reflects the scholar's priorities. The post-dictionary timeframe subtly pressures the stakes by making language restoration impossible, guiding her toward listening rather than reconstruction.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fog sculpture garden is vividly particular—fog curling into phantom limbs and half-remembered faces, mildewed videotape towers as tombstones, driftwood from tidal flats—and the setting constrains choice (he arranges markers, kneels before tapes, walks backward to avoid disturbing them). The chalk's screech on rusted fender and plastic case is tactile, purposeful, and charges the final image when it hangs in the mist "clinging like breath on glass." Micro-setting (chalk, driftwood, tapes) functions as constraint and tool, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the prophet's obsessive attention, with fog as both atmosphere and active participant that sculpts his grief.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lunar observatory, brass chronometer, glass dome, and plinth anchor spatial detail early and recur through the piece. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop for metaphysical narration; it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The clouds "stilling" and stars "flickering" are effects, not pressures. The chronometer (object-as-setting) is handled in multiple beats and charges the final sequence, lifting the score into the 5-band despite limited tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.1)
    The haven is described through vivid metaphor ("scent of hope: crisp as mountain air…sweet as bread rising") but remains a static backdrop. Spatial choreography is vague—figures "drift," Elara sits "on nothing"—with no grounding that constrains movement or choice. The vinyl shard is handled in multiple beats, meeting the micro-object test, and its dissolution charges the ending, lifting the score above pure ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating observatory, cracked dome, and orrery are vividly rendered and integrated into the central mystery. The automaton key's tactile coldness and serpent-shape anchor several beats, and the vault of liquid-night shadows provides a memorable micro-setting for the threshold crossing. Spatial choreography within the observatory is clear, though the broader floating-isle geography remains postcard-level. The key and orrery constrain Elira's ritual choices and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.1)
    The secret garden is vividly detailed (roses beside thistles, backward clocks, cinnamon and ozone) and anchors every beat. The hedge maze functions as a spatial constraint and invitation at closure. The tooth—handled twice, glowing with memory—charges the final image. Sensory specificity (damp soil, lilac scent, moss) is consistent and filtered through the protagonist's restorative focus, meeting the micro-setting test.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    The serpentine grotto is vividly rendered through mist, condensation, moss-slick stone, and filtered light, creating a coherent micro-cathedral. Sensory detail (salt, jasmine, thatch smoke) is filtered through memory and serves atmospheric accretion. The basin carved into the grotto floor enables the prismatic payoff, constraining the protagonist's ritual spatially and charging the final image, which lifts the score into the 7s despite the lack of spatial choice-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.4)
    The moss-choked data center is vividly rendered with sensory detail (emerald moss underfoot, rusted console, broken skylights). The setting functions as a crucible for ritual but does not constrain a key choice—she moves freely, places objects, and leaves without spatial or environmental friction. The amber pendant and nectar dish are handled on the page, elevating micro-setting work. However, the environment remains a backdrop for reflection rather than a pressure that alters tactics or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "feral nexus in mist" opens with vivid abstraction but lacks spatial anchors—no distances, landmarks, or body position to ground movement. The pier finale provides concrete sensory detail (gulls, tide, dawn) that constrains the final gesture. Micro-setting (seashell, satchel, manuscript) functions adequately but does not force a choice or charge the closure image beyond atmosphere. The mist serves tone more than constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    The arbor at dawn is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: dew on the vine tendril, moss and machine oil scent, amber rays through brass goggles, shadows deepening as the sun climbs. The vine tendril functions as micro-setting, constraining Elara's action (she must play to it, it responds by curling around her wrist, then releases and blooms). The final wreath image charges the closure moment. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's focus (sound, touch, light over taste/smell), and the environment subtly guides the ritual's progression. No spatial confusion or placeholder generics.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.1)
    The subarctic crater orchard is vividly rendered with frost, permafrost, brittle branches, and auroral imagery. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. The setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome, capping the score below 9.0. The body and tools (vials, plate, objects) are handled but function as ritual props rather than tactical pressures. Spatial choreography is clear; the environment charges mood but does not drive the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.1)
    The marble cavern is vividly rendered with quartz veins, condensation, and the single shaft of midday sun that the locksmith uses tactically (aligning mirrors, triggering glyphs). The shattered stalactite at dusk demonstrates environment responding to action, and the resin slabs function as micro-setting that organizes the harvest. Sensory detail is abundant and selective, filtered through the locksmith's archive-building purpose, meeting the requirement that setting constrains choice and charges the final display.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bronze grotto is vividly anchored with oxidized walls, copper halos, starlight fissures, and the kerosene lamp's pulsing glow. Spatial choreography is clean: lamp placement, letter beside it, shelves carved into walls. The lamp's alignment with the grotto's magnetic seam and the starlight fissure provides a constraint that shapes the ritual and charges the final image. The recurring detail of snowmelt dripping as a metronome ties time, atmosphere, and the story's rhythm together.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    The loft is established early (rain-beaded skylight, woolen rug, cedar chest, single window) and micro-setting constrains choice: the carving blank pulled from "Before," the skylight's watery gold striping her hands at the turn, the windowsill as final resting place. The kettle downstairs creates spatial pressure through sound, and Eleanor's refusal to descend becomes a choice shaped by environment. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her state: "rust-hued peace," "wet cedar and old tea leaves," rain tapping glass. The body and tool (chisel worn by Viktor's grip) charge the final image when the lion is placed where light touches it.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.1)
    The kinetic lagoon, carousel spire, and floating islands create a vivid, specific setting that remains consistent. The camera wheel functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and charged at closure when the ghost takes and uses it. Sensory selection is purposeful ("salt-crusted planks that remember music," "whispers trapped in glass beads"), filtered through the scavenger's melancholic lens, and the twin moons return to frame the climactic scene. The camera's final use — flash, winding, empty film — constrains the protagonist's realization and charges the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    The abandoned terminal is vividly rendered through specific decay (peeling hazard stripes, fractured skylight, deflated balloons) and its infrastructure directly constrains Elira's choices: the ruptured geothermal line becomes the steam source, security kiosk housings supply conduit material. The sextant mounted atop the rotunda's spire charges the final image by projecting golden triangles, and the kinetic tiles convert visitor footsteps into power. Spatial choreography remains clear across all moves (Sub-Level 3 descent, central rotunda work, cargo annex threshold) and the setting actively participates in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sanctuary is vivid and recurring (chronometers, pendulums, stool, high windows); the crystal's moss-cradled arrival and its surface tremor provide micro-setting constraint that charges the ending. Sensory detail is purposeful: mercury-pooled time, velvet silence, liquid-sun brass. The crystal's placement atop the chronometer and the filtered moonlight create spatial logic that narrows Elias's final act. Meets the 9+ gate (object constrains choice and charges final image) but idiom occasionally drifts into elevated register ("glacial hush," "petrichor nostalgia") that feels imposed rather than Elias-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    The canal is vivid and specific: moss-slicked edge, rotting pilings, silt, violet light mirroring the sundial's arc. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the seeker's priorities (angles, temperature of time, physics and patience). The sundial's shadow-casting and the water's stillness constrain the moment of salvage, directly shaping the retrieval choice. The canal's final exhalation and return to murmur charge the closure image, making the environment indispensable to the ending's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    The golden dock, snow, fog, and harbor create a coherent sensory envelope filtered through the protagonist's priorities (oceanic hush, breath-held reverence). The fulgurite and rope function as charged micro-settings that constrain interaction: the glass is an offering that earns trust, the rope becomes the teaching instrument. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling, sitting beside, tracing knots). The setting charges the final image when "fog curled around their shoulders like a shawl," grounding the abstract transmission in tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The garden is vividly rendered with selective, POV-filtered detail: "marble nymphs wept lichen tears," "ivy choked forgotten arches," "damp stone," and "withered rosebush" all anchor the traveler's solitary ritual in a decayed, autumnal space. Sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist's priorities—touch (thread, parchment, moss), sight (crimson glow, moonlight, frost-like shimmer), and sound (leaves whispering, harbor bells silent)—without tourist catalog. The rosebush functions as micro-setting, receiving the folded crane and thus constraining the traveler's final gesture. Spatial choreography is clean: seated on stone, then standing to brush knees. The thread on the wrist recurs across beats, its warmth charging the closure image with memory and resonance, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The suspended palace anchored to stalactites is established early and constrains choice—chains groaning, chandeliers swaying—charging the final image when "the palace trembled harder, not from decay, but awakening." The mechanical wasteland below, stained-glass myths, and the atrium's cracked marble are filtered through the prince's despair and hope. The egg's cradle of brass petals and velvet moss, plus the mirrors shattering into floating shards of sky, uses micro-setting objects to pressure the climax. Spatial choreography is clear; sensory detail (acid rain, wild thyme scent) is selective and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.6)
    The black sand, obsidian lagoon, and dune-grass create a coherent micro-setting that constrains the ritual: sand clings "like a blessing," the lagoon's glassy surface mirrors clouds, and the volcanic origin ties directly to the father's forbidden beach. The coin kissing the water and the obsidian shards rising are tactile, pressure-laden moments. The final image—coin-glint beneath the surface, sand clinging to boots—charges closure by grounding the metaphor in physical persistence. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (firefighter's attention to "kelp-drift," "salt-laced air").

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    The city of forgotten fountains is vividly rendered through sensory particulars (moss-choked basins, pigeon bones, rusted gates) and filters through the skeptic's perceptual bias (mapping acoustics, recording humidity). The stained glass box and brass key are handled on the page and constrain her method. Spatial choreography is coherent across fountains. The final image—a single drop in the oldest basin—charges the ending and demonstrates that environment shapes both tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.1)
    The nebula garden supplies vivid sensory texture (violet, ember, petals, hydrogen clouds) filtered through an otherworldly POV. The setting does not constrain a choice but charges the final image through petals and pulses, meeting the micro-setting allowance. Spatial choreography is dreamlike but coherent within its own logic. The recurring petals reweight the closure moment, lifting the score toward the 9+ gate threshold without quite crossing it.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    The greenhouse setting is vivid and purposeful: moss-slicked flagstones, glass panes, iron rafters, and the overgrown lemon tree create tactile grounding. Ribbons tied to the rafters and the butterfly migration brushing the glass charge the space with accumulative meaning. The setting constrains Elias's action (he comes here nightly, ties ribbons, carves in this specific sanctuary) and the final storm's "bass note" modulates atmosphere to support closure. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tidal obsidian ridge is vivid and specific ("jagged altar to time's erosion," "black glass surface slick with brine"), and the tower's spatial choreography (spiral stairs, brass housing, pendulum bob) is clear. The pendulum bob's "microscopic grooves" and the rake's inscriptions ground the world in tactile detail. The ridge returns at closure where Elias places the rake handle, charging the final image with accumulated texture. Sensory selection reflects his professional focus (gear whispers, arc degrees) and the setting modulates with his emotional shift (from clamor to gull cries). No penalty for occupation depth at this length when it serves stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cobalt silo is vivid and purposeful: "curved walls drank the moonlight, turning the air into liquid twilight." The tapestry and sovereign case function as micro-setting objects that constrain the gardener's ritual choices. However, the cemetery above and the transition between graveyard and silo remain spatially vague—no anchoring details bridge the descent. The final image returns to the headstones, charging them as "thresholds," which elevates the setting's role in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.1)
    Vivid sensory catalog (glacial mist, obsidian inkwell, iridescent barbs) anchors location and atmosphere, but the setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics—props are handled ceremonially without friction. The parchment's luminescent veins and the spire's pulse are ornamental flourishes that do not pressure the protagonist's decisions. Spatial choreography is clear and the recurring ice/stone imagery supports tone, lifting the score above mere postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ember alcove is vivid and purposeful: embers flare in response to her tears, mist thickens at the threshold, and the shortwave dial's warmth guides her tuning. The setting constrains her ritual (tuning only after midnight when mist thickens) and charges the closure image (another alcove warming). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her copyist's attention (staves, vellum, moth-wing thread). Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the alcove functions as both literal workspace and metaphorical incubator for resurrection, satisfying the micro-setting standard for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    The gallery, rocking chair, and porcelain mask function as micro-setting that charges the ritual and final image; the chair's stopping marks the beat transition into the scattering, and the mask's "seams where shards were glued" reinforces brokenness-as-revelation. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (bare feet whispering, powder settling like snowfall, candle flame trembling), filtered through art-ritual idiom. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting shapes atmosphere and grounds the character's symbolic work but does not constrain a plot choice or alter tactics under external pressure, keeping this shy of the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting is integral: the sewer/archive, submerged artifacts (slate, scale-weight, vial, sundial), and vertical geography (below vs. above, depth vs. height) constrain his choices and charge the final image. The chronometer cog, handled in multiple beats, functions as micro-setting that shapes his methodology and the bell-tower ritual. Sensory detail is purposeful (phosphorescent fungi glow, stagnant puddle, slick stone) and filtered through his preservationist lens. The half-submerged bell tower and its cracked lip provide the stage for closure, where the cog's placement and the water's response directly serve the ending's resonance. Spatial choreography (descent, climb, return) remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    The velvet library is vividly rendered (drapes, amber light, dust motes) and recurs with purpose: it absorbs noise, mirrors Elara's subtractive method, and anchors the girl's entrance. The rosette functions as micro-setting—handled twice, reweighted in the ending as a "blueprint for rebuilding." The autumn window and clinging leaf charge the final turn. Spatial choreography is clear (table, stacks, window). The setting constrains choice subtly (the quiet invites waiting, the creak signals presence) and charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate, but the velvet/merlot description leans decorative in the middle beats without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.4)
    The rusted greenhouse is vividly anchored with selective detail (fractured glass, iron rot, blunt thorns), and the setting frames the action throughout. The micro-setting of soil and trellis constrains the planting choice and the sprout's sideways growth charges the final image. However, the celestial alignment and twin moons remain decorative; they do not alter Elara's tactics or options, weakening the environment's pressure role.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Lightning Collection Tower constrains the entire action—drones cling to its copper struts, it still hums post-blackout, and the climb to the third platform is necessary for discovery. Micro-setting details (salt marshes, copper veins, photoreceptors, nectar dusk) are filtered through Elias's patient reverence and the woman's cartographic gaze. The lacquer box's hummingbee etchings and the matchboxes provide tactile, recurring anchors. The final image—rain on copper, drones beginning to hum—charges closure and validates the tower's aliveness. Spatial choreography (base, ladder, third platform) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bay setting is rendered with strong sensory specificity ("moss-slick stone," "salt-kissed air") and the orris root shard functions as micro-setting, constraining the ritual's physical choreography. The streetlights "daydreaming" and the vanished cottage beneath the hedge charge the atmosphere. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting participates in the closure by providing the tide that will dissolve the shard, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint or charge.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    The underwater garden is richly textured (kelp, moss-furred shoulder, statuesque orchids, eels through trellises) and integrated throughout. The ampoule's recess "in sea-silt and snail trails" and the statue's chipped knee as structural weakness tie environment to the closure beat: breaking the ampoule against the knee releases light that reveals murals, directly altering what the historian knows and can carry upward. The garden's animate lifelessness constrains perception and charges the final image as the statue dissolves "into plankton." Sensory detail is POV-filtered (pressure suit, oxygen debt, tears mixing with saltwater) and the spatial choreography remains clear across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    The infinite staircase is vivid, particular, and pressures every choice: "spiraled without curvature," stone that digests his equations, landings every 37 steps. The body (thumbnail carving, breath syncing with gears, back scraping stone) and the chipped die function as micro-setting, constraining action and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (cold tread, hum of gears, neon-lit arcade memory). The environment is integral to the protagonist's tactics and the closure moment when stone becomes liquid glass.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rooftop greenhouse is signaled early, its glass panes and soot anchoring the smog-choked city. The moon's path dictates canvas alignment, and the skylight's opening becomes ritual choreography. The brush's lunar-charged bristles and the greenhouse's salt-and-jasmine air during the Vaelish glyph demonstrate that environment shapes the protagonist's method and charges the final shared painting. Spatial choreography remains coherent; the fire escape, studio door, and billboard across the street track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.2)
    The grotto city behind the waterfall is vividly rendered with moss, limestone chambers, stalactites, and the rosewater-dread atmosphere. Sensory details are purposeful and the setting supports the cultural-preservation theme. Yet the environment remains largely backdrop; it does not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics in a meaningful way. The alcove where the boy hides the drum is the closest moment where setting enables action, but that discovery feels convenient rather than a spatial pressure that narrows options or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse, hunger stone, and tidal window provide concrete spatial anchors and constrain the sequence: tide must be low to reveal the stone, the lighthouse beam reverses as a physical marker of temporal inversion. The hunger stone's glyphs, kelp, silt, and obsidian petals are specific and tactile. However, the rocky island itself remains generic—no unique geography or local detail differentiates it from any coastal ruin. The body and tools (mainspring, yoyo core) do constrain choices and charge the final image, satisfying the micro-setting allowance and lifting the score into the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    The funhouse is vividly realized through selective sensory detail (mildew, cotton candy ghost, cracked mirrors reflecting screams) and the opera cloak clasp functions as a micro-object that pulses with heartbeat, creating tangible environmental constraint. Spatial choreography through the Hall of Whispers is clear. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical constraint; the mirrors and mannequins pressure mood but do not materially alter the protagonist's choices or narrow options. The final "mechanisms sighing into permanent stillness" charges the ending image, lifting the setting's role at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.1)
    The orchard afloat—driftwood, salt-drinking roots, gnarled trees—is vivid and purposeful, shaping the Prophet's percussion toolkit. The whalebone mallet, wave-xylophone, and fruit-as-drum provide tactile constraint. Spatial choreography (Prophet at the edge, Kael behind) remains clear. The blue-hour timeframe and blackening sea charge atmosphere, and the final translucent hum reweights the orchard's resonance, meeting the 9+ gate for setting participation at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    The turtle-shell city is vivid and specific: grooves as streets, ridges as districts, the bleached sky, and the rusted gate all anchor the world. The reed whistle functions as micro-setting, returning across beats to constrain her method and charge the final packing scene. Spatial choreography is coherent (balcony, ridge, gate), and sensory detail (sun bleaching, silence pressing, whistle trembling) modulates with urgency. The setting subtly guides choice—the highest ridge is the target, the city's noise fades at midnight—without becoming a postcard catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    The disused railway station is vividly rendered with purposeful detail (ivy strangling iron, roots cracking concrete, the rosebush petal falling into a puddle). Sensory selection is strong and filtered through the historian's purposeful search. The station constrains her movements (kneeling, brushing aside moss) and the final image of the falling petal charges the ending symbolically, meeting the 9+ gate criterion for constraint/charge. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.1)
    The submerged pavilion is vivid and purposeful: "chandeliers now crusted barnacle-crowns," water lapping at her knees, tiles shifting "like teeth in a slack jaw." Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's professional bias (surveyor turned scribe) and the pavilion itself constrains her ritual—foundation repairs, cracked mortar, the sealed copper tube behind a keystone. The keystone detail charges the closure when she seals her copy there with fresh mortar, making the setting indispensable to the final image. Spatial choreography and decay details remain consistent across descents.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sunken library is vividly realized through moss-slick shelves, kelp-choked skylight, hidden vents, and silt; sensory detail is selective and filtered through the indexer's professional priorities. The setting constrains movement (water pressure, rotting wood groans) and supplies resources (marble tide tables, preserved Master Index) that shape her investigative path. The antique stamp and the circular desk pedestal anchor the final image, charging closure. Spatial choreography remains clear across the rotunda descent.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    The floating isle, glass basilica, tea garden, and gem-polishing workshop are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Silas's grief-soaked attention (silver-leafed camellias, cups that never cool, spires humming with refracted light). The basilica's new-key hum signals the shadow's ascent and triggers Silas's final action, so setting constrains choice. Spatial choreography is clean (isle above clouds, basilica's central nave, rose window at the apex). The sapphire striking marble and the tea garden blooming in reverse charge the closure image with sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating observatory is vividly rendered (zero-gravity halls, mirrored domes, observation blister) and the geode's tactile presence (pulsing, vibrating air into visible ripples) charges multiple beats. The body and tool constrain choice: magnetized boots anchor movement, the neural interface chair stages the simulation, and the South Pacific coordinates arise from the setting's systems. The environment subtly mirrors internal state (Earth "like a wound turning in its sleep"), though some details ("Cradle of Cold Eyes") feel more ornamented than pressure-driven. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the thrusters' ignition directly enables the closure leap.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory is established with vivid, selective detail (cracked celestial dial, crumbling arches, velvet-lined obsidian) and the "brilliant dimness" paradox charges the atmosphere throughout. The drone's projected star trails enable the activation sequence, giving the setting tactical utility. Spatial choreography remains clear across all moves, and the twin moons in the vision anchor world-scale without catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt terrace, surf, and driftwood shore are vivid and purposeful: the tiles shift from "cool beneath her feet" to feeling "like closure," and the tide's physical action (gnawing, tugging, reclaiming) mirrors the story's thematic work. The watch hand's rust "flecked with gold" and the warm, humming wood anchor tactile specificity. However, the setting functions more as symbolic backdrop than tactical constraint—Elira's choices are not meaningfully altered by access, proximity, or environmental pressure. The terrace and shore charge the final image but do not narrow her options in earlier beats.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.1)
    The storm-worn parapet and mist are vividly rendered and sustain atmosphere throughout. The drawer pull and key function as micro-setting elements that charge the final exchange. Spatial choreography is clean: two figures on a parapet, descent together. The environment supports tone but does not materially constrain a choice—no tactical shift arises from the setting's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: utility poles replace stars as navigational anchors, constraining the protagonist's tactics and charging the final image. The coastal launch, gravel, crossarms, and kayak hull are filtered through her navigator's perspective. Sensory detail is selective (salt wind, crows, fogged compass glass, tide licking boots) and the poles function as micro-setting, shaping her choice to move inland then return. This meets the 9+ gate test (environment constrains choice, charges closure), but the body itself (boots, wrists, breath) could be more tactilely integrated into peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    The underground lake is vividly rendered (turquoise glow, ozone taste, algae-lit walls, submerged objects) and directly charges the closure: the baseball floats, ripples branch fractally, light reveals pain-images. The water's pulse and the cavern's physicality constrain the seeker's choice—this exact setting enables the empathy-kindling moment. Micro-setting (the baseball on water) functions as both object and spatial anchor, altering the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.4)
    The orchard's "permanent moonlight" and "silver bark" anchor atmosphere effectively, and the spices (saffron, cardamom, cinnamon) are named with sensory detail. Yet the environment remains postcard-static: no branch blocks her movement, no moon-phase shift alters the conjuring, no tactile constraint shapes her final choice. The setting charges the tone but does not narrow options or participate in the closure action.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.1)
    The midnight glade above clouds is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (thin air, moss, clouds thickening into spectral hands) and the environment constrains choice: roots rise to cradle her hand, the saucer becomes a threshold she must crawl through. The micro-setting—her body pressed to moss, forehead to saucer rim—drives the climactic crossing. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, the glade's mechanics (why this place pools time) are asserted rather than discovered through action, and the porch swing at the end arrives without spatial setup, creating a brief geography gap.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.1)
    The recycled spaceship supplies vivid sensory anchors (rust, solar wind, failing gravity plates, cracked viewport) and the locket fused to her sternum constrains her physicality. Sector Gamma and the coolant valve ground the pivotal photograph discovery in spatial detail. The Echo-Realm meadow under twin moons charges the final image with tactile arrival (translucent figures, cake, glistening tear) that extends the photograph motif, making environment inseparable from closure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    Black sand absorbing moonlight and the volcano's affectionate rumble provide vivid sensory anchors. However, the beach remains a passive backdrop—neither sand nor volcano constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters the protagonist's tactics. The setting charges the atmosphere but does not participate in the closure image's pressure, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.7)
    The luminous fort, spiral stair, courtyard, and rooftop are spatially coherent and anchored early. The blackout dims the lanterns and dulls the guards' attention, which enables the protagonist's moves but does not force a tactical pivot. The sundial plinth and bronze quill holder are handled concretely (twist, align, press, trace), and the final rooftop return reprises the opening vantage with the light "seeping" back—this reprise reweights the opening image with modest thematic charge. Environment supplies resources rather than constraints; no moment where setting blocks a path and compels adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    The frictionless world is a striking, purposeful constraint that charges the final image: the herder cannot grab the eel, so breath and proximity replace grip. The tidal bluff, aurora, and painted rocks all contribute to the closure beat. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("slick stone," "liquid mercury," "collapsed star dust"), filtered through the herder's reverent attention. Spatial choreography is clear throughout; the setting actively shapes the herder's method and the eels' response.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory setting is vivid and purposeful: "domed ceiling streaked by lightning," "glass eye trained on galaxies." Spatial choreography is clear (chair, locker, eastern window). The darkroom timer and sealed envelope function as micro-setting objects that constrain the ritual. The storm accumulates pressure and charges the final image ("storm-kissed and wonder-struck"). However, the observatory itself does not alter a tactical choice on the page; it serves as atmospheric container rather than active constraint. Sensory detail is selective and consistent with the accumulative design, filtered through the poet's elevated register.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.1)
    The atrium's glass panes, sundial, and brook are vividly rendered and anchor spatial choreography throughout. The sundial's shadow at 11:03 provides a concrete constraint that drives the transcription beat, and the needle card's perforations interact with that shadow to unlock the score—micro-setting functioning as tool. The brook's "gurgling approvingly" and glass "holding its breath" veer toward pathetic fallacy but do not obscure spatial logic. The setting charges the final image (leaving the needle card on the table) with modest resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    The rusted library is vividly rendered (corroded gutters, shattered skylight, open ribs of the ruined roof) and the environment charges the final image by supplying the floorboard cracks for seed-planting. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric (moonlight "stitching the fractures," wax pooling "like liquid starlight"), filtered through Molt's poetic lens. The setting functions as more than backdrop—it becomes the canvas for her act of rebellion—pushing this into the solid 7-range despite minimal spatial choreography of movement within the space.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.0)
    The tidal arbor is vividly rendered with silver bark, mist pockets, and cloud-sea below, and the setting constrains one key choice: Elira has mapped harmonic resonances to "bend local gravity" and "coax color from the monochrome sky," shaping her tactical approach to the final chord. The projector, piano, and moss-pulse details are sensory and purposeful. However, spatial choreography wobbles—how the film projects onto the canopy, where the compasses materialize relative to Elira, and the mechanics of "threads of starlight from below the clouds" remain abstract. Capped at 7.0 per the Orientation Test penalty applied in Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ancient ridge is vividly rendered with opal petals, translucent vines, and glyphs like fireflies in amber. The setting constrains Aris's ritual (warm soil, twin moons, Elira sleeping beside the seed) and charges the final image (the ridge glows, villagers gather below). Sensory detail is lush and filtered through Aris's professional lens. The ridge qualifies as micro-setting that shapes tactics and ending, meeting the 9+ gate test. However, slight overwriting (e.g., "star-drunk skies," "magic's arrogance") and the delayed spatial anchoring (noted in Q2) prevent higher placement.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    The islet after rain is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (salt-laced wind, damp stone and brine scent, shallow hollow beneath wind-sculpted pine). Setting constrains Elio's actions: he finds the precise spot where rain pooled, kneels in loam, and the wet earth allows the color to bleed upward. The compass and lace function as micro-setting objects that directly enable the ritual and charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

    Setting is vivid and purposeful, with viaduct details (bioluminescent vines, lantern-flowers) constraining choices via breath responses and charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects POV urgency, and micro-setting (camera obscura, tear) integrates tightly with closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.4)
    The living bridge garden constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details filtered through Elira's POV. Specificity is high, and the environment actively shapes tactics, such as when the bridge absorbs her tears, meeting the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is vividly specific with sensory details like dust motes and dry soil scent. The abandoned carnival constrains choices through the piano mechanism and vault. Micro-setting elements (arrow, keys) charge the final image by reweighting meaning. Environment shapes tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting is vividly specific and atmospheric, with the sunken orchard greenhouse and shipwrecks pressuring choices and charging the final image. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV, and the forge acts as a micro-setting that constrains action. Environment evolves causally with events.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)
    Setting is vividly specific and integral, constraining choices as the station's features guide her interventions (e.g., Platform 3, western alcove). Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through her POV, charging the final image with the "service gate" and station's atmosphere. The emerald station functions as a micro-setting that actively pressures tactics and deepens theme.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.2)
    Setting is vivid and sensory, with the abandoned control room and thawing world constraining choices through scavenged resources and charging the final image via the glass spheres; details are selective and purposeful, filtered through POV.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.5)
    Setting ("rusted library under stars") is vivid and sensory, pressuring choices by housing the decoder cast and projector. The seashell and cast as micro-settings constrain actions and charge the final image. Details are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding generic description.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting constrains choice and charges the finale, with the ridge fort's "cold, salt-crusted stone" and "ambered hush" shaping her actions. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, reflecting POV bias—e.g., thunder as a "muted heartbeat." The storm-tossed environment actively pressures her solitude, altering tactics and deepening the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    The frozen courtyard and ice violin are indispensable, constraining choices as an archive and charging the closure when the violin melts; sensory details like "bristles whispering over ice" are selective and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is vividly specific and sensory, with the crystal forecourt and rain influencing choices and mood. The environment constrains action, such as the dais and skylight used for the lens. Details are filtered through POV, enhancing atmosphere. The recurring object (lens) charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.5)
    Setting is indispensable, with the garden maze actively pressuring choices and evolving organically to charge the closure. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered, such as the "scent of damp earth and impending rain," and the marbles constrain tactics. The environment shapes the final image of reciprocity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting is vividly specific and sensory ("methane sea," "bruised violet and silver sky"), filtered through Elira's POV to guide choice.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse is richly realized—wet rot, ozone, broken panes, mushrooms—and it meaningfully shapes what she can do (a patched skylight corner, drafts, humidity gradients, vines intruding). Environmental specifics (humidifier zone, drafty door) directly generate the dust geometries that drive her insights, and the final image of the slide on the east wall charges the setting as a sanctified lab/chapel. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her scientific attention, supporting theme without feeling touristic. The only small limit is that the external physical constraint of the damaged space is less about forcing hard choices than about quietly enabling observation.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    The canyon, stars, frost, sand, and kiln are not decorative; they directly shape what she can do (study frost, gather sand, build a brick kiln) and charge the final images of glass and ledger as altar. Weather and geology—dawn frost, wind and water carving stone—are mirrored in her adaptive process and choices, integrating environment with theme and tactic. The micro-setting of the canyon constrains who can find her (hikers, seekers) and how her work circulates. The final image of the ledger framed in glass above the kiln is inseparable from place, satisfying the “object-as-setting” gate.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    The winterglass conservatory is vivid and particular—frosted tiles, ice-limned panes, frozen ferns and petals—never reading as a generic greenhouse. Environment and tools (glass, ice, tuning forks, thermal visor) directly constrain and enable action: vibration must travel through frozen structures; emotional thermals are literally mapped onto the space. The final image of the conservatory “hummed—silent, radiant, alive” shows the setting reweighted by her actions, charging both tone and theme. Sensory focus is strongly visual and tactile but appropriate to a world without audible sound, which sharpens rather than flattens the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    The underwater city library is vividly rendered (floating swollen books, cathedral-rib ceilings, drowned scholars) and tightly integrated with action: it’s both refuge and apparatus for embedding the lens shards. Environmental images (“the city remembered light”) fuse setting with theme and directly charge the final image of a “cathedral of quiet endings.” The physical structure of the library constrains tactics—he uses its walls, statues, and stacks as housing for prisms—so atmosphere is not merely decorative. The specificity and evolution of the space from mausoleum to cathedral strongly support the story’s emotional and conceptual arc.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting work is vivid and purposeful: the terra-cotta arbor, frost-feathered ridge, and clay bowls of soup ground the abstract themes in concrete texture.

Setting is always filtered through her synesthetic perception, which keeps description purposeful rather than touristic. The environment constrains and shapes the method—this specific acoustically haunted, ruin-ringed space is framed as the only place that can echo trust’s fracture. At the end, the setting unmistakably charges the final image, with wrecks now “resonating with the imprint she’d forged.”

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    The station is richly and efficiently realized—“moss-cracked tiles,” “ivy-wrapped pillars,” departure boards, benches, alcoves—always filtered through her sense of it as a “cathedral of crossings.” Spatial logic holds across platforms, benches, escalator, and alcove, so we can track where each encounter happens. The environment meaningfully shapes the premise: its status as a transit hub of near-misses and reunions makes her flower codes and moonbeam visions plausible and thematically charged. The final image of the sunset’s last sliver vanishing behind the clock tower nicely charges the closing departure, even if the setting doesn’t actively constrain a specific tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned control room and melting structure are vividly and precisely rendered, with weather and architecture (“ice whispered its retreat,” “building sighed”) mirroring the thematic thaw. Setting details are filtered through her craft sensibility (glass, steel, furnace, colored rods) and never feel like a catalogue. Environment meaningfully shapes the final image: meltwater carries the sphere to the child, and the control room’s drip-chime becomes the building’s “lullaby.” The only limit keeping this just shy of the very top is that the space rarely constrains her options or forces tactical adaptation; it’s more canvas than obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “rusted library” under perforated, star-leaking rafters is both atmospherically rich and functionally integrated: it supplies the projector, the buried reel, and the final fire-lit transformation. Details like the collapsed astronomy section and mural of librarians turned to stone by silence echo the theme of petrified knowledge and suppressed truth without feeling like mere ornament. Environment constrains action (the footage is literally under the projector in this decaying archive) and charges the closing image as the building burns around her. The setting is focused rather than encyclopedic, with just enough specificity to feel singular.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is rich, specific, and fully integrated: storm-tossed ridge fort, salt-crusted stone, ambered hush, and sea all interlock with the act of listening to silences. The environment actively shapes the piece: the hush versus the raging storm embodies her project and charges the final image of entering a “marbled hush.” Weather and fort are not postcard backdrops; they mirror and contain the central tension between chaos and structured quiet. This is publish-grade atmospheric control with only slight risk of sensory density edging toward saturation.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    The frozen courtyard, twilight, and the Conservatory of Frozen Echoes are vividly realized and tightly integrated; the environment literally archives thought and makes possible the echo-violin mechanic. Setting is filtered through the robot’s ritualistic attention, giving the place a lived, patient feel rather than a tourist catalog. The courtyard and ice violin actively charge the final image: as the instrument melts and droplets fall on flagstones, both space and object embody the shift from external archive to internal witnessing. Weather, cold, and ice aren’t just backdrop; they structure how memory and thought behave.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through the story’s mood—“crystal whispering forecourt,” rain, quartz, moonlight, and the Annex all deepen atmosphere without feeling like a tourist catalog. Environmental elements meaningfully shape the action: the crystals, rain, and fractured skylight enable the lens’s effect, and the architecture channels the keepers’ responses. The world’s odd rules (air carrying memory, abandoned Municipal Archives) are implied through setting rather than exposition. The closing image of dawn over quartz eaves reweights the prior night’s ritual effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    The garden maze is richly and precisely rendered—vines knotting, roses elbowing boxwood, the mossy altar—and is consistently filtered through her decades-long intimacy with it. Setting actively charges the final image: marbles on river stones, canopy parting, fireflies mirroring the collection, and a vine curling round her ankle all reconfigure the garden as co-agent. The measurable-luck world is sketched with just enough detail (probability bands, census drones) to feel concrete without expository drag. Environment clearly shapes what matters—ritual over metrics—though it could constrain her choices a bit more directly to push into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: methane sea, titanium ribs, twilight sky, and avian xenomorphs all feel tactile and specific, and details like magnetized boots and the gantry shape how Elira moves. The magnetic nexus as an architectural heart that becomes a temporal pivot tightly weds environment to plot. The recurring twilight and roosting wings charge the final image of creatures “in the fold between moments,” turning setting into a conceptual stage. World rules (magnetic harmony, chroniton drift) are sketched efficiently and stay internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    The flooded opera house is richly and precisely rendered—“submerged velvet seats,” “balconies weeping rust,” “chairs floated like lily pads”—with details tightly filtered through a musician’s sensibility. Environment isn’t mere backdrop: water depth, lantern angle, and the damaged architecture all directly shape how she reads the program and how the ghost manifests. The recurring water/lantern/pit imagery culminates in the ending, where the warmed water and humming silence charge the final image. This is elite-level atmosphere that meaningfully constrains and inflects the action.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mountain weather station is vividly rendered and functionally integral, from the wind “gnashing” at glass to the ice-glazed gantry that makes her externalization of the drawing a literal exposure to the elements. Instruments, rusted anemometers, and the cramped cot all mirror and constrain her isolation and choices. The aurora and “auroral sorrow” directly charge the final emotional register. Setting, body, and small objects (quartz shard, vellum, hatch) all meaningfully shape her actions and the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tunnel, mildew, damp gravel, rusted alcove, and tarnished brass wheel create a vivid, claustrophobic atmosphere filtered through her alert yet exhausted perception. The environment works as a liminal, underworld-like space that mirrors her descent into suppressed truth without feeling like blunt symbolism. The valve and radio operate as micro-setting tools that constrain tactile choices (kneeling, touching, twisting, pocketing). These objects and the tunnel frame charge the final walk back toward dawn with concrete resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is richly imagined and specific: mossed catacombs, beetle-wing “books,” star maps, the obsidian monolith, and the river all build a coherent, uncanny archive. Details are consistently filtered through the keeper’s reverent, observant lens, and the environment’s loosened grip on reality matches the story’s thematic looseness about time and causality. The refuge and river recur to charge the final image, giving place real weight in the ending. The only limit is that the environment mostly frames experience rather than constraining concrete choices.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sage Ridge and the “dreaming roots” are vividly, specifically rendered, with smell (sage, cedar), shape (bowl-shaped hollow), and history (land that “learned to listen”) tightly fused to mood. The environment doesn’t just decorate; it frames the possibility of “ordinary magic” and makes the communal hush under the eclipse feel earned rather than generic. The curl as a recurring small object also functions as a micro-setting, charging the final image in the girl’s hands. The one limitation is that the geography rarely constrains action beyond providing an acoustically and spiritually apt bowl for the gathering.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and thematically integrated: a grain silo “rusted into reverence,” a drowned cathedral, an underlibrary where “gravity still stutters,” all filtered through her archivist gaze. Environmental details do real work: the fireplace’s ash yields diaries; the tapestry fragment and the humming walls directly shape her realizations and next move. The final image of “bronze quiet” and faintly glowing dragons is charged by everything we’ve learned about rifts, threads, and memories. This is near top-tier environment-as-character work, though a touch more immediate physical constraint or hazard could push it even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    The lighthouse and rocky island are rendered with strong, economical specificity (Fresnel lens, salt-crusted windows, whispering kelp), and the environment is thematically integrated as a conduit for light and flow. The physical isolation, tides, and ferries plausibly shape Elias’s tactics for timing fortunes. The final image of the sweeping beam as conductor’s baton effectively charges the setting with conceptual weight. That said, the environment constrains few concrete, high-pressure choices, keeping this just short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dimensional anchor and its sensory specifics (“gravity whispered,” “air tasted of static and old incense”) are vivid and consistently filtered through the priest’s rhetorical and liturgical sensibility. Environment and objects materially affect events: questions warp geometry, the vortex at the center defines danger, and the palette/glyph reshape the rules of engagement. The setting feels intrinsically tied to theme—thresholds, mirages, architecture of silence—rather than pasted-on atmosphere. A touch less metaphor-stacking in early lines would sharpen, not weaken, the impact of this already strong worldbuilding.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, mirrored horizon, and frost-laced glass floor are richly drawn and tightly integrated into action (the nautilus on the table, the glass rippling, the lake cracking). Setting is not mere backdrop; it behaves in response to her conducting, effectively externalizing the stakes of her memory-work. The rules of this environment—horizon as seam, glass absorbing fortunes—are consistent enough to feel intentional without over-explained lore. The final image of the split horizon and reverent silence feels inseparable from this particular place.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glowing viaduct, phosphorescent temporal leakage, frozen raindrops, and the procedural stair-labyrinth are vivid, specific, and thematically consonant with fractured timelines. Setting details are filtered through her psychic state and recur at the end (frozen raindrops, trembling viaduct) to charge closure. However, the environment rarely constrains her options; it mirrors and amplifies internal stakes more than it forces tactical choices, which keeps this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    The drum maker’s cavern is vivid—resin, burnt sage, hanging drums—and its physical properties (acoustics, vibration, instruments overhead) materially shape tactics (palms on floor, drums resonating, needle placed in the drum at the end). Setting and tools become part of the emotional mechanism, not just backdrop. The environment’s sensory filter (vibration over sound) feels deeply tied to POV. This integration charges the final image of the needle resting “like a relic” in the largest drum.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    The courtyard at dusk, wisteria arbor, wind bell, and later the rusted rail yard create a vivid, atmospheric sense of place filtered through Elias’s observational priorities. Setting is not mere backdrop: the courtyard provides concealment for the cache and the message tube, while the rail yard as destination signals entry into a more dangerous, liminal space. Sensory and environmental details are selective and purposeful, reinforcing tone and theme rather than cataloguing. The environment shapes mood and resources more than it sharply constrains physical options, which keeps it just under the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    The greenhouse for extinct plants is vividly rendered through glass panes, skeletal vines, moss-stained tiles, and filtered sun, with strong olfactory atmosphere. Setting is not just backdrop; its function as a preservation space (“designed to preserve what the world erased”) thematically charges her revelation and the choice to step back into the city. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical options moment-to-moment, but it does shape the emotional frame and final image (cathedral of revelation → exit into dusk). Sensory detail is rich and POV-filtered, with smell and light given priority matching her profession.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    The terra-cotta grotto, canyon, twin moons, and smoldering village create a vivid, coherent environment filtered through the poet’s sensibility. The rope functions as a micro-setting object whose physicality (frays, burns, spiral on the floor) grounds the metaphysics and charges the final image of it becoming a literal bridge. The energy beings’ auroras and light pulses are economically but memorably used to alter perception and reveal the rope’s “record,” not just for spectacle. Setting consistently supports tone and theme without lapsing into a generic fantasy backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is strikingly original and specific—“sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks” with rusted hulls as “drunken sentinels” and ash-laden air creates a vivid, coherent environment. Crucially, the environment participates: glass panes hum, beams groan in recognition, shipwrecks echo the melody, and the rafters host the hiding child. The mendicant’s bowl and shipwrecks function as micro-settings/objects that charge the final image and shape how unbinding manifests. Density occasionally borders on baroque, but the world rules remain legible and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    The amber grotto is vivid and sensorially rich, with resin, warmth, scent, and pulsing walls that mirror internal changes. The environment isn’t just decorative: the grotto’s “breathing” and resonance with the petal help charge the transformation and the final image of her standing in amber glow. World rules around amber, static, and emotive craft feel internally consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition. It stops just short of constraining a concrete choice, which keeps it shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    The harbor world is vivid and particular—jobs like “foghorn tuner” and “ink mixer for harbor maps” do strong atmospheric work and locate the theme in concrete labor. The “breezy library under stars” and “harbor symphony” provide a lyrical frame that supports the gentle, contemplative tone. Setting is mostly textural rather than constraining, but it does charge the final image of laughter and mugs clinking on the docks. A slightly tighter link between physical environment and Elias’s tactical choices would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, original, and consistently filtered through Lira’s sensibility: marsh reeds, crystalline orchard, crater-rim, and weeping grove all feel specific and sensorial. The obsidian arbor as loom meaningfully charges the final image and functions as a micro-setting that structures choice and ritual. Environmental details occasionally verge on ornamental, but most of the lushness supports mood and theme rather than stalling momentum. The world’s rules remain implicit yet coherent, and the orchard/crater space clearly becomes the charged locus of community-building.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is striking and cohesive: rooftop resonance canals, spiral aqueduct, singing marble, and stored laughter build a fully realized acoustic city that feels specific to this story. Details are filtered through her observational, natural-history mindset, which keeps description purposeful rather than touristic. Environment does exert some pressure—the canals as resonance channels and the need to move across precarious, moss-slick infrastructure—but mostly as texture rather than hard constraint. The echo-womb chamber and the pendant/time mechanics charge the final image enough to push this near top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cavern orchard is vivid, sensorial, and integrated with the emotional arc (dripping stalactites as metronome, bioluminescent fruit dimming in Aris’s absence, tree etched with derivations). Environment constrains and enables key actions: the moon-angle projection, the orchard “holding its breath,” the final fruit functioning as a compass. Setting details evolve with the story’s turns, culminating in the orchard’s glow strengthening in response to her reoriented stance. The specificity feels inextricable rather than postcard-like.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    The library, crawl spaces, boiler room, and stained-glass windows are vividly realized and tightly integrated with action: she moves through ducts “like veins,” caches relics in specific niches, and observes from behind the biography stacks. The environment consistently shapes what is possible (she can only influence the world via objects placed in particular library sites), and the stained-glass/sapphire imagery meaningfully charges both the opening and the emotional climax. Detail is selective and filtered through her sensibility rather than touristic, with no white-room stretches.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mossy trellis, rain, and storm-season atmosphere are vivid and tightly integrated with the emotional arc: the environment feels like an active participant in the metamorphosis. Details like moss “swelled with absorbed sorrow” and the trellis cradling the new shoot charge both the crisis and final image. Weather physically affects her—kneeling in mud, soaked clothes—which grounds the lyricism. The only thing keeping this short of the highest band is that the setting pressures mood and embodiment more than concrete tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tidal island, storm weather, and post–water war seascape are vividly drawn and inseparable from the story’s logic. Environment constrains and enables choices: objects surface via tide and rain trails; the bluff, cairn, and well shape discovery; the tide line is where the exchange must occur. Recurring objects (brooch, then seaglass shard) are saturated with place and charge the final image. Detail is selective yet lush, with no white-room gaps or irrelevant worldbuilding.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    The musical crystal cave is vividly rendered and integral: acoustics, light refraction, and the singing stone environment all shape what can happen and how it feels. The cave’s music literally “sings her fate,” and the pearl’s glow and shadows are inseparable from this setting. Environmental details are selective and purposeful, never devolving into catalogue. The final image—“The cave sang on”—is charged by everything we’ve learned about this place.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    The harbor is vividly realized—“ivory harbor,” “bruised sky,” fog, gulls, and brine are all filtered through Elira’s vocation—and the customs house attic is textured with specific tools. Crucially, the harbor and sea aren’t just backdrop: they are her collaborator and antagonist, the space where absences occur and where the rite is staged. The herald’s valve as a recurring object charges both the work in the attic and the final public image in the square. The only thing holding this just shy of the very top is that the physical environment rarely constrains concrete choices; it mainly inflects mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: mist, stone, and starlight interlock with the vault’s function as liminal space, and subterranean corridors with impossible staircases and accusatory mirrors feel specific rather than generic dreamscape. Environmental features continually shape action (she literally follows fissure-arrows; gravity-defying stairs and mirror chambers are tests) rather than sitting as backdrop. The recurring physicality of cracks, vault, and obsidian door all charge the conceptual stakes around truth and readiness. This could push higher still if one environmental constraint visibly forced a tactical adjustment near the climax rather than simply being followed.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tower on the cliff, salt winds, and migrating whales create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s strongly filtered through Elira’s attention. Setting is not mere backdrop: the open height between sea and stars literalizes the “in between” space where she works, and the whales’ calls physically interact with the tile and her heartbeat. The environment charges the final image—the tower as a kind of resonant instrument—but it rarely constrains concrete options or tactics. A bit more physical dependence on the tower’s features in her process could have pushed this into the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific—“prismatic escondite,” “solar storm…whips of ionized regret,” and the final “vast, murmuring plain”—and these environments are not just wallpaper but functional: the storm’s magnetism enables the ritual, and the escondite’s collapse marks real cost. World rules around magnetism and spatial mutiny stay internally consistent at this length. The closing image of the ground pulsing with accumulated goodbyes is a charged environmental choice that reweights the entire piece. A slight tendency toward ornamental color in early lines is the only thing keeping this from the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    The funeral home prep room is vividly rendered—the stainless steel, refrigerating hum, formaldehyde—and the “deathly vitality” of the space harmonizes well with the story’s concern with transformed thinking. The setting justifies privacy and the stream of desperate visitors, and the mortician’s presence anchors the locale professionally. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics; almost everything that happens could occur in any quiet liminal room. The ink pot, rather than the broader room, does most of the work charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bonsai labyrinth and mountaintop are vividly and economically evoked, filtered through her professional and obsessive eye, and the fluorescent lamp functions as a key environmental tool whose hum literally channels the histories. The final image of the lamp flickering “approvingly” and the trees shielding the notepad is charged and reweights the setting as co-conspirator rather than backdrop. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices, it meaningfully shapes the story’s logic and closure image, which is enough at this length and mode for a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    The port and container labyrinth are intensely specific and integrated—salt, rust, cranes, tides, and alleys all shape what Elias can do and when (“high tide drowned the lower alleys, forcing him upward”). Environmental detail is filtered tightly through his obsession with residue and texture, avoiding tourist-list description. Recurring objects (containers, the stain, the child’s shoe, the label) charge the atmosphere and the final images. The only reason this doesn’t go higher is that setting constrains mood and ritual more than it forces distinct tactical choices beyond tide-driven movement.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned observatory on a cliff, with shattered glass and howling wind, is richly rendered and tonally aligned with grief and failed knowledge. The micro-setting of cello, shell, and compass works as environment-as-tool, especially in the closing image of her walking out at dawn with humming shell halves. The observatory doesn’t strongly constrain her tactical options, but it does deeply charge the mood and the “myth buster” identity (science vs. ghosts). Line-level specificity is high and consistently filtered through her sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    The raft-city carnival is vividly and economically rendered—salt-stained wood, rusted railings, neon, monsoon rain—and consistently filters through Lira’s carnival-tuned perception. Setting is not just backdrop: the floating architecture, Midway Promenade, and rides become canvases and vantage points that shape her tactics (e.g., the tilt-a-whirl tower mural visible from every pier). The foundation stone chip functions as a micro-setting object that subtly charges the final image when she pockets it, linking her body to the city’s “submerged roots.” It stops just short of the absolute top band because the environment rarely constrains her with concrete obstacles; it mostly offers opportunities.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lunar setting is richly and efficiently realized: regolith, Earth’s blue glow, Mare Imbrium’s rim, vacuum thresholds and thermal spikes all matter to how the hourglass works and why this vigil can only occur here. Environment shapes the premise (atomic sync vs celestial chronometry) and constrains action (no atmosphere, no wind, dawn as mechanical trigger). The hourglass as an object-setting hybrid strongly charges the final images—the summit, the empty glass, the taped label, the ascent thrusters painting amber against black. The setting’s physical and emotional atmospheres are inseparable from the story’s stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mist-coated rail depot, vibrating rails, harbor horn, and sagging canopy are richly realized and filtered through Elara’s sensory biases, including her bare feet and nonvisual perception. Setting elements meaningfully affect action: the prism from a lighthouse, the water basin, ambient light, and rail vibrations all participate in her method and in the temporal pressure of the ship’s departure. The environment also thematically underlines liminality—between departures and repairs, tides and tracks. A slight excess of atmospheric description in proportion to on-page struggle is the only check on an even higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and functionally integrated: the rusted outpost, the frozen lake, and especially the grimy window are not postcards but tools that constrain method (condensation divination) and tactics (he must leave the outpost and kneel on the ice). Weather and environment affect tone and choice throughout (“ice groaned like an old ship,” the biting calm, the frozen braided rivers below). The final image of drawing a spiral at the lake’s edge is charged by everything we’ve learned about the place. Only a slight sense of over-lush description in a few spots keeps this from the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting and atmosphere are superb: the archway, moss-slick cobblestones, eyeless windows, tongueless bell, and rain "from the air itself" create a vivid, coherent world. Details are always filtered through the tuner’s craft and the town’s liminal state, so they feel purposeful rather than decorative. The tuning fork, cobblestones, archway, fountain, and bell recur and converge in the final images, charging the closure. The only reason this doesn’t go higher is that the environment guides mood and theme more than it constrains concrete choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    The underwater temple and surrounding seascape are vividly and specifically realized—kelp “whispered like mourners,” statues “frozen mid-flow,” silt, sea anemones, and basalt pillars all feel tactile and lived-in. Setting meaningfully constrains choice: depth, pressure, limited oxygen, and the acoustically charged atrium dictate that stillness is both dangerous and necessary. The environment charges the final image (body cradled by kelp, shards on the dais, temple stirring with resonance). At times the density of description edges toward lush excess, but clarity and atmospheric control remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse prison and jagged reef are vividly rendered and integral: the height, lens, rusted door, and sea below all constrain action and make his tactic (encoding truth into the beam) feel inevitable rather than arbitrary. Environmental details (brine, candle wax, the ’37 storm, copper dusk) are filtered through his purpose and mood, avoiding tourist-catalog description. The setting directly shapes the final image: a beam sweeping the sea, carrying whispers, in a repurposed carceral structure. This would be almost textbook 9+ setting work, but under the global cap it sits just below that band.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night” is intensely textured, with frost, glass, iron ribs, and perpetual bud-state all contributing to tone and world logic. Setting is not mere backdrop: the endless night, the unfruiting trees, and the glass cathedral constraints directly charge the final image of twilight-colored fruit etched with runes. Environmental details evolve with events—the greenhouse literally “exhales” and then trembles awake—so the place participates in the story’s arc. A small trim of descriptive density in early lines could heighten impact, but at elite level this is already quite strong.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    The canyon labyrinth, tide pools, heart-chamber, and star-loom sky are vividly realized and tightly integrated with action (sleepwalking paths, stone that “remembers,” walls that hum in response to sewing). Setting is always filtered through her vocation and ritual, avoiding generic landscape description and instead making environment a participant in the magic. The final images—labyrinth walls shimmering with memory, stars rearranged into the grandmother’s loom—directly charge the ending and could not be swapped out without gutting the story’s effect.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “catacomb orchard” is vivid, original, and omnipresent: roots threading bones, petals falling upward, and the final image of her cradled in roots fuse setting with theme. Environment actively shapes meaning and action—roots steady her wrists, the sundial is literally misaligned in the soil, and the orchard’s physical response (petals, chime) signals restored order. Details are consistently filtered through her tactile, reverent attention. It’s lush but purposeful, with the space functioning as a living character rather than a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)
    The golden arcade is richly evoked as a “temple of bygone surface mail,” with tactile details (pneumatic tubes, brass chutes, bakery carts, pigeons) that strongly color mood and theme. The setting choice articulates her values—she works where “paper still mattered”—and the final return to the arcade as a “cathedral of lost connections and slow deliveries” charges the closing image. The ebony clipboard and chalked plazas function as micro-settings that embody analog slowness and ephemerality. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactical options, it deeply inflects tone and the conceptual stakes at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt observatory, autumn light, aurora tapestries, and eternal candle are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through her cosmological craft. The observatory and candle aren’t mere backdrop: the flame’s behavior constrains choices and charges the final image, and the observatory’s seclusion plus seizure matter to the plot. Sensory detail is rich but purposeful, rarely slipping into tourist catalog; atmosphere and world rules feel internally consistent. The environment could exert a bit more physical constraint, but as a micro-setting centered on the candle and loom it’s highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mangrove labyrinth and its spirits are richly realized and functionally integrated: roots grab and slow her, branches and leaves become literal “windows,” water receives the shard, and the trees ultimately part to reveal a path. Sensory detail is specific and purposeful (salt-thick air, moss-slick roots, silver moonlight knitting wounds), and world rules—spirits singing, condensation messages, moon-healing with memory cost—are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition. Environment actively guides and constrains choices rather than serving as backdrop, and recurring objects (leaves, water, shard) charge the final image. The only thing keeping this just under the 9-band is that the physical geometry of the labyrinth, while evocative, never quite presses her into a dilemma beyond atmosphere and pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mist-clad atrium, glass ceiling, and salt-thick air are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Mira’s ocean- and war-haunted perceptions. The brain coral functions as a charged recurring object that culminates in the final image of her pocketing it as a talisman, satisfying the object-as-setting criterion. Environment largely mirrors and amplifies interior states rather than constraining concrete choices, but this is acceptable in a lyric mode. The atmospheric specificity is high enough that the world feels lived-in rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ruined orchard and centuries-thick fog are vividly specific and consistently threaded through action, not just description; fog as emulsion and light as developer is an excellent functionalization of atmosphere. The environment meaningfully shapes tactics (waiting for noon, using arches, fog, and ruins as projection surface) and charges the final images of “a place no longer ruined, but reverent.” Spatial and sensory anchors (skeletal trees, moss-caked walls, fractured dome) never drift. This is publishable-level scene-setting, held just below a 9 because the physical constraints, while present, are not pushed into real tactical difficulty.

    The sound wave garden is exceptionally specific and integrated: brass petals, echo-bending arches, and sonic frescoes are not mere backdrop but the mechanism for the reflected-sound method and the Nested Awakenings. Environmental details are filtered through Elira’s professional sensibility and used actively (ricochet, amplification, sympathetic resonance). The setting also charges the ending as the garden rearranges itself into a waiting poise for the next seeker. It’s difficult to imagine this story transplanted from this environment without losing its core logic.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.5)
    The entomologist’s greenhouse is vividly rendered and deeply functional: insects, surveillance moths, humid air, and trellises all shape how rebellion must be camouflaged as horticulture. The Bureau’s drones, moss tiles, and “cathedral of chitinous observation” integrate worldbuilding with mood rather than feeling like a tour. Setting constraints directly affect choices (coded seed packets, irrigation adjustments, vine patterns legible only at dawn). The final image of a world “cracked open” via a garden makes the environment itself part of the charged closure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    The gargantuan shell, reef, and bioluminescent canopy are not backdrop; they condition solitude, acoustics, and her ritual of climbing to the “shell’s ribbed throat” to broadcast. World rules (voice carried by off-key wind through barnacles and kelp) are coherent and integrated with action. The recurring shell/postcard/body triangle culminates in the postcard “nestled deeper into her ribs” inside the shell, charging the final image. The only small limiter is that the setting rarely constrains a discrete tactical choice; it shapes the life rather than a specific decision.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is vivid, original, and tightly filtered through the caretaker’s practice: opal library, museum of extinct feelings, mist stairs, and skylight of spider-silk and starlight all feel integral rather than touristic. Environmental rules (wind through porous architecture, dimming wings where cracks are sealed) meaningfully shape what she can do and how memory behaves. The space of the library and its architecture of emptiness directly charge the final image of the nook that “remembered itself.” The only thing holding this just shy of the very top is that a few details lean ornamental rather than constraining concrete choice.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    The extinct language archive is textured and integral—dust, chandelier, rotunda acoustics, and the drowned monastery bells all matter to how the ritual works. The ink well and chandelier both respond physically to the song, and the final image of the empty ink well casting “scattered promises kept” charges the thematic closure. Environmental detail is always filtered through her professional perception, which keeps it purposeful. There’s little sense of external geography or broader world, but at this length the micro-setting focus feels exactly right.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dormant-volcano amphitheater is exquisitely rendered and never ornamental: ash in the glue leads her here; acoustics and “the building’s breath” enable the harmonic epiphany; warmth and dust physically mediate her experience. The surveyor’s chain and fissure-as-weeping-eye further anchor space and emotion, and the volcano’s breath directly informs her plan for the floodgates. This is rich, purposeful setting that shapes tactics and charges images, with only occasional flirtation with over-density holding it below the very top of the band.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.2)
    The vintage bookshop attic is extraordinarily vivid and specific—foxed paper, cedar, leaning shelves, single cracked skylight—and every major beat is anchored to that micro-environment. The skylight and dust motes are not mere decoration; they become the literal and conceptual apparatus for mapping memory and charging the final image (letter pinned by the skylight, dust like applause, meteorite glowing). The pigeons’ perches, ledgers under the floorboards, and the collapsed shelf that reveals the meteorite all show the setting actively shaping events. This is exemplary integration of atmosphere, object, and thematic function.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    The drifting prism terrace, rainbow mist, corn maze below, and the glassine floor are vivid and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Setting is not decorative: the terrace’s rim and mist create the literal final threshold, and the bench functions as a micro-setting object charged with memory and choice. World rules (fractured causality, butterfly effect) are sketched economically but coherently. Environmental tone (“fractured hush,” compressed sound) meaningfully shapes the story’s pressure and the valence of her last act.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    The underwater research facility is vividly and specifically realized—the kelp-and-coral lattice, trembling pressure gauges, jellyfish glyphs, and anglerfish “living lanterns” all feel integrated rather than touristic. Setting is filtered through her professional and emotional lens (rusted corridors as “braille maps of drowned constellations”), which deepens both world and character. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical options, but it absolutely charges the final images and the notion of thresholds reclaimed by nature. The recurring objects (burnt feather, viewport, fireflies) function as micro-setting elements that meaningfully frame the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    The iridescent cave and giant geode are vividly realized and tightly integrated—crystal walls provide light, quartz holds seeds, amethyst cradles the crater glass. Environmental details mirror and amplify the emotional palette (“auroras,” “phosphorescent moss,” echoes like giggling), not just decorate it. The crater glass as embedded object-as-setting constrains the key choice and charges the final image as a pendant. A touch more sense of physical risk or constraint from the environment itself would be needed for a 9-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tidal arcade under stars is richly drawn and strongly filtered through the premise of liminality (“between acts,” “constellations like faulty marquee lights”). Setting details—the velvet rug, buckets, coins, tide, bishop—are not postcard décor; they’re actively used in his methods and recur in the final image. The bishop in particular functions as a micro-setting object that orients the whole stage and charges the closing tableau. Environmental pressure is more atmospheric than constraining, but the atmosphere is integrated and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    The twilight garden under stars is sensuously rendered and integrated—dew-laced moss, folding petals, constellations humming—firmly anchoring mood and action. The setting functions as more than backdrop: its lack of “walls, no clocks” literalizes a space where banned memory can breathe and where time is malleable. Micro-setting details (moss taking blood, petals “taking dictation,” the garden’s edge where villagers gather) subtly shape choices and charge the final image. World rules around the nostalgia ban and lunar tides remain consistent and legible through environmental cues rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pearl Bay at dawn, the damp pier, fog, ropes, dinghies, and birds are all concretely rendered and tightly filtered through his craft and attentiveness to light. The prism, tide pool, and refracted rings integrate setting with action and theme rather than feeling like postcard description. Weather and light conditions matter to his ritual and to the planned repair for Widow Hargrove’s noon light. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain choice, but it does charge the imagery and tone at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    The moonlit ridge, frost-dusted needles, moss boulder, and celestial bodies are vivid, selective, and tightly integrated with his mental state; the ridge becoming an “altar” is a strong evolution of setting. The cracked porcelain box functions as a micro-setting object, charging the final image and constraining his ritual choices. Environment plausibly explains the quiet, contemplative mode and the sense of seclusion needed for this act. It does not strongly constrain tactics in a practical sense, which is the only thing holding it below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tide-polished grotto is vivid, specific, and central: tides deliver artifacts, polish the stones, and act as a temporal metronome while the cave functions as a convergence node. Details like salt hexagons, bioluminescent anemones, and silk-brushing timelines are not decorative; they encode how her work interfaces with the environment. The gauge and grotto together constrain her methods and charge the final image of the multiverse exhaling. This is rich, integrated setting craft at a near-publishable level.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is richly particular: ivy-veiled passage, breathing buildings, collapsed antechamber, moss, shattered brick, bruised twilight sky all create a strong atmospheric frame. Details are filtered through her sensibility as a listener to walls, so environment and interior state mirror each other without feeling like blunt symbolism. The ivy and walls meaningfully charge the final image (the passage exhaling; walls dreaming) even if they don’t tactically constrain choices. World rules (post–climate shift, Great Retreat) are sketched lightly but consistently and never break credibility for this lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vividly particular—the wet marble, prism parapet, tarnished mirrors, valley bells—and all are woven into action rather than serving as backdrop. The parapet as canvas and light-bender is functionally crucial, and the terrace’s echoing stillness and impending bells frame the ritual as a temporally bounded act. Environmental details mirror the thematic aim (fractured light as possibility) without blunt symbolism. The final image of her dissolving into “spring’s last sigh” is strongly charged by the previously established terrace atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    The volcanic terrace, triple moons, and battlefield below are vivid and specific, with sensory details (burnt sage, distant rain) that feel purpose-driven rather than touristic. Setting is not mere backdrop: the terrace’s history of binding oaths and the moons as “cosmic witness” are directly tied to Elira’s tactic of resurrecting ritual as enforcement mechanism. The ebony clipboard and altar act as micro-setting tools that constrain how peace can be attempted. The final image of the clipboard lifted into triple moonlight effectively charges the environment into a thematic agent.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    The salt flat is vividly rendered and thematically loaded: once-sea turned engineered desert, now altar, with the cracks functioning as both map and memory. Environmental details (“bruised purple” sky, “salt crunching like shattered glass”) are selective and filtered through Elias’s guilt and purpose. The setting directly charges the final image—“The egg stayed. / The cracks remembered.”—so the land itself holds the story’s last note. The only reason not to go higher is that the environment constrains meaning more than it constrains tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    The silver courtyard, snow, and prism sanctuary are sensuously rendered, and details like snow melting from “the heat of her intent” and bare feet leaving no prints charge the atmosphere and final image. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain her options beyond mood and texture; it’s more altar than obstacle. However, it does meaningfully frame the act of unlocking and the echo-harvest, so the setting and objects feel integral rather than postcard-like. This is near top-tier atmospheric work, just shy of using setting as active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    The radar dome and its Cold War machinery, the rain “like Morse code from ghosts,” and the candlelit interior give a vivid, textural sense of place that clearly mirrors his ethical hauntings. The campfire stick functions as a recurring object-as-setting, guiding choices and literally warming his palm at the end, charging the final image. Environmental details are selective and filtered through his sensibility as a careful, aesthetic observer. While the dome doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, it deeply supports tone and thematic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    The grotto, mist, moss, and “above the clouds” vantage are vividly rendered with a strong sensory palette, and they’re consistently filtered through her devotional gaze. Setting and recurring objects (grotto, stump hollow, spiral, wing, monarchs) charge the final image—the grotto “blushed deeper” and the last monarch’s lift carry thematic weight. While the environment doesn’t much constrain physical options, it fundamentally defines the story’s atmosphere and sacred stakes. The specificity and integration are high enough to feel distinctive and necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    The icebound sanctum, aurora, permafrost rope, and eventual thaw are richly specific and tightly interwoven with theme and action, not postcard scenery. Environmental constraints (cold, glacial time, preservation by ice) are built into both process and payoff, especially the future meadow/oak roots image that recharges everything. Tools and materials—lost wax, bell metal, lapis from frescoes—are tactile, believable, and filtered through the caster’s sensibility. A hairline reason this doesn’t crest higher is that the environment never actively complicates or endangers the work; it frames and enriches rather than constraining tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is richly particular—the vine-draped bunker, rewilded forest, and storm are sensorially dense and closely filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Environmental details echo theme (reclamation vs surrender) and recur meaningfully at the end when the forest “recognizes” her and the bunker collapses. The space constrains some action (avoiding alarms, accessing the core) but mostly serves as charged atmosphere rather than as a hard tactical limit. A slight trim of ornamental description could increase functional sharpness without losing mood.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ancient Babylonian palace reimagined as an observatory is vividly and consistently evoked, with selective, purposeful details (cracked ziggurat terrace, ivy over forgotten gods, indigo sky). Setting is filtered through the astronomer’s priorities—stairs as cost, Sky Chamber as instrument—and the palace’s neglect enables his solitary access between regimes. The environment charges the final image: future rulers unknowingly sitting above a humming covenant embeds the setting into the story’s conceptual closure. It falls just short of 9-band only because the physical environment doesn’t strongly constrain a concrete choice in the climax; its role is more thematic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “soundless sanctuary” with flickering walls and dissolving stone/glass/mist is vivid and tightly bound to theme and constraint (no spoken words, unstable reality). The sanctuary’s transformation—floor to moss, ceiling to sky—tracks her inner release and charges the final image of her walking into the mist. The music box and her body also function as micro-settings that shape action and closure. A slightly stronger sense of physical vulnerability in the shifting space could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the ruined orchard, persistent fog, twilight frost, and workshop scents all shape mood and magic rather than feeling decorative. Environmental details actively participate—the fog harbors the dream, responds to the ritual, briefly reveals sky, and then thickens again; blossoms erupt where light touches. Tools-as-setting (sextant shards, obsidian disc) are well integrated into both world logic and climax. The atmosphere is cohesive and charged, though nearly too lush in places.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vividly original and fully integrated: the orchard-cathedral, vow-leaves, ivy-and-hymnal ladder, and wild rose at the doorway all feed both atmosphere and action. Environmental rules (vows resisting retrieval, magic turning leaves) stay consistent and directly shape tactics like using honey on the spoon. The final image of the green fabric on the rose thorn is charged by its placement in this space, making the environment crucial to closure. Sensory detail is lush without becoming disorienting, and it’s consistently filtered through the mender’s craft-minded lens.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    The astral orchard and the shabby bathroom are vividly and economically rendered, with strong sensory contrast that supports mood and idea. Setting elements actively participate in meaning: blossoms tremble “as if remembering,” petals carry alternative selves, the cameo’s light and temperature shifts are consequential. The environment clearly charges the final image of her walking through a newly reconfigured orchard. A touch more indication that the asteroid’s isolation materially limits or endangers her could push this into the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mountain-bookstore is vivid and particular—spiraling stone shelves, gravity stuttering, books like vines, footnotes as fruit—and consistently filtered through Elira’s linguistic sensibility. The environment is not mere backdrop: it literally rearranges in response to the negotiation, and the “gaps” in shelves are treated as doors and ultimately the lexicon’s resting place, charging the final image. World rules (time bleed, sentient lexicon teaching the mountain) are strange but internally coherent and learned through action rather than exposition dumps. A slight reason this doesn’t reach the highest band is that the physical constraints of the space never significantly restrict tactics beyond mood and symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    The abandoned carnival ship and the subterranean garden are richly, specifically realized; details like “carousel horses frozen mid-gallop under tarps slick with mildew” and oil puddles reflecting non-existent constellations create a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting evolves with the plot, from rot and confinement to the lush, impossible garden, mirroring her descent into memory. The environment meaningfully constrains and enables action (ship as portal, engine room as threshold, garden as the choice arena), and the emerald card’s dulling at the prow charges the final image. A hair more tactile interaction with the physical risks of the ship would push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mechanism room, rope, pendulum, and anomalous door are vividly rendered and deeply integrated into both action and meaning. The clock tower environment genuinely constrains what she can do and charges the final image of a “recalibrated” university below. Small, specific touches (brass oil smell, worn stairs, rope on bronze stand) feel purposeful rather than touristic. Setting could go even higher if environmental constraints forced tougher tactical trade-offs, but it’s already a notable strength.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    The harmonic caves, glacial walls, and energy beings are vividly rendered and deeply integrated into action: the architecture of resonance dictates both the problem and her solution. Environmental specifics (limestone “throats,” crack patterns in ancient ice, thermal vents and seepage) are filtered through her sensibility as Mapkeeper. The echo chamber stone and the caves’ acoustics constrain tactics and charge the final image (melting ice, caves breathing again). A slightly narrower but sharper focus on one or two key sensory threads at peak moments could push this to elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glass humming pavilion, wind, thistles, salt, and fused glass tripod create a vivid, coherent environment whose physical qualities (fragility, resonance) directly shape the ritual and its risks. The setting evolves with events—the shiver, hum deepening into a chorus, the final sigh—and the prism plus beacon-tower function as charged objects that frame the ending image. Details are purposeful and POV-filtered rather than touristic cataloguing. It very nearly hits exemplary level, but environment constrains mood and ritual more than it forces hard tactical trade-offs, keeping it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the standout: “stormlit observatory above clouds,” “crystal whispering forecourt,” and “solid fog” are vividly, specifically rendered and tightly filtered through her archival sensibility. Environmental elements aren’t just pretty; they actively charge choices and images—memory refracting in raindrops, shadows as grief clocks, fog cracking like bells on her descent. The observatory’s telescopes “aimed not at stars, but at the echoes between them” and the hush moving from world → tower → body give the environment direct thematic weight in the final image. The world’s rules (storms as archivists of memory) feel consistent and intriguingly implied, not exposited.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    The fortress is exquisitely rendered—veins of glowing moss, petal-laden battlements, bioluminescent stamen-lanterns—and these aren’t static postcards but active participants (petals releasing dust, tiles singing underfoot, the structure “speaking” through temperature and tremors). The mosaic floor and the kerosene rag function as micro-settings that constrain what Lira can do and charge the final image of sacrifice and absorption. World rules are consistent in their dream-logic and are learned through her movement and sensory filtering. This category is only just shy of 9-band because the environment, while strongly charging the closure, could exert more overt tactical constraint in her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    The grotto and tidal pools are vividly rendered across senses (light fracture, barnacles, wind in her molars) and feel fully inhabitable rather than postcard-like. Setting functions thematically as a liminal, tidal threshold that mirrors and charges the concept of transition, and the recurring cicada object is tied to that space. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, it absolutely frames and deepens the central contemplative action and final image (“The tide turned”). This earns a high score, just shy of 9 because setting is more atmospheric than tactically constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    The settings—the iron-smelling bunker, blinding sky, and xenial trellis—are vividly particular and strongly filtered through the child’s perception of silence and constriction. Environmental elements actively shape action: ventilation shafts and hatches enable escape; the trellis literally supports climbing and receives the doll’s threads, charging the final image. Sensory detail across smell, touch, and taste (of different silences) deepens atmosphere rather than feeling like a tour. The fantastical rules (gravity inversion, starlight trellis) remain tonally coherent and consistent once introduced.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, original, and integral: prism tiles, chime-trees, and the upward waterfall all participate in the emotional work rather than acting as backdrop. Environmental details are filtered through the operator’s priorities—geometry as propulsion, harmonics as tools—and evolve with the scene (e.g., tilting toward the grove to alter her state). The recurring storm glass and responsive terrace tiles help charge the final image and underline the world’s rules. It stops short of 9+ because the environment, while strongly present, doesn’t significantly constrain difficult choices so much as gently facilitate them.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and continuously functional: the murals are literal maps, the willow conceals the hatch, and the orchard’s temporal veil and collapse directly affect stakes and pacing. Sensory detail (mist, bioluminescent fruit, nano-filament ivy, liquid starlight) is rich yet usually tied to action. The ruby flake and orchard both act as environment-like constraints/tools that shape choices and the final image. At times the density of imagery edges toward decorative, but spatial and rule coherence are consistently maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sanctuary, ash, threshold, and later lantern-field are vivid, sensorially specific, and tightly integrated with mood and action (“bare feet whispering over charcoal dust,” “starlight pooled thickest”). The environment constrains choices (she must face the door/threshold, negotiate the veil) and charges the final image as the sanctuary folds into the sky. Details are consistently filtered through her sensibility; nothing feels like neutral postcard description. This is near top-tier setting/atmosphere work, held back only slightly by a uniform register of somber grandeur that risks sameness.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vivid, tactile, and tonally precise, with details like “cerulean and violet halos” and crystal-veined caps doing double duty as atmosphere and plot infrastructure. The environment responds to and amplifies the action: mushrooms flare during the ritual, “shadowseam wonder” becomes an operative phenomenon, and the altered grove (singing mushrooms) is central to the final image. Setting is consistently filtered through Elara’s perspective (a sanctuary after exploitative capitalism) and charges the thematic contrast between extraction and cultivation. The only thing keeping this just shy of the very top band is that physical constraints from the environment don’t significantly limit her options—they enrich rather than pressure her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.1)
    The sepia reading room and its objects (mahogany table, law tomes, windows, gramophone) are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through her sensibility. Setting is not decorative: this exact room holds familial crimes and lost intimacy, making it a moral and emotional crucible for the revelation. The gramophone and cylinder function as tools that literally and figuratively unlock trapped histories, and the “golden shadows” recur to charge the final image. Environmental detail stays coherent and purposeful, building atmosphere without losing spatial clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly specific (mercury roots, phosphor-bark, nectar reversing flow) and constantly interacts with the knight’s actions, culminating in the orchard’s “bow” and dawn’s reconfigured “grammar.” Environment is not backdrop; it responds to and amplifies the ritual, charging the final image of soil that sings and a reshaping horizon. World rules feel internally consistent in their surrealism, taught through action rather than exposition. The only small check is that, while the setting frames his choice, it rarely constrains concrete tactics beyond being the ritual site.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    The foster care file room, with its dust, shelves, fluorescent light, and manila folders, is viscerally present and always filtered through her archival gaze. The environment does real work: dust gradients and handprints literally shape her method and reading of human traces, and the room becomes a “sanctuary of examined unknowns” by the end. The infantryman’s button on her desk functions as micro-setting and charges the final image as a compass-object. A slight tendency toward abstracted phrases (“paper and shadow”) keeps this just shy of fully exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    The auric lagoon, underwater hatch, and analog relay station are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action, not mere backdrop. The environment constrains and enables choice: only someone who can read reflections in water and brave the lagoon can find the hatch. The setting recurs meaningfully in the charged final image—her disappearance “into the lagoon’s glow” reframes the opening atmosphere. World rules (artificial glow, censored stars, analog archive) remain consistent and serve both plot and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is vividly realized and tightly integrated with action: the grotto, prism, fog, luminescent moss, and dewdrops all respond to and mirror the musical struggle. Environmental details actively shape the logic of the scene—the grotto as a “cathedral of forgotten auguries” and the prism as a caging device for prophecy, then as the visible sign of its unmaking. The final dewdrop and the fading hues reweight earlier images and make the cost of the hush palpable. Density of description borders on lush, but it remains legible, purposeful, and character-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ashen skyborne arbor is richly and consistently rendered, with details like “petrified roots…suspended between earth and ether” and dew-cradled bark crevices doing real worldbuilding work. Setting is not just backdrop: it’s the mechanism by which memory is stored and accessed (leaves, dust-specks, root hollows), and it charges the final image of the sanctuary of echoes. Sensory specificity is high and POV-filtered—Elira touches, sorts, hums, and builds within this space in ways that feel lived-in rather than touristic. The only ceiling is that the environment doesn’t strongly constrain a concrete choice under pressure so much as steadily enable wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid, tactile, and filtered through Elias’s mechanical sensibility: the rust-and-rain workshop, iron bridge, neglected greenhouse, and phosphorescent cavern all feel lived-in. The environment meaningfully shapes action—the greenhouse as threshold, the cavern and waterfall as the crucible where he discards the watch. Recurring objects (compass, clocks, kettle) are integrated into place, not just props. A slight excess of lush description in the cavern could be pruned without losing atmospheric power.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rain-washed foundry is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elara’s purpose: “cathedral of rust,” “altar for her penance,” roof-drumming like “a thousand tapping fingers.” The anvil, brazier, and weather become functional, not just decorative, and the final golden seam on the anvil meaningfully charges the last image. Environment mirrors and frames the ritual without sliding into clumsy symbolism. The only limit is that the setting guides mood more than it constrains concrete options.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Echo Gorge, the warped harp of rock, and the hidden-sunrise light are vivid and thematically integrated; the environment is not backdrop but the instrument she must work with. The geology-as-harp directly shapes her method and the stakes (broken resonance vs. tentative alignment), and the closing image of laughter in the wind roots the resolution in place. World rules (centuries of weeping change the resonance; Styx’s cousin) are consistent and economical. The only reason this doesn’t climb higher is that the environment constrains mood and method more than it presents hard logistical obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.1)
    The ultraviolet forest is richly specific and fully integrated: it responds to pain, radiates in “wavelengths only the wounded could see,” and physically opens a new path when the narrator articulates grace. Environmental rules stay consistent and directly shape options and meaning. The final image of the strap dissolving into the glowing soil and the forest’s light softening charges the setting as an active participant in the transformation, not a backdrop. This environment cannot be swapped out without breaking the story’s logic and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alchemist’s market, rope bridges, attic chamber, and breathing triptych are rendered with high sensory and conceptual specificity, all filtered through the translator’s distinctive perception. Setting is not just pretty backdrop: being high above the city and the existence of markets that trade in relics and memories directly enable the plot (access to Mara, the lens, the return at twilight) and charge the final image of “translators walking its bridges.” World rules feel internally coherent and are learned through action (memory-as-currency, relics that “remember”). The density of description is high but purposeful, maintaining atmosphere without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    The circus ticket office is vividly, economically rendered—popcorn smell, rusted call button, broken marquee—and every detail is filtered through his technician/observer gaze. Tools and environment (ceiling tile, rafter, marquee, water drop into metal bucket) shape his tactics and charge the final image, so the setting is not mere backdrop. The micro-setting of the ceiling space and the reflective barrel is especially strong, grounding the ghostly activity in tactile specifics. A slight overabundance of atmospheric detail in places brushes against lushness but does not stall clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glass orchard library and its cloud-sea setting are vividly original and integrated into nearly every beat: frost on glass floors, living books, crystal branches, and floating architecture all respond to the rupture. Environmental changes (tilting shelves, bleeding ink, churning clouds) are how we register the story’s central event. The final image of the “beautifully broken” floating library charges the thematic revaluation of chaos and order. The setting doesn’t quite constrain concrete tactical choices, but it is inseparable from the story’s logic and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    The baroque asteroid, visible time-streams, and chrono-winds are vividly rendered and consistently rule-bound, with the environment directly constraining tactics (storms necessitate mirror-covering; low gravity and ruined splendor shape mood and action). The crystal shard’s interaction with ambient time is a strong micro-setting device that literally writes the text they decode. Weather and architecture both feed tone (“gilded ruin,” “fossilized starlight”) and the final dawn on gilt balconies recharges earlier details. The world feels specific and lived-in without sliding into static exhibition.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    The resonance chamber—copper pipes, glass bells, midnight shadows—functions as more than backdrop; it literally sings back to him, amplifies his choice, and becomes the vessel for reclaimed light. Environmental specificity is high and consistently filtered through his craft-minded perception. The final image of song seeping into walls and bones, with light flooding the chamber and repelling shadows, is charged directly by the setting. A touch more tactile interaction with the space under duress (e.g., how he moves through it as shadows lunge) could tighten its role as constraint rather than almost entirely as amplifier.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is vivid and specific: the cooling factory, limestone cliffs, fissure, and subterranean lagoon all feel sensorially rich, with an especially strong olfactory palette tied to petrichor. The world’s rules (memory as scent, ink legible only when wet, stone that “breathes”) are consistent and integrated into action rather than dumped. The environment thematically pressures the choice—its hushed, breathing quality seduces Elira into staying—but it doesn’t strongly constrain her options in a practical sense. Still, the cave/lagoon complex and its tools (compass, journal, water) clearly charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    The storm-tossed archway, cliff, and village ecology are vivid and specific, with weather, surf, and stone materially shaping what is possible (shelter, projection surface, communal gathering point). Sensory detail is rich but goal-linked—storm noise becomes “turbine-hum,” sand and wet wood inform her carving process. The final image of lantern-light, projected shadows, and offerings left at the arch charges the setting as a functional shrine, not just a backdrop. World rules around the magic slide and projector remain intuitively consistent within this slightly enchanted realism.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is a major strength: the amber pavilion, the solstice garden, the thawing countryside, and Saint Elise’s Cathedral are rendered with vivid, selective sensory detail that’s clearly filtered through an artist’s eye. Environment meaningfully shapes action—the need for dusk light, the etched glass’s physical layers, the seasons’ shifts—all of which constrain when and how she can discover the encoded flowers. The recurring spaces (pavilion ↔ cathedral) charge the final mural image and the act of leaving the postcard on the altar. The only check on a higher score is that in a few spots the lush description flirts with decorative excess rather than additional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting work is exceptional: the floating library, salt-scarred dunes, obsidian lagoon, and debris-strewn shore are vivid, sensorial, and thematically integrated. Environment and objects constrain options—the lagoon only responds at certain hours and anniversaries; the zeppelin’s altitude, ladders, and portholes shape how others can witness but not fully join her. The recurring lagoon imagery directly charges the final image (glow, hands, shells, etched names) and makes the cost of remembering unavoidable. A minor trim of descriptive density in a few lines could heighten impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: “Paper-Lantern Cove” moves from extinguished, creaking globes to organically grown lanterns powered by memory, directly charging the final image. Details like tattered silk, sagging awning with cranes, rice-paper blueprints, and cobblestone-grown lanterns feel filtered through the alchemist’s sensibility and occupation. The town’s architecture of emptiness (dust on thresholds, shuttered windows) materially shapes behavior and tone, and the lanterns function as environment-changing tools. The only thing keeping this shy of 9+ is that physical constraints of place don’t significantly narrow options; they mostly enrich mood and symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, strange, and purposeful: the orchard atop the Veridian Spire functions as both physical space and emotional repository, and its rules (roots in steel, petals as carriers) are consistently developed. Environmental details like cracked marble, rain-catchers shaped like forgotten gods, and the smog-clearing sky are filtered through Elira’s sensibility. Crucially, the orchard constrains tactic and closure—the only way to reintroduce emotion is through its blossoms. The final image of roots threading steel and a humming garden charges the thematic stakes through setting.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    The icebound atrium, glass ceiling with alien constellations, and frozen vines are rendered with high specificity and integrated into action (walking barefoot on ice, ice weeping upward, vines uncurling). Environment and recurring objects (egg, acorn cap, dais) charge the final image of the sapling and warm air. The setting is not a postcard; it evolves in direct response to her choices and the entropy reversal. This world feels particular and internally consistent, even if some cosmological details remain suggestively opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mountain sanctuary, spiral stair, belfry, and weather systems are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through her professional attention to air, stone, and sky. Setting and objects (rope, bell, stained glass, clouds) are not postcard décor; they actively participate in the logic of the warning system and in the final image of raindrops and solstice hush. The environment shapes tone and plausibility of her craft more than it constrains tactical options, which keeps it just beneath 9+. Still, it feels fully inhabited and thematically charged.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly specific and filtered through his attention: crystalline deck, analog dials, wind-chime sensors, the Andromeda Drift rim, the gravitational sigh between dying pulsars. The yellow lantern glass functions as a micro-setting object that shapes how he perceives and engages with events, especially in the final image. World rules (forgotten station, unlogged phenomena) are consistent and support the story’s premise of unrecorded sacredness. Environment doesn’t tightly constrain physical choices, but it decisively charges tone and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned beekeeping oasis, scorched wasteland, and specific tools (collapsed hives, rusted smokers, honey press) are vivid and thematically fused to the piece. Setting is not mere backdrop: storms force her to protect the box, and the fractured roof and stained glass co-create the charged final image. The environment and object-as-setting both constrain her behavior and shape how the covenant is enacted. This is near exemplary, but a touch of over-description in places just keeps it shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.8)
    The emerald silo, salt flats, and Hollow Net are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through the time-bent premise. The silo is not just backdrop: its hum, core, and rippling panels respond to the urn’s chime and charge the final image. Objects-as-setting (capsule, urn fragments, mother-of-pearl flecks) are sensorial and thematically aligned with accumulation and refracted memory. World rules (numbers as textures, time as breathing) are introduced through setting details rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cobalt lagoon, bruised sky, dunes, and wet sand are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elira’s sensibility. The recurring feather and the lagoon’s reflective surface both charge the final images (“lagoon breathing beside her, the sky forgiving its own fractures”). Setting mostly shapes tone and theme rather than constraining physical options, but it does so with precision and economy. A slight increase in how the environment concretely affects tactics would push this into the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    The temple orchard and living stone pillars are vivid, tactile, and conceptually integral—architecture “coaxed” rather than built shapes every choice Arlen makes. Copper-wrapped branches, root-stone symbiosis, and animal use of the space (bats, foxes, doe, sparrows) all actively charge the stakes and the final images. The environment isn’t backdrop; it’s the cathedral, constraint, and legacy for Arlen’s project. The last paragraphs, with his burial under the Whisper Arch and sparrows nesting in copper arms, demonstrate the setting’s direct role in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vivid, specific, and tightly tied to mood: “rainwashed tower,” moss, petrichor, lichen-inscribed walls, dusty footprints, and the open circular summit all serve the story’s contemplative pressure. The environment doesn’t just decorate; the footprints, stairs, and polished stone embody accumulated prior seekers and charge her actions. Weather and architecture meaningfully interact with theme, culminating in the “bronze quiet benediction” of rain at the end. The tower, path, and season are so integral that changing them would dilute both tone and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is exquisitely particular—“blooming jetty at twilight,” battlefield beneath, retreating sea, reef-death cycle—and consistently filtered through his ritualistic attention. Environment and objects (jetty planks, soil between slats, tide, buried bayonets) directly shape what he can do and charge the final image of dark earth patches and dusk. The sensory palette (smell of ash, kelp, monsoon dust) is rich without losing spatial clarity. This nearly reaches a 9-band; the only thing holding it back is that the jetty itself could plausibly be swapped for another liminal ground with modest revision.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting work is exceptional: “scrapyard settlement spanning a cracked wasteland,” children on tank hulls, stoves fueled by shredded circuit boards—these details feel both fresh and thematically tied to salvage and resonance. The post-war environment and machinery aren’t just backdrop; they supply the cylinders, the improvised turntable, and the nightly listening space, all of which shape what’s possible. The autumn leaf functions as a micro-setting object that decisively charges the final image and constrains how Bracken reads truth. A slight trim of repeated phrasing (“scrapyard settlement spanning a cracked wasteland” used twice almost verbatim) would raise this to truly flawless territory.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observation deck, time-dilated sky, and “echoed silence” create a vivid, specific atmosphere woven tightly into her perception. Details like mist on the glass, smeared constellations, and the faint hum of stilled machinery feel lived-in and character-filtered. The environment doesn’t just backdrop the story; the altered sky and deck’s stillness are integral to her ritual and the final image. While the setting doesn’t sharply constrain options, it meaningfully charges her choices and the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.3)
    The icebound spire, obsidian table, and wrong sky are rendered with vivid, multi-sensory detail (“breath sharp as glass,” “wind howled like a choir of forgotten gods”). Setting is not mere wallpaper; the board, chamber, and sundial lid are environmental anchors that charge the final images and embody the magic system. However, the spire and weather don’t significantly constrain tactics beyond establishing atmosphere—the climb is summarized rather than pressured. The specificity and tonal fit are excellent even if the environment could shape choices more concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    The whispering gallery is vivid, specific, and constantly active in the piece: its acoustics, circular floor, and central heart where the chessboard rests all shape what’s possible. The environment isn’t backdrop; it enables the word-spelling walks, houses the survivors’ ritual, and frames the final confrontation, so it clearly charges the last image. Details like “echoing not voices but silences shaped like breaths” are evocative yet grounded in the space’s function. The gallery’s properties constrain the action in a way that integrates setting tightly with theme and plot.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mountain-bookstore is vividly rendered and consistently filtered through her tactile, textural perception, with shelves “shifting like tectonic plates” and corridors breathing. Environment actively shapes the turn: the shelves rearrange to form an archway, and the hidden room is the concrete manifestation of “home.” Recurring objects (stone, feather, books, glass) charge the final image rather than serving as scenery. Setting, atmosphere, and the magic system interlock smoothly to constrain and then expand her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    The time-frozen village, platinum labyrinth, and “woven hush” are vivid, selective, and tightly integrated with mood; they’re filtered through her professional, pattern-seeing gaze in a way that feels embodied. Environmental shifts (thunder, frozen/animating people, final rain) mirror internal movement without feeling like blunt symbolism. The labyrinth and hush charge the final image conceptually, but the setting rarely constrains tactics in a concrete way; it’s more atmospheric pressure than situational obstacle. That keeps this strong but short of the top tier where environment would more directly force or limit choices.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bone towers, canyon of echoes, and pale spire are vivid, original, and tightly integrated with how refraction works—regrets physically become altered echoes. Environment actively shapes tactics (she must climb the tower, hurl poems into the canyon) and directly charges the final image when the spire dissolves. Sensory specificity (“mist that pulsed like a slow heartbeat,” “smelled of rain and burnt sugar”) deepens atmosphere without static postcard description. World rules stay consistent and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop over an acid sea is vividly rendered and consistently interacted with—fumes sting, the hull groans, rivets are threatened, and a later seam-split sprays acid into the scene. Environment constrains her (she’s racing both suffocation and dissolution) and then directly charges the final image when the statue’s aura pushes the fumes back and steadies the floor. Specific recurring objects (the key ring, fox, statue) are physically and symbolically integrated rather than decorative. A tiny fraction of the imagery edges toward lush for the crisis moment, but spatial and rule coherence remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting and atmosphere are a major strength: the harbor, lighthouse, tide-washed stones, and especially the cave are rendered with vivid, sensorial specificity. The cave is not just backdrop; it functions as a kind of cathedral/microcosm where time stretches and her choices (where to sit, what to paint, where to leave the shell) gain weight. Environmental details (kelp-slick steps, salt crystals, metronomic drips) track her internal state without feeling over-symbolized. The one minor limitation is that while the environment deeply charges the experience, it rarely constrains her options in a way that raises explicit on-page stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cobalt lighthouse, sea, dawn, and scented air are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Setting is not merely decorative: height, beam, sea, and scent all interact to make her method plausible and to charge the final image of her “broadcasting” tenderness. The recurring cobalt-and-gold imagery and the scent motifs effectively frame the thematic stakes. It stops short of a 9+ only because the environment shapes mood and method more than it actively constrains difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    The starlit signal station, rusted gantry, and broken dish array are not mere backdrop; they condition the entire mode of grief-navigation and make the “abandonment”/“recalibration” turn possible. Micro-setting (the censer foot, copper veins, dead airwaves, Junction 7 silt) is tactile and character-filtered, and the environment’s disuse directly creates the vacuum she must fill with new lattices of meaning. The setting’s rules (failed hydraulics, dead signals, static) stay consistent and evolve into the reverse-migration architecture. Environment and object decisively charge the final image of her on the gantry singing coordinates into the wind.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    The hanging orchard and storm-battered ravine are vividly, sensorially rendered and tightly fused with her profession and the emotional palette of the story. Details like cables, bridges, rotting fruit, mycelium, and the ravine-as-lung image evolve across the piece, reflecting and amplifying internal states without tipping into clumsy symbolism. The setting meaningfully charges the final image (bridge, orchard sighing, mycelium holding memory), though it only lightly constrains tactical choices. Overall, the atmosphere is rich, specific, and thematically consonant.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting work is rich and purposeful: the “opal dock,” mist, salt, gulls, and lighthouse all cultivate an atmosphere that mirrors Silas’s vocation as a watcher of thresholds. Details are filtered through his sensibility—environment is not a neutral postcard but a field of “gaps” and residues. The Edelweiss operates as a micro-setting object that charges the final image in the desk drawer and beside Elara’s photograph. The dock and coastal world don’t strongly constrain physical options, but they do meaningfully shape tone and the logic of his observational method.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    The settings are vivid and purposeful: dusty shop, rising creek, phosphorescent cavern, and the root-and-quartz arch all feel sensorially specific and thematically tuned to buried choices and mapped/unmapped spaces. Environment shapes options—the hidden iron door, moss-slick steps, and the pulsing arch literally gate his progression—and the creek’s rise/ebb and the gleaming stones at the end charge the final image. Details are filtered through a map-obsessed consciousness (“continents whispered,” “doorway of decisions”) rather than reading like a tourist catalog. The cavern and door in particular perform real narrative work, not just atmospheric decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting and atmosphere are vivid, specific, and tightly integrated: the ridge, frost-laced cobwebs, cobalt fireflies, and bleeding sky all mirror and pressure her internal state. The environment actively guides choices (treacherous trail, firefly path, grotto as threshold) and deeply charges the final image of her descending with fireflies clinging to her. World rules around starlight, memory, and the grotto stay consistent and are shown rather than exposited. The lush description always feels filtered through her sensibility rather than touristic cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ember nexus, pocket-sun, and shell create a vivid, coherent magical micro-setting with strong sensory texture (“embers exhaling warmth,” “liquid twilight”). The environment is not mere backdrop: the nexus reacts to the confession, supplies the twilight used in the ritual, and “sighs” in the final cadence, clearly charging the closure image. Details are filtered through the alchemist’s sensibility, maintaining tonal unity. A bit of descriptive lushness borders on ornamental, but overall the setting meaningfully shapes and mirrors the emotional action.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is rich and purposeful from the first line—“pine resin and damp wool,” “cabin walls breathe with old timber sighs”—and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. The mountain cabin and surrounding peaks aren’t postcards; they frame the retreat, mirror isolation, and culminate in the trailhead image that charges the final “soar.” The birch forest and bark scroll fuse environment and object into a micro-setting that literally channels the conflict. Weather and landscape (“mountain exhales mist”) meaningfully color the closing stance.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    The water clock shop, its brass gears, glass reservoirs, and morning fog create a strongly textured, purposeful environment that mirrors and shapes the emotional stakes. Objects-as-setting (water clock, birthing screw) are integrated into action and culminate in the final image of the clock on the therapy table, clearly charging closure. The fog’s softening rather than lifting elegantly tracks the thematic stance toward “occluded views” without feeling like a flat symbol. Spatial and temporal anchors are clear, and details feel filtered through Elara’s altered sensory hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating rock tea platform, valley mist, geomantic currents, and the tea itself create a highly specific, atmospheric setting that feels lived-in rather than decorative. Environmental details are filtered through Elira’s focus—scar heat, ink behavior, suspended time—so they serve both mood and stakes. The space affects the closure: the platform’s resonance and the tea’s reflection of sky instead of fear charge the final image. Occasionally the descriptive richness skirts excess, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    The archive and orchard are rendered with rich, selective sensory detail (“yellowed paper and forgotten crescendos,” “hush before the orchard’s trees were cut down”) that deeply color mood. The perfume bottle functions as a micro-setting/tool that charges the final image and shapes action. While the environment influences tone and subtext more than tactical options, the musical specificity (Restoration Room, spines labeled Chopin, Debussy, Satie) is lived-in and coherent. Strong atmosphere; it stops just short of 9-band because the physical space rarely constrains what they can actually do.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ancient temple library is vividly rendered (“dust motes hung like frozen stars,” shelves spiraling into a domeless sky, regret-bound volumes) and deeply entwined with the premise. Environmental changes (shelves rotating, sky-eyes, library closing like “a hand around a seed”) participate directly in the climax rather than serving as backdrop. World rules—time eddies, fossilized librarians, resonance-based shelving—stay internally consistent and inform what’s possible. The setting also charges the final image, with the library itself acting as the closing hand on her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    The fjord, basalt promontory, hydraulic station, brass dials, and lenses are concrete and consistently filtered through his temporal obsession. The environment constrains what’s possible—no windows facing land, only sea/sky—and that choice charges the thematic sense of time as unowned vastness. Tools (pistons, lenses, key) and weather (frost, ice floes) aren’t postcard details; they actively shape the ritual and the final image of dormant machinery pointed at a temporal horizon. Setting, mood, and premise are tightly fused.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vividly realized and deeply functional: the fungi register thresholds, respond to Aris’s movement and intent, and literally absorb the dissolving stranger. Environmental detail is filtered through her professional and spatial bias, avoiding tourist cataloguing. The final image of motes sinking into soil and the farm’s “quiet, glowing pulse” charges the setting with emotional and conceptual weight. The world rules around thresholds, mycelial roots, and quantum particulates remain internally consistent at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.3)
    The rainwashed library, subway underbelly, and rehab ward are vividly rendered and filtered through Elara’s probabilistic, melancholic lens; sensory details (wet paper, cedar, condensation) and the lantern function as a micro-setting. The recurring library frame and the lantern’s mica pane charge the final image with emotional and thematic weight. However, the environment mostly shapes mood and symbolism rather than constraining concrete choices or tactics. That keeps this just shy of the very top band despite its lush specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    The subway utility tunnel and retrofitted signal station are richly realized—damp concrete, iron-and-ozone air, rotary dials as veins—creating a tactile, coherent underworld. The glass harmonica disc functions as a micro-setting object, anchoring attention and heavily charging the final image. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical options, but it saturates the tone and makes her vocation feel materially rooted and inevitable. The recurrence of underground hums and flickering streetlamps ties setting into temporal rhythm and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is richly particular—the salt-crusted planks, lanterns, jasmine, and the scent-mix of salt and ink all anchor the scene and mirror the emotional blend of loss and beauty. Environmental details are filtered through her archival sensibility, charging objects like the locket and journal. The jetty and twilight return in the final image, clearly reweighting earlier description and making the environment part of the closure. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain her physical options, it does meaningfully shape tone and thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    The disused railway station is vividly rendered (“draped in ivy like a forgotten cathedral”) and recurs meaningfully in the final re-description as no longer abandoned. While it doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choice, it thematically supports the transformation from disuse to communal resonance. The micro-setting of Platform 3 and the table is clean, and details like birds in ticket booths and foxes on rails reinforce the “polite anarchy” mood rather than feeling like postcard clutter. The station’s shift in symbolic charge at closure nearly, but not fully, reaches indispensable-object-as-setting status.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ultrasonic forest is richly rendered through non-visual senses (vibrations, pitches, textures) in a way that is tightly bound to this blind POV. Environmental features are not decorative: moss that chimes, mushrooms in C-minor, and the silent hollow sphere all constrain her tactics and culminate in the charged final image of the glowing ring on moss. World rules (sound as landscape; silence as compressed potential) are consistent and learned through her movement rather than exposition. The density of imagery is high but generally purposeful and oriented around her vocation and senses.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    The gravitational anomaly is vividly rendered and conceptually integrated: warped crust of spacetime, light spirals, and “gravity pulling narrative threads” all both set mood and explain mechanics. The micro-setting (anomaly + pen) directly enables and constrains what she can do with history, and the anomaly’s settling at the end charges the closure image. Detail selection feels purposeful rather than touristic, supporting both atmosphere and theme without breaking internal rules.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    The harbor is not mere backdrop; it’s actively reframed as concert hall, with boats as instruments, wind as conductor, sea and stars as the only audience, and the tide as the agent of erasure. Details like lantern flickers, gull cries, and the creak of ropes are woven into the “score,” integrating setting with action and theme. The luminous water and moonlight also charge the final image of fleeting, uncaptured music. This is rich, purposeful atmosphere that meaningfully shapes the story’s terms without over-describing.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.0)
    The archive setting is richly textured—“petrified ink and salt,” “volcanic tuff,” glowing glyphs—and consistently filtered through her sensibility. Environment is not mere backdrop; it responds (tremors, hidden doors, glowing glyphs), functionally guiding her deeper. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactical options, it clearly charges both the middle beats and the final transformation image. The integration is strong and memorable, if just shy of using environment as an explicit dilemma engine.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.3)
    The auric lagoon and sound wave garden are vivid, specific, and tightly integrated with character and theme, especially the lagoon reflection of “twenty-seven faces” and the resonant soil triggering chimes. Setting details evolve with action: the garden and lagoon actively respond to her drumming and singing rather than sitting as backdrop. The environment meaningfully charges the final image (the garden carrying the rhythm, auroras pulsing with shared sorrow-turned-grace). At times the density of imagery verges on ornamental, but it rarely stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    The container labyrinth and storm are vividly realized and strongly filtered through Lena’s professional eye (“read time in the sway of stacked containers”). The environment meaningfully shapes what’s possible—sound behaves differently in steel canyons, enabling the whisper-vs-shout theme and the overheard confession. Recurring objects (coin, map, keyhole) function as charged micro-settings that culminate in the final image. A touch more tactile interaction with physical danger in the maze would push this toward true exceptionalism.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is exceptionally integrated: the cobalt dock, rain-slick planks, lamplight, and iron grates all directly enable her tactics (reflections, glyphs) and define what is possible. The canal’s darkness is both literal environment and active pressure, and the final star piercing the water repurposes that environment into the closure image. Details feel selective and purposeful rather than touristic, with water, light, and metal repeatedly shaping action and meaning. This is a clear case where environment and recurring objects constrain choices and charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cobalt library, mist, stained glass, sundial, and spectral arbors form a strongly atmospheric, unified world, all filtered through Elira’s sensibility. Setting details are purposeful—windows as literal/figurative mirrors, the library as a junction of “past and prophecy,” the mist as medium for the grotto’s glow. The environment meaningfully frames her tactics (chessboards in windows, light-warping through glass) and charges the final image of a town softly transformed. It still feels more like a beautifully realized backdrop than an active constraint on options, which holds it just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sublittoral fringe, bioluminescent kelp, and disappearing island create a richly textured, original environment that’s inseparable from the story’s meaning. The sea and island actively shape options and choices: the warming scrimshaw at the water’s edge, the island rising only under compassion, and its vanishing by dawn all constrain Lira’s window for transformation. Details stay tightly filtered through her working familiarity with docks and tides, preventing “tourist” description. The final image—salt on her lips, walking toward “the next wounded wave”—recharges the setting as an ongoing spiritual terrain, not mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and thematically fused: turbines as “skeletal sentinels,” engineered hush, the rattling farmhouse, and the Compliance Station all feel integral rather than ornamental. Environmental constraints (mandated quiet, surveillance, turbine hum) concretely shape what kinds of grief are possible and charge the tiny pockets of “true silence” that matter at the end. Objects-as-setting (bouquet, knife, box) operate as lived tools, not symbols stapled on top. This is publishably strong; the only slight limitation is that we never see the physical environment obstruct a tactic in real time—it’s more atmospheric constraint than direct obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: the cobalt atrium, humming quartz, and frozen lake are not backdrop but active partners—the pillars hum and warm, the lake cracks “like a god clearing its throat,” and finally mirrors and “paraphrases” her motion. Spatial and sensory choreography is clear and consistently filtered through an artist’s eye, with sound/light/temperature all in play. Environment shapes her actions (bare feet on marble, kneeling in the cupped-heart of the colonnade, stepping onto the ice) and decisively charges the final image of her first step across the shimmering lake. This is publish-grade atmospheric work.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    The courtyard is richly realized and inextricable from the action: scrap heaps, overgrown flora, ash wall, birdbath, and kiln all do work rather than sit as décor. Environmental specifics (morning sun on cobblestones, phoenix shadow, dew filling the birdbath) actively register the awakening, charging the final hum with place-based meaning. The setting’s rules—glass, fire, ash, plants, resonance—are consistent and learned through what characters do. It stops just short of 9-band because the environment shapes possibility more than it constrains or endangers choice.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “laboratory of lost sounds” is richly imagined and consistently exploited: fossilized echoes, vacuum tubes, and wire harps all serve the premise of sound as sediment and memory. The miner’s lens and tuning fork function as micro-setting tools that shape what she can do—she refracts sound rather than merely hearing it. Environmental detail is selective and thematically charged, with silence treated as layered matter rather than emptiness. The final image of the cracked, glowing lens clipped to her belt is strongly grounded in the physical space and carries the story’s charge.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    The observatory as a “timeless” vault with shuttered lenses and “curtains of intention” is a striking, coherent spatial metaphor that anchors mood and world-rules. Details like “time pooled here like spilled ink” and silk the color of twilight are precise and voice-specific, not generic decoration. The environment mostly frames and mirrors her interiority rather than constraining concrete choices, and the crucial actions (leaving origami) occur off-site, so the setting’s influence on tactics is limited. Even so, it clearly charges the cosmology of ache and resonance that underpins the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft, hollowed financial district, and post-crash city are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through her sensibility. Recurring objects—the onyx ink, ledger, corkboards, and especially the measuring tape—make the environment feel like an instrument of her work rather than backdrop. Weather and light (rain, thunder, dawn) evolve with the piece and subtly reinforce mood without becoming clichéd. The setting charges the final image (dawn, pinned maps, loft as observatory-cathedral), even if it doesn’t sharply constrain tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    The archive and pagoda are richly realized with tactile and sensory detail that’s consistently filtered through her emotional state (shelves like “broken ribs,” dust “relieved of a burden”). The environment concretely constrains choice: this is where a civilization engineered forgetting, and the machine’s physical properties dictate her tactics. The recurring image of motes of nostalgia moving through the space culminates in their release at the ceiling, charging the final reconfiguration. Description edges toward lush, but it remains purposeful and never devolves into a static postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “blooming library above clouds,” petal chandeliers, pulsing books, and central archive form a vivid, coherent environment filtered through Elira’s sensibility. Setting elements aren’t mere backdrop: the archive physically enables her intervention, and the river stone as a micro-setting object charges both her motive and the final alteration of dreams. World rules around neural lace and shareable dreams are sketched efficiently and feel consistent with what happens. A bit more use of non-visual senses in the library itself could deepen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    The misty workshop, lantern light, and star-pricked darkness are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s attention, creating a strong atmospheric container. The environment and the small-object “setting” of the tail and glass case charge the final images—the starlit dark as nonjudgmental witness, the case as compass. Tools and materials (resin, pigments, lichen, quartz) feel tactile and grounded in her vocation. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, it meaningfully frames and deepens the internal stakes and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tower, ivy, catacombs, and cathedral are vividly rendered with concrete sensory touches (“moss-slick flagstones,” “silence pooled like spilled ink”) and always filtered through Elira’s sensibility. Environment directly shapes options: her bond with roots opens the tunnel, the buried seed exists specifically where stone meets soil, and the hourglass on the sill/floor/ending becomes a micro-setting object that charges the final image. The atmosphere of damp stone, turned earth, and dawn light supports the numinous tone without drifting into generic fantasy architecture. A slightly stronger sense of spatial risk or physical constraint in the tunnel itself is the only missing layer.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    The projection booth and theater are vividly realized through tactile, olfactory, and auditory detail (“dusty velvet couch,” “smelling of ozone and old velvet,” rain on the domed roof) and are never generic. The environment directly shapes the plot (film canister, projector baseplate, hidden compartment) and charges the ending via the marquee and the rain, so setting is tightly integrated rather than decorative. This is near top-tier work for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    The aurora-lit archway and cliffside environment are vivid and specific, with the lights “like spirits weaving through cathedral spires” and frozen stone under her knees grounding the lyricism. Setting is not mere backdrop: the archway functions as a ritual site and refuge, the aurora visibly responds to her effort, and weather (winter, cold) imposes a somatic cost. The astronomical instrument also works as a micro-setting/tool that charges the final image when it grows warm and hums. A minor limitation is that the town below stays generalized rather than physically particularized, which slightly blunts the spatial stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    The worldbuilding and atmosphere are vivid, specific, and integrated: bioluminescent petals encoding “final sighs,” a probability-stitched archive, and spheres of almost-worlds all feel fresh and legible. The chess clock and dune function as micro-settings that charge the final image, and environmental details reliably mirror the conceptual stakes of potential vs. entropy. Rules of the world (archive flickering, quantum resonance) are learned through his actions, not exposition dumps. At times the density of imagery approaches overload, but it remains coherent and supports tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.3)
    The mechanical rainforest is richly and specifically rendered—brass vines, copper leaves, mercury waterfall, turbine rocks—filtered through the philosopher’s perceptual bias toward sound and mechanism. Setting is not just backdrop: the canopy fall, the responsive flora, and the mercury all directly interact with him and the gear. The Edge and the void extend this environment into an abstract but legible threshold. The world doesn’t sharply constrain choices, but it consistently charges them with tone and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vividly specific and integrated: cobblestones, veiled ridgeway, moss-slick railings, fox, shrines, and shoreline cottages all feel lived-in and coherent. Environmental elements shape tone and meaning, especially the ridge’s crest where sea and mountain breaths meet, and the star-punched world fabric that literally guides their path. The final image of star-shaped holes in doorframes and bread is charged by prior object and setting work. This is near top-tier atmosphere, docked only slightly because the environment constrains mood more than concrete choices.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt fortress, the unmelting snow, the spiral staircase stain, and the piano atrium are richly particular and consistently filtered through his sensibility, giving the world a lived, uncanny solidity. Setting actively shapes choice: the fortress’s design as a mausoleum of silence, the missing bolt, and the stain-as-oracle all constrain what he believes is possible and safe. The final images—the dust dancing, the chandelier light, the stain flushing gold—clearly charge the closure and reconfigure the fortress from tomb to something more porous. This is elite-level atmosphere and specificity; only a slight restraint keeps it from feeling like the entire choice is materially constrained by the physical environment rather than thematically so.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    The temple library and celestial dome are vividly rendered and functionally integrated: books become the vehicle of dissent, the sacred font is the tactical target, and the final image of the open book and hidden pellet is charged. Details are selective and purposeful rather than touristic, with dust, starlight, and stone echoing the theme of slow erosion. The world’s rules (paused constellations, ink memory) feel internally consistent at this length. Environment meaningfully shapes options and the closing image without bogging the pace.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sea level monitoring station, drowned mangroves, and bioluminescent reefs are rendered with vivid, selective detail that’s tightly filtered through Elara’s scientific and tactile attention. Setting constrains and enables choices (storm surge breaching sensors forces her into the water; the station’s AI and hardware make the ECHO subroutine and tapping interface plausible). Recurring objects—the atlas page, sensors, and surfaces she taps—charge the final image rather than serving as static props. Atmosphere consistently supports the drifting, half-ruined, half-sacred mood without bogging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly specific and integrated: cold alloy grating under bare feet, shattered dome, derelict tarmac, dead control panels all filter through her attention and mood. The abandoned spaceport and the buried stone circle layer tech and antiquity in a way that feels coherent and tonally apt, and the environment actively participates in the climax (bioluminescent schematics, dust exhaling, vibrations through the floor). The opera glasses and the bay function as charged micro-setting elements that constrain perception and charge the final image. World rules remain consistent at a mythic level, and the physical space is always clear.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    The volcanic hot springs, sulfurous vents, obsidian stone, and ash-rich soil are vivid and continuously integrated into action (“the soil here… remembered everything,” steam carrying the essence, seedlings pushing through ash). Environment meaningfully shapes what’s possible: the soil’s memory and the vents’ heat are required for the ritual mechanics and the final diffusion. The setting is filtered through her worldview (tradition, reconstruction, soil-memory) rather than reading as a neutral postcard. The final image of impossible seedlings humming with glyphs powerfully charges the setting as an active participant in the story’s stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    The arboretum on the seaside cliff is vividly drawn and tightly filtered through the narrator’s noticing: “wind-rattled glass,” “ivy has swallowed the slats,” “dewdrop caught in a spider’s web.” Environment isn’t mere backdrop; it actively shapes the inner shifts—the wild, unapologetic decay mirrors the refusal of neat healing, and specific features (bench, cypress, greenhouse panes, lighthouse beam) recur and evolve. The setting directly charges the closure image (carrying the “pearl” in the pulse) by grounding stillness in a concrete micro-setting (dew in a web). Sensory balance is strong, with tactility and sound as present as sight.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.1)
    The lighthouse library is vivid and specific—salt-crusted windows, drunkard shelves, spiraling guts—and its physical oddities mirror and enact the metaphysical fracture. Environment isn’t mere backdrop: the spiral staircase inverts, the sea rises vertically, and the walls close in to cocoon her, directly shaping the climax. The tarot box and stitched parchment function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. Sensory details feel filtered through her sensibility rather than touristic listing.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    The wind-carved encampment, erosion-shaped structures, and sighing dunes are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through the tracker’s perception and purpose. The environment, tools, and objects (camp, stone, rice paper, ink, Ghostwing) are not mere backdrop; the stone and spilled ink literally become the lab and gateway. The final image of the drone hovering alone in the carved encampment charges the setting with absence and cost. This is rich, economical setting work, though the physical environment constrains choice slightly less than the conceptual tools do.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “echoing library under snow” is vivid, tactile, and tonally central: frost, cryo-glass, snow-muted sound all reinforce the tension between silence and latent volatility. Setting isn’t mere backdrop; the library’s architecture hides dormant networks, the Resonance Table is a relic of prior wars, and later the “Silent Scandal Wing” embodies the story’s ongoing stakes. Weather and physical environment meaningfully shape the mood and final image even if they don’t block literal movement. World rules for this frozen capital and its tech remain consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glass-domed desert rose farm, salvaged ballast sand, and rubble zones outside are drawn with precise, evocative detail that feels lived-in rather than decorative. Setting is tightly integrated with theme: the dome as sanctuary against the Scorched Belt, the sandbag scrap as literal and spiritual ballast, roses traveling into orphanages and slums. Environmental constraints—charred world outside, fragile oasis inside—implicitly shape Elara’s options and give weight to her choice to remain a gardener rather than a hunter. The worldbuilding is rich without becoming encyclopedic.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “sound wave garden,” choral ferns, and sleepwalking constellations form a richly specific, coherent environment whose rules (sound as matter, silence as tool) are learned through action. The rail spike and sonic soil constrain tactics and charge the final image, meeting the high-band gate for setting-as-constraint. A touch more tactile or bodily grounding would make the space even more lived-in, but atmosphere and rule-consistency are already exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observatory above the clouds, the brass rail, and the modified telescope create a vivid, atmospheric micro-world that feels both tactile and thematically apt. The setting is not just decorative: the hacked telescope and vantage over the archive rooftop are the enabling conditions for her whole method of resistance. Recurring environmental images—smoke, clouds, iron ribs, the dome “sighing”—mirror her moral cosmology without feeling like blunt allegory. The world remains a little abstracted (no city name, minimal concrete social context), but for this length it’s a coherent, charged stage.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “laboratory of lost sounds,” jars of lullaby-echoes, and Model L-7’s violet tubes create an unusually vivid, coherent environment that directly shapes action. Setting is not wallpaper: the lab’s “meteor hush” becomes both atmosphere and moral pressure, and the cradle, willow, and aurora-threaded sky feed the thematic arc of shame transformed into gentler sound. World rules (ghosts as regrets, firmware translating cries) stay internally consistent and are learned through concrete interaction. A touch less decorative density in places might heighten the impact of the strongest details, but the integration of objects and environment into the final image is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grotto, mist, damp sand, and whispering tile are sensuously rendered and tightly integrated with the action rather than feeling like backdrop. Environmental rules (emergent hush, echo-absorbing walls, the tile’s resonance) are consistent and shape what’s possible—she must work through texture and pattern, not speech. The setting constrains and clarifies her choice to “interject” through the mandala, and the rain-on-glass image at the end recharges the grotto’s motifs in a new micro-setting. Description occasionally verges on lush, but it remains purposeful and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is intensely atmospheric: “ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky,” ash like “powdered grief,” and the ruined minaret debris all feel specific and lived-in. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactical options, but the fallen minaret and its tesserae are functionally the ritual ground and resource Elira uses to enact change. The sensory choices—fractured arches, scorched velvet, ash-laden air—are purposeful and echo the emotional state without feeling like a tourist catalog. The tessera as charged object at the end effectively functions as micro-setting that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mystic orchard and hedge maze are vividly realized with multisensory specificity (blossoms from spring with autumn’s rot, timelines cracking like eggshells) and always filtered through the ghost’s artistic/sonic perception. Setting actively shapes events: the orchard’s fractured time enables contact with future echoes, and the hedge-maze enclosure plus after-hours frame establish a liminal, secret stage. Environment charges the final image: the sapling grown from the coin and the orchard’s “remembering” are inseparable from place. A slight excess of descriptive flourish in places keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    The light painting studio, geode, and equipment are sensuously and specifically rendered—oscilloscope, synth, blackout velvet, resin-flecked floor—and all are filtered through Elira’s artistic/technical eye. Setting actively shapes her tactics: she routes biofeedback into light modulators and uses studio tools to manifest the “starfield of shared memory,” so environment and tools are not mere backdrop. The geode-as-micro-setting and the walls-as-constellations both charge the final image. Description density is high but purposeful, and spatial grounding remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    The coastal cave network is richly and precisely rendered—salt-crusted stalactites, bioluminescent lichen keyed to emotion, tidal arches—and those features are not decorative; they participate in how emotions are mapped and how the climax manifests. The lichen’s color shifts and the Tidal Sanctum setting directly charge the turning point and final image, and the fossil-as-tool sits convincingly within this environment. The world’s rules feel internally consistent and learned through action rather than exposition dumps. This integration of setting with premise and closure is a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    The amber warehouse, cliffs, jars, and buttons are vividly and economically realized, creating a coherent, tactile atmosphere that feels wholly its own. Setting is not mere backdrop: the carved-under-cliff space, shelves of breath and confessions, and canyon echo all shape what kind of work is possible and how prophecy functions. The recurring objects (hourglass, jars, buttons) charge the final image of “buttons gleamed under lantern light” with accumulated meaning. It stops just short of 9-band because the physical environment rarely constrains specific moment-to-moment choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bluff, mist, snow, thaw, and buried relay station are vivid, tactile, and consistently filtered through her spy’s tactical awareness. Environment constrains and enables her method (using snowmelt as transport to the underground cache) and supports theme through seasonal transition. Recurring objects-as-setting (pillbox, hatch, rust, bones of the bluff) explicitly charge the final images. The world feels tightly bounded yet deep, with no white-room moments.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    The fog-bound river crossing, ticking gutters, and willows are vivid and sensorially specific, and they meaningfully constrain action (slow pace, closed eyes, reliance on sound and instinct). Weather and water aren’t decorative; the fog’s thickness, the river’s stones, and the cessation of gutter-ticking all directly shape timing and choices. The yarn needle and coach/river function as micro-settings that charge the final image and theme. A slight tendency toward atmospheric luxuriance over selectivity keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vividly particular—the cracked kiln, “broken cathedrals” of hives, wax pooled and stone-scribed sun patterns—and consistently filtered through her craftsman’s, contemplative gaze. Environmental elements and objects (kiln, dry riverbed clay, the beekeeping ruins, the lantern glass) meaningfully shape tactics and the ending image: she chooses not to fire the kiln, uses riverbed clay, and leaves the pot in the dust as an open, breathing “home for time.” Weather and wasteland context press subtly on choices (limited water, heat, abandonment). The world rules about time’s layering in this oasis are clear enough and integrated via image rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the fire escape, cracked planters, harbor like “spilled mercury,” and alleyways below all shape what’s possible. Moonlight and height are not postcard backdrops but functional constraints—the prisms and their angles depend on this environment, and the final image of the harbor “moonlit and merciful” directly charges the closure. Details feel filtered through her practical yet lyrical eye (the bitting gauge, the demolished theater’s prism), creating a strong sense of place. The world rules remain consistent and the environment quietly dictates the story’s entire method of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is striking and functionally integrated: the tidal cloud-sea, brass sundials, and buried stone circle all constrain and enable choices, especially in the flooding crisis. Environmental mechanics (cloud-tides rising, hum faltering, vapor hissing against brass) directly force Veyra’s intervention and shape how she acts. The recurring objects—the sundial, stone circle, library itself—charge the final image, where the library “turns its next page” in tandem with the hum and gleam. Description is rich yet purposeful, rarely feeling like a static postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, and inner reflecting pool are vividly realized and tightly woven into action—the walk through the shallows, the origami birds afloat, the lilies reacting to whispered names. Setting is not postcard filler; it actively frames and charges the ritual and the final state of being. The recurring water/temple/lily environment clearly underwrites the final image, though it stops just short of exerting hard constraints on choice. Overall, atmosphere and specificity are publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    The university radio station is tactile and functional—dim booth, Cold War transmitters, humming jury-rigged hardware—and directly shapes tactics and threat. Campus unrest outside the booth is sketched efficiently yet credibly and clearly affected by the signal warfare. Charts, oscilloscopes, and the counter-frequency rig are woven into action rather than paraded as décor. The final pinned chart nicely charges the last image, though the physical environment at closure could bear one more concrete, sensory touch.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is vivid and integral: the nexus, starlight fissures, constricting tunnel, and star-painted dome all shape Elara’s physical and psychological options. The narrow passage pressures her key decision, and the altered passage on her return directly embodies the story’s conceptual turn. World rules around subterranean vaults and cosmic architecture are consistent and learned through her movement rather than exposition dumps. Environmental detail is lush but largely purposeful, serving atmosphere and theme rather than feeling like a museum tour.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    The quarry and its mist are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Elira’s tactile bias—stone swallowing sound and light, grit under boots, damp rock under the portraits. The setting does more than decorate: it embodies erasure, hides the masks, and becomes a literal counterstage to the masquerade, charging the idea of “performance of disappearance.” Environmental choices (night, mist, candles, the old foreman’s office) all feed tone and theme without feeling like generic gothic wallpaper. The final image of preserved masks emerging from this void consolidates setting into the story’s conceptual spine.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the fractured coast, experimental station, and inverted weather situate us quickly and support the world’s altered rules. Environmental elements like the resonance board, alarms, and the storm’s physical reversals are integrated into action, not just shown as backdrop. The copper nail functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. Still, the station could constrain choices more tangibly—most of its role is enabling magic rather than forcing tactical improvisation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mountain pullout, mist, and ridge are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the imagery of liminality and transformation; the environment clearly isn’t generic. Objects-as-setting (glass flake, scaffold flutters, violin case) function as a micro-ecosystem, with the ridge and last light literally charging the final image when the flake shatters. The mountain’s “exhale” syncs atmospheric texture with the protagonist’s internal release without feeling on-the-nose. It doesn’t quite constrain choices in a tactical way, but it strongly charges the ending, which is enough for a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    The abandoned circus train and railyard are vivid, specific, and recurrent: rusted boxcars, peeling clown murals, raccoons in sequined costumes, lantern-lit dusk. The setting isn’t just backdrop—it shapes his choices (where he pitches, where he retreats, how he reframes failure) and charges the final image of a roaming think-tank on wheels. Environmental motifs (rust, dusk, ivy, lantern light) mirror his internal reconfiguration without feeling like blunt symbolism. The space functions as both crucible and sanctuary, and the last paragraph pays off its accumulated atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observatory, the “glass eye” dome, and the pulsing starfield are concretely rendered and woven into the character’s perception rather than offered as neutral backdrop. Setting elements—charts, variable stars, temple ruins in the dreamscape, the daylily—interlock and charge the final image of the observatory as “a sanctuary where burdens became constellations.” The environment and objects meaningfully shape the story’s logic: without this specific apparatus for mapping and listening to stars, her vocation and the closure scene would not function. Sensory detail is rich but controlled, mostly avoiding static, museum-like description.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cursed lake and swirling orchard vortex are richly realized and tightly integrated with the character’s journey: faces in the ice, inverted branches, and frozen blossoms all mirror the frozen confessions she must unthaw. The environment constrains action—she must cross the surface, reach the eye, kneel, and physically anchor to the lake—and then is visibly reconfigured at the end (“The lake drained into sky”). Sensory and imagistic specificity are high without feeling like a catalog. A slight overreliance on visual imagery is the only minor restraint on a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cobalt glade, its dusk light, and the eclipse-darkened sky are sensuously and consistently rendered, with strong use of color and texture (“deep cobalt…helix of liquid shadow and starlight”). Setting is tightly integrated with function: the glade as last uncorrupted node, the dais as center, and the living roots that both bind and anchor her all constrain what can happen and what it means. The environment charges the final image directly; the story couldn’t simply be relocated without breaking its logic. At times the visual density edges toward lushness for its own sake, but it rarely stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    The catacomb orchard is strikingly original and fully integrated: roots threading bones, ambient fissure-light, resin “like slow tears” all feel specific and lived-in. Crucially, the environment constrains and enables action—the orchard’s will binds Kael, surfaces tarot cards, and literally participates in the climax, charging the final image of roots “weaving” destinies. Sensory detail is rich but not random, consistently filtered through Elira’s ritualistic, meaning-seeking gaze. The setting shapes both mood and mechanics of the conflict, not just providing backdrop but functioning as a third, ancient presence.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    The quarry office trailer and valley are vividly rendered through smell, vibration, and sound, and they feel inhabited rather than decorative. The “echo valley” acoustics and terraced scars directly charge the thematic frame of resonance and absence, especially in the closing walk and the idea of “listening.” The cloth as pinned object and the rock-cut wind hum together to shape the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    The magnetic arbor above the clouds, soil as “solidified memory,” and ley-lines all do real work beyond prettiness: the field holds glyphs, shapes how she can act, and physically embodies “transition” as bent light and humming charge. The setting is inseparable from the premise—this could not be relocated without rewriting the story’s logic. Environmental details evolve with the action (halos, pulses, stair in the trunk) and directly charge the final image of the seedling inscribing a symbol in the air. It’s vivid, conceptually integrated, and well-calibrated in density.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal atrium, bioluminescent floor, lunar-glass dome, and emotion-labeled shelves are vividly realized and tightly integrated with the ritual. Setting is not mere backdrop: the tide of liquid moonlight, migrating faces, and the “Waning Wonder” alcove all charge the central act and final image. World rules stay consistent and are learned through her work rather than dump. While the environment does not force a hard tactical constraint, it deeply shapes meaning and tone at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    The crystal caves are vividly rendered through tactile and auditory detail (“subterranean resonance,” “salt-crusted shale”) and consistently filtered through her professional but devotional gaze. The environment meaningfully charges the concept—“cathedral of compression” links geology to emotional alchemy and makes the final global glow feel inevitable. While the cave doesn’t strongly constrain tactical options, it does shape mood, ritual, and the charged final image. A slightly sharper physical constraint (narrow ledge, risk of collapse) could have raised both setting and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    The station and ivy are richly specific and consistently filtered through her obsessions (ivy as archive, stalls as strata, Track 3 as threshold). Environment doesn’t just decorate; it structures her process (bathrooms as oracles, echo tests, skylight rain in the sink) and charges the ending image of her departure. The accordion as tool-object intertwines with place via echoes and bird-listening. The only reason this doesn’t edge into the 9s is that the setting shapes meaning more than concrete options or physical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glowing, mist-filled library is vivid, specific, and fully integrated into the story’s rules—mist forming sentences, shelves curving like vertebrae, punctuation as fireflies. The environment consistently shapes what is possible (reading negative space, the law of propagation delays) and culminates in the final image of the library folding around her “like a letter sealing itself,” directly charging the ending. Objects—the bone stylus, watch, mirror—function as micro-settings that constrain choices and are woven into atmosphere rather than merely named. A slight risk of description saturation exists, but it largely serves mood and rule-building instead of stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    The velvet observatory, ice violin, and pervasive plant-life create a lush, coherent environment whose details recur with heightened charge—constellations, velvet, roots, and seeds all return at the ending to frame the reconfigured world. Setting is not just decorative; the plants and mycelium are the literal transmission medium for truth, and the observatory’s design (domed, skylights, arches) enables that propagation. Sensory specificity is high and strongly filtered through Elira’s sensibility (mulberry constellations, “mulberry ache”), with consistent world rules. At times the density borders on ornamental, but it still actively charges the final image rather than stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    The skyborne grotto and aurora are rendered with striking specificity (“stalactites of condensed skylight,” “liquid radiance”), and the environment’s properties meaningfully relate to the chip and the drifting constellation of sparks. The setting strongly inflects tone and theme, and the aurora’s slowing at the end elegantly charges the closure image. What keeps this just shy of the very top tier is that the grotto rarely constrains her choices; it’s a gorgeously realized backdrop more than a full-on tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    The oak, umbral grotto, mist, and valley are vividly rendered with multi-sensory detail and consistently filtered through Elara’s need for hush and elevation. Setting is not postcard-only: the tree and grotto physically enable her tactic of “rising above” and charge the final image of descent bearing “scalloped peace.” The recurring verticality (climbing, canopy, above the clouds) mirrors and supports the internal arc. The only small limit is that the environment nudges mood and symbolism more than it imposes hard constraints or obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and tightly integrated: the crumbling lighthouse balcony, salt wind, and rusted chimes are not backdrop but active agents shaping what can happen (decoding messages, unhooking the cloak, the risk of exposure). Objects like the cloak, shard, ash, and seashell recur and are reweighted, particularly the ash/seashell pairing at the end as a quiet benediction that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with the environment mirroring internal shifts without feeling over-symbolic. The scene could almost not exist anywhere else without losing its logic and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and particular: the floating obsidian slab, sycamore hush, magnetic grotto, and dark pond form an integrated, memorable environment. Details are filtered through the story’s preoccupations with time and revelation, so the rings, starlight fractures, and pulsing grotto all feel thematically charged. Spatial relations and physical logic remain clear even within the fantastical frame. While the environment shapes mood and symbolism more than tactical choice, it strongly charges the final images of the pond and grotto.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and specific: “tallest tower of bone,” “canyon of endless echoes,” and the murmuration of crows build a dense, coherent atmosphere. Environmental details mirror and charge the theme (bones as fossilized motion, echoes of migrations, dust as buried maps) and evolve toward the final image of towers crumbling around a stationary figure. The arrowhead and bone towers together function as micro-setting constraints on who the skimmer can be (a fixed landmark, not a traveler). The only ceiling here is that the setting shapes concept and image more than concrete tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    The icebound spire, frost, “lingering luminance,” and cloud-tree are vivid, purposeful, and tightly filtered through Lior’s sensibility. Environment actively shapes options (isolation in the spire, elevation enabling mist-walk, keystone’s micro-climate of impossibility), and the final image (“in the brilliant dimness between cloud and star”) is charged by these recurring details. World rules around automation vs. older magic are consistent and shown through setting elements like glyph-drones. This is rich and specific without feeling like a catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: the pier, sky lanterns, and sunken luxury liner-library are rendered through concrete, character-filtered detail (e.g., books like anemones, chandeliers crusted with barnacles). Environment constrains action—the only way to reach the ledger is to dive into a wrecked, groaning ship—and the recurring objects (lanterns, key tag, ledger) charge the final images. Sensory detail is strongly visual but not exclusively so; sound and pressure (ship’s groans, water against eardrums) play into the core concept. A hair shy of perfect only because the world’s rules for the glowing ink and vows remain evocatively vague rather than fully grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ambered observatory deck and last star are sensually and conceptually integrated; the “honeyed” light, cracked glass, and vertical relation to the survivors all shape mood and action. The physical setting constrains choice (a high, visible platform to send a signal from; glass for coins to clatter on) and charges the final image. Details like “amber dust,” “residual heat,” and the hollow sky consistently filter through her mindset. World rules—collapsed universe, contracting galaxies—are stable and learned through implication rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ancient observatory, cracked dome, and shattered prism are more than backdrop—they are the apparatus that enables the scattered-light ritual and thus the story’s central action. Details like the marble balcony, vine-choked ceiling, and brass armature are selectively vivid and filtered through his mood, supporting the melancholic, sacred atmosphere. Crucially, the environment constrains choice: the dying sun, dome, and prism are required for crystallization. A bit more sensory variety beyond the visual could heighten immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sapphire viaduct, dew, dripping arches, ash-gray sea, and charcoal equations create a vivid, specific environment that feels integral rather than ornamental. Setting genuinely constrains tactics: he needs this viaduct, this runoff, and this dawn rhythm for his method to function. The atmosphere of thinned magic and cosmic bookkeeping harmonizes with the premise and charges the final image of the sea’s sigh and the surfacing fish. World rules (plausible-seeming drip physics combined with divine-accounting myth) stay internally coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the resurfacing reservoir town, cracked asphalt, submerged gazebo, and ridgeway vantage all carry thematic and emotional weight. Environmental specifics (silt, barbed wire, drowned lamppost, humid air) feel lived-in and consistently filter through Elias’s observational lens. The resurfacing itself constrains choices and drives the entire scenario, and recurring objects-as-setting (wind chime, label, relics) charge the final images. The only minor limitation is that physical navigation of the town is more symbolic than tactical, but it suits the story’s mode.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.3)
    The orchard behind the kaleidoscopic waterfall, moss, silver-barked trees, and murmuring starlings create a vivid, coherent magical micro-ecology. Environmental details are strongly filtered through her alchemical sensibility (time-bending light, memory-trapping crystal) and evolve with the ritual—the blossoms unfurling in mid-winter, the waterfall’s song changing. The setting charges the final image by making the world itself “remember how to wonder,” even if it doesn’t rigidly constrain her tactical options. On a top-tier level, slightly more direct pressure from place (a concrete limitation or risk) would further elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    The nocturnal arbor, sideways trees, sky-whales, and bioluminescent vines are vivid and consistent, and they feel filtered through her professional attention. Setting is not just postcard: the floating canopy and living network allow her vibration-based signaling, and the buckle as a recurring object charges the final vow. World rules remain coherent and are learned through action rather than infodump. A slight bias toward visual/abstract description is the only minor limit.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating rock dojo, ink-black cloud sea, temporal winds, and levitating perches are vivid and consistently reused rather than postcard dressing. The dojo’s hum and the perches for the judges concretize the metaphysical trial, and the auroras on the ceiling at the climax directly charge the final image. World rules around time-fracturing and history rewriting are sketched impressionistically but stay internally consistent. The setting actively mirrors and amplifies the internal struggle rather than standing apart from it.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is richly realized and integrated: the brook, moonlight, willow, and nocturnal stillness are not postcard details but the enabling conditions for Aris’s work and his relationship with the seed. The haven’s quiet, “storm-born silence” and the willow as a kind of cathedral recur and intensify, then are recharged at the end with the journal buried beside the brook. Environmental specifics consistently feel filtered through Aris’s sensibility for controlled, unsettling spaces. The corpse flower’s placement under the willow and the brook’s hymn-like murmur genuinely charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    The echo chamber tunnel and the leaf blower shell are richly realized micro-setting elements that do real work: the tunnel’s acoustics enable the central conceit (echoed laughter), and the blower body reshapes from tool to reliquary. Environmental details (“curved concrete walls,” “eastern curve,” “western arch”) are selective and tied to action, not generic scenery. The setting meaningfully charges the final image: his stance in the tunnel with the pull cord as pendulum is inseparable from the story’s emotional logic. There’s little evolution of the physical environment over time, but for this lyric scope the constraint feels intentional rather than thin.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    The frozen garden, mist, and statues are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through the guardian’s sensibility (mist as half-language, garden geometry tucked under ribs). The environment meaningfully shapes action and closure: the statues are only available because of this garden, and the garden’s “remembering how to be porous” plus its final “exhale” charge the last image. The pendant functions almost as a micro-setting object, constraining and then redirecting choice. This is very nearly exemplary; the only limit is that environmental constraints could impinge more concretely on tactics rather than mostly serving as atmosphere and metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ember nexus, obsidian floor, frost blooms, and indigo-thickened twilight are sensuous, specific, and consistently filtered through Elric’s alchemical mindset. Environment actively shapes options and charges the ending: what began as a graveyard of failed experiments becomes a “portable” nexus he carries inside him. Tools and objects (crozier, failed stone shard, circle of powders) are integrated into action, not just described. The final image of melting frost into singing light is both spatially coherent and thematically loaded, giving the setting decisive weight in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned radio tower city over a gorge is vividly specific and persistently functional—rusted gantries, leaning antennae, buried capacitors all directly participate in the climax when the city “breathes” and sings. Setting is always filtered through her professional gaze, avoiding tourist catalogues. Crucially, the environment constrains and enables the outcome: without this particular lattice of decayed infrastructure, there is nothing for her to “conduct.” A slight excess of stacked atmospheric descriptors in early lines keeps it just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is lush, specific, and functional: the “spectral grotto under starlight,” phosphorescent pebbles, coral arches, and bioluminescent eels all both atmosphere-build and feed directly into his pattern work and ritual. The ferry decks, brass railings, salt spray, and lighthouse/buoy network give a coherent maritime world filtered through his working-class perspective. The grotto and its tools (radio, stalactites, eels) constrain and enable his choices; the final wake “shimmering with ghostly ripples” recharges the spatial logic and mood. A slight risk of over-ornamentation is present, but it rarely stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    The optical illusion gallery is vivid, specific, and continuously re-invented—breathing walls, self-swallowing doorways, portraits that blink and later weep pigment. Setting is not mere backdrop; it responds to her actions and culminates in the architectural eruption, directly charging the climax and final image. The environment’s rules feel consistent within the dream-logic frame. A slight cap comes from the atmosphere leaning more toward lush spectacle than constraint on concrete choices.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    The benthic city and pressure-dome classroom are vividly and economically realized—the bioluminescent towers, holographic constellations, braille star-charts, and deep-sea vents all feel purposeful and filtered through Elira’s priorities. The underwater setting meaningfully constrains experience (colonists will never see the sky with their eyes) and charges the central premise of “navigating by starlight even in the deep.” The anchor link functions as a recurring object that bridges surface and abyss, concretely charging the final image of the classroom wall. World rules about alien-folded space and edge geometry are consistent enough to feel lived-in, even if they tilt more toward idea than gritty logistics.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    The atrium is sensuously rendered—mist, glass ceiling “weeping,” statues, cracked fountain—and these details are filtered through her work, not as a neutral tour. The environment subtly participates in the arc (mist thinning, atrium “sighing”) and the objects-as-setting (photograph, hearing aid, lilies) charge the final image. While the space doesn’t strongly constrain tactics—this could occur in many liminal places—the specificity and tone fit the premise exceptionally well. Description stays mostly purposeful rather than indulgent.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vividly realized and constantly active—the rusted stairwell, “binary frost” of dead LEDs, salt-crusted cafeteria, and the tidal breathing of the facility all shape mood and plausibly constrain her behavior. Environmental details aren’t tourist catalog; they’re filtered through her mission and fear, and the undersea cables/the child’s drawing charge the final images of remembrance. The tidal window and collapsing structure subtly, if not brutally, narrow her options. This world feels specific and lived-in without exposition bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Snowveil Observatory and its opal dome, frost-feathered glass, and buried-under-snow isolation are vivid and consistently filtered through Aris’s tactile and visual attention. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, but it deeply shapes mood and meaning—the under-snow observatory mirrors his bureaucratic burial, and the shard and ink function as charged micro-settings. Weather and architecture subtly participate in theme (snow as drifted-over memory, opal light on porcelain) and charge the final images of him leaving through snow tunnels. The only holdback from the very top tier is that these elements pressure atmosphere more than on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is remarkably vivid and conceptually integrated: bone spires, a sky that won’t echo color, and a canyon that preserves all sound are not postcard details but the operating rules of the piece. The tunnel of echoes and its time-folding acoustics directly shape the ritual, enable the joining of voices across centuries, and charge the final image of a word sent “forward.” The bone towers’ tremble at recognition is a strong environmental response that mirrors thematic stakes without slipping into clumsy symbolism. There is minor reliance on visual/auditory channels over other senses, but the selectivity feels purposeful and voice-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    The herbalist’s underground garden is vividly and economically realized—bioluminescent vines, labeled pots of “Patience” and “Regret,” floating books and teacups—and the environment is not mere backdrop but an active field where gravity and time misbehave. Setting details consistently track with Elara’s expertise and the story’s physics: the vines dim and flicker as the arrowhead hums, gravity “hiccups,” and the garden dissolves into auroras at the climax. The recurring vines in particular charge the final image when they chime in resonance with Elara’s laughter. There is a dense, almost baroque layer of description, but it generally serves texture and concept rather than stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.0)
    The enchanted orchard and statues are vivid, specific, and constantly active in the scene: their patrol, freezing, weeping dew, and becoming gardeners all shape what’s possible. Environmental details (sky-bridge height, metallic apples, marble sentinels) are never postcard-only; they evolve in response to the music. Recurring objects from the setting (apples, statues, bridge) directly charge the final image of the offered apple and her departure. The world’s rules (mechanical pulse vs organic resurgence) feel coherent and organically revealed.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, textured, and integral: the disputed territory, cobalt arcade, neon, and drone lattice all feel specific while shaping options (basement vents, rigged power grid, skylight launch). Environmental rules—drones avoid weather anomalies, Marla’s grid mimics storms—are woven into action rather than dumped as exposition. The atmosphere of brittle, electric quiet mirrors the precariousness of their mission and charges the final image of the storm reaching the child. A slight tendency toward lushness over tactility in a few lines is the only thing keeping this from an even higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned circus train and half-built carousel are rendered with rich, selective sensory detail (ivy, moss-swallowed wheels, faded murals, caramel ghosts) that feel both specific and thematically charged. The environment isn’t just backdrop: it dictates his available actions (exploring car to car, working with old wood and gears) and directly charges the final image of the carousel turning under the halo fragment. The setting’s tone—ruin as “cathedral of whimsy” and “reliquary of joy”—beautifully mirrors the story’s concern with salvaging neglected beauty. A slight tendency toward descriptive density in places keeps this from feeling absolutely flawless, but it’s publishably strong.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is striking and specific—the “scientific poetry library” with equations as sonnets and “Non-Euclidean Lullabies” is both vivid and thematically keyed. Environmental details (Restricted Stacks, hyperbolic tessellation scroll, amphitheater of pulsing story-cores) are integrated into action and world logic rather than functioning as static backdrop. The scarf as a recurring object functions as a kind of micro-setting, charging both the portal scene and the final return. The one limitation is that the environment mostly enables rather than constrains choice; it shapes possibility but rarely boxes her in.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    The whispering archipelago, tide-timed ferries, stilted library outposts, and fog-choked coves are vivid and sensorially rich, with details filtered through the librarian’s work and obsessions. Setting is not mere backdrop: the geography and light conditions (double sunrise, northernmost jetty, precise dawn hues) directly constrain her methods and make the climax possible. The watercolor palette as a light-tool functions as micro-setting, returning charged in the final image when she closes it “not to store, but to savor.” Atmosphere is impeccably aligned with theme—salty, liminal, and quietly haunted without slipping into generic fantasy décor.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and tonally integrated: “shadowed nexus under starlight,” “arch of fractured moonstone,” and the door of “shadow and starlight” all feel coherent and sensuous. Environmental details are filtered through the quest (cosmic dust, lullabies, mirrors of fear), and recurring objects (door, ribbons, stars) charge the atmosphere and final image. The world rules (cosmic threads, memory-vault) are consistently implied through action rather than exposition. The only limit is that the environment rarely constrains tactics; it shapes mood more than choice.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    The greenhouse-and-wrecks environment is richly specific and wholly integrated with the premise: glass panes refracting undersea light, kelp and rust, iron ship “sentinels” all function as more than décor. World rules (the orchard luring ships, feeding on rupture) are learned via setting details and stay consistent. The micro-setting of the distorted skylight and broken constellations directly shapes her experiment and charges the final image. There’s no slack description; nearly every detail reinforces atmosphere or mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    The forgotten library, fractured skylight, trapped shadow, and empty swing are not decor but active constraints on meaning and choice. The rules of the place—the listening hush, the breathing building, the exile mechanic—are learned entirely through embodied interactions. The final image (shadow held, swing moving) is inseparable from the physical environment and could not be transplanted elsewhere without breaking the story. Sensory and spatial details are precise, economical, and consistently filtered through the archivist’s ritualized, professional gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is lush and purposeful: the mossy parapet, the waterfall, and the thin veil between worlds are not mere decoration but define what is possible here (“this place… was a seam”). Environmental details are consistently filtered through Elira’s craft and purpose, tying space to theme and action. The final image of the parapet shimmering and the seam knitting tighter shows the environment directly charging the closure. Vivid, economical, and integrated at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prism sanctuary under starlight is vividly rendered and integrated: prisms bend light into “liquid whispers” and later dim and pulse in response to the dangerous knot, so the environment isn’t mere backdrop. The net, cedar chest, lavender, and river stones extend setting into tactile micro-setting that grounds the abstract premise. Atmosphere and world rules feel consistent, and the final image of altered starlight charges the closure. Detail density is high but purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and purposeful: the rain-scoured fresco vault, weeping arches, moss, and henge all echo and deepen the story’s concern with erosion, memory, and silence. Environmental details are filtered through her professional/ethical attentiveness, making the world feel inhabited rather than touristic. The vault, stones, map tear, and altar-shadow directly charge the final image, with the yarrow sprig functioning as a precise, earned threshold token. Description is dense but mostly controlled, integrating atmosphere with thematic and emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    The environments—the sunken library, abyssal trench, sterile lab, and wind-swept cliff—are vivid, selective, and charged, with the snow globe functioning as a micro-setting that dominates the narrative’s physics and mood. The forgotten library and trench frame the artifact with an eerie, curated silence, while the lab sequences translate that awe into controlled, empirical scrutiny. The cliffside setting materially shapes the final choice (to drop vs. open her hands) and the closing image of the globe floating into a silver helix, so place and object jointly charge the resolution. A slight overreliance on conceptual rather than tactile detail in the lab prevents this from quite reaching absolute top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “misty courtyard above clouds” with its liminal, storm-adjacent atmosphere is vivid, and the ivy-choked terminal and rain-slick stone all feel sensorially concrete and thematically apt. Setting is not postcard-static: fog, lanterns, and the terminal’s glow actively respond to the song, charging the climax and final images. The bolt plate functions as a micro-setting/tool that mediates between body and machine, and it is crucial in the communion beat. World rules (gravity, ghost-in-code, graffiti-encoding) are consistently handled within a lyrical, lightly speculative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    The icebound spire, elevator shaft, frost, and cloud-sea are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through her perceptions, giving the piece a strong, immersive atmosphere. Setting details (floors, pressure hiss, wind at the peak) track cleanly and mirror her inner ascent from grief to acceptance. The goggles as a recurring tool-object tie into the environment effectively, especially as lenses refracting scattered light. However, the setting rarely constrains her options in a tactical sense; it mostly functions as resonant backdrop rather than a true pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sky gondola, cold telescope lens, “wicker floor dusted with starlight,” and valley below produce a vivid, coherent micro-setting. Environment and tools are filtered through her professional and emotional lens, so weather and altitude are never generic. The gondola’s fraying cables and suspension between earth and heaven quietly constrain options and charge the liminal, grief-straddling tone of the ending. The recurring telescope-as-tool and gondola-as-threshold meaningfully charge the final image when she lowers the telescope and remains aloft under watching stars.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tree-trunk library is vividly realized through bark-worn shelves, moss-crusted doors, and hollowed living wood, and these specifics integrate tightly with her tactile perception and painting on the ceiling. Environment isn’t just backdrop: the bark itself is the canvas, the demolition machinery outside constrains time, and the smell and damp tang of old paper and wood charge the final image. The coin functions as a micro-setting object that guides action, making the cosmos physically legible through touch. Overall, the setting’s specificity and integration are strong enough that changing it would materially alter the story’s logic and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    The antique airship, stranded luminance, and bird murmurations are rendered with rich, specific detail that consistently filters through Arlen’s observing mind. Setting is not mere backdrop: the balloon’s enchantments, the chalk on teak deck, and the view through portholes all directly enable or constrain tactics and ultimately define the method of controlling luminance. The final image—chalk route on deck beneath a sky alive with wings and wonder—feels strongly charged by these recurring environmental elements. A slight tendency toward density of metaphor is the only thing holding this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “frozen library above clouds” and the Hall of Mirrors are vividly realized and consistently filtered through her craft-focused perception (gears, keyholes, phases of the moon). Environment and objects (the icy statues, glacial glass pedestal, mirrors, staircase of ice) all feed tone and ultimately charge the final image of gears embedded in the ceiling keeping time “for no one but the echoes.” The world feels coherent and lived-in without exposition dumps. The setting shapes mood and meaning more than it constrains concrete options, which keeps it just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vividly original and carefully textured—floating arches, upside‑down trees, violet root-vein sidewalks, Glass Canopy, and nebula all feel coherent and sense-rich. Environment does more than decorate: the failing orchard and the arches define both the need to move and the physical path to the nebula, while the bell and butterflies are embedded tools. World rules (ghost tears, bell summoning memory of water) are consistent enough to trust. Description is dense but generally purposeful, supporting mood and theme rather than stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    The hidden lighthouse, pane of hush, frozen sea, and inward-turned beacon are vividly realized and deeply integrated into the premise, not just scenery. The environment genuinely charges and shapes the story: the tower houses the chronometer, focuses the “inward” beacon, and becomes the final structure to dissolve. Small environmental shifts (stairs groaning, hush thickening, sea and gulls freezing) track the ritual’s progress and reinforce mood and stakes. This is near-elite work; it stops just short of higher scores because the lighthouse, while apt, could be swapped for another liminal tower with modest adjustments.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and distinctive—the shale switchbacks, brass-winged birds, silver-sapped willow, and frost-feathered branches build a coherent, texturally rich world. Environment and rules meaningfully constrain choices: the labyrinth twists under the curse, safe corridors come from the blueprint, frost is a ticking constraint, and birds monitor overt disturbances, justifying his subtle “impressions without touching.” These elements all feed the final image of him in the central grove as frost settles, so the world directly charges closure. Detail is dense but rarely feels touristic or extraneous.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ravine, river, foam, and canyon walls are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through her chemist-musician lens (braided walls as DNA; foam patterns as score). Setting isn’t just backdrop; it structures the thematic logic (braiding/divergence/confluence) and charges the final images of the chrysalis swept away and the ravine fading in her rearview as a returning musical theme. The micro-setting (tributaries, slick stones, trailhead, sun “through cloud-gauze”) evolves alongside her internal arc. While the environment doesn’t physically constrain her tactics much, it deeply shapes interpretation and closure, which is appropriate for this lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “glass orchard library floating upon a swirling sea of clouds” is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through the story’s logic (glass petals, crystalline branches, clouds swallowing myths). Setting choices echo the premise of beginnings and unwritten stories, and the environment actively charges key images (moonlight refracting in the incisions, shelves shifting to accommodate silence). The world rules feel stable enough despite their surrealism; we learn them through use, not exposition. The setting doesn’t quite constrain tactics, but it’s inseparable from the story’s mood and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is richly imagined and integral: the rain-changed desert fortress and subterranean coral pavilion both enable and constrain action (puddles as portals, hoarfrost underfoot, cold that shapes her ordeal). Sensory detail is specific and filtered through her memory-taster’s perspective, especially in taste metaphors and water imagery. The environment actively participates in the transformation (pavilion thawing, fortress renewed), charging the final images. It’s very strong, only narrowly shy of perfection due to occasional density verging on decorative rather than strictly pressure-linked.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is rich, specific, and thematically integrated: the astronomical clock, brass dials, memory core, and creaking grain elevator all feel lived-in and purposeful. Environmental features actively shape tactics—the tower’s acoustics, the cuckoo weight, and starlight-reflecting dials are used as tools, not scenery. The final image of the tower anchored by the weight and the repurposed silo as stage charges the earlier details with resonance. This is highly publishable-level atmosphere with only slight risk of sensory overload.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    The moonlit canyon is vivid and specific—“canyon’s throat,” wind in juniper, owls calling “in binary hoots,” sage and shale—and the mirror functions as a charged micro-setting/tool. The environment is not mere backdrop; it frames her as an “archeologist of abandoned dreams,” makes the excavation metaphor literal, and the canyon’s “breath” and “whispering resonance” entwine with the entangled-memory conceit. The final images—horizon shimmering, moonlight like liquid mercury, canyon exhaling—clearly charge the closure and recast the space as collaborator in her transformation. While the canyon doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, it strongly shapes the psychological stakes and thematic field.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.5)
    The serpentine grotto, inverted gravity, phosphorescent moss, and threshold effects are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action (e.g., the rising water curtain, upside-down bridge). Setting rules are internally consistent and directly shape her path and discoveries. The environment also charges the final image—the sealed chamber, the snapped-back gravity—so place and physics matter to closure, not just atmosphere. At times description borders on lush excess, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    The siskin alder grove, roots, poles, and porcelain are rendered with tactile, specific detail that feels integral rather than decorative. Environment directly shapes the action: the insulator’s origin, the choice of specific alder, and the grove’s awakening as participatory music all hinge on place. The setting and recurring objects (insulator, hedgehog, roots) charge the final image and enact the theme rather than merely symbolizing it. This is publish-ready landscape work with clear POV filtering.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and texturally rich: magnetic nexus, twilight hues, auroras, basalt stone, and humming fields all filter through his chess-tuned perception. World rules (magnetic surge at eclipse, old scholars’ oaths) are consistent and folded into his reflection. The nexus and stone meaningfully charge the final image, though the environment doesn’t quite constrain his choice so much as metaphorically frame it. Overall, atmosphere is a major strength and feels publishable at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    The workshop and star-vaulted night are richly specific and tightly filtered through Elara’s priorities (tuning forks, jars of petrified silence, copper coils). Environmental elements actively charge the stakes: the fireworks and “screaming stars” oppose her sacred quiet, while the tools enable her method. The final image of the raging sky versus the still workshop crystallizes the thematic contrast between noise and preserved silence. Description flirts with lushness but stays purposeful and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    The treetop village and suspended greenhouse are rendered with lush, specific detail—rope bridges, canopies, moss, and scent-driven atmosphere all feel lived-in and particular to Elira’s perception. The environment dovetails with theme: a village literally swaying in the wind mirrors the sought “stillness within motion,” and the final image of Virelai swaying “with wildflower hush” charges the closure. While the setting lightly influences behavior (her climb, the high greenhouse), it rarely constrains choices in a concrete way. The strength here is tonal and imagistic rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is rich, specific, and fully integrated: inverted gravity, floating rock arches, dew-trails, mist, and bio-resonant tech failure all shape what she can do and how she moves. Environmental constraints (the inversion hour, upward-pooling water, arches to skim and land on) directly channel her tactics and opportunities. The Grandmother Canopy and the arrow fusing into its bark explicitly charge the final image with setting-inflected meaning. A slight pullback from maximal score comes from the sheer descriptive density occasionally edging toward aesthetic display rather than additional constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    The port’s container labyrinth is vividly realized and tightly bound to the premise: shifting stacks create microclimates that plausibly generate “impossible” gusts. Details like “rusted steel walls forty feet high,” “salt-crusted gravel,” and precise wind behaviors are filtered through a professional eye, avoiding tourist cataloguing. Environment actively constrains and shapes the danger (repositioned crane, re-routed drafts), and the wind–maze system quietly governs every choice. The setting also charges the final image, where he moves deeper into the maze to confront a place that literally “trains” the air.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ice cavern and aurora are exquisitely realized, with tactile, chromatic specificity (“cathedral arches and frozen chandeliers,” glacial prism bell, blizzard outside) that deeply color the piece. Environment is not mere backdrop; the cavern’s acoustics, frozen laughter, and cracking ice actively respond to her actions and charge the final image of her stepping into the storm with hush inside her. World rules (sound as color, ice as memory) stay consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition. The only ceiling limiter is that the setting shapes meaning and mood more than it constrains concrete choices.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Thunder-echo Range, ghost delta, cracked amphitheater, and between-place are vividly realized and tightly filtered through her work: driftwood, leylines, and wind’s memory all matter to what she does. The setting and key objects (flute, driftwood compass) actively charge the final image of the abandoned monument and deepened canyon hush. Environmental logic stays consistent and tactile, and the silence/echo motif entwines atmosphere with method. It stops just short of perfection because the environment constrains mood and ritual more than it directly constrains a hard tactical choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    The topaz workshop, amber glow, vault of vanishing stars, and halo fragment are rendered with striking specificity and integrated into action (typesetting, experiments, pamphlet production) rather than as backdrop. The environment actively charges the final image: the vanishing of the last star, the dimming halo, and her exit into literal and figurative darkness are inseparable from setting. World rules around “celestial recession” and the halo’s geometry of emotion remain consistent enough to feel lived-in, not arbitrary. The lushness occasionally borders on decorative, but it still serves tone and motif more than it stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the aurora-lit ridgeway, Hollow Market, moth-wing canopy, and lanterns all filter through the courier’s sensibility and mirror her inner shifts. The ridgeway and sky literally influence choices (the auroral glyphs nudge her toward the Market), and the pendant functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image when released back into the sky. World rules (relics, drowned oracle breath, Archive of Whispers) are sketched with economical specificity that supports tone and stakes without infodump. Environment and recurring object together meaningfully charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    The quartz arbor, mist, car, frost, and prism form a vivid, coherent micro-world filtered through her sensibility, and sensory detail is purposeful rather than touristic. The environment does more than decorate: the arbor amplifies the communion, the car’s placement and frost are functional constraints, and the final image of the prism on the windowsill pays off the object-as-setting motif. Weather and surfaces (frost, quartz, glass) subtly mirror the thematic concern with stored and released emotion. It stops just short of 9-band because the arbor itself, while atmospheric, doesn’t strongly constrain her choices beyond mood and amplification.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    The forgotten orchard and bamboo forest are vividly, specifically rendered, and their isolation justifies the absence of normal routes of communication and the reliance on ritual/magic. The loom, trees, dew, and bead act as a micro-setting that constrains her tactics and then powerfully charge the final images. The contrast with the “city of glass towers and silent screens” adds an effective atmospheric and thematic counterpoint without muddying geography. Description is rich but usually purposeful, maintaining spatial and tonal coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    The orchard planet with floating arches and humming mine shafts is richly imagined and tightly woven into every layer of the story. Environmental specifics—roots dangling through arches, the shafts’ residual magic, the silk as a mined remnant—are filtered through Arlo’s working attention and recur in the closing image when arches “hum” with returned magic. Setting not only decorates but charges the stakes and final reweighting of the world’s magic. This is near–publish-ready worldbuilding in both texture and functional integration.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid and purpose-driven: the abandoned repair bay as “cathedral of silence” and its pristine Sigma-7 counterpart do real thematic work around loss, divergence, and erasure. Details (oily floor like braille, dust motes as ghosts of engines, automatons that ignore her because she never existed there) are filtered through Elira’s sensory bias and reinforce her vocation. The green shard functions as a micro-setting/tool that constrains how she moves between worlds and charges the final image when it cools in the ruined bay. Environment and recurring objects clearly shape options and reweight the ending, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coastal town, haunted lighthouse, rusted stairs, and cairn window are vivid and integrated with Elias’s perceptions and actions. The lantern room’s darkness and later glow, plus the cairns and sea glass, all charge the emotional stakes rather than sitting as décor. The environment nudges rather than strongly constrains choices, which keeps this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    The emerald lighthouse, storm-wrapped cliffs, and post-print world are vividly and economically rendered, with strong sensory and conceptual specificity (“neural streams,” “libraries grown from coral”). Setting is deeply fused with function: her altitude, the storm, and the lantern’s glow all embody her role as liminal navigator between data-drowned world and myth. The environment charges the final image—shadow stretching across the tower’s crown, emerald stone, and sea-sigh—though it doesn’t quite constrain discrete tactical choices. Overall, the atmosphere is rich, coherent, and central to the story’s effect.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating rock tea house above valley mist, tethered by silk ropes to “nothing but belief,” is a striking, specific environment that perfectly matches the story’s contemplative, liminal mood. Setting details (mist, moss-carved ledge, sun trails, silk) are not postcard flourishes; they’re tightly integrated with her practice and the final charged image of mist curling “like a question.” The blue morpho wing and tea house together function as micro-setting, shaping what she can do (observe light, watch patrons) and how revelation arrives. The world’s rules are fantastical but consistent and learned through her attention rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is exceptionally integrated: the stormlit tower, moonlight, and forest are not just decorative but actively enable key beats (the sextant heals only in moonlight; the forest houses the witnessed sorrows). Sensory detail is selective and vivid—“damp stone,” “rain-slicked parchment,” “forest… exhaling mist”—and always filtered through her workmanlike yet reverent gaze. The sextant and the trees function as micro-settings that constrain action and charge the final image. Environment and recurring objects clearly reweight the last moments, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is richly imagined and specific: mica panes hoarding dawn, an alchemical citrus tree with runes, dew-lit moss with trapped starlight, all filtered through the keeper’s sensibility. Environment meaningfully constrains and charges events—the hoarded light behind mica defines the problem, her climb and touch of the window are tactical, and the greenhouse/orchard physically responds to the renewed song. The endless night and captured dawn are not postcard backdrops but the mechanical and emotional frame for the story’s stakes. A small trim of descriptive density in the back half could sharpen impact, but the world rules feel consistent and integral.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    The library is vivid and singular—owls reading clocks, truth-creaking floorboards, paradox shelves—and always filtered through Elira’s sensibility. Setting is not mere backdrop: it functions as sanctuary, crucible, and mirror for her paradox of presence/absence, and the Paradox shelf specifically anchors both inciting discovery and closing reconfiguration. The secret-society/derelict-archive duality strengthens the “hidden in plain sight” motif that underpins her own status. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, it clearly charges the final images of the reordered shelf and dawn arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is richly specific and fully embodied: the overgrown palace courtyard, crumbling archway, cracked fountain, and secret tea house are all filtered through her sensibility. Environment directly shapes action—she moves slowly over moss, hides within ivy and wisteria, plants seeds in flagstone cracks and by the dry basin—and charges the final image with the hidden spring’s drip. The recurring objects (bread, fountain, lanterns, cracked teacup) are spatially coherent and thematically loaded without feeling like museum pieces. Atmosphere and place are inseparable from character and theme, and the world feels tactile rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    The frozen library above the clouds is richly and precisely realized—frosted marble, rime-glazed shelves, crystalline dome, glacial chandeliers—and these elements are consistently filtered through Elira’s reverent, professional gaze. Environment shapes both image and action: cold air fogs her breath, tears freeze, the ice shifts and groans, and the twilight shaft at the end recharges the now-spent slide as a benediction. The library’s altitude and cold also thematically echo the edge-of-oblivion premise, so setting is not mere backdrop. A slight functional constraint—e.g., the cold making the work riskier—would push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    The pirate market under the pier is vivid and specific—glow-worm gin, bottled ghosts, singing eels—yet details are filtered through her tactical needs (noise as cover, shadows as concealment). The environment actively shapes choices: crowd density and ambient sound allow her to edge closer; the “truce of hush” and tide-imperiled secrets charge the stakes and the time limit. The recurring object (watch fob) functions as a micro-setting tool, physically bridging the gap between conspirators and catalyzing memory. The final image of her retreating into the dark while sunrise inevitably approaches is tonally and thematically charged by the setting rather than merely picturesque.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lavender bluff, aurora, mycelial voting forests, and microclimate weather all feel vivid, specific, and integrated into the logic of events. The ring and taste mechanism, and the way the storm dissolves into soil and lavender, charge the final images with grounded specificity. World rules (e.g., taste codes, forest democracy) are introduced through action rather than exposition dumps and stay internally consistent. The one restraint is that the bluff itself doesn’t materially constrain her choices; it frames tone more than it pressures tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vivid and specific—“auroral sorrow,” indigo/violet walls, millennia of fallen geodes—and its glow both illuminates and functions as living canvas. The environment isn’t just backdrop: the cave “remembers imprisonment,” resonates with the lock, houses the portraits, and its dimming at the end materially charges the closure image. Details are filtered through her artistic sensibility, which keeps them purposeful rather than touristic. The only limit is that physical constraints of the cave (danger, navigation, etc.) remain abstract; it shapes mood and ritual more than concrete options.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    The greenhouse city under a toxic sky is vividly and economically rendered, with specific details like hydroponic towers, ghost vines, and condensation-sticky floorboards that feel lived-in rather than touristic. Environment does constrain and guide action: she follows vents and atriums, the city’s “ambient untruths” physically sap her, and the physical architecture determines where the lost conversations pool. The toxic sky and dried oasis thematically mirror scarcity of truth without feeling like blunt allegory. The recurring environmental pressures charge the final image of the oasis refilling with “truth, drop by drop.”

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: the “whispering bluff above the clouds,” wind, hollow stone, and kinetic sculpture all shape what is possible, from wind-powered chimes to tourist absence. Environmental details are consistently filtered through the tuner’s craft-focused perception, avoiding tourist-catalog description. The iceberg fragment functions as both object and micro-setting, its responses to weather and emotion charging multiple beats and the final image. While the landscape doesn’t force difficult tactical choices, it meaningfully conditions the story’s premise and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    The desert rose farm, glass dome, crimson sand, and planetary magnetic shift are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the emotional arc—the environment is not backdrop but mirror and constraint. The dome and external storm shape tactics (the farm is failing; the caretaker must stabilize from within) and the final image of petals rooting in the sand directly reweights the premise. World rules (miniaturized fears, bioglass roses, magnetic interference) are learned through action, not exposition dumps, and stay consistent. Setting clearly charges the closing image and choice, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    The courtyard, jasmine, birds, and iron gate are vivid without excess, and the shop name “The Listening Post” economically ties setting to concept. The mailbox functions as a micro-setting constraint—its locked, keyhole-less design forces Elara’s method of waiting rather than prying. The shift to Cedar Hollow and back is clear and spatially coherent. The final seashell-in-mailbox image effectively charges the environment with ongoing, communal magic.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sunken laboratory, algae-lit trench, drones blind below 37°C, coolant vents, and submersible bay are concrete and consistently exploited for tactics and mood. Environmental rules (temperature sensors, flooding as veil not just threat) shape what Elira can do and how she hides and misleads. Detail is selective yet rich, always filtered through her code/dance perspective rather than reading as a static tour. The final flooding and the capsules surfacing cap the setting’s role by charging the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integral: beached whale at dawn, salt crystal growing chamber under the pier, fluctuating gravity all shape both atmosphere and metaphysics. Environmental details are filtered through Elira’s trained attention (tidal charts, neural pathways, sedimentary gravity) and recur at the end when salt crystals chime and the whale’s bones glow, charging the closure image. The world rules around gravity pockets and salt as a medium for memory are coherent and learned via action, not exposition dumps. The setting is not a backdrop; it actively defines how memory can be stored and accessed.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    The nocturnal haven, brook, moonlight, and stars are vividly realized and consistently filtered through the summoner’s sensibility (“water’s murmur flowed not as sound but as texture”). Setting actively participates in the magic: the brook bears the wing, voices the whisper, and receives the stars’ listening, and the final image depends on this environment. While the place doesn’t heavily constrain choices beyond being the ritual locus, it clearly charges and shapes the closure. Sensory specificity is rich without devolving into a tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rooftop garden and meteor shower are atmospheric and purposeful, not postcard—meteors as “fleeting silver scars” and the garden’s final “sigh” both frame and charge the emotional turn. Setting is consistently filtered through her sensibility (moss, flagstones, gargoyles, humming walls) and integrates with the core conceit of buildings as linguistic beings. The building as environment constrains and promises future choices (the basement vault, the sentient walls) and is essential to the final image. A touch more interaction between weather/architecture and immediate tactics could have pushed this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “velvet garden,” willow, and moss are vividly realized and tightly tied to function: it is where “memories go to be quarantined” and where the shell is both discovered and left as an anchor. Sensory detail (damp earth, jasmine, salt-and-ozone) is lush but mostly purposeful, mirroring internal states without feeling like a mere backdrop. The environment constrains the ritual—this is the site and technology of archiving—and the final image of the garden holding its breath charges the closure. A hair’s breadth from 9+ mainly because setting shapes tone and ritual more than concrete tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sanctuary, marble, aurora, stalactites, quartz pedestal, and mother-of-pearl veins are richly particular and filtered through her ritual mindset, producing a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting is not merely decorative: the seamless marble vault, comet-glass key, and dripping stalactites as a time-constraint all shape what she can do and when. Environmental changes (aurora flaring, fissures of light, sanctuary trembling) track directly with the scroll’s resistance and release, charging the climax. The final image of the thorn taking root in marble elegantly fuses place, object, and thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.5)
    The canyon, serpentine nexus, starlight, and petrified willow are vividly realized and tonally unified, giving a strong, mystical sense of place. The setting is not just backdrop: the canyon’s grief-laden acoustics explain the entity’s choice of lair, and the nexus becomes the necessary site of confrontation and resolution. The seashell as recurring, charged object functions as a micro-setting, especially in the final image when it falls silent. Environmental constraint is present but could be sharpened further (her tactics do not visibly change in response to specific physical constraints of the space).

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glacier shrine is exceptionally vivid—“candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice,” “borrowed starlight,” blue-veined walls—and the snow globe as micro-setting is tightly fused to the story’s emotional and metaphysical logic. Environment isn’t just decorative: the ice window literally becomes the vessel that reframes and contains the ghost’s echo, charging the final image. Details are selective and purposeful, reinforcing the tone and theme without straying into worldbuilding dump. Setting directly shapes the closure, which is a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integral: rain-slick parapet, moss, harbor lanterns, and fireflies all shape the mood and her actions (bare feet on stone, chalk washed away, footprints fading). Environmental details are filtered through her sensibility as a net-mender and philosopher, so setting and character perception reinforce each other. The bamboo whisk functions as a micro-setting/tool that charges the final image, embodying quiet, sustaining labor. Weather and season (post-rain, firefly time) actively affect what is possible to witness, pushing this into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    The wasteland orchard is vivid and specific—irradiated soil, glowing blossoms, gamma winds, bees with “hymns older than radiation.” Setting isn’t decorative: the poisoned world versus thriving stillpoints underpins the premise, and the environment literally reacts when she plants the diamond (dust storm clears, air stills). The final images—the orchard exhaling, petals drifting, the softened wind carrying blossom-scent into the wasteland—charge the thematic stakes of regeneration and truth. World rules (resonant crystals, radiation transmutation) stay internally consistent and are shown through action rather than dumped as exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.3)
    The observatory, storm, and cobalt glass portico are richly realized and strongly filtered through Elira’s perceptions; lightning, glass, and static recur with thematic weight. Setting is not just backdrop: the storm’s “veil” function and the portico’s harmonic lattice materially enable the climactic broadcast. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful without devolving into a mere catalog. This is close to top-tier, but the environment could constrain her options or impose danger more sharply to hit a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dunes, salt-wind, “feral loft,” winter ice, and smuggler’s-cache history create a vivid, lived-in environment that’s tonally perfect for the story’s loneliness and memory-work. Setting details are selective and purposeful—sea, wind, and loft recur as structural elements rather than postcard backdrop. Crucially, the environment charges the final image: jars that hum when the wind blows reframe the whole practice as part of the landscape’s ongoing music. While the setting doesn’t often constrain tactical choices beat by beat, its integration with tone and closure is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    The drift-ice marina, lighthouse interior, and Heartstone chamber are rendered with strong sensory specificity and a clear spatial logic. Environment repeatedly shapes action: she must match her steps to the ice’s song, descend the bioluminescent stair, and mediate vibrations in a fragile chamber over liquid mercury. The setting’s rules (sound as physical pressure, ice responding to resonance) remain internally consistent and directly charge the final image of a pacified sea and glowing stone. Description is lush yet mostly purposeful, integrated into action rather than pausing it.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly rendered and recur as functional tools rather than mere backdrop. Setting actively shapes the method (mapping on ice, lunar alignment of the viaduct) and charges the ending image when thaw approaches. Environmental details (hoarfrost, storm-bruised sky, lunar reflection) are tightly tied to tone and theme. The final contrast between ice groaning with thaw and her continued mapping lets the environment participate in the story’s reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    The subway maintenance tunnel, post-drought damp, and the lantern function as more than backdrop: moisture as “whispered confessions,” reverberating walls, and dripping runoff all mirror and house the trapped memories. Setting is sensorially rich across sight, sound, smell, and touch, and is always filtered through her professional and historical lens rather than as a neutral catalog. Crucially, the tunnel and lantern charge the final image—she leaves the lantern as an “anchor,” softening reverberations—so environment and object directly shape the resolution. It falls just shy of 9-band only because the physical constraints of the tunnel never force a hard tactical choice beyond mood and symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    The shop environment and its tools are vividly realized and constantly filtered through Elias’s perception (“silent ballerinas and frozen lullabies,” lemon oil, tarnished brass). The setting isn’t decorative: the unfinished toymaker’s work, Mrs. Lin’s workspace, and the bench where the light falls all directly shape his options and the eventual insight. The music box and its heart function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image of him walking into the clearing sky. World details stay consistent and tonally apt without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is richly specific and deeply integrated: acid sea, floating workshop, brass wings, and the Yearning Engine all feel lived-in and mechanically plausible for this world. Environment does apply some pressure (acid waves slapping the underbelly, need for acid-resistant modifications) and the bell tower on the roof charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid without sliding into incoherence, and filtered nicely through Zeta’s mechanic-mind bias. A slightly clearer moment where the physical environment directly constrains a tactical choice would push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    The archive setting is vivid, specific, and thematically loaded: server racks as mausoleums, frosted glass, decommissioned AI cores, ghost pixels and latency as physical hints of the dead. The Helios-7 patch functions as a charged object that anchors place, history, and the final image on her sleeve. Environmental details feed the logic of the haunting—deleted content “unraveling into the substrate” and existing in hums, pulses, and silences—so the world’s rules feel coherent. The only reason this doesn’t reach the very top band is that the environment rarely constrains her tactics explicitly; it mostly provides atmosphere and conceptual logic.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes is vivid and consistently used: beam, mirrors, skeletal trees, and groaning ice all recur and evolve. Setting isn’t mere backdrop; the beam enables her practice, the ice’s shifting culminates in “possibility” and “hidden channels,” and the orchard’s height marks the peak beat. Details stay filtered through her task and mood, avoiding tourist catalog. The environment clearly charges the final image even if it doesn’t impose hard physical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    The drift-ice marina and surrounding Arctic world are vividly rendered (“floes still groaned like old bones,” “violet auroras”) and tightly filtered through Elara’s listening obsession. Environment constrains action—black ice causes the fall that triggers the chime; the floe enables her drift and isolation; the cold nearly kills her—and charges the final rescue image. The heirloom parasol functions as a micro-setting object, bridging marina, floe, and later hospital spaces. A slight pullback is that once she’s adrift, the physical mechanics of survival on the floe are compressed in favor of mood, softening some situational immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.9)
    The vineyard, pavilion, oak, and autumn weather are vividly rendered and consistently threaded through action and theme (frost-sweet grapes, mismatched vines on a post). The amber pavilion and distant station frame the sense of isolation and possibility, charging the final image of her silhouette and the whistle. Setting is clearly filtered through Elias’s vineyard-trained eye, which keeps details purposeful rather than touristic. The environment mirrors and deepens the emotional stakes more than it constrains concrete choices, which holds it just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    The murmuring pavilion, petrified vines, dunes, and buried parapet are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through her ritualistic attention. Setting and atmosphere are not mere backdrop; the pavilion’s murmur, the parapet’s hum, and the jealous dunes all modulate and mirror the ritual’s progress. Environmental elements charge the final image—the invisible clearings, the wind bearing whispers—and make the consecration feel spatially anchored. The only limit is that the setting constrains mood and meaning more than concrete tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lavender field behind rusted factory ruins is vividly rendered and thematically apt, with details like chimney swifts, vines, and cricket-song doing real atmospheric work. The environment mirrors the story’s preoccupation with decay becoming ground for growth, and the final image of the gray case gilded by sun in the lavender is strong. However, the setting rarely constrains her choices or tactics; it is an expressive backdrop more than an active pressure. This keeps it just short of the highest band where environment must more directly shape action or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    The library, dawn light, dust, and sonic architecture are vividly rendered and always filtered through her acoustic, archival obsessions. The environment is not backdrop: vaulted ceilings, shelves, and the crystal’s acoustics are integral to her method and to the charged final image (“The library exhaled”). World details like “after the last dictionary” and “Great Quiet” are suggestive without over-explanation. Setting strongly charges the mood and the closure without ever lapsing into a static tour.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.1)
    The junkyard fog sculpture garden, driftwood, tapes, and chalk are integrated with exemplary precision—setting is inseparable from premise. Environment and recurring objects actively constrain and channel his tactics (he must work with fog, driftwood, metal, tapes) and also charge the final image (rocking chair → swing set → nothing, humming chalk). Sensory detail across sight, sound, touch, even taste (“ozone,” “static”) is rich but targeted to the stakes. The world’s slightly uncanny rules remain consistent and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lunar observatory above boiling clouds is vivid, coherent, and integrated: zero gravity affects her tears, the plinth and lenses matter, and the vantage on Earth’s mosaic of moments charges the final image. The spinning hand and camera function as micro-settings/tools that shape action, not just décor. World rules (shaking moon, storming Earth) remain consistent and feed atmosphere without exposition dumps. The environment mostly pressures tone and image more than tactical options, which keeps it just short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “radiant haven above the clouds” and, especially, the recurring “scent of hope” are vividly realized and sensorially rich, charging the atmosphere and final image. Details are selective and purposeful—the air, bread, and hum of peace all mirror her work with the dying in a transformed register. The environment doesn’t significantly constrain choices, but it does meaningfully charge the emotional stakes and the closing hum. Overall, the setting feels integral to tone and theme rather than postcard decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and particular: a nocturnal observatory barnacled under a floating isle, cracked dome from a falling spoon, orrery of a rewired sky. These details are not just decorative; the observatory and orrery are the functional arena where she can test, rewind, and ultimately step through thresholds. The final image of noon casting a shadow “on time itself” shows environment and cosmic rules directly charging the closure. A slight reason this doesn’t hit 9+ is that the “floating isle” aspect itself doesn’t much constrain her choices beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    The garden and hedge maze are vividly, economically realized—roses beside thistles, backward-ticking clocks, cinnamon and ozone—and these details consistently reflect the thematic paradox of repair through contradiction. The setting evolves with action (soil touched, vines stirring, tooth left to root) and directly charges the final image of the garden as communal altar. The environment constrains the mode of action—this is a hidden, ritual space for bone-setting, not confrontation—and the tooth as object-as-setting strongly anchors closure. A slight sense of ornamental density in a few descriptive phrases keeps this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    The serpentine grotto, mist, waterfalls, and condensation are vivid and deeply integrated; the environment literally enables the final prismatic “constellations” and frames the no-fire constraint. Sensory selection (mist like sleeping dragons, damp knees, rock crevices) is specific and filtered through her ritualized attention. The grotto meaningfully constrains tactics—only reflected, refracted light is possible here—and becomes a lived-in cathedral of witness, not just a backdrop. This environment clearly charges the final image without feeling like a mere symbol dump.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    The abandoned data center turned moss cathedral is vivid, sensorial, and tightly fused to theme, from “server racks…swallowed by emerald moss” to “roots threading through circuit boards.” Environment is not mere backdrop; it’s the medium in which she performs her healing, culminating in burying the confession and planning to sow seeds and observe rain patterns. The amber light through cracked glass echoing her pendant in the final image powerfully charges the ending. While the setting does not strongly constrain tactics, it meaningfully shapes the story’s logic and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “feral nexus in mist” and the later pier are vividly realized, with mist, tide, dawn, and gulls all filtered through her artistic consciousness. Setting is not just backdrop; the nexus allows the cameo apparitions, while the pier and tide at the end concretize her new stance (“against the current”). The recurring seashell and water imagery charge the final image and bind world, theme, and action. A slight pullback in descriptive density at a few points might sharpen, rather than blur, the scene’s contours.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.1)
    The verdant arbor, Moonroot vine, and oak-doorway are richly, specifically rendered and fully integrated into action and meaning. Environment is not backdrop: the plant’s response, the hush in birds and river, and the arbor’s ultimate transformation into a living instrument all constrain what Elara can do and charge the final image (“a wreath awaiting the next singer”). World rules stay consistent (music animates memory-bearing wood and root), and the natural/steampunk textures are filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The setting decisively carries tone and theme into the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is a standout: the withered orchard in a subarctic crater, frost, permafrost, and safekept starlight create a highly specific, coherent atmosphere. Environmental features affect action (kneeling on permafrost, blood sizzling on frost, crater geometry aligning constellations) and charge the final image (stars waking, wind through “orchard’s bones,” wolf howl). Details are filtered through her task-focused perception rather than as a neutral tour. The setting could constrain choices even more explicitly, but it already deeply inflects tone and ritual mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    The marble cavern, quartz veins, condensation, and shaft of sun create a vivid, tactile environment that is constantly in play rather than backdrop. Setting directly shapes tactics—he uses stalactites, quartz pulses, and the single shaft of light as instruments in his work—and charges the final image of wonder “fermented in perfect, angular silence.” The environment evolves with events (cracked stalactite, resin slabs, timer at the center) and remains central through the later travelers’ visit. Sensory detail is rich and selective, anchored in his optical/aural obsessions.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bronze grotto, starlight fissure, oxidized walls, and snowmelt drip create a rich, coherent environment that feels lived-in and mythic. Setting is not just decorative: the grotto “remembers,” the magnetic seam and starlight are required for the lamp’s function, and the shelves of burdens literally embody history and theme. The final image of snowmelt as a metronome between salvations beautifully charges the ending. A slight trim of ornamental descriptors could sharpen the sense of physical constraint even further, but the integration is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft, cedar chest, and kettle form a vivid, coherent micro-setting that mirrors Eleanor’s interior and charges the final tableau at the window. Details are selectively chosen (wet cedar, “rust-hued peace,” rain streaking the glass) and filtered through her sensibility, avoiding generic description. The environment lightly shapes action—especially the choice to ignore the kettle and the decision to place the carving in the light—but mainly serves as an atmospheric and thematic echo rather than a hard constraint. It’s lush and purposeful, just shy of using setting as a full-on tactical obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “kinetic lagoon above the clouds” and floating carousel islands are vivid and particular, with tactile details like “salt-crusted planks” and a “rusted calliope” anchoring the surrealism. The environment mirrors the internal state—stalled ascent and circular motion as metaphors for stalled ambition and cyclical regret—without feeling like mere allegorical wallpaper. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical tactics, the central spire and moons frame the climax and inflect the final image. Overall, atmosphere and specificity are excellent and tightly integrated with theme.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned spaceport is vividly and specifically rendered—fractured skylights, sub-level shafts, the geothermal line, baggage belts turned into mural canvases. Environment consistently constrains tactics: the ruin provides both obstacles (cracks, ruptures) and resources (ducts, kiosks, tiles) that enable her redirections. The sextant on the rotunda spire and the warmed concourse charge the final image with place-specific resonance. This is close to top-tier, though a touch more sensory variety beyond the visual and thermal could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is rich, particular, and fully integrated: the subterranean sanctuary, the old observatory, the mossy sundial, and the rain-soaked forecourt all feel tactile and lived in. Environmental elements aren’t postcard details—they interact with action (crystal by sundial after rain; crystal on the chronometer; stained glass moonlight; the clocks’ softened ticks). The final image of light spilling into the sanctuary, gilding dust and brass around the glowing crystal and humming scribe, is strongly charged by the space. A slight trim of overlapping metaphors would keep the atmosphere from occasionally feeling over-saturated.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    The twilight barge canal, rotting pilings, and reeds in a wind “only they could feel” create a vivid, texturally rich environment that mirrors his interior state. The canal and its silted depths are not just backdrop; they concretize the theme of submerged truths and physically enable the salvage of the locket. The sundial and silent radio function as micro-setting elements that meaningfully charge the final image (twin relics of “light” and “loss”). While the environment doesn’t impose hard logistical constraints on his options, it is deeply integrated into the story’s logic and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    The harbor, golden dock, snow, and fog are vividly realized and consistently filtered through her priorities—silence, craft, and relics of storms. Weather and water don’t just decorate; they shape tone and action (she comes “for silence,” fog creates the hush that allows transmission, snow and cold test endurance). The recurring fulgurite and dock imagery charge the final image of her walking away with rope and glass. A slight tendency toward lushness occasionally risks over-saturation but doesn’t blur clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting work is excellent: the shadowed autumn garden, marble nymphs with “lichen tears,” ivy-choked arches, and the damp stone all feel tactile and tonally precise. Environment and object-as-setting (especially the carpet thread) charge the mood and final image more than they constrain physical options, but they meaningfully shape perception and thematic weight. Seasonal and weather details (brittle leaves, frost-like solitude) are specific rather than generic and evolve with the emotional cadence of the scene. The one limiter is that the garden frames and mirrors the traveler’s interior rather than actively altering their tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is richly specific and integrated—the suspended palace, stalactites dripping “mineral tears,” and iron plains below are not postcard details but a constant pressure and mirror of his precarious project. Environmental features evolve with events (quakes, chains groaning, factories’ thunder) and culminate in the first true breeze and ambient birdsong, which reweight the entire world. World rules (mechanical wasteland, extinct birds, acid rain) stay internally consistent and are learned through action. The palace’s instability and vertical isolation subtly charge the final awakening, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dunes, black sand, and obsidian lagoon are not postcard backdrops; they are the medium of the ritual and the carrier of the “wounds sealed under pressure” motif that charges the ending. The volcanic blackness, glassy water, and cloud migration recur and evolve, shaping both images and stakes (legacy as something geologic and submerged rather than ephemeral). The micro-setting of sand on her knees and boots constrains mood and choice, functioning almost as a physical sacrament she carries away. World rules around the lagoon’s subtle magic stay consistent and are learned through her actions rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    The city of forgotten fountains is vividly realized through selective, sensuous detail—dry basins with “pigeon bones,” moss-choked throats, lilac-scented gates—and everything is filtered through the skeptic’s perceptual biases. The fountains aren’t postcard backdrop; they are the mechanism and prison for the memories and directly charge the final image of the first fountain’s single drop. Recurring environmental motifs (water, silence, geese frozen in the sky) evolve meaningfully as the story progresses. The world’s rules—the way memories cling to places and are unpinned—stay internally consistent and are learned through her actions rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    The nebula garden is vividly realized—petals of ionized plasma, veils of violet and ember—and stays tightly integrated to tone and theme. The environment charges the final image: petals slowing “as if listening” and the nebula learning to glow differently mirror the evolved pattern of light. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactics in a practical sense, it functions as a macro-body the character is in dialogue with. Specific sensory details (oil and ozone, rain on metal) are well-chosen and avoid generic SF texture.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse is richly realized and does thematic heavy lifting: stone, soil, glass, and ribbons form a credible ecology of mourning. Recurring objects (ribbon roll, chisel, butterflies, lemon tree, thunder) all charge the atmosphere and directly inflect the final image. The space is not just backdrop; it’s a shared sanctuary with Silas and the site where grief is literally hung, carved, and heard. The only thing holding this shy of 9+ is that the environment influences meaning more than concrete tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal obsidian ridge, salt-wind, and clock tower interior are not just decorative; they’re woven into nearly every paragraph and mirrored in Elias’s psychology (erosion, polishing, tides vs precision). The environment shapes imagery and final action (placing the rake handle on the ridge to be polished into an altar), charging the last image with physical and thematic weight. Sensory detail is rich and filtered through a time-obsessed mind (echoes “not in stone but in bone,” surfaces “slick with brine and memory”). At times the descriptive density edges toward indulgence, but it remains coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    The settings—the moss-kissed graveyard and cobalt silo—are vivid, sensorial, and integrated with the protagonist’s perception and actions. The silo’s curvature, moonlight-drinking walls, and tapestry at its heart all shape what she can do and feel, functioning as a literal and psychic chamber for “uncharted echoes.” Objects-as-setting (the sovereign case, the tapestry, the needle) constrain and channel her choices, then charge the final image when she reemerges to see graves as thresholds. A minor further tying of physical constraints (e.g., the depth, cold, or danger of the silo) to stakes could nudge this into even stronger territory.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is richly particular and filtered through purpose: spire, frozen lake, glacial mist, meteorite ink, and responsive parchment all interlock with theme and action. Environmental details (“ice shifting — a sound like tectonic thought”) do double duty as worldbuilding and conceptual frame, and the tools (quill, parchment, inkwell) literally constrain and enable her work. The final hum of the parchment and pulse of the spire are charged by all that prior material. There is some density of imagery, but it remains coherent and meaning-bearing rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ember alcove, mist, hearthstone, and radio warmth create a striking, coherent atmosphere that feels both cloistered and porous to the outside world. Environmental elements actively matter: the alcove’s embers respond to her tears, the mist marks the world’s famine, and the dial’s heat guides and finally burns her. The setting’s logic remains stable, and the final image—“Somewhere, another alcove would warm”—charges the environment with communal, ongoing consequence. Description is dense but purposeful, rarely lapsing into static postcarding.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Vanishing Point gallery, the rocking chair, the candle, and the mask are sensuously rendered and consistently filtered through the protagonist’s sensibility. Setting is not mere backdrop: the chair’s motion/stillness, the windowless-feeling gallery, and the candle by the portrait all actively charge the final image and embody the “safety vs truth” tension. Spatial and temporal orientation are clear despite the lyric style. The only thing keeping this from the 9-band is that the environment constrains mood and meaning more than concrete tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is rich, specific, and integrated: the “inverted archive,” collapsed aqueduct, submerged bell tower, fungi light, and sunken city ruins all feel tactile and lived in. Environmental details are filtered through his archivist mindset (floodlines as “impatient vines,” sewer-flow as sacred text), which deepens both character and world. The recurring objects/places—sewers vs manholes, bell tower, sundial—directly charge the final contrast with the steel obelisk. The only reason this doesn’t push into 9+ is that setting constrains mood and theme more than it forces concrete tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    The velvet library in autumn is rendered with lush, specific detail—amber light, merlot drapes, dust motes, the maple leaf—that all align with the story’s quiet, reverent mood. Setting is consistently filtered through Elara’s sonic and tactile priorities (the rosette’s grooves, the way velvet “absorbed footsteps”), making the environment feel lived-in rather than decorative. The rosette and the final leaf meaningfully charge the ending image, turning the room into a kind of sanctuary for endangered arts. The limitations are minor: the environment shapes tone more than concrete tactical options, but at this length that trade-off works.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rusted greenhouse is richly specific and omnipresent, from “glass panes fractured but still holding moonlight” to “rust meets root,” and the environment meaningfully shapes what Elara can do (pruning, planting, cleaning panes). Setting details are POV-filtered through a chef of memory, often via scent and taste, which sharpens both tone and character. Crucially, rust, vines, glass, and trellis all charge the final image: the knowledge fruit literally weaves into iron and reframes decay as structure. This integration of place with theme and closure is very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Lightning Collection Tower, salt marshes, humming copper, and gathering storm form a vivid, coherent environment that feels indispensably tied to the premise. The tower and weather literally shape the plot—the drones “migrate” there to drink lightning—and the final image of rain on copper and bees humming is charged by that specificity. Details like pollen-flecked boots and lacquer boxes etched with bees reinforce atmosphere without feeling ornamental. Setting is not just backdrop; it structures the story’s logic and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is a major strength: the bay, reeds, moss-slick stone, and daydreaming streetlights are sensorially vivid and tightly filtered through her ritualistic attention. The environment meaningfully shapes the action and final image—the rock, tide, and salt air are integral to how the shard works and dissolves. Spatial and temporal anchors are clear and consistent, and the vanished cottage’s ghost-geography feels specific rather than generic. The setting also mirrors theme without feeling like blunt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    The underwater city garden is vividly specific—“statuesque orchids bloomed phosphorescent and eels wove through rusted trellises”—and stays tightly integrated with every beat. The environment is not backdrop: the civilization’s choice to dissolve into the sea, the living garden as afterlife, and the statue’s final dissolution into plankton all hinge on this setting. Physical constraints (pressure suit, kelp, water, stone, cracks) subtly guide choices and imagery. The final image of an “animate lifelessness” watching her leave is charged directly by this environment.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    The infinite staircase and void are richly realized through rules (the staircase moves him; landings every 37 steps; carved equations being “digested”) rather than mere description. These environmental properties genuinely constrain and channel his actions, satisfying the micro-setting test. The remembered arcade scene adds just enough concrete contrast without bloating scope. A hair more sensory variety beyond visual and tactile could deepen immersion, but the world logic is strong and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rooftop greenhouse in a smog-choked city is vividly and economically rendered, with details like soot-streaked glass and fire-escape offerings integrating atmosphere with action. The moon, brush, and greenhouse together function as a micro-setting that constrains the ritual (needs moon path, skylight, isolation) and decisively charge the final image of two figures painting under “saffron quiet.” Environmental texture consistently mirrors the thematic tension between toxicity and fragile nurture. A slight check is that the city’s physical pressure on her options remains mostly tonal rather than forcing explicit on-page tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    The grotto city is vividly and specifically rendered—waterfall as thunderous curtain, stalactites like chandeliers, glowing fungi as stage lights—creating a memorable, coherent environment. Setting is not mere backdrop: the hidden city behind a roar of water shapes how art is practiced (alcoves, echo chambers) and how outsiders eventually discover it. The final image of the waterfall “roaring its approval” charges the environment with thematic meaning. Sensory detail is dense but purposeful, mostly avoiding the sense of a catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse, rocky island, and receding tide are vividly rendered and consistently used as constraints (low tide revealing the stone, the physical descent, the beam reversing). The hunger stone functions as both environmental feature and charged object, evolving from relic to mechanism to ash. Weather and sea are not mere backdrop; the tide’s timing and the island’s isolation shape what’s possible. The final image of the horizon and returning gulls is cleanly charged by all the prior atmospheric work.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned carnival funhouse is richly and specifically rendered (mildew, ghost of cotton candy, cracked mirrors, Hall of Whispers) and fully fused with the story’s emotional logic. Setting shapes experience and symbolic pressure—the mirrors, mannequins, and breathing walls externalize the protagonist’s dread and history. The opera cloak clasp and funhouse mechanics charge the atmosphere and finale (“dawn bled through the broken ticket booth”), though the environment constrains psychologically more than tactically. This is high-level atmospheric work that remains purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is rich, specific, and constantly in play—the floating driftwood orchard isn’t postcard dressing but a full instrument: roots conduct sound, fruits burst to drum the sea, the edge of the driftwood frames the Prophet’s tactical space. Environmental details evolve with the action (sea glassing into obsidian, then softening under harmonic rain) and mirror the stakes of sonic control. Objects-as-setting (driftwood ring, fruit, mallet, conch) constrain what tactics are possible and explicitly charge the final image. This integration is exemplary, only held back from higher by the relatively low on-page practical jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    The city on gargantuan turtle shells, bleached sky, carapace maps, and rusted gate are all sharply imagined and tightly woven into her vocation and tactics. Environment constrains choice (the sealed gate forces her to climb ridges at night; the shell-plateaus and watchers’ perches define her path of approach) and echoes the thematic obsession with layers and spirals. Details feel selective rather than touristic, and recurring elements (shells, spirals, gate, horizon) charge the final decision image. The only small step down from top-tier is that the “turtle” nature of the city, while wonderfully strange, could be swapped for other high-ridge geology with limited impact on plot-level logic.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    The disused railway station, ivy, roots, skylight, and rosebush are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the mood and thematic concerns about buried history and curated silence. Details like the brass compartment, oilcloth, and the final petal falling give the environment specificity and charge the final image. The setting is filtered through the historian’s sensibility in a believable way; it never reads like a neutral postcard. It doesn’t strongly constrain her choices, which keeps it just shy of the very highest band, but as atmosphere and thematic mirror it’s excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    The submerged pavilion is vividly rendered and omnipresent—the “drowned ballroom,” barnacled chandeliers, coughing fountain, and shifting beams create a tactile, decaying environment. Setting actively pressures choices: water level, rot, and the raised drawbridge create isolation and physical constraint on her work. The inkwell and pavilion together form a micro-ecosystem; the final rumors of lights and music under the waves are charged by the earlier concrete details. Description is lush but largely purposeful, rarely lapsing into static postcard imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    The underwater library is richly realized through tactile and visual detail—the silt, kelp-choked skylight, moss-slick shelves, and pressurized groans all feel specific and lived-in. Environmental constraints (darkness, water, decay, engineered vents) are not just mood but logic: they explain why certain records survive and shape how she moves, searches, and interprets anomalies. The Master Index’s preservation system and the lantern in deep water explicitly charge the ending image. A slight density of description flirts with over-opulence, but it remains purposeful and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating isle, glass basilica, and tea garden are vividly rendered with selective, original details (“gravity wept,” “tea leaves stand upright,” roots drinking sky) that reinforce tone and concept. Setting is not decorative: the basilica’s central nave and rose window physically stage the climax, and the island’s drift at the end concretizes the inner shift. World rules (dream-glass, gem-infused lanterns, gravity’s odd behavior) remain consistent within the piece’s surreal logic. The environment actively charges the final image rather than serving as a mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating observatory, geosynchronous orbit over the irradiated wedding site, and zero-g corridors are vivid and integrated into action, not just backdrop. Environment and object-as-setting (the geode, the “Cradle of Cold Eyes,” the observation blister) meaningfully charge the final image as she fires thrusters and bends the stars. Details feel selective and filtered through her trauma and scientific focus, not like a generic SF postcard. The setting does constrain options (isolation, reliance on tech), though explicit physical constraints could tighten even further.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ancient observatory at dusk is vividly rendered through selective, purposeful detail: dust, glyphs, crumbling arches, twilight’s “brilliant dimness,” and the celestial dial all reinforce the story’s motifs of hidden patterns and internal astronomy. The environment is filtered through her trained observational eye, which keeps the description character-specific rather than touristic. Setting and tools (drone, plinth, seam, dome) participate in the action by enabling discovery and the star-trail activation, and the final stillness under the dome charges the last image. The space could exert a bit more concrete constraint on options, but as atmosphere and thematic mirror it’s strong.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is richly particular—the cobalt terrace, bruise-colored horizon, humming driftwood figures, and tide that gnaws at “shipwrecked confessions” all feel specific and lived. The shore’s magical rule-set (truth fragments washing up and dissolving when fulfilled) is consistent and learned through action rather than exposition dumps. Environment and objects meaningfully charge the experience, especially the carvings and the surf during her physical reaction, though they mostly frame and inflect rather than hard-constrain choices. Overall, atmosphere and specificity are strong enough for high-band even without a literal environmental bottleneck.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    The storm-worn parapet, mist, and unsheltered height are vividly used to embody exposure and neutrality (“where the wind doesn’t take sides”). Setting is consistently filtered through her perception, with weather and stone mirroring the emotional stakes without feeling like a generic backdrop. The small objects (drawer pull, key) function as micro-setting, charging the final image with tactile specificity. The environment influences tone and symbolism more than choices moment-to-moment, keeping it just shy of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid and deeply integrated: the coastal launch, tide, gulls, and rusted utility poles are all filtered through her navigator’s eye and emotional state. The environment meaningfully shapes options—the poles literally redirect her path inland, the kayak-and-tide frame the decisive return to the water, and the sea is both threat and home. The astronomical compass functions as a micro-setting object that heavily charges the final image. Atmosphere (bruised sky, crows, cottages, gloaming) underpins tone and theme without devolving into static postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    The underground bioluminescent lake and the Layer 7 city infrastructure are vividly rendered through purposeful sensory detail (ozone, wet stone, engineered algae) and never feel like postcard description. The environment actively shapes meaning and options: the hidden shaft, the lake’s reactive glow, and the submerged objects all constrain what the seeker can do and what they must confront. The ball’s buoyant drift into the brightest center charges the final image and anchors the RR. Occasionally the worldbuilding hints (Layer 7, engineered algae) feel like they could support even more tactical interaction, but at this length the integration is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “fairy-tale orchard blooming under permanent moonlight” is vivid, specific, and threaded throughout, with blossoms, silver bark, and moonlight all tied to the magic and to the fortune’s promise. Setting is filtered through her emotional state and actions (branches leaning, blossoms pulsing in response to the spell), so environment feels alive and engaged with the stake. The final movement “deeper into the grove” uses place to signal a new phase of possibility, not just a scenic exit. It stops short of physically constraining tactical choices but strongly charges the mood and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    The “midnight glade above clouds” and the archive of evaporated seconds are vivid, specific, and constantly inflect the action (clouds becoming hands, roots cradling her wrist, the saucer as portal). Environment and recurring objects don’t just decorate—they actively enable and constrain her options, especially at the threshold and closure. The fantastical world-rules feel consistent and are learned through ritual and response rather than exposition. The final sense of descent back below the cloudline gives a strong spatial and thematic before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    The recycled spaceship, with its rust, solar wind lullaby, failing gravity plates, and dimming/brightening lights, is vivid and tightly tied to Elira’s loneliness and process. The micro-setting of Kwan Yin’s Tear as an object-as-environment is excellent; its emotional gravity literally constrains her options and calibrates the gate. The transition to the Echo-Realm meadow under twin moons is legible and charged, clearly contrasting the ship’s decay with a still, numinous afterspace. Almost every detail is purposeful; there’s minimal “tourist” description.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    The black sand beach, active volcano, and celestial sky are vividly rendered and tightly tied to tone and theme; details like sand absorbing moonlight and the volcano “purring” dynamically mirror internal shifts. The environment responds to her acts (tremor, volcano’s pause/sleep, gleaming sand), charging the final tableau with earned, world-scale resonance. While the locale could, in theory, be swapped for another liminal landscape, the specific combination of black sand/volcano/tide-as-voice feels integral to the ritual atmosphere. Setting is not mere backdrop; it actively participates in the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the luminous fort, twilight, dimmed arcane lanterns, ramparts, and the half-painted sundial are all integrated into action rather than postcard description. The environment and tools (blackout, architecture, sundial, quill holder) directly shape tactics and constraints, particularly in how she uses shadow and angles. World rules (arcane glow, observatory, coded geometry) feel consistent and are learned through use. The final image of dawn and the horizon “blushing awake” is charged by the established fort/blackout context, satisfying the micro-setting-as-closure gate.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: the aurora as “scripture,” the frictionless world constraining action (no grip, no speech), the tidal bluff and rocks functioning as both ritual space and tool. Environmental rules are consistent and shape tactics, especially around handling the eels and communicating. Recurring objects (painted rocks, aurora, star dust) charge the final image of the humming stones and dissolved eels. A touch more interaction with the physical peril of a frictionless shoreline could push it into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stormlit observatory above the clouds is vivid, tactile, and consistently filtered through her sensibility (“suspended between heaven and oblivion,” “clouds below churned like ink in milk”). Setting and objects (telescope, dome, locker, timer, window) are clearly placed and revisited, and the storm’s soundscape threads the piece. The environment largely serves atmosphere and theme rather than hard constraints on choice, though the elevated isolation and stormlight effectively mirror her charged solitude. Strong, purposeful description, just short of using the setting to actively limit options.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting work is excellent: the glass atrium, brook, scholars, and especially the sundial are vividly rendered and tightly integrated into action. Light, shadow, and glass aren’t just décor; they’re the literal mechanism for decoding the overture and charge the final image of the shadow sliding to “the next coded angle.” Sensory selection stays purposeful, with sound (brook, glass chime, page rustle) and light consistently tuned to anticipation. It falls just shy of a 9-band only because the larger world beyond the atrium (and how it might resist or reshape this discovery) remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rusted library under stars is richly realized—broken glass, corroded gutters, shattered skylight, mildew and glue—and it’s continuously used, not just painted in. The environment meaningfully shapes her actions: she nails the poem to the rusted door, plants seeds in the cracks between floorboards, and transforms the ruin into a “kind of cathedral.” Recurring objects—the coffee tin, candle, seeds—are tightly tied to place and charge the final image. Setting, mood, and theme are strongly integrated without slipping into pure postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tidal arbor above the clouds is vividly original and functionally integrated—its harmonics, mist, and gravity-bending properties directly shape Elira’s tactics. Objects-as-setting (piano, clock, film reel, projector) are spatially and conceptually grounded, and the environment evolves under pressure (arbor shuddering, starlight threads, shattering horizon). Sensory detail is lush yet purposeful, consistently filtered through Elira’s musical/experimental priorities. The final image of dawn, frozen compasses, and a clock that “kept going” is deeply charged by prior environmental specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “ancient ridge in bloom” with opalescent petals and memory-rooted flowers is vivid, sensorial, and tightly bound to stakes. Environmental rules (memory in roots, early blooming signaling a hungrier monsoon) are clear and consistently exploited, and the ridge directly shapes the method and closure (the seed fractalizing into a hovering mini-ridge). The final image of the glowing ridge, now a living archive, powerfully charges the theme of memory with place. A slight excess of descriptive flourish in spots keeps this from pushing into the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    The islet, bonsai, compass, and weather are vividly rendered and tightly woven into the emotional fabric of the piece; sensory details like “blue as silence after a slammed door” feel precise rather than generic. Environment constrains and shapes action: Elio must find the specific hollow, work with rain-pooled soil, and rely on wind to carry diffused regret away. The setting’s mood and physical conditions clearly charge the final image of a lighter islet and dawn-colored leaves. A touch more evidence that the location uniquely raises stakes (rather than being one of many equivalent islets) would be needed to push into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmosphere is strong, with vivid sensory details ("cold stone," "indigo and silver," "grit of ash") that ground the setting effectively. The environment feels distinct, though the "canyon as teacher" motif leans slightly into pathetic fallacy.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and integral to the plot; the "winterglass" physics and "brittle geometry" actively constrain the protagonist's tools (vibration over sound). The sensory details of frost and thermal overlays ground the high-concept premise effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    The underwater library is realized with vivid, tactile specificity ("salt-crusted," "brine-stilled," "bloated spines"). The setting actively shapes the mood and the mechanics of the haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sensory details are vivid and evocative, effectively establishing a melancholic but resilient atmosphere ("bruised twilight," "amber light like old coins"). The arbor serves as a strong, grounding anchor for the community's interactions, though the setting remains largely static.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with "bioluminescent vines" and "inverted blossoms" establishing a strong magical realist tone. The environment supports the mystical logic of the story, though it functions more as a backdrop than a source of frictional constraint or distinct obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is lush and active; the "living bridge" absorbing tears and the "pulsing" leaves create a distinct, immersive atmosphere that transcends mere backdrop. The environment actively participates in the character's transformation, constraining her actions (thorns, gravity shifts) and grounding the surrealism.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, blending the decaying carnival aesthetic ("grinning clown," "broken ticket counters") with the vital seed vault effectively. The environment provides the specific tools (piano keys) used to resolve the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is lush and integral; the "sunken orchard greenhouse" ringed by shipwrecks provides the necessary acoustic environment for the plot’s central action. The imagery of "phosphorescent algae" and "cracked glass" actively supports the mood of decay and preservation. The environment constrains the protagonist's method, satisfying the requirement for setting as pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting is vividly established with atmospheric details ("moss-cracked tiles," "bleeding the last hues"), though the descriptions lean toward adjectival stacking. While the environment provides a strong mood, it functions more as a backdrop than a pressure cooker that constrains the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.0)
    The juxtaposition of the industrial control room and the delicate glasswork creates a solid atmospheric baseline. However, the mechanics of the "scavenged furnace" humming to life in a frozen room strain credibility slightly, and the setting serves more as a passive backdrop for the ritual than a source of constraints or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting suffers from confused spatial logic; the "rusted library" containing film reels, prop trunks, and a projector room creates an unclear hybrid space that isn't fully grounded as either a literal location or a surreal metaphor. Over-reliance on atmospheric adjectives ("forgotten stars," "tired spines") crowds out specific, tactile grounding that would anchor the stunt double's physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is vivid and the "ambered hush" concept effectively grounds the scene's physics. However, the heavy reliance on metaphorical filtering ("honeyed resin," "bruised horizon") distances the reader from the concrete physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the frozen courtyard and crystalline dust effectively grounding the metaphysical stakes. The sensory details ("lavender and indigo," "whispering over ice") support the "mundane mysticism" tone, though some descriptions verge on purple ("bruised twilight").

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is atmospherically consistent, with vivid imagery like "liquid stars" and "quartz veins." However, the description is heavy on adjectives and occasionally repetitive ("fractured" appears three times in quick succession) without constraining the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the tactile contrast between "cracked marbles" and "probability bands" anchors the conflict. Sensory details like the "golden resin" and "damp earth" are vivid and purposeful. The "empire of metrics" is effectively dramatized through the setting's rebellion (vines knotting paths).

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.7)
    Atmospheric detailing is the story's strength, with imagery like "bruised violet and silver" and the "hush of beating wings" grounding the speculative elements. The setting feels specific and tangible, effectively supporting the twilight mood.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.1)
    The strongest category; the flooded opera house is rendered with vivid, specific imagery ("chairs floated like lily pads"). The setting actively constrains the method (wading, water as lens), integrating well with the premise. Some descriptions border on ornamental ("balconies weeping rust"), but the atmosphere is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    The station provides excellent atmospheric pressure, with the cold and wind directly influencing the protagonist's physical state and choices. The "gantry" scene effectively utilizes the setting to force the climax, though "auroral sorrow" feels like a slightly forced label rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Atmosphere is excellent, with sensory details like "breath of mildew" and "scuffed echoes" grounding the scene. The "beaded valve wheel" is described with tactile specificity that anchors the ghostly lore in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmospheric specificity is a strength, with details like "ink-dried roses," "beetle wings," and "scent of cinnamon" grounding the fantastical setting. These sensory anchors successfully establish the library's physical reality, though the reliance on abstract descriptors occasionally dilutes the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting of Sage Ridge is established with specific flora, but the description leans toward the ornamental ("earth hummed secrets," "dreaming roots"). While atmospheric, the details often feel like set dressing for a mood rather than constraints that pressure the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "silo library" is rendered with vivid, specific sensory details ("ash still clung," "liquid metal"). The atmosphere effectively supports the theme of decay and preservation, grounding the abstract concepts in a tangible, rusted reality.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is atmospheric, with strong specific details like the "spycraft microdot film specs" and "salt-crusted windows." However, the lighthouse environment often leans into romanticized tropes rather than constraining the character’s choices in a tactile way.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Surreal specificity is a major strength; details like the "cassock stitched from frayed audio tape" and "Assumption’s Veil" indigo ground the abstract setting effectively. The atmosphere is cohesive, blending static, incense, and silence into a tangible environment.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    The "glass spire" and "frozen lake" create a vivid, austere atmosphere that grounds the surrealism. The sensory details of the memories (flour, static, grease) provide excellent textural contrast to the cold, abstract "upturned hush" of the primary setting.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmosphere is a strength, with vivid, high-contrast imagery like "phosphorescent residue" and "suspended stars" effectively grounding the surreal concept. The setting actively charges the final beat as the viaduct trembles and the tablet blooms. However, the generated "childhood room" feels less distinct than the frame setting.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, establishing the cavern as a distinct acoustic space. The focus on vibration and scent effectively anchors the reader in Elara's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    Atmospheric and specific. The "storm recorder" texture (pressure gradients, wind vectors) nicely colors the POV's perception of the courtyard. The setting actively constrains him, serving as the sanctuary he must choose to leave.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.5)
    The greenhouse provides a strong, atmospheric backdrop with details like "skeletal vines" and "moss-stained tiles" that support the theme. However, the introduction of literal "glowing glyphs" in the air shifts the world's physical rules abruptly, feeling less like a setting feature and more like a convenient visualization tool.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.1)
    The grotto and rope offer grounded tactile details, though the "energy beings" remain abstract mood lighting rather than a concrete presence. The setting largely serves as a passive backdrop for philosophical reflection rather than a source of active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting—a sunken greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks—is vivid, specific, and atmospherically rich, anchoring the surreal tone effectively. The acoustics of the space are well-integrated into the action, though the setting functions more as a backdrop for the performance than a source of active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    The "amber grotto" is evocative and texturally rich, with the static electricity serving as a strong sensory bridge between setting and plot. The atmosphere palpably supports the "fossilized" versus "living" theme.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.4)
    Setting details are atmospheric ("salt-kissed air," "lantern’s warm glass") but largely decorative, serving as a backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure. The environment feels generic to the genre rather than specific to the protagonist’s immediate physical struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, integrating the "marsh-reed" tools and "obsidian/crystal" environment directly into the protagonist's actions and the story's logic. The sensory details effectively ground the surreal atmosphere, though the lushness occasionally borders on ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is inventive and integral to the plot; the acoustic canals and the giant's breathing provide specific, atmospheric constraints that shape the protagonist's actions. The sensory details ("moss-slicked," "iridescent throats") ground the fantastical elements effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.1)
    The bioluminescent cavern is vivid and integral to the plot, acting as a machine that responds to the protagonist’s ritual. The interplay of moonlight, moss, and stalactites effectively grounds the magical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.5)
    The library setting is established with vivid, if slightly purple, sensory details ("scent of ozone," "sapphire hush"). The environment provides atmosphere but fails to exert significant pressure or constraint on the character's physical movements or choices beyond the basic need for stealth.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory details like "bruised clouds" and "wet bark" effectively ground the opening. However, the shift to generic fantasy imagery ("liquid circuitry") weakens the specific, mossy atmosphere established early on.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is atmospheric and functional, with the "rain trails" and "silver veins" on the floorboards serving as a unique, constraint-based navigation tool. The "librarian of loss" metaphor effectively anchors the post-apocalyptic context in the physical environment of the tidal island.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.0)
    The acoustic properties of the cave ("voice swallowed and returned... layered in harmonics") provide a specific, sensory grounding that elevates the setting beyond generic fantasy. However, descriptors like "woven moonlight" and "mineral tears" lean toward cliché, slightly diminishing the atmospheric distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.4)
    The setting is atmospheric but static, relying on "adjective-noun" pairings ("bruised sky," "salt-warped ledgers") that serve as decoration rather than constraint. The harbor provides a backdrop but does not force specific tactical choices or impede the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting leans heavily into generic dreamscape imagery ("cathedral of mist," "liquid mercury," "corridors lined with mirrors") rather than specific, lived-in texture. While atmospheric, the environment feels constructed solely for the metaphor, lacking the sensory friction or concrete grounding that would make the "vault" feel real.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with the tower, whale song, and salt winds creating a vivid sensory texture. The magic square tile functions well as a micro-setting that grounds the abstract memories in physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    The "prismatic escondite" is vivid and specific, functioning as more than a backdrop by actively collapsing to signal the cost of the transition. The sensory details ("trapped wasp," "liquid ink") successfully establish a surreal, high-fantasy atmosphere that grounds the abstract concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.7)
    The funeral home setting is evoked well initially with details like "sterile fluorescents" and "burnt parchment," creating a distinct atmosphere. However, the setting evaporates during the montage section, becoming a generic backdrop for the parade of visitors.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bonsai labyrinth and the orphaned fluorescent lamp are excellent, specific constraints that drive the method and imagery. The setting is active, functioning as an archive that resists and guides the protagonist, rather than just a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the "labyrinth of shipping containers" providing specific, atmospheric constraints (tides forcing movement). Sensory details like "rust and rivets" and "salt-stung silence" effectively ground the abstract themes.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Atmospheric details like the "bent paperclip" and "shattered telescope glass" ground the scene well. The setting successfully mirrors the character’s internal ruin. However, some descriptors lean toward the purple ("choir of forgotten astronomers"), which distracts slightly from the visceral specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Setting is the strongest element, offering vivid, specific sensory details ("salt-stained wood," "blazers smelling of starch") that effectively establish the atmosphere. However, the description sometimes lists static attributes rather than integrating them into active constraints on the character's choices. The environment is immersive but treated more as a backdrop than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is integral to the plot mechanism; the vacuum and thermal dawn spike are not just backdrop but active causal forces triggering the hourglass. Sensory details are vivid ("frost," "shimmer"), though occasionally marred by standard descriptors ("bleeding dawn"). The integration of environment and mechanism is the story's strongest feature.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    The atmosphere is vivid and consistent, effectively establishing the "mist-coated" steampunk/fantasy aesthetic. However, elements like "lunar resin" clash slightly with the "guidance chip" sci-fi logic, creating a blurred world-building rule set. The sensory focus on vibration and touch anchors the POV well.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.1)
    Atmosphere is vivid and sensory ("ice groaned like an old ship"), effectively grounding the magical realism. The condensation on the window serves as a functional micro-setting that constrains the method and charges the central action.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "wild hush," "choked chimneys," and "moss-slicked cobblestones" create a vivid, immersive setting. Specific details like the clock "rusted solid since 1893" ground the surrealism. The environment actively participates in the narrative arc, responding to the tuner's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "forgotten underwater temple" is atmospheric, establishing a "lonesome splendor" consistent with the tone. However, sensory details like "scent bloomed" in a submerged environment break physical credibility, and the spatial logistics of the character's movement relative to her vehicle remain fuzzy.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    Atmosphere is a strong point, with "brine and candle wax" and "iron gate" grounding the magical elements in a tangible reality. The lighthouse serves as an effective crucible, constraining the action and focusing the sensory details, though the "copperlight repose" repetition feels slightly forced.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sensory details are vivid and atmospheric ("iron-boned ribs," "frost-laden winds"), anchoring the mood effectively. The setting descriptions sometimes stall momentum, but the environment feels cohesive and tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies heavily on abstract, synesthetic metaphors ("dust that tasted of forgotten hymns") rather than concrete, grounding details that constrain the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.9)
    The "catacomb orchard" is an inventive, atmospheric concept anchored by vivid sensory specifics like "petals fell upward" and "roots threading between femurs," creating a distinct physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vividly rendered with specific sensory details ("cool marble," "scent of cedar pencils") that establish a cohesive, atmospheric mood. However, the description occasionally leans into static "postcard" imagery, serving as a backdrop for reflection rather than a source of constraints that force tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is established with vivid, atmospheric specificity ("cobalt observatory," "frozen tear"), grounding the magical premise effectively, though the descriptions occasionally verge on purple.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mangrove labyrinth is vivid and functional, acting as an antagonist that slows the protagonist and a medium for communication via the leaf-windows. The "windows formed by nature" concept is integrated well into the climax, constraining the protagonist's attention and shaping the resolution. The setting does heavy lifting in creating the story's atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid ("thick with salt and silence," "liquid gold"), effectively mirroring the protagonist's internal state. The sensory details are lush, though they occasionally serve the metaphor more than the physical grounding of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    The fusion of the "light painting" mechanics with the fog setting is vivid and specific, grounding the fantasy elements in pseudo-physics (fog as emulsion). The sensory detail is strong, though occasionally leans on familiar descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    The "sound wave garden" is excellent—vivid, specific, and functionally integrated into the plot mechanics (requiring reflection). The setting actively constrains the protagonist's approach and shapes the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.1)
    The greenhouse setting is vivid and atmospheric, blending organic decay with surveillance technology ("surveillance moths," "taxable thoughts") to create a distinct sense of place. The sensory details—wet earth, rattling glass, pinned wings—effectively ground the abstract concept of linguistic rebellion in a tangible environment.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and integral; the acoustic properties of the "gargantuan shell" and the bioluminescent atmosphere meaningfully constrain and shape the delivery of the song. The sensory details ("barnacle-teeth," "ribbed throat") effectively ground the fantastical premise.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with sensory details like "dew from crystalline petals" and "slow tides of mercury" grounding the surreal concept. The environment actively constrains the action—the reliance on wind and the porous architecture are integral to the ritual, effectively merging setting with plot.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    The atmosphere is vivid and active; the archive functions as a participant (walls exhaling, dust spiraling) rather than just a backdrop. The glass ink well serves as an excellent anchor for the setting's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid, atmospheric, and central to the resolution, actively providing the "equations" needed for the climax. However, descriptions occasionally veer into purple prose ("exhaled powdered rust," "whispered echoes"), slightly overcrowding the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.5)
    The atmosphere is cohesive and sensory, successfully establishing the "vintage bookshop" aesthetic. However, the setting details (dust motes, cedar, foxed paper) lean toward generic literary tropes without surprising specificity that would constrain the character's choices in a unique way.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is atmospherically distinct, effectively using the "drifting prism terrace" and "rainbow mist" to mirror the fractured reality. The sensory details are consistent and immersive, anchoring the abstract concepts in strong visual imagery. The environment actively participates in the narrative mood, reinforcing the theme of suspension and thresholds.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sensory details are vivid and lyrical ("barnacle sighs," "braille maps"), creating a strong mood. However, the central image of fireflies in saltwater, even when acknowledged as "impossible," strains suspension of disbelief in a sci-fi/research setting, feeling like a convenient conceit rather than an integrated world element.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is vivid and imaginative, effectively establishing a fantastical atmosphere. However, the description leans toward the ornamental ("laughter echoing like bubbles popping"), creating a sugar-spun aesthetic that occasionally distracts from the gravity of the thematic intent.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is established with vivid, sensory specificity ("salt-scented," "lapping waves," "driftwood"), effectively grounding the ethereal tone. While some descriptions lean toward decorative similes ("faulty marquee lights," "saltwater taffy"), the atmospheric pressure of the "tidal arcade" is palpable and serves the theme well.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.4)
    Atmosphere is consistent and lyrical, but the setting is rendered through "purple" descriptors ("gravitational sighs," "velvet hush") that distance the reader from concrete sensory reality. The "nostalgia ban" is established via exposition rather than being shown through immediate environmental pressure or specific constraints in the garden.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmosphere is the story's primary strength, with specific, grounded details like the "rusted iron frame" and "damp stone pier." However, the sensory experience is often interrupted by the narrator explaining the symbolic meaning of those details.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.5)
    Setting details are vivid but frequently overwritten ("quiet negotiation with gravity"), serving as a backdrop for philosophical musing rather than a source of pressure or constraint. The atmosphere is consistent but relies on romanticized imagery ("celestial dance") that distances the reader from the gritty reality of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and integral to the plot; the grotto is a machine, not just a backdrop. The specific physical details (wet stone, abalone shards, the tide delivering the obsidian disc) actively constrain the protagonist’s timing and resources, grounding the abstract concept in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Atmosphere is vivid and consistent, effectively grounding the "softened" world. However, description occasionally drifts into purple prose ("bruised twilight sky," "curled like unborn birds") that prioritizes ornamentation over narrative utility.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sensory details are vivid and establish a strong, ethereal atmosphere ("wept," "trembling halos," "liquid dawn"). However, the description often leans toward lush ornamentation, creating a static tableau rather than a setting that actively pressures the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the "triple moons" and "volcanic stone" effectively anchoring the ritual tone. While distinct, the description occasionally lists fantasy elements (meteorite ink, dove bone) rather than integrating them into urgent action.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.1)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with the salt flat rendering a vivid, "bruised" tableau. The sensory details ("crunching like shattered glass") effectively ground the abstract concept of the echo in physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.8)
    The imagery is vivid ("silver courtyard," "prism sanctuary") but ungrounded; the setting operates as a "white room" with poetic furniture rather than a tangible place affecting the character. The orientation is purely atmospheric, lacking social or physical context.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    The decommissioned radar dome is an evocative setting that mirrors the "abandoned signals" of the protagonist’s relationship. Sensory details like the rain as "Morse code" and the "half-lit" atmosphere effectively charge the scene, though the seedy bars are less spatially grounded than the dome.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmospheric and vivid, with strong specific details like "moss-thread" and "vapor-thin canopies" that ground the esoteric concept. The setting successfully establishes a mood of reverence, though the repeated personification of the grotto ("blushing") feels slightly decorative rather than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptional—the "icebound sanctum," "ceiling glows like a bruise," and the material specificity of "ground lapis lazuli" create a tangible, atmospheric weight. The environment actively constrains the process (cooling time, permafrost), integrating setting with plot beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with vivid, atmospheric details ("damp moss," "rusted steel") that effectively ground the abstract action. However, the environment yields too easily to the protagonist's needs, functioning more as a stage set for revelation than a source of genuine constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    The atmospheric blend of ruin and mathematical precision is vivid ("creeping ivy and bureaucratic neglect"). However, specific anachronisms in the protagonist's log ("decibel") and the narrator's comparisons ("neutron star") clash with the "ancient Babylonian" grounding, momentarily breaking the specific historical/fantasy immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmosphere is a strength, with vivid imagery like "ink bleeding into water" establishing the surreal nature of the sanctuary. The setting effectively mirrors the internal state, though the lack of concrete physical constraints beyond the silence limits its tactical pressure on the character.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory details like "wet bark," "ozone," and "bruised violet sky" creating a tangible atmosphere. The transformation of the orchard with "silent bursts of white and pink" provides a striking visual counterpoint to the initial gloom. The environment feels lived-in and ancient, effectively grounding the magical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptional; "deciduous vows" falling like fruit physically constrains the action, requiring ladders and tools. The cathedral-orchard fusion is not just backdrop but the engine of the plot, determining how the character interacts with the abstract concept of broken promises.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is excellent, juxtaposing the cosmic "astral orchard" with the mundane, mildewed maintenance alcove to great effect. The specific sensory details ("fluorescent light flickered," "edges whispering of kernels uncracked") ground the surreal elements, making the environment feel lived-in and distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and active; the "collapsed aisle where gravity seemed to stutter" and "shelves that spiraled" create a strong atmospheric pressure. The environment actively participates in the narrative (shelves rearranging, mountain exhaling), and the "botanical diary" metaphor bridges setting and character tools effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific, with strong sensory details like the "copper and cinnamon" scent and "carousel horses frozen mid-gallop." The environment actively shapes the journey, providing both obstacle (fog, labyrinth) and path.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.7)
    The atmosphere is cohesive and sensory ("brass oil and dust"), effectively grounding the magical realism. While the "magical clock tower" setting is a familiar trope, the specific details of the non-existent door and the workbench support the plot efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, blending geology and acoustics into a vivid, resonant atmosphere that grounds the abstract conflict. Details like "limestone throats," "frozen weeping," and the specific mechanics of the ice fractures effectively integrate the environment into the plot as both a constraint and a tool.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong atmospheric work; the "glass humming pavilion" and "powdered silica" create a vivid, tactile environment that actively shapes the ritual. The setting is not just a backdrop but an integral tool in the protagonist's interaction with the stars.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    Atmospheric specificity is the story's highlight, with vivid details like "obsidian and quartz" and "frozen bells" grounding the speculative elements. The setting actively constrains the method of the protagonist, integrating the magic system well with the physical environment.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptional, blending the protagonist’s pyrotechnic lexicon with the organic decay of the fortress ("petals that curl... like slow-burning fuses"). The environment is not just a backdrop but an interactive force that responds to her presence ("earth itself remembers combustion"), charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong, atmospheric detailing ("wind... hummed a minor chord," "tremor of barnacles") grounds the abstract concept in a vivid physical reality. The setting actively pressures the character and mirrors the thematic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sensory details are vivid and synesthetic ("silence of snowfall... dissolved like spun sugar"), effectively grounding the high-concept setting. The contrast between the damp, iron-scented bunker and the radiant trellis is sharp and immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, imaginative, and integral to the story's logic; the "drifting prism terrace" actively drives the plot and emotional arc. Sensory details are specific ("waterfall that fell upward," "frozen auroras") and establish a cohesive, surreal atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting blends steampunk and sci-fi elements ("brass goggles," "nano-filaments") with some vivid, if adjective-heavy, imagery. The descriptions occasionally veer into purple prose ("fractured glass across time," "chromatic veil") but successfully ground the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.8)
    Atmosphere is consistent and evocative ("burnt sugar," "cold curve"), but the setting suffers from "white room syndrome," existing only as a stage for metaphors. The environment lacks lived-in specificity or concrete geography, relying instead on poetic signaling.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific, grounding the magical realism in a tangible location; the bioluminescence and subway details create a strong atmosphere. The environment interacts well with the bolt, though the sensory details occasionally lean into familiar tropes (ozone).

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.5)
    Atmospheric details are present but often slide into purple prose ("pooled like spilled honey," "bruised violet") that feels ornamental rather than grounding. The setting serves as a backdrop for poetic reflection rather than a source of pressure or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.0)
    The imagery is vivid ("mercury-root," "phosphor-bark") but functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint. The phrase "factually mystical" is a jarring tonal break that disrupts immersion, reading like an unintegrated prompt insertion.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is established clearly with sensory details (dust, light, folders). However, the description relies heavily on clichés ("dust motes danced," "slanted afternoon light") and poetic conceits that distance the reader from the physical reality of the space. The environment serves the theme but feels more like a stage set than a lived-in archive.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is established with sensory vividness ("salt-bleached driftwood," "dust and static"), though the "auric lagoon" leans into purple description. The environment serves as a backdrop rather than an active pressure cooker; the "propaganda museum" above adds flavor but doesn't constrain the immediate physical action in the bunker.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.5)
    Atmosphere is vivid and central to the story's logic, with the grotto reacting to the music. However, specificity is harmed by repetitive, clunky tagging ("prism atrium in mist," "radiant grotto in mist") that feels like mechanical prompt insertion rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "ashen skyborne arbor" is evoked with rich, sensory specificity that grounds the fantasy effectively. The setting actively provides the tools (moss, seeds) for the character's agency, integrating world-building directly into the method of resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.7)
    Atmosphere is a strong point, with the workshop and cavern rendered in vivid, sensory-rich detail (rust, rainwater, phosphorescent moss). However, some descriptions veer into abstraction ("question posed by gravity") or cliché ("tasted of cinnamon and memory"), which distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with details like "cathedral of rust" and "rain-washed foundry" grounding the mystical elements in a tactile reality. The environment effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal state without becoming purely symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    The concept of the gorge’s geology acting as a "misaligned harp" is a standout invention that anchors the metaphysics of the story. This environmental constraint actively shapes the protagonist's method (harmonizing rather than banishing), integrating setting deeply with plot.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "ultraviolet forest" is vivid and functionally integrated with the protagonist's "pain navigation" mechanic, creating a strong, unified atmosphere. Specific details like the "bioluminescent oak" and "glowing soil" ground the surrealism, though the descriptions occasionally veer into abstract pathetic fallacy.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with strong sensory details ("scent of grandmother's apron," "hummed with suspended lanterns"), though it leans towards decorative fantasy tropes. The environment provides flavor and resources but does not meaningfully constrain the protagonist's tactics or force a difficult trade-off beyond the initial transaction.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, utilizing specific sensory details like the "pure tone" of the water drop and the "smell of popcorn." The integration of the horologist’s tool as a means to interact with the environment adds a layer of unique, tactile specificity that grounds the ghostly elements.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, immersive, and active; the library does not just sit there but reacts (tilting shelves, bleeding ink) and constrains the protagonist's choices via the frost patterns. The atmosphere effectively supports the "negotiable reality" premise.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    The atmosphere is lush and strictly adhered to, perfectly capturing the "baroque" requirement with details like "fossilized starlight" and "violet and gold currents." The setting actively constrains the climax through the storm/mirror mechanic, integrating environment with plot effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    The resonance chamber is a standout element, functioning not just as a backdrop but as an active participant that "answers" the repairman's actions. The specific details of copper pipes and glass bells grounding the magic in a tangible, acoustic reality are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.1)
    Atmosphere is the story’s strongest asset; the sensory details of the subterranean lagoon (scent, dampness, silence) are immersive and specific. The environment actively charges the final image. While some descriptions border on purple ("silence so complete it vibrated in her molars"), the setting successfully anchors the metaphysical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sensory environment is vivid and textured ("salt-crusted," "vibrated in her molars"), grounding the fable-like narrative in physical reality. However, the setting primarily serves as an atmospheric backdrop rather than a source of constraints that force difficult tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.2)
    Atmosphere is vivid and sensory ("turpentine and dried lavender," "incense and silence"), creating a cohesive mood. However, the setting details are largely ornamental; they decorate the scene rather than constraining the character's choices or forcing tactical pivots.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sensory details are vivid ("burnt cedar," "taste of iron," "cool grit"), anchoring the abstract concept of the floating library. However, the setting is often described in generalities or lists rather than interacting dynamically with the character during a specific, constrained moment. The "obsidian lagoon" is a strong image, though "shimmering like spilled ink" is a bit familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.3)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific details like "tattered silk globes" and "powdered moonstone" establishing a consistent, melancholic tone that anchors the magical realism.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, blending the mechanical and the botanical into a vivid, specific ecosystem ("rain-catchers shaped like forgotten gods") that constrains the ritual. The atmosphere is palpable, though the specific imagery of the orchard does the heavy lifting for the world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and reactive, with strong sensory details like "shattered chandeliers" and "velvet ice." The environment integrates well with the action, responding to the protagonist's movements (cracks blooming, ice weeping) to externalize the shift in entropy.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, acting as a constraint on the protagonist&#39;s method. The &quot;windblown sanctuary&quot; and the specific sensor details (&quot;thermal threads,&quot; &quot;barometric levers&quot;) ground the mystical tone in pseudo-mechanical specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.6)
    Specific details like the "yellow lantern glass" and "wind-chime sensors" ground the scene well. However, atmospheric descriptions occasionally drift into vague abstraction ("whispering against eternity," "hush of an overlooked era"), reducing the visceral impact of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.0)
    The atmosphere is vivid and tightly controlled, with the "sun-bleached" ruin and "stained glass box" anchoring the visual field effectively. The sensory details (" ash," "cobalt," "grit") successfully create a cohesive, oppressive texture, though the reliance on visual adjectives sometimes crowds out other sensory modes.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, vividly realizing the "numbers as textures" concept and the "emerald silo" atmosphere. The sensory details (grit, silk, chalk) effectively ground the surreal premise. The environment actively shapes the narrative logic, though the lack of physical resistance from the setting limits its dramatic role.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is established with vivid, atmospheric detail ("cobalt lagoon," "salt-cured silence"), grounding the scene effectively. However, the imagery occasionally drifts into "purple" territory ("bruised sky," "trembling with memory") which can distance the reader from the physical reality of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the specific imagery of copper wire guiding living oak into architecture is vivid and original. The "temple orchard" is tactile and atmospheric, grounding the abstract themes in concrete details.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sensory details are vivid and specific ("iron-rich soil," "petrichor"), though the phrase "lichen spelled out equations" feels slightly overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    Exceptional integration of setting; the jetty, tide, and bird life do not just provide a backdrop but actively constrain the ritual and dictate the protagonist's timing. The sensory details are vivid and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.0)
    Atmospheric detail is vivid and establishes a strong mood ("scent of rain," "ghost of ozone," "fields of glassed sand"). However, specific details like burning "shredded circuit boards" strain plausibility given the toxic reality, distracting from the otherwise grounded sensory environment.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with vivid sensory details like stars "smeared into a teardrop" and "stretched thin like taffy." The setting anchors the accumulation of mood effectively, though the "violet filament" reads as a somewhat generic anomaly.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting is visually evocative but relies heavily on generic high-fantasy tropes ("obsidian," "rime," "forgotten gods") rather than specific, tactile constraints. The "icebound spire" serves as a backdrop rather than an active environment that pressures the protagonist’s tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.1)
    The whispering gallery is an evocative setting, using acoustic details to ground the abstract themes of silence and memory. However, the description occasionally drifts into unanchored metaphor ("silences shaped like breaths") rather than concrete sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.9)
    Setting is the story's strongest asset; the "labyrinthine bookstore occupying an entire mountain" is evocative and grounded in tactile details like "dew-slicked tile" and "stormcloud leather." The environment reacts to the character ("shelves shifting like tectonic plates"), creating a strong atmospheric resonance that supports the magical realism tone.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is atmospheric, with vivid details like the "platinum labyrinth," but relies on familiar "frozen time" tropes (cobblestones holding breath). The physical rules of the magic are vague, serving as a pathetic fallacy for the protagonist's emotions rather than a concrete environment.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is evocative and integral to the plot; the "canyon of endless echoes" is not just scenery but the mechanism by which the conflict is resolved. The sensory details (mist, bone, salt, burnt sugar) are vivid, though the "spire" itself remains slightly vague visually until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sinking workshop provides immediate, tangible pressure (acid eating rivets, fumes), grounding the abstract ritual in physical urgency. However, the atmosphere is marred by overwritten descriptors ("hissed like a chorus of dying serpents") that render the setting performative rather than lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmospheric and tactile; the cave’s dampness and the rising tide press effectively on the character. Some descriptions drift into standard literary phrasing ("cathedral silence," "frozen stars") rather than strictly character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric ("cobalt walls," "salt and silence"), effectively grounding the reader in the physical space. However, the description frequently leans into abstraction ("paint peeling under... silence") that prioritizes lyricism over concrete spatial logic. The lighthouse feels more like a stage set for the theme than a working environment.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively grounding the abstract themes in concrete details like the "rusted gantry" and "broken dish array." The sensory details ("scent of rain on dry concrete") establish a strong, melancholic mood that supports the concept of entropy.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    The "hanging orchard" in the ravine is realized with excellent sensory specificity ("moss-slick roots," "forgotten chimes"), creating an unstable, precarious atmosphere that actively pressures the character's movement. The setting integrates tightly with the theme of balance, acting as more than just a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.9)
    The atmosphere is vivid and specific, utilizing "nautical twilight" and the "opal dock" to create a strong mood. However, the description occasionally leans into ornamental or "purple" territory ("pearlescent planks," "bleached nearly white") rather than strictly functional detail.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting is rendered with competent sensory detail ("dust-hung quiet," "phosphorescent fungi"), though the imagery leans heavily on standard fantasy tropes. The atmosphere effectively contrasts the dusty shop with the humid, magical cavern.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid details like "mercury wine" and "old roses." The setting is immersive, though occasionally the imagery feels slightly decorative ("veiled in mist that shimmered like crushed sapphires") rather than purely functional.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ember nexus and columella shell are rendered with vivid, specific sensory detail that anchors the abstract magic. The object successfully constrains the ritual, providing a tangible focus for the scene, though some descriptions lean toward the ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sensory specificity is a strength, particularly the tactile details of the "birch bark scroll," "damp wool," and "pine resin" which ground the surreal dream elements. The cabin feels lived-in and functions well as a constraint. The distortion of the environment (blue frosting, collapsing libraries) effectively mirrors the narrator's psychological state without breaking the scene's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    The water clock repair shop is a vivid, atmospheric setting that effectively constrains the interaction and mirrors the themes of time and flow. The sensory details—damp counter, brass gears, fog—are distinct and ground the potentially abstract conversation in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is integral and vivid; the floating rock and the specific properties of the "midnight moss" ink actively constrain the protagonist's choices. The ink’s reaction to stress is a brilliant micro-setting detail that drives the conflict. Sensory details like the vibrating rock and the "hush pressing against her eardrums" effectively build the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sheet music archive is rendered with specific, atmospheric details ("mausoleum of melodies," "dust over piano keys") that support the tone. The looming destruction of the orchard functions effectively as a time constraint, adding pressure to the scene's quiet interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with strong sensory details like "dust motes hung like frozen stars" and "bindings humming." The environment feels appropriately weighty and cosmic. Some descriptions ("woven regret") risk abstraction, but the physical grounding of the library generally works well to anchor the metaphysical action.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    Excellent atmospheric grounding; the "basalt promontory" and "hydraulics sighing steam" create a vivid steampunk-naturalist fusion. The setting details (no windows facing land) actively reinforce the character's isolation and the central theme.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.2)
    Exceptional integration of setting and mechanic; the mushrooms acting as quantum anchors and responding to the protagonist's proximity actively constrains the interaction. The "bioluminescent" element is not just decoration but the medium of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lantern serves as an excellent micro-setting, constraining Elara’s attention and charging the visual field with thematic weight. The "rainwashed library" provides a vivid atmospheric anchor ("wet paper," "old cedar"), though the rapid shifting between library, subway, and rehab softens the spatial grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the subway tunnel is viscerally rendered ("wept condensation," "iron and ozone"), acting as a pressurized container that actively enforces the operator's isolation. The glass harmonica functions well as a micro-setting that anchors the abstract concept of "cultivated estrangement" in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory details are vivid ("salt-crusted planks," "scent tangled with salt and ink"), establishing a strong atmosphere. However, the setting acts only as a backdrop; the "blooming jetty" does not constrain the character's choices or provide resources that alter the outcome of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.1)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "disused railway station" is rendered with vivid, specific sensory details ("polite anarchy," "rustle of ivy"). The setting successfully anchors the whimsical tone, though the "overgrown terminus" is a somewhat standard trope. The physical space actively supports the "forgotten cathedral" vibe essential to the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "ultrasonic forest" is realized with vivid, synesthetic detail ("moss that chimed like glass bells") that effectively grounds the abstract premise. The setting actively participates in the narrative method (dowsing), though the "emotional topography" occasionally drifts into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.5)
    Atmospheric details are vivid ("light bent in lazy spirals"), establishing a strong visual tone. However, the setting remains a passive backdrop that yields immediately to the protagonist's will, failing to provide the constraint or friction required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.9)
    The setting is vividly rendered with high-contrast imagery ("spilled mercury") but functions as an atmospheric backdrop rather than a source of constraints. Environmental details are ornamental, decorating the scene without forcing tactical shifts or limiting choices.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.4)
    Atmospheric details like "petrified ink and salt" and "charred spines" effectively establish a mythic, tactile tone. However, the setting often lapses into abstract grandeur ("cracked open time itself") rather than grounded specificity. The environment yields too easily to the protagonist, functioning more as a responsive stage set than a resistant physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.7)
    The "sound wave garden" is an evocative, active setting that responds to the character's agency. However, reliance on abstract descriptors ("liquid light," "petals of frequency") occasionally distances the reader from the physical reality of the space.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting of the shifting container labyrinth is excellent, creating a strong, specific atmosphere that shapes the protagonist's movement and method. The integration of the geomagnetic storm as a constraint on technology (forcing reliance on analog skills) is a smart, cohesive touch.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.3)
    Atmospheric specificity is high, particularly with the dental mirror and iron grates acting as micro-settings that constrain the magic. The sensory details effectively ground the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.7)
    The "cobalt library" and bioluminescent effects create a strong, unified atmosphere that supports the tone. The sensory details are vivid, though occasionally they lean into heavy personification ("windows weeping condensation") that feels slightly decorative rather than functional constraints on the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the "sublittoral fringe" and bioluminescence provide atmosphere, the setting relies heavily on lush, abstract descriptors ("whispered truces," "bruised indigo") rather than concrete, tactile grounding. The environment functions as a backdrop for the epiphany rather than a source of pressure or distinct constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    The "remade hush" and the looming presence of the wind turbines actively pressure the protagonist, turning the setting into an antagonist that enforces the silence. While the imagery is generally strong, the "nameless aunt" detail feels slightly generic compared to the specificity of the turbines and the porch.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.5)
    The atmospheric description is vivid and cohesive, effectively evoking a "frozen" and "crystalline" world through sensory details like "glacial marble" and "bruised twilight." The setting is well-integrated with the aesthetic themes, though the reliance on abstract metaphors occasionally distances the reader from the physical reality of the space.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is not merely a backdrop but the raw material of the plot; the ash, heat, and "overgrown flora" actively constrain Elias's choices and charge the final image. The contrast between the scorched earth and the sprouting green is visceral and visually arresting.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sensory details are vivid and atmospheric, effectively grounding the abstract concept in the "fossilized echoes" and "vacuum tubes whispering." The setting establishes a strong mood, though it functions more as a static backdrop than an active constraint on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.8)
    The observatory is atmospherically described, but the "curtains of intention" function as a convenient magical device that removes narrative friction. The setting actively "cradles her intent," supporting the protagonist rather than exerting the pressure necessary for a dynamic scene.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    Atmosphere is the piece's strongest asset; the "rain-beaded skylight" and "liquid runes" create a cohesive, vivid mood that supports the theme. Specific details like "broken QR codes" and "onyx ink" effectively ground the abstract concepts in a tangible, lived-in reality.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bronze prism pagoda acts as a strong anchor and constraint, focusing the action. Atmospheric details are vivid, though occasionally abstract ("molten regret") rather than sensory. The archive feels tactile and lived-in through the dust and shifting shelves.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.1)
    The "blooming library" is realized with vivid, atmospheric sensory details ("petal-chandeliers," "velvet moss") that support the dream-logic tone. The setting actively pressures the protagonist’s task, though the "data-core" interface feels slightly generic within the fantasy frame.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sensory details like "pigments ground from lichen" and the specific mechanics of the tail repair are vivid and grounding. The atmosphere is established well, though occasionally dips into generic descriptors ("velvet dark") rather than strictly observed particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is rendered with evocative, sensory-rich details, particularly the "cold stone bench" and the "concentric rings staining the oak." The atmosphere of the tower is palpable and distinct. The "cathedral" and "monks" feel slightly more generic by comparison but serve their purpose as a backdrop for the underground sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    Atmosphere is a standout strength; sensory details like "ozone and old velvet" and "wax the color of dried roses" ground the magical realism. The projection booth feels lived-in and specifically constrains the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.5)
    Atmosphere is consistent but relies on generic "postcard" imagery ("cobblestone streets," "emerald ribbons") that lacks lived-in texture. The setting serves as a passive backdrop for the ritual rather than offering constraints or resources that force specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively blending sci-fi and fantasy elements like the "bioluminescent petals" and the "divergent archive." The sensory details are consistent, though they occasionally veer into abstraction ("edges fraying like torn sheet music") that distances the reader from the physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vivid, prompt-compliant imagery ("brass vines," "turbine-shaped rocks") establishes a distinct aesthetic. However, the setting functions primarily as passive scenery, yielding to the protagonist ("vines unspooled") rather than providing constraint or opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is vivid but relies heavily on stock fantasy tropes ("gnarled willow," "crumbling shrines," "sea mist"). While atmospheric, the environment serves as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint or tactical pressure that forces specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the cold and silence acting as tangible constraints on the character. The cobalt fortress establishes a strong mood. However, some descriptors lean toward purple prose ("frozen hymn," "seraphically mundane") which distances the reader slightly from the immediacy of the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is atmospheric, utilizing "dust motes" and "cracked marble" to establish a mythic tone, but it functions more as a backdrop than a constraint. The environment does not force specific tactical choices; instead, it serves as a passive container for the messages. The descriptions often lean into cliché ("books lined the walls like tombstones") rather than specific, sensory engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is established with strong sensory details ("creaked with each tide," "smelled of salt and mildew") that ground the station’s isolation. The integration of the station’s mechanics (CALYPSO, sensors) with the natural environment creates a cohesive atmosphere. The submersible appears abruptly without prior establishment, slightly jarring the spatial logic.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.7)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with vivid, specific imagery ("shattered dome," "moss-crusted monoliths"). The juxtaposition of the high-tech spaceport and ancient druidic stones creates a distinct, grounded sense of place that anchors the scene well.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sensory details like "steam curling" and "obsidian stone" are vivid and ground the scene well. The setting functions adequately as a resource for the ritual, though the "Reconstruction" background feels somewhat generic.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmospheric detail is a strength, with specific textures like "wind-rattled glass" and "salt-crusted benches" grounding the setting. However, the physical environment is occasionally overshadowed by the need to make objects symbolically convenient (the dewdrop pearl), which feels less discovered than arranged.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively grounding the surrealism in sensory details like "salt-crusted windows" and "damp stone floor." The environment acts as an antagonist, physically compressing the protagonist, which integrates the setting well with the plot. Some descriptions veer into purple prose ("bruised twilight"), but the overall density creates a cohesive, immersive world.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sensory details like "tents stitched from sailcloth" and the "scent faintly metallic, like ozone" are vivid and purposeful. The setting successfully grounds the abstract metaphysical action in a tactile, eroded reality that mirrors the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.0)
    The atmosphere of the "echoing library under snow" is well-rendered with sensory specifics like the scent of "iron and jasmine." The setting effectively mirrors the "frozen" state of the society, though some elements (cryo-wax, chrono-globe) lean on standard genre shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story’s strongest asset, grounded in vivid, specific details like the "ballast bags" and "red soil" that anchor the abstract themes. The physical environment of the glass dome effectively contrasts with the "charred world" outside, pressuring the atmosphere if not the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    The "sound wave garden" is realized with vivid, synesthetic detail that actively constrains the protagonist's movement (zigzagging to avoid snapping chords). The environment feels distinct and coherent, effectively grounding the surreal premise in tactile and auditory specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.1)
    The observatory setting is vivid and atmospheric, providing a strong literal and metaphorical vantage point. The specific detail of the modified telescope anchors the scene well, though the spatial logic of seeing city smoke clearly from above cloud cover relies on a slightly dreamlike physics.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmosphere is vivid and consistent, effectively blending the mechanical with the mystical. However, the density of "purple" imagery ("static into symphonies," "comet dust") sometimes creates a decorative clutter that distances the reader from the physical reality of the lab.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is vivid and active; the "emergent hush" and the sound-dampening qualities of the grotto are integrated well into the action. The environment acts as a partner in the scene, though some descriptions ("curled like breath") lean on familiar tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on standard ruin tropes ("shattered sky," "skeletal remains") without specific, tactile interaction beyond the tessera. The plaza feels like a stage set for the speech rather than a lived-in environment that pressures the characters’ choices.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, offering a lush, specific, and atmospheric backdrop that integrates well with the ghost’s synesthesia. The "orchard concealed within the maze" and the "timelines like eggshells" provide a strong, grounding physical logic for the surreal premise.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is integral to the action; the studio’s equipment (synths, LEDs, blackout velvet) is actively used to drive the plot rather than just serving as a backdrop. The "micro-setting" of the body combined with the geode effectively constrains and guides the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    Atmospheric details like "salt-crusted stalactites" and "bioluminescent lichen" establish a vivid, specific setting. However, the reliance on negational descriptions ("not compass or sextant") occasionally distances the reader from the immediate sensory reality. The environment reacts beautifully to the plot, serving as a dynamic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmospheric detail is a strength, with sensory specifics like "resin and rust" and "hissed like wind through bone flutes" creating a vivid, tactile world. However, the setting often feels static due to the lack of kinetic interaction in a specific timeframe; the warehouse is a backdrop for contemplation rather than a pressure cooker for action.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.1)
    The atmospheric detailing is strong, effectively using the "silver hush" and "mist" to mirror Elira’s isolation. The setting feels tactile and lived-in, though the confusion regarding the physical relationship between the snow, the hatch, and the cache detracts slightly from the spatial grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    Atmospheric details like "wet moss" and the "glint of a heron’s wing" successfully establish the gothic mood. However, the specific image of "rain gutters ticking" clashes with the logic of a horse-drawn coach, breaking the physical verisimilitude of the setting for the sake of a required phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and integral, acting as a constraint on the protagonist's method. Sensory details like the "ghosts of honey" and "wax pooled" effectively ground the magical realism, and the environment actively shapes the pacing and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.7)
    Atmospheric details are vivid and establish the mood well ("spilled mercury," "sapphire and amber"), though they sometimes veer into decorative territory rather than constraining choice. The setting effectively frames the ritual, but the environment functions more as a passive backdrop for the light show than an active pressure on the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, offering a vivid, ethereal atmosphere with the "tidal library" and "vapor-sea." The "library without books" is a compelling conceit. However, the physical geography remains somewhat abstract ("stone circle buried beneath"), and the environment functions more as a backdrop for internal monologue than a source of physical obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.1)
    Setting details are lush and atmospheric ("liquid light," "green moons"), effectively establishing the fable-like tone. However, the environment facilitates the protagonist's journey effortlessly rather than providing constraint or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sensory details like "yellowed astronomical charts" and the subsonic vibrations rattling molars effectively ground the scene. The setting serves as a functional tool for the protagonist, though it does not significantly constrain her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmosphere is vivid, particularly the "ribs of stone" and the "silvered bone" of the organ. The setting actively pressures the protagonist, though some descriptors ("constellations no longer visible") lean toward generic fantasy tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmosphere is the story’s strongest asset, with the quarry’s mist and stone vividly rendered. Sensory details like "silk’s decay" and "grit under boots" effectively ground the scene. The setting actively pressures the encounter, though the reliance on pathetic fallacy ("stone walls... ashamed") detracts slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory details like "mildewed pages" and "waterlogged crates" create a visceral, tactile environment that grounds the fantastical elements. The setting effectively constrains the atmosphere, though the "whirring machines" are slightly generic compared to the natural descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    Atmospheric details (ozone, pine, resin) are vivid, but the prompt elements (“pixelated,” “wet-plate”) clash anachronistically without a grounding explanation. The setting functions more as a stage for metaphor than a physical place that constrains the character or provides resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    The abandoned circus train is established with vivid, specific details ("fossilized serpent," "murals... peeling") that support the tone. However, the shift to a functional "roaming think-tank" with solar panels strains credibility given the initial emphasis on rust and decay.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the star charts and temple glyphs providing a vivid, specific grounding for the magical elements. The "glass eye" of the dome and the "daylily-pressed telegram" are strong, tactile anchors, though some descriptions veer into excessive ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.5)
    The "orchard vortex" is a vivid, inventive setting that actively constrains the character and shapes the imagery ("inverted branches," "faces flickered in the ice"). The physical integration of the setting with the magic system (roots mapping veins) is visceral and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is vivid but operates as a mood board rather than a physical space that constrains action. Descriptions like "pulsed with anxious elation" project emotion onto the scenery (pathetic fallacy) instead of grounding the reader in concrete sensory details that affect the character’s movement.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, vivid and active; the "catacomb orchard" is specific and distinct. The environment actively constrains the antagonist (roots as manacles), integrating setting directly into the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is excellent, using the quarry's sensory details (dust, vibration, acoustics) to mirror Jasper's internal state. The environment actively pressures the character, with the "beast chewing stone" and the "hollows humming" serving as effective atmospheric constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, blending physics and mysticism into a cohesive, memorable environment ("solidified memory," "magnetic hum"). The environment actively participates in the narrative logic, constraining the method of interaction (cuneiform/resonance) effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.6)
    The atmosphere is vivid and poetic ("liquid moonlight," "cathedral of salt"), establishing a strong mood. However, the setting acts primarily as a passive backdrop for the ritual rather than offering constraints or resources that pressure the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is lush and atmospheric, effectively creating a mood of reverence with details like "salt-crusted shale." However, the "bunker inspector" framing is largely discarded for geological mysticism, missing a chance to contrast industrial grit with the crystal's purity.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and atmospherically consistent, acting as an effective archive for the protagonist's memory and grief. Specific details like the "accordion bellows patched with tape" and the "shattered skylight" ground the abstract themes. However, the reliance on standard "abandoned ruin" tropes (ivy, dust, silence) feels slightly familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and tactile; details like "shelves curved like vertebrae" and the scent of "bergamot and rain" ground the metaphysical concept. The propagation delay mechanic creates a unique, functional atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    The "velvet observatory" is rendered with vivid, lush sensory details that successfully establish a surreal, atmospheric tone. The setting actively participates in the narrative through the plant life and the texture of the environment, grounding the magical realism.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vividly realized, with sensory details like "liquid radiance" and "frozen moonpetals" establishing a strong, specific atmosphere. The environment supports the tone well, though the description occasionally prioritizes static beauty over constraining action or forcing choices.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is rendered with high-density, ornamental description ("twilight lived even at noon," "moss-hung silence") that feels painted on rather than interactive. While the "umbral grotto" provides atmosphere, the environment functions more as a backdrop for reflection than a source of constraint or resources that shape the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is atmospheric and functional; the "crumbling stone" and "rusted pipes" support the tone of decay and renewal. The physical environment (cold rock, salt air) effectively grounds the abstract internal conflict, though the "tide erasing footprints" is a somewhat generic closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and integral, with the "magnetic grotto" and "obsidian platform" actively participating in the magic system. The atmosphere of the "sycamore hush" effectively grounds the abstract lesson in physical texture.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific imagery like "ribs that had calcified" and "canyon of endless echoes" grounding the mythic tone. The setting meaningfully frames the skimmer's purpose and charges the final image of the towers crumbling into powder.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful, using the contrast between "glyph-drones" and "jasmine" to anchor the theme. The "lingering luminance" and the "garden folly keystone" serve as strong, specific anchors that elevate the atmosphere beyond generic fantasy.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underwater library is vividly realized with strong sensory details ("pages blooming like anemones," "stressed metal"). The setting effectively constrains the action, forcing the protagonist to navigate a breathless, alien environment that supports the magical realism tone.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    The "ambered observatory deck" is rendered with vivid, specific sensory details that effectively ground the abstract concepts. The setting serves as an atmospheric container that mirrors the theme of preservation and contraction.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    The observatory setting is vivid and functional, with the "shattered prism" and "stone table" actively constraining and enabling the climax. The atmosphere of "ruined grandeur" supports the tone well, though some descriptors ("cracked and vine-choked") feel slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and integrally linked to the plot; the specific mechanics of the "dripping rates" on the viaduct effectively constrain the magic system. Sensory details like "dew-slick stone" and "ash-gray glass" ground the abstract concept of cosmic repair in a tactile reality. The environment is not just a backdrop but a necessary tool for the protagonist's method.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, utilizing sensory details like the "metallic sigh" and "indigo into charcoal" to ground the surreal premise. The physical constraints of the mud and rising water are well-integrated into the action, though the rapid summary of the found objects slightly distances the reader from the environment in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is vividly described with high sensory density ("kaleidoscopic waterfall," "silver-barked trees") but functions largely as an ornamental backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint. While the imagery is consistent, it leans toward static beauty that does not force the character to adapt her tactics. The description often pauses the momentum rather than fueling the action.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is established with vivid sensory details, particularly the tactile description of the arbor and the vibration of the silence. However, elements like "sky-whales" and "floating islands" rely on familiar genre tropes that slightly diminish the specific atmospheric distinctness.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is established with vivid, if slightly generic, high-fantasy imagery ("ink-black clouds," "floating rock"). While visually distinct, the environment acts mostly as a static backdrop; the "temporal winds" and "rewriting history" are described but do not physically constrain Kael’s movement or force him to utilize the space tactically.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmospheric description is vivid ("liquid mercury," "cathedral," "obsidian-black"), establishing a strong, cohesive mood. However, the setting functions primarily as a static backdrop for summary rather than a physical environment that constrains specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting is atmospheric but obscured by heavy metaphorical abstraction ("amplify sighs into hymns") rather than grounded sensory detail. The physical reality of the tunnel and the leaf blower is often lost beneath the poetic gloss, making the environment feel more like a stage set than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with sensory details like "glyphs that tasted like static and snow" creating a tangible, immersive world. The setting actively mirrors the protagonist's internal state, with the frozen garden serving as both a physical space and a metaphor for the guardian's initial isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting details (obsidian, church bell bronze, ember nexus) provide a solid ground for the ritual. However, some descriptors veer into purple abstraction ("indigo syrup," "scaffold of awakening") that distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    Atmosphere is the story’s standout feature; the "frost-glazed metal" and "liquid silver" create a vivid, immersive world. The "Hollywood star fragment" functions excellently as a micro-setting and tool, grounding the cosmic concept in a specific, tangible artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    Imagery is vivid and cohesive ("phosphorescent pebbles," "liquid starlight"), successfully establishing a fable-like atmosphere. However, descriptions occasionally drift into decorative abstraction ("ozone and memory") that prioritizes aesthetic over grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong, vivid setting details ("marble cracked into lace," "walls breathing") effectively ground the surreal concept. The gallery functions as an active participant in the narrative, exerting pressure and reacting to the protagonist's weaving.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.5)
    The benthic setting is evocative, effectively grounding the abstract celestial concepts in the physical weight of the "crushing ocean"; sensory details like the "ink-black water" and "hiss" of the seal work well.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively using sensory details like "wet stone" and "wilted roses" to ground the supernatural elements. While some descriptions lean toward the ornamental ("veined with forgotten histories"), the environment successfully creates a coherent mood that supports the narrative's melancholic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmospheric details like "salt-crusted spoons" and "binary frost" effectively ground the metaphysical premise in a tactile reality. The setting feels lived-in and specific, though the "child’s drawing" prop leans heavily on sentimental shorthand rather than fresh observation. The environment effectively mirrors the theme of decay and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with vivid sensory details like "frost feathered the glass" and "spilled night" establishing a cohesive mood. The observatory acts as a resonant vessel for the themes of coldness and isolation, grounding the abstract digital concepts in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is active and integral to the plot; the "tunnel of echoes" and "towers of bone" act as dynamic mechanisms that shape the outcome rather than serving as mere backdrops. The sensory details are vivid and specific, grounding the magical realism in a tangible, acoustic geography.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sensory details are immersive and specific ("wet moss," "humming in E-flat," "silver thyme"), grounding the fantastical elements effectively. The setting actively participates in the climax, reacting to the gravitational shifts with distinct, visualized consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is the story’s strongest asset, with vivid, tactile imagery ("clouds frayed," "marble sentinels," "obsidian eyes"). The setting is distinct and richly textured, though it serves more as a canvas for the protagonist’s influence than a source of constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.0)
    The "cobalt arcade" provides a vivid backdrop, but the description often lapses into overwrought "purple" imagery ("shadows as if afraid," "neon flickering like dying stars") that distances the reader. A significant flaw is the sensory abstraction "condensation that smelled like ozone and regret"—attributing a smell to an abstract emotion breaks immersion and specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting is lush and visually distinct, effectively anchoring the fable-like tone. However, the description leans toward the ornamental, occasionally stalling narrative momentum with static density rather than interacting with the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "whispering archipelago" is established with vivid, atmospheric detail that grounds the magical elements. While the description is sometimes adjective-heavy ("salt-damp," "fog-choked," "tide-locked"), the setting effectively frames the isolation required for the story's mood.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is a collection of abstract fantasy tropes ("cosmic dust," "fractured moonstone") that fails to ground the reader in a tactile reality. The environment serves as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint or resource.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting relies on high-fantasy generalizations ("mist," "ancient memory," "ley lines") rather than specific, grounding details. While atmospheric, the environment serves as a passive backdrop for the ritual rather than a source of constraint or tactical difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.5)
    The "prism sanctuary" is atmospheric and vivid ("cathedral of captured starlight"), setting a strong mood. However, the description leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("liquid whispers"), occasionally unmooring the reader from the physical reality of the space.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    Atmospheric details are vivid ("mahogany shelves warped," "swollen into unreadable pulp"), effectively grounding the surreal elements. However, description relies heavily on similes ("whispered like librarians") which occasionally distances the reader from sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.2)
    Atmospheric details are vivid but rely on familiar tropes ("ozone," "struck crystal") and vague physics ("gravity felt optional") that blur orientation without narrative payoff. The setting serves as a passive backdrop rather than an active pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is atmospheric, with details like the "glacial bronze" bell and "frostbloom," though the descriptions often veer into ornamental excess ("cloth softer than snowfall"). The environment provides a backdrop but rarely constrains the character's choices or forces a tactical shift beyond the initial cipher reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is integral; the gondola’s isolation and the brass telescope’s physical limitations constrain the protagonist’s focus. The specific sensory details—the "breath fogging the cold eyepiece," the "creak" of the wicker—anchor the ethereal concept in a tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is integral, acting as both canvas and ticking clock; the hollowed tree and the coin constrain choices and shape the physical action. Sensory details are specific (moss-crusted, faint indentations) and filtered strictly through the protagonist's tactile bias.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and integral to the plot; the "stranded luminance" and starling murmurations create a distinct, memorable atmosphere.

    The setting is vivid and inventive, utilizing specific sensory details like "petrified root-veins," "gravity-marbles," and "upside-down trees" to effectively ground the fantasy. The environment actively shapes the imagery, though the "Glass Canopy" leans slightly into list-like description.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, successfully establishing a mythic, terminal mood. Sensory details like "salt-worn stone" and the "viscous, golden" silence ground the abstract concept of the lighthouse effectively. The environment actively shapes the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting acts as a dynamic constraint; the mechanical birds directly dictate the caretaker’s indirect methods (moss, pebbles), fulfilling the high-band requirement for environment shaping tactics. Sensory details like "clockwork currents" and "silver sap" are vivid and strictly filtered through the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and functionally integrated; the ravine’s physical properties (braided streams, foam) actively drive the protagonist’s internal logic. The focus on micro-details like foam structure effectively grounds the abstract theme.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and immersive, successfully establishing a surreal, ethereal atmosphere ("glass orchard," "clouds," "ozone") that anchors the metaphysical commerce. While evocative, the description occasionally leans on stock fantasy imagery ("pearlescent gates," "swirling sea") that borders on ornamental. The environment integrates well with the plot, specifically the glass countertop used for the ritual incisions.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    The juxtaposition of the arid, rain-slicked fortress and the subterranean, frozen coral pavilion creates a memorable and distinct atmosphere. Sensory details are prioritized well, particularly the taste-based descriptions ("salt and silence," "metallic tang") which ground the magical elements in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    The atmospheric details of the clock tower and elevator are vivid ("copper wires," "stained glass"), establishing a fable-like tone. However, the physical logic connecting the tower to the valley via "seismic whispers" is tenuous, and the reliance on abstract imagery occasionally unmoors the reader from the scene's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is vivid and specific ("shale," "juniper," "binary hoots"), effectively grounding the abstract mental work in a physical space. However, the environment serves largely as an atmospheric backdrop for internal monologue rather than offering constraints that force difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    The inverted gravity setting is vivid and functionally constrains movement, forcing the protagonist to navigate the underside of the bridge. The sensory details ("falling water that now rose") effectively ground the fantastical physics in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.4)
    The specific focus on the porcelain insulator and the alder grove creates a vivid, albeit static, tableau. However, the setting functions largely as a passive recipient of the protagonist's magic rather than an environment that imposes constraints or friction on his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the atmosphere is consistently rendered, the setting functions as a mood board rather than a concrete environment with rules that constrain the character. Terms like "magnetic nexus" and "unseen polarities" remain vague abstractions that do not force tactical adjustments or physical engagement beyond the symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with specific details ("meteorite iron," "hummingbird vertebrae") that actively constrain the protagonist's tuning method.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sensory work is vivid and specific, particularly the olfactory details which effectively ground the reader in Elira’s perspective. The treetop village and greenhouse are distinct and textured, though the setting functions more as a backdrop than a source of active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is integral to the plot mechanics; the dew trails acting as compass needles and the gravity tide creating the window of action are brilliant. The environment constrains the protagonist's choices and charges the final image with resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting acts as a dynamic antagonist; the specific interaction between the wind and the container geometry is vivid and constrains the protagonist's actions. The atmosphere is tactile ("salt-crusted gravel," "rusted steel"), elevating the premise beyond a simple backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    The sensory imagery is vivid and consistent with the synesthetic premise, though it occasionally strays into catalogue-like listing. The ice cavern is realized with specific textures ("fused crystal," "liquid sapphire"), though the environment supports rather than pressures the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "Thunder-echo Range" is rendered with strong sensory detail ("driftwood bleached silver," "shadows pooled"), anchoring the scene effectively. However, the magical "between-place" relies on somewhat abstract descriptors ("gradient of forgotten hues," "gravity bent politely") that lack the visceral specificity of the canyon.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "topaz workshop" and "vanishing stars" create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that supports the melancholic tone. However, the setting feels somewhat staged and hermetic, functioning as a backdrop for the concept rather than an environment the character interacts with in a tactile, consequential way.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid ("frost that sang," "moth-wing silk"), effectively supporting the fable-like tone. However, the imagery occasionally drifts into generic fantasy tropes (archives, oracles, singing jewels) rather than grounding the reader in specific, gritty constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.8)
    Atmosphere is consistent, but the spatial logic—a wrecked car parked immediately next to a "quartz arbor" with a "crystalline trellis"—creates friction; the setting feels more like a symbolic dreamscape than a grounded reality, lacking concrete spatial anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.4)
    The orchard and bamboo forest are rendered with vivid, if slightly generic, sensory details that establish a coherent mood. The immersion is broken by the unexplained presence of the modern "rummage sale box" in a fantasy setting where "no roads led," which strains world consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and imaginative, with the floating arches and orchard roots creating a distinct physical reality that informs the plot. The "mine shafts" and "twin suns" are well-integrated, though some descriptions ("liquid twilight") lean towards the ornamental rather than the strictly sensory.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sensory detailing is the story's strongest asset, effectively contrasting the tactile grime of the abandoned bay with the sterile hum of the alternate universe. The setting functions not just as a backdrop but as the primary tool for the protagonist's navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is atmospheric, with specific details like the stone cairn codes grounding the scene. However, descriptors like "velvet dark" and "bruised twilight" lean toward generic literary clichés, slightly diminishing the vividness of the locale.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and imaginative, effectively grounding the mythic tone with details like "wind chimes forged from lightning" and "jade meteorite." The imagery is consistent and distinct, though the high density of descriptors occasionally slows the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sensory details like the "moss-carved ledge" and "iridescent caution" establish a strong, cohesive atmosphere. However, the setting primarily functions as a static backdrop; the "floating" nature of the tea house is ornamental and does not constrain the protagonist’s choices or impose necessary physical pressure on the action.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and integral; the moonlight is not just atmospheric but functions as a necessary tool for the sextant’s repair, constraining the action. Sensory details like "damp stone" and "stormlit tower" effectively ground the magical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "mica window sheets" are a specific, constraining material choice that grounds the magical atmosphere and visually anchors the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, establishing the magical library effectively. However, elements like cookbooks that require weeping border on whimsical twee, and the description occasionally stalls momentum to deliver static imagery ("frescoes depicting owls").

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sensory details are vivid and establish a strong, melancholic atmosphere ("vines swallow marble," "moss muffles footsteps"). The overgrown courtyard and tea house effectively constrain the protagonist's movement and mirror her internal state. The setting actively participates in the mood, though the "secret tea house" feels slightly standard for this genre.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with specific sensory details ("quartz hush," "obsidian lectern") creating a cohesive, immersive atmosphere. The environment acts as a tangible constraint on the pacing and reinforces the themes of cold preservation versus fading warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with sensory details like "singing eels" and "salt-rotted shadows" creating a vivid, specific world. The setting actively masks the protagonist's approach, integrating well with the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sensory specificities are excellent, particularly the "tasting" of direction (copper, ozone, honey), which acts as a vivid micro-setting and navigation tool. The environment of the lavender bluff and the aurora feels tangible and atmospheric, actively shaping the mood and the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.8)
    Atmosphere is heavy with modifiers ("auroral sorrow," "ancient grief") that create a distancing, purple effect. Physical details like geodes "fallen" like leaves and tears "sizzling" into steam strain credibility and distract from the setting's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptional, acting as an antagonist that physically pressures the character through "ambient untruths." The sensory details—ochre glow, humidity, ghost vines—are vivid and create a cohesive, oppressive atmosphere that directly influences the plot mechanics. The integration of the "wilting" mechanic with the toxic environment elevates the setting to a 9+ constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is atmospherically vivid but operates as a static backdrop for exposition rather than a dynamic environment that constrains choice. While the "kinetic sculpture" and "iceberg" are distinct images, they serve illustrative purposes in a montage rather than interacting with the protagonist's tactics in a singular moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with strong sensory details like "crimson sand" and "bioglass." The imagery of the internal desert rose farm is particularly effective, though the "nursery wing" arrives late as a setting element, functioning more as a closing image than an integrated space.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.1)
    The courtyard and shop are atmospherically consistent, invoking a cozy, magical sanctuary vibe. However, the details (jasmine, dew, cracked planter) are safe and familiar choices that do not constrain the characters or heighten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is the story’s strongest asset, employing vivid sensory details like "silt-choked glass" and "phosphorescent algae" to create a distinct, pressurized mood. The setting actively constrains the protagonist, though the specific geography beyond the central chamber remains somewhat vague.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific imagery ("salt crystals spiraled upward... under violet lamps") that grounds the magical realism. The physical environment (salt, gravity) actively constrains and shapes the visualization of the anomalies.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.6)
    The setting is a generic fantasy backdrop ("nocturnal haven," "quiet brook") described with abstract phrasing rather than grounded sensory detail. Terms like "terrestrially cosmic rhythm" are clunky and break immersion, failing to anchor the reader in a specific place.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting functions as a third character, with "creaks" and "sighs" providing necessary resistance and texture to the plot. The sensory details—from the "tea-stained receipts" to the "patina catching starlight"—are vivid and distinct, charging the final image with significant atmospheric pressure. The building’s sentience is established not just as flavor, but as the central constraint of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting relies on "velvet," "sighing," and "weeping" clichés that generate a generic poetic atmosphere rather than a specific, grounded reality. The environment functions as a backdrop for introspection rather than a source of constraints or resources that shape the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and integral to the magic system, with the aurora and sanctuary walls interacting with the ink. However, the descriptions lean toward the ornate ("velvet pouch stitched with moon-silk," "mother-of-pearl"), occasionally prioritizing decoration over atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is evoked with rich, sensory-laden imagery ("wind-carved hollows," "spiraling rock arches") that effectively establishes a mythic atmosphere. While the atmosphere is strong, the description occasionally leans into abstract density that distances the reader from the physical immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integral to the plot; the specific tactile details of the "melted snow globe" and the "glacier shrine" ground the ethereal concept and constrain the ritual effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    The atmospheric details (“wet silk banners,” “droplets still trembling”) are vivid and establish a strong, specific mood. However, the setting remains a backdrop for contemplation rather than a source of friction or constraint that forces a tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric ("blossoms glowed faintly," "roots drinking poisoned earth"), anchoring the story effectively. However, the description sometimes leans into adjective-heavy filtering ("gamma winds," "tragic") that tells the reader how to feel about the environment rather than letting the sensory details do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is vivid but overwritten with decorative adjectives ("cobalt," "sapphire," "frozen"), creating a "purple" atmosphere that distances the reader. While details like "frost-glazed metal grates" offer some tactile grounding, elements like "equations scrawled on the walls" feel like staged set-dressing rather than integrated environmental constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with evocative sensory details ("salt-wind," "crackling dune grass") that ground the fable-like tone. The setting supports the mood effectively, though the specific geography remains somewhat generic.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.7)
    Atmospheric details like the "drift-ice marina" and "bioluminescent moss" are vivid and effectively ground the ethereal concepts in physical space. The setting actively integrates with the plot mechanics (vibration through ice), though some descriptors lean slightly toward purple prose ("kissed the horizon," "bleeding amber").

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.5)
    The imagery is evocative ("iron bones gleaming," "star charts folded like prayers"), but the setting feels like a static stage for the metaphor rather than a tactile environment. The lack of specific interaction beyond symbolic gestures ("kneeling," "tracing") limits immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmospheric and tactile; details like "wet wool," "diesel residue," and the "crunching over grit" create a vivid, claustrophobic setting. The sensory environment effectively mirrors the thematic weight of the suffocated history.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is tactile and specific, acting as more than a backdrop; the tools, the "tarnished brass," and the "clockwork heart" constrain the protagonist’s actions and drive the plot. The sensory details ("lemon oil," "clicking," "humming") create a cohesive atmosphere that supports the story's reverent tone.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.3)
    The workshop and acid sea are rendered with vivid, sensory specificity ("dripping green mist," "floating anvils") that grounds the fantastical elements. The setting effectively constrains the action, forcing a hasty landing and creating atmospheric pressure, though "drunken cog-toy" strains slightly for effect.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is atmospheric and integral to the plot; the archive is not just a backdrop but a "resonance chamber" that defines the story's logic. Sensory details like the "humming behind frosted glass" and the "scorched thread" of the patch ground the sci-fi elements in tactile reality. The environment actively constrains the protagonist's choices and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.5)
    The lighthouse orchard and ice floes provide a distinct, surreal visual backdrop that anchors the scene. However, the setting operates more as a symbolic stage than a physical reality that pressures the character, with details feeling ornamental rather than tactile or constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Arctic setting is integral to the plot, acting as both a soundscape and an antagonist. The specific acoustic details (groaning floes, calving bergs) actively drive the protagonist's motivation and the climax, making the environment indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.5)
    Setting details are vivid and purposeful; the "amber pavilion" and "gnarled oak" effectively frame the emotional beats. The vineyard environment is well-integrated into the central argument (vines as metaphor), though some descriptions veer into overwrought territory ("pyre of her own making").

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, atmospheric details like "petrified vines" and the "kinetic parapet." However, the atmosphere relies heavily on abstract descriptors ("ancient ache," "duality of truth") rather than concrete, grounded interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sensory details are vivid ("scent of aged paper," "chimney swifts") but operate as decorative atmosphere rather than narrative constraints. The setting frames the character's mood but never pressures her choices or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmospheric details ("dust-thick spines," "silence pooled like ink") are vivid and effectively ground the scene. The setting feels distinct and lived-in, though the physical properties of the "sonically reflective" environment drift into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific, particularly the "Betamax relics" and "fog sculpture garden." The atmosphere effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal state, though "towers... like tombstones" is a slightly generic simile.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with strong specific details like "tears crystallizing in low gravity" and "stars... like faulty bulbs." The imagery consistently supports the ethereal tone, grounding the abstract concepts in visible, tactile elements.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.0)
    The "radiant haven" is an abstract, sentimental backdrop lacking specific, grounding constraints. Sensory details like "scent of hope" and "cloud-light" are metaphorical and vague, failing to create a tangible environment that shapes the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmosphere is vivid and specific ("clung like a barnacle," "liquid night"), effectively grounding the surreal setting. However, the inherent absurdity of the "spoon" premise creates a tonal dissonance with the solemn high-fantasy elements that is never fully reconciled.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sensory details are vivid but list-like ("cinnamon and ozone," "clocks ticked backward"), functioning as atmospheric wallpaper rather than constraints that shape the character's tactics. The setting feels like a catalog of magical tropes; while the "hollow chest cavity stuffed with lavender" is a strong image, the environment generally lacks the friction required to force specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.5)
    The atmospheric details of the grotto, mist, and "moss-slick stones" are vivid and establish a strong, cohesive mood. The sensory immersion is effective, though the specific phrase "reflectively vibrant" feels jarringly distinct from the otherwise organic descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.8)
    Atmosphere is vivid but relies on familiar "ruin-nature" tropes ("emerald moss," "ancient monoliths"); the setting accommodates the character rather than providing resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmosphere is vivid and consistent, with the "feral nexus" feeling distinct from the pier. However, the reliance on simile to describe the setting ("reality frayed like old parchment," "gulls crying like editors") occasionally draws attention to the author's hand rather than the world itself.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmospheric detailing is the story's strength, with vivid imagery like the "knot split open like a mouth," though the setting serves as a backdrop rather than a source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's defining strength, with vivid, tactile imagery ("breath curled... like slow smoke," "ice cracked its knuckles") that creates a cohesive subarctic mood. The setting actively informs the pacing, grounding the magical elements in a tangible, hostile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.3)
    The cavern is vividly realized with specific details like "veined with quartz" and "slick with condensation" that ground the action. However, the setting is occasionally obscured by heavy metaphorical layering (e.g., "marble throat of the earth") that distances the reader from the physical reality of the space. The environment effectively constrains the light-based method, serving the plot well.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and integral to the magic system, with the bronze/oxidation motif grounding the abstract concept of calcification. The environment actively constrains the ritual (aligning with the magnetic seam), satisfying the requirement for setting as a tool.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and functional; the "rain-beaded skylight" and "wet cedar" establish a strong sensory baseline. The light interacting with the carving at the closure charges the final image effectively. The environment is well-integrated into the character's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the kinetic lagoon and the frozen carousel are vivid, specific, and perfectly externalize the theme of suspended ambition. The sensory details ("salt-crusted planks," "faulty neon") ground the surreal concept effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory details like "prismatic shards" and "ruptured geothermal line" grounding the space. However, the "spaceport" aspect functions mostly as aesthetic skin; the mechanics of the setting rarely constrain the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the &quot;soundless sanctuary&quot; and &quot;time pooled like mercury&quot; create a palpable, immersive atmosphere. The sensory details are specific and tone-perfect, actively contributing to the mood. The environment interacts with the character (clocks softening) effectively, grounding the abstract themes.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.0)
    Atmospheric details like "moss-slicked" and "rotting pilings" are vivid and establish a strong mood. However, the conflicting time markers (morning radio vs. evening stars/violet light) destabilize the setting's reality, making the "when" of the scene impossible to pin down.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sensory details are vivid and specific, successfully grounding the abstract themes in concrete elements like "tarred" rope and "salt-sting." The atmosphere actively supports the pacing, though "golden dock" creates a minor lighting ambiguity against the descriptions of fog and snow.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmosphere is rich and specific ("damp stone," "lichen tears"), effectively mirroring the melancholic tone. The setting supports the mood well, though the imagery relies heavily on standard "ruined garden" tropes (weeping nymphs, withered rosebush) rather than surprising sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with strong sensory details ("crushed beetle shell," "mineral tears") that reinforce the theme. The environment actively mirrors the protagonist's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and specific, with the "obsidian lagoon" and "black sand" effectively grounding the magical realism. The environment actively participates in the ritual, providing a tactile anchor for the ethereal elements.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory details are vivid (scent of lilac, condensation patterns), but the world-building suffers from the aforementioned logic gap regarding time. The "forgotten city" trope is rendered with atmospheric competence but relies on generic signifiers (moss, dust, pigeon bones) rather than specific, pressurized constraints that force the character to adapt.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "nebula garden" is established with vivid, atmospheric lyricism ("veils of violet and ember"). However, the opening sentence contains a jarring tautology ("petals... fell... across the quiet sigh of falling petals") that breaks the otherwise strong immersion of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, successfully grounding the narrative in the specific sensory details of the greenhouse and the butterflies. The environment participates in the mood, though it functions more as a beautiful backdrop than a source of constraint or active pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "tidal obsidian ridge" and "salt-wind" are rendered with vivid, tactile specificity that mirrors the protagonist's harsh, eroding internal state. The environment actively pressures the character, transforming the tower into a "jagged altar" that enhances the mood effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.5)
    The silo and tapestry provide a vivid, constraining environment that shapes the action, particularly the use of the needle. However, the atmosphere occasionally tips into purple prose ("liquid twilight," "velvet gloom") which softens the scene's edges rather than sharpening them with sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is rendered with vivid, specific imagery (obsidian spire, kingfisher quill, lichen glyphs) that establishes a strong, mythic atmosphere. However, the environment acts primarily as a backdrop; the cold and isolation do not actively constrain the protagonist's choices or force tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with constraints like the "story famine" and the radio's heat-based interface grounding the fantasy. The sensory details ("phantom flour," "moth-wing thread") are specific and effectively build the world's texture.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.7)
    The gallery setting is rendered with strong sensory specificities ("charcoal portrait," "rocking chair") that effectively establish a somber mood. However, the setting serves largely as a backdrop for the ritual rather than providing physical constraints that force the character to adapt her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the piece's strongest element, effectively using "sedimentary layers" and the "inverted archive" to ground abstract themes in concrete geography. Details like the oilcloth and floodlines on spires create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that supports the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with the "velvet library" and "zither rosette" providing a vivid, tactile anchor for the atmosphere. The sensory details effectively support the theme of stillness and preservation, though the description occasionally risks becoming static.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "rusted greenhouse" is rendered with vivid, specific sensory details (iron rot, damp earth) that ground the magical elements. The environment actively frames the action, though the celestial alignment acts more as atmospheric background than a pressuring constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the tower isn't just a backdrop but the mechanical enabler of the twist (collecting lightning/charge). Sensory details like "copper veins," "salt marshes," and "crystallized nectar" create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that supports the fable-like tone.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.5)
    Atmosphere is established with vivid, if occasionally purple, imagery ("silence pooled like spilled ink"). While the "manicured hedge three blocks inland" offers grounding specificity, the setting often dissolves into abstract metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underwater atmosphere is the story’s strongest asset, with vivid, specific details ("foxglove-stained glass," "jellyfish lanterns") that effectively ground the fable. The setting actively informs the "fluidity" theme, merging environment with narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    The surreal atmosphere is established quickly with "illusion wrapped in geometry." While the staircase itself is somewhat abstract, the sensory details of the flashback (ozone, cheap perfume) ground the emotion effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.1)
    Atmospheric details are vivid and consistent ("confession booth for colors," "stubborn dew"), establishing a strong lyrical mood. However, the setting primarily serves as a backdrop; the "smog-choked" nature of the city provides contrast but does not actively constrain the protagonist's tactics or force improvisation.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the piece's standout feature, with the "rosewater dread" and "damp stone arches" creating a vivid, specific atmosphere. The sensory details are consistent and evocative, grounding the fable-like tone in a tangible physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.7)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with the lighthouse and hunger stone rendered in vivid, tactile detail that grounds the magical elements. The physical environment (tide, salt, stone) effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal desolation, though the "pulsing glyphs" veer slightly into generic fantasy tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.7)
    Atmospheric details like "grease on glass" and "ozone and old roses" create a vivid, cohesive sensory experience. The "photographically cursed" visual motif integrates well with the funhouse setting, though the carnival tropes themselves remain familiar.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sensory details are vivid and inventive, particularly the "roots drinking salt" and the "liquid xylophone." The setting effectively constrains the action. However, the descriptive impact is dulled by the repetitive syntactic structures used to convey these details.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is evocative and tightly integrated, with the "cracked carapace map" and "city built on the shells" serving as both atmosphere and plot constraints. The physical details of the world (salt, shadow, turtle ridges) effectively ground the speculative elements. "Sunwashed dread" is woven well into the environmental description.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is atmospheric and specific, with strong sensory details like the "smell of vellum" and "cold brass." While it leans on some abandoned-place tropes (ivy strangling, broken skylights), the environment effectively mirrors the theme of buried history.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "barnacle-crowns" and "coughing seaweed" create a vivid, entropic environment that actively pressures the protagonist. The submerged pavilion feels lived-in and distinct. The sensory details ("smell of cedar," "brackish water") ground the surreal premise effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with specific, tactile details like "silt-choked aisle" and "shattered skylight choked with kelp" grounding the sunken setting. The environment actively pressures the character, though the "muffled chaos" abstract description slightly dilutes the sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and actively participates in the narrative, with elements like the "glass basilica" and "tea garden" grounding the surreal mechanics. The environment meaningfully constrains the action (the inverted sky) and charges the final image (petals unfolding in reverse).

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    The "Cradle of Cold Eyes" provides a vivid, isolating environment that mirrors the protagonist's internal state. Sensory details like magnetized boots, the chilled glass, and the geode's violet filaments successfully ground the high-concept premise.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory setting is rendered with vivid specificity, utilizing details like "velvet-lined obsidian" and "trapped constellations" to ground the scene. The atmosphere is palpable, though the specific phrase "brilliant dimness" leans toward abstract description rather than sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    The atmospheric details are evocative, grounding the surreal premise with sensory specificity like "tiles cool beneath Elira’s bare feet" and "salt and bile." The "cobalt terrace" and "driftwood carvings" create a vivid, cohesive environment that effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting establishes a coherent atmosphere that supports the "neutral territory" concept, utilizing the parapet and mist effectively. While functional, the description leans on generic "storm-worn" tropes without the specific, tactile details required to make the location feel singular.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.8)
    Atmosphere is vivid and consistent, with "rusted and leaning" poles and "bruised twilight" effectively setting the mood. However, the environment functions largely as a pathetic fallacy reflecting the protagonist's emotions rather than providing distinct physical resistance or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, using "forgotten neon" and "ozone and wet stone" to ground the speculative elements in sensory detail. The environment is not just a backdrop but an active participant, with the bioluminescent lake providing the mechanism for the protagonist's internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific details like "saffron that wept gold tears" and "branches leaned closer." The setting successfully supports the fairy-tale tone.

    Ice, aurora, and rope fiber function as micro-setting: the caster’s fingertips read the cold braid like braille, and the thawing drip provides the story’s only metronome. Every sensory anchor is filtered through artisanal necessity; the sanctum’s geometry is never catalogued, yet spatial choreography stays clean as the rope slackens and the mold is cracked.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    The vine-draped bunker functions as micro-setting: its corroded grates dictate Elara’s foot placement and the ivy-choked vents literalize the AI’s “breath” dying. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she notices damp moss and rusted steel first, not tourist-catalog fauna. The final image of roots swallowing steel in under a minute is spatially coherent and charges the closure by showing the bunker’s surrender, not just describing decay.</answer>

    <comment>Dominant stake—why paths choose walkers—signals early and tightens once when the dream reveals the wrist-grabbing road, forcing her stance crystallization. Cost is present but soft: she forfeits the shelter (the bunker collapses) yet walks away unhurt, so the price is conceptual rather than visceral; still, the forest’s salute shows the world has reweighted her options. Agency is internalized attention/renunciation, appropriate to the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cracked ziggurat terrace functions as micro-setting: its dust coats the robe, its dais must align with Sirius, constraining bodily placement. Palace memory (ivy, throne gaps) is filtered through POV priorities—what an astronomer notices is acoustic resonance in stone, not royal heraldry. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel → uncloak → lay tile → sketch → rise → descend, no impossible positions. Environment charges the final image: the bronze door seals a vibration into stone that will outlive regimes.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access the cosmic frequency—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the tile actually hums, foreclosing the option to abandon vigils. Cost is visceral: winter cloak sold, barley cake supper, page 3,412 of logged silence. No antagonist needed; pressure is coherent cosmic indifference. The hum’s activation is not luck but the earned payoff of sacrificed comfort, making the final stance crystallization legible.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sanctuary’s flicker between stone, glass, mist is selective, sensory, and directly guides the final choice to walk into dissolving walls. Music box as micro-setting constrains the beat: broken pin silences action, then becomes relic. Environmental mirroring (edges blur as she lets go) charges the closure image without overt symbolism. Meets 9+ gate: environment materially shapes the tactics of release.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ruined orchard, frost-timing, and broken sextant shards together constrain every ritual move; fog thickness dictates visio-spatial limits and the breathing cadence is keyed to twilight frost. Micro-setting (obsidian disc, brass fragments) functions as manipulable terrain that directly enables the final fusion—no descriptive detail is idle.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    The orchard-cathedral is not backdrop but toolkit: ivy-woven ladder, rose-thorn at the exit, fruit weight warping beams—all constrain how the mender climbs, reaches, and ultimately where the daughter can leave the scrap. Sensory triangulation (honey’s stick, parchment curl, dew on cheek) keeps the space three-dimensional. Cathedral light through stained glass literally colors the vows, making the setting an active sorter of promises. Spatial choreography is flawless: we track ladder, branch, spoon, boot, doorway without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.7)
    The astral orchard is not backdrop but instrument: petal-names of unborn selves literally dissolve into skin, constraining her future options. Micro-setting (the maintenance alcove toilet) becomes the crucible where environment and plumbing conspire to force revelation. Sensory economy is excellent—ozone/petrichor, embryo-star fruit—each detail filtered through her archivist bias. Spatial anchors hold across the zero-g drift; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mountain-bookstore is sensory and causal: stone shelves spiral into “shadowed vaults above and below,” and gravity “stutter[s]” to resist Kael’s rise. The hollow shaped like an open codex functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice—only Elira’s blank page fits. Ozone and old paper scent the air like a live circuit, anchoring chronal fracture. Spatial choreography stays clean as they walk “past aisles where books grew like vines,” the setting evolving with the decision it enables.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Micro-setting triumph: the emerald card evolves from color token to skeleton key, constraining the final opening beat. Fog-thinned bay and oil-slick constellations mirror internal liquidity of identity without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is airtight: descent route, valve wheel, staircase track believably. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile and olfactory—copper/cinnamon memory—grounding abstract premise in bodily experience.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Brass-oil air, uneven tick, and stone worn smooth are selective, pressure-filtered details that guide her tactile choices.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.2)
    The harmonic caves are not backdrop but instrument: limestone throats, glacial seams, thermal vents all dictate how hush can be harvested. Micro-setting (echo stone, ice fractures) literally constrains her method and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no description is tourism—every detail either amplifies or absorbs frequency.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.0)
    The pavilion is not backdrop but instrument: its fractured glass sings under starlight, constraining the exact angle she must adjust. Micro-setting (the prism’s fracture depth, the fused-glass tripod) determines success or collapse of vision. Weather (wind scrubbing sky clean) is causal—without it Polaris would not strike true. Final image of thistles “bowed in reverence” recharges the setting with transformed meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Observatory, crystal forecourt, and solidified fog function as micro-settings that constrain movement and supply the memory-reading surface; the brass telescope aimed at “echoes between stars” charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—archivist notices refraction angles, not tourist vistas—anchoring the speculative physics in tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.0)
    The fortress is not backdrop but instrument: petals release phosphor only under sole pressure, vines recoil from moonlight—rules that directly shape Lira’s stealth choreography. Micro-setting of the kerosene rag knot constrains her final choice; its absorption into tile is the closing visual. Sensory hierarchy is pyrotechnic: scent of kerosene, taste of ozone, tactile thrum of C-note up the shin. No exposition dump; world logic is discovered through footfall. The blooming iron lattice above replaces collapsed ceiling, a literal charged image that houses the star-reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    Grotto breathes—stalactite metronome, minor-chord wind in molars—micro-setting becomes body. Starlight on jade cicada charges final image; pool surface mirrors both cosmos and fracture of memory, constraining her theory of granular time. Spatial choreography flawless: footprints lead in, tidal-pool edge, cicada placement tracked without drift. Sensory economy favors touch and sound over visual spectacle, matching her haptic epistemology.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.1)
    Bunker steel, condensation beads, and thumb-high doll are tactile micro-settings that constrain every move. Xenial trellis is not postcard flora—its vines curl like “affectionate cats,” actively steadying the climb and deciding the landing spot. Spatial choreography stays clean: up shafts, through hatch, onto petal, sideways fold to garden—bodies never ghost. Environment charges the final image: moss receives the gold-thread doll, fusing setting + object + closure. Meets 9+ gate: setting dictates final tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    Iridescent tiles, chime-trees, upward waterfall are vivid, selective, and woven through action; terrace geometry is the micro-setting that literally guides tilt and tone. Every new sensory note also feeds the “texture of sound” conceit, so description never stalls momentum. Tool (storm glass) constrains choices—he lifts or lowers it to modulate resonance and thus satisfies 9+ gate for element-charged closure. Spatial choreography clean: bodies, bench, ramp positions track without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hidden orchard rendered through synesthetic compression (“mist-laced air,” “liquid starlight”) that doubles as temporal interface; setting actively gates progress—veil collapses at sunrise, hatch opens only under flake. Micro-setting (ivy nano-filaments, alloyed moonrock hatch) constrains interaction and charges final image when orchard pixelates out. Spatial choreography stays clean across spiral descent. Environment’s erasure at end directly supplies the closure cost; satisfies 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sanctuary’s charcoal dust, starlight pool, and dissolving threshold act as micro-setting that literally constrains movement and finally collapses the choice space. Sensory economy is ruthless: only ash, chill, burnt-sugar air, and the knocker’s weight—each returned and re-valued. Spatial choreography is pristine; the barefoot step, the palm press, the lantern field beyond track without a drift. Missing the 9+ gate only because the body-as-setting (scars) does not quite alter tactics in the final step; it is memory, not physical limit.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mushroom farm is not backdrop; its glowing caps breathe proximity and mirror her emotional flares, while the bolt-as-micro-setting literally pierces the seam to rewire reality. Sensory selection is urgent: mineral air, ozone drip, ozone-library smell—all filtered through scavenger-survivor bias. Spatial choreography remains clean through the single continuous scene. Final image—singing mushrooms harmonizing with bolt—recharges every prior glow.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.7)

Spatial choreography is clean—she rises once, door awaits, no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Alchemical greenhouse is not backdrop but agonist: mercury roots rise to question, nectar reverses flow, ceiling dissolves into vortex that rethreads his joints. Micro-setting succeeds—armor hinges, marionette program pages, copper troughs—each handled and altered. Sensory hierarchy favors taste (dissolved time) and kinesthetic release over visual catalog. Final image of “soil that sings” fuses body and world, meeting the 9+ constraint by charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    The file room is rendered through tactile micro-setting—spines, fluorescent hum, slanted light—each detail filtering her archivist gaze and guiding choice (where she angles the lamp). The button functions as a recurring object that constrains her next move and finally charges the compass image. Spatial choreography is flawless: desk, shelf, lamp, shadows track cleanly. Only a single weather cliché (“afternoon light”) and one unattached brand mention (“magnifying lamp”) keep it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.2)
    The lagoon’s starlit grid literally routes her footsteps to the submerged hatch; water temperature and mirrored constellations constrain timing and body stance. Final image re-weights the same lagoon as both crime-scene and birthplace of public memory—setting as tool and tomb.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.0)
    The saxophone body becomes micro-setting—valves condensing dew that lenses the prism’s last glow, directly constraining his embouchure shift. Negative space is rendered as tactile fog that “curls like smoke around silence,” forcing him to play absence instead of sound. Spatial choreography is flawless: droplets freeze mid-fall, stalactite lips are tracked, and the arch’s empty curve at the end is the exact negative of the vanished prism. Environment is inseparable from tactic; remove the mist-and-crystal physics and the counter-spell fails.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ashen skyborne arbor is no backdrop; its petrified-root canopy and coded leaf-fall constrain every action and supply the story’s lexicon. The moonstone speck functions as micro-setting—embedded in bark crevices, it literally stitches memory into matter. Spatial choreography is clean: root-knot → fern-tip → wrist → monuments. Final image of root-fiber grandmother charges the environment with undeniable conceptual cost.

Final shop sign shows environment re-shaped by new ethos.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    The foundry’s cold anvil, warped skylights, and wet-iron scent constrain every placement of crucible and footstep; the golden seam that remains on the anvil after the dust ascends is the charged micro-setting that reconfigures meaning. Spatial choreography is spotless—no floating rooms. Environment is not backdrop; it supplies the crucible surface that literally holds her fracture-gold and becomes the sacred relic left behind.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.0)
    Echo Gorge is not backdrop but instrument: fissures snag wind, stones sing off-key, narrowing walls force her to kneel and play. Micro-setting rule: the misaligned harp’s geology constrains how she pursues and ultimately harmonizes souls. Crocodile tooth functions as portable Styx-vein, its warming amber glow charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy stays biased to her task—sound over sight—so every descriptor advances integration pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ultraviolet forest is not backdrop but instrument: soil that “ripples like equations solving themselves” constrains navigation and charges the final image when the strap dissolves into the same light. Sensory hierarchy is wounded-specific—only the damaged see the spectral violet—so setting filters through POV bias. Spatial choreography is clean: trunk, clearing, path of bending light track without drift. One minor slip: canopy description edges toward purple-prose density, but it pays off in the reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    The swaying rope bridges, crow-feather shawls, and bottled storms are economically selected, each filtering through the translator’s barefoot, scent-oriented bias. The lens itself functions as micro-setting: its cold-to-warm pulse and captured twilight physically constrain the act of seeing and thus charge the climax. Spatial choreography is pristine—no impossible moves from market to attic to return stall. Sensory hierarchy narrows under urgency (lanterns “hum,” gears “tick like heartbeats”), mirroring the narrator’s attuned attention rather than tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ticket office is textured through technician’s tool-mediated gaze: popcorn-sawdust smell, water-stained tile, moonlit dust curls. The mainspring barrel doubles as micro-setting that refracts light and reveals footprints—environment actively constrains discovery. Single drop into bucket at end re-weights the silence, fusing setting and closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Glass orchard, cloud-sea, frost patterns, and the letterpress are not backdrop—they dictate tactics: frost supplies the map, glass shelves refract the whisper’s chaos, the press warps under new glyphs. Final compressed moment is shelved inside a book that literally didn’t exist before, turning setting into archive. Micro-setting (bottled whisper) constrains the rupture’s scale. Minor cap: environment does not physically impede her body, so stays under 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    The asteroid’s baroque ruin is not backdrop but instrument: low gravity lets dust motes swirl like slow scripture, the gilded balcony becomes a pulpit for dawn, and fossilized starlight in the marble literalizes “burnished sorrow.” The shard functions as micro-setting—its refracted glyphs map directly onto the ceiling, constraining decoding tactics. Chrono-ribbons outside serve as both clock and weather, bending perception so that covering mirrors is materially necessary, not symbolic. Spatial choreography stays clean as the two bodies orbit the shard beneath the ceiling screen.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)

Sensory hierarchy is caretaker-specific: salt, sweat, and bird pause dominate over visual spectacle. Final image of darkened copper and thickened oaks recharges the opening promise that architecture can be grown, not imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rainwashed tower is not backdrop but catalyst: lichen equations, concentric knee-rings, stone that turns longing to limestone. Micro-setting is the amber itself—handled, placed, abandoned—its fossilized wingbeat mirroring her suspended arrival. Environment constrains the final choice: only by leaving the control sample can she exit the reaction chamber. Sensory hierarchy stays POV-bound (petrichor, iron, mother’s soap), never touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.4)
    Setting is not backdrop but instrument: jetty planks yield soil, moss, ash; tide supplies kelp and closure; birds deliver verbs, not accompaniment. The “blooming jetty” is a micro-setting that literally bears the ritual—pods crushed on wood, ash worked into cracks—so removing it would collapse the act. Twilight’s color progression (orange → indigo → purple bruise) paces the rite without declaring time. Each sensory note is filtered through the coachman’s professional body: drought-cracked palms test dampness, tongue clicks mimic pebbles, lungs measure wind—no tourist catalog, only tools he needs to bargain with the dead.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.0)
    The scrapyard is not backdrop but instrument: children play on tank hulls, elders burn circuit boards, the turntable is hand-cranked—every object is lived-in and altered by use. The wax leaf is micro-setting that charges the final image; its umber/ochre glow projects the color-code of revelation onto walls of rust. Spatial choreography is clean: eastward trek past wind turbines to the bunker, interior rows of cylinders, nightly lamplight sessions.

    Brass gears, damp counter, cracked escapement wheel, and fog-thinned lampposts are filtered through haptic POV; the screw’s cold bluntness is re-handled twice, charging the final image. Micro-setting (clock ribcage) constrains the closing gesture of mounting the screw, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Floating rock platform is not postcard backdrop—its tremor mirrors her pulse and constrains her kneeling posture, directly feeding the ceremony’s stakes. Micro-setting (tea surface, quill, scars) doubles as environment and charges the final mirror-image. Sensory economy is extreme—only four named objects—yet each returns with reweighted meaning. Gate satisfied: platform’s vibration cues the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    The archive, perfume bottle, and orchard function as micro-settings that constrain choices: only here can the scent be electrically re-animated; only now, before the axes, does the apology carry weight. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—yellowed paper, firefly smoke—rather than catalogue. Spatial choreography is precise: bottle chimes on table, coil clipped to lamp, threads braid above. One minor slip: “ Restoration Room” is named late, but the marble floor already anchored location.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.2)
    Library is not backdrop; humming shelves and domeless sky actively constrain tactics—resonance decides which book she pulls. Micro-setting tool: the regret-bound volume and the dictionary alter her next action (hand on book = surrender trigger). Spatial choreography crisp: barefoot on mosaic, shelves rotate, glyphs orbit. Final image—eyes in sky rippling—recharges earlier “dust motes hung like frozen stars.” 9+ gate met: environment charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Horizon lenses, brass dials, and hydraulic breath are filtered through the shepherd’s perceptual bias, constraining his ritualized motions. The station’s sea-facing isolation and metallic cold materially shape the necessity of his backward count; environment is not backdrop but apparatus. Final image of “suspended seconds” is charged by the basalt promontory and ice-cracking echo, marrying setting to temporal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    Bioluminescent mushrooms function as micro-setting: their color-shift anchors constrain Aris’s interpretation of breaches and charge the final image when the motes sink back into caps. Orientation is clean—who/where/when anchored by word 60. Texture favors selective luminescence over tourist catalog, and the farm’s quantum soil rules stay consistent. Tool (diode) and environment together constrain the final gesture, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rainwashed library is not postcard; it actively guides choice—wet cedar smell = paper decay = reason to steal lantern; condensation on high windows = private prism for glyph decoding. Subway underbelly is rendered through selective detail (cracked vinyl seat, drainage grate chalk) that constrains placement of scrawls. The lantern functions as micro-setting: its mica pane fractures light to reveal hidden map; physical handling (“tracing,” “held close”) keeps it tactile. Final image recharges setting: library’s cedar scent returns but now “glowed with new warmth,” marking the shift from sanctuary-as-hiding to sanctuary-as-launch.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tunnel’s weeping concrete, rusted conduits, and iron-ozone air function as active co-conspirators: damp seeps into rotary dials, corrosion decides which jacks accept patches, the background hum times her shifts. The glass harmonica disc operates as micro-setting that constrains every tactic—its chipped rim limits tonal range, its self-spinning triggers the final self-call. Sensory hierarchy is operator-specific: she notices electrical hum over human footsteps, condensation over graffiti—details that matter to someone who thinks in circuits and resonance. Final image tunnels the city’s surface down into one vibrating pane of glass, recharging every prior sensory cue.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Jetty-as-micro-setting constrains every move: salt crust on planks, lantern petals caught in jasmine cracks, tide sigh against pylons—each tactile detail is filtered through the archivist’s conservationist eye and charged at closure when she walks the same planks home. Light, scent, and ink interweave without catalogue fatigue; economy favors selective, purposeful strokes. Nighttime tide and blooming jasmine serve as both atmosphere and tool: the scent tangles with ink to create the haunted euphoria tone that lingers in the final reprise. No slips in spatial tracking; environment meaningfully shapes the tactics of transcription and the final stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ivy-draped terminus is no postcard: foxes on rails constrain where Elara can set her table, the chalkboard’s placement beside Platform 3 guides the flow of strangers, and the lunar fragment’s velvet wrap becomes a tactile micro-setting that charges the final hand-off. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she notices rust, spice, and static, not tourist catalogues. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the widening circle of tellers.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    Ultrasonic forest, moss that “chimes like glass bells,” and the hollow sphere of silence function as micro-setting that constrains choice: sound-based navigation becomes impossible inside the stillpoint, forcing the renunciation of the ring. Sensory hierarchy skews proprioceptive and sonic, true to a blind cartographer. Spatial choreography stays coherent—ring placed at moss edge, constellations resume drift overhead.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Gravitational anomaly is not postcard scenery; it actively pulls narrative threads, warps boots, and supplies the membrane that accepts the glyph—setting as tooling. The dried-up pen evolves from prop to reservoir of starlight, making tool-as-micro-setting charge the final image. Sensory economy is high—“light bent in lazy spirals” compresses visual and physical distortion in five words. Spatial choreography remains lucid across the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    Harbor moonlight is not backdrop; its reflections are recruited as notation paper for the signed score, constraining where Elara can stand and what she can “hear.” Camera body, rope creaks, and lantern flickers are handled in motion, not catalogued. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from Elara → Silas → fisherman → girl without teleportation. Micro-setting (camera-as-frame) directly enables the closing reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    “Petrified ink and salt” and “thumbprints in clay” are tactile micro-settings that constrain her process; the spiral motif carved into fallen columns directly guides her next move.

    Container labyrinth and sodium-lit gantry actively constrain movement paths and sightlines; keyhole placement atop gantry forces stealthy climb, mirrored in prose rhythm. Geomagnetic storm narrows sensory bandwidth, heightening reliance on gait—a causal environmental pressure. Coin warmth against thigh, metal smell, static hiss—all selective, POV-filtered. Setting charges closure: the very altitude and steel canyon acoustics allow whispered confession to rise, physical logic respected.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.1)
    Cobalt dock, rain-slick planks, and iron shutters are not backdrop but instruments: the planks’ grain is read like braille, the shutters’ hinges are oiled to whisper, and the lock’s spillway becomes the screen for life-or-death glyphs. Environment physically constrains stance—crouching, fingertip leverage, mirror submersion—and charges the final image when unfiltered starlight hits the same water. Micro-setting (dental mirror) likewise constrains angle of reflection, deciding which glyphs appear. No static postcards; every sensory detail alters tactical possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt library mist, magnetic grotto, and condensation-weeping glass anchor every move; the grotto-as-micro-setting literally bends the town’s light, constraining tactics. Spatial choreography is flawless across the window-to-window montage. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but the bias matches Elira’s curator gaze. Meets 9+ gate: environment charges the final image—cobalt shimmer under her feet—as the cost of anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sublittoral fringe, tide-worn crates, whalebone ridges, and bruised indigo sky are filtered through Lira’s dock-worker gaze, constraining every step she takes toward the water. The bioluminescent kelp and receding island physically guide her choice to wade; the final salt on her lips recharges the opening “salt and surrender.” Setting literally supports her body at climax—no ersatz backdrop.

Spatial choreography is immaculate: barefoot marble → glass wall → curved heart → ice step, each distance tactile and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.0)
    Glass shards, furnace soot, and reed curvature are not backdrop but tools that constrain placement and resonance; the cracked birdbath filling with unseen dew recharges the opening ash-shadow. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s haptic bias—velvet moss, brittle maple—so every descriptor performs double duty as world-fact and character filter. Spatial choreography remains exact across kneeling, wedging, stepping barefoot.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.0)
    The “laboratory of lost sounds” is not backdrop but instrument: vacuum tubes whisper lullabies, wire harps tremble under Elira’s vowel, the cracked lens refracts choirs onto her skin. Setting literally bends sound into color, constraining her tactic of listening-through-light and charging the final prismatic projection.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    “Weighted silk the color of twilight” and shuttered lenses convert the observatory from star-machine to grief-chapel; the brass locket cavity functions as micro-setting that literally holds absence.

The environment’s emotional responsiveness (curtains glow to ache) is internally consistent and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rain-beaded skylight glass, ink-stained fingers, and the coiled tape create a tactile micro-setting that constrains the cartomancer’s slow, methodical gestures. Weather and city glow filter every perception; the loft’s corkboard cathedral supplies the only geography needed. Specificity is selective, never touristic, and the final pin in the map charges the accumulated atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bronze prism pagoda is not backdrop but tactile tool—warm facets, wrong-scattered light—whose thermal pulse times the climax; the tilting shelves and unspooling scrolls choreograph her unstable gait. Micro-setting (dust on glyphs, blood on bronze) constrains footing and signals cost. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: she smells no wind because the archive has “no scent but time’s slow decay.” Final cooling of the pagoda mirrors internal relinquishment, charging the resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Petal-chandeliers and velvet-moss spines create a micro-setting that constrains action—Elira must brush gently to avoid dislodging archives. The river stone’s cool weight is returned to repeatedly, guiding tactile choices and final embedding. Spatial choreography stays clean: west-arch perch → central archive → data-core housing, each move shortening her options. Sensory hierarchy is POV-specific: she notices textures (velvet, smooth, cool) before sound, aligning with her preservationist vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Micro-setting triumph: the glass case, brazier embers, and lichen pigment constrain her next-moves and charge the final compass image. Mist and stars function as environmental mirror without slipping into atmospheric cliché; spatial choreography remains precise as she moves from moss-stained floor to cot. Weather is felt (cold clarity) but never overwhelms the indoor crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    Tower, cellar, cathedral crypt form a vertical world that physically guides descent and return; ivy as living GPS constrains route. Frosted hourglass recharged in final image, meeting micro-setting gate. Sensory selection narrows to touch and vegetal murmur under crisis, then widens at dawn; spatial choreography tracked cleanly. Selective detail skips broad city map for root-level specificity, economy observed.

Setting details evolve through erosion and regret metaphors, mirroring internal vigil without overt symbolic shout.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt walls, bolt-less bench, and color-shifting stain are not picturesque flourishes—they are the machinery of choice: the bolt physically prevents music, the stain meters psychological winter. Sensory triage is POV-filtered (“cold bite his skin” regenerates nerves), guiding every action. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we track his spiral ascent, the hollow bench leg, the bolt’s screw-back. Environment constrains the final image—middle C rings against cobalt glass, reconfiguring both atmosphere and meaning—meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)

The ink pellet’s material chemistry directly constrains the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across the shard-cuts; only the “vaulted halls” line drifts toward postcard vagueness, capping at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Station, submersible, and journal are handled in tactile motion; each object changes state (CALYPSO’s lag, fused pages, glowing coral) and constrains next moves. Salt-crust, mildew scent, bioluminescent spirals are filtered through Elara’s marine-biologist eye, never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate: ankle-deep brine → generator housing → descending hull. The final image of “depth, rhythm, patience” fuses environment with moral stance.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is micro-focused: body (bare soles on cold alloy), tool (opera glasses), and ancient stones beneath the grating constrain every move. Shattered dome and rusted gantries evolve from ruin to bioluminescent schematic, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography remains clean as others approach across tarmac. Final image of bay exhaling dust charges the closing beat; meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Volcanic hot springs act as micro-setting that supplies both hazard (steam, sulfurous vents) and resource (the obsidian slab warmed for amber). Vines and obsidian constrain her choreography and choice temperature—amber must be placed on warm stone, not cold ground. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: she notices scent, heat, and plant-whispers before visual breadth. Setting charges the final image: the springs bubble clearer, registering the seeding’s success.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Seaside-cliff arboretum is no backdrop: salt-stung glass, ivy-swallowed bench, dewdrop in web all constrain where the body can sit/see/draw. Micro-setting (the body’s sole pressure against soil) doubles as therapeutic tool; final image requires this exact cliff greenhouse for the pearl’s evaporation to reprice meaning. Gate passed.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse-library is tactile: salt-crusted windows, rusted gears, leaning shelves that exhale new books. Micro-setting objects—the needle, the Tower card, the childhood sketch—constrain her stitching choices and charge the final tapestry. Spatial choreography is precise; distances collapse only after the fabric is stepped upon. Environment literally compresses to cocoon her, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    Wind-carved tents and ozone ink provide tactile micro-setting that constrains her experiment; the spilled-ink fractals literally become the portal. Drone’s titanium wings serve as mutable prop whose final state (alone, humming a dirge) charges the last image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: pale eyes raw from squinting narrow to ink veins. No 9+ only because world-rules (how disappearance works) are implied not tested before climax.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.0)
    The echoing library under snow is not backdrop—it is the weapon: frost on glass parallels viral confession, marble columns hide quantum relays, the Resonance Table is literal amplifier. Micro-setting (cryo-wax shell, chrono-globe hands) constrains the decisive act. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: she smells iron/jasmine, hears only her breath, ignores tourist chatter later. Final image of snow thickening while walls still vibrate recharges the opening freeze, making environment the continuing transmitter.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glass dome refracts sun into “liquid gold,” a micro-setting that literally constrains Elara’s choices—she can cultivate but cannot leave. Ballast sand, knife sheath, and rose stems recur as handled objects whose states evolve; the fraying scrap finally swaddles the child’s cutting, charging the last image. Sensory economy is tight: red soil under fingernails, thorn-crowned stems, condensation rationed—each detail double-labors as moral and tactile texture. Spatial choreography remains clean despite time-jumps; orphanages and slums are named only when they receive flowers, keeping the world rule compact yet lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.4)
    Sound-wave garden, rail spike, and sleepwalking constellations are not backdrop but tactical terrain: every step must avoid snapping sonic vines, spike conducts buried bass note, constellations absorb the released echo.

    Observatory-above-clouds is more than postcard: the grafted spy-scope turns the dome into an urban microscope, directly enabling the evidence grab. Brass railing, iron ribs, timestamped display—each tactile detail is filtered through her grandfather-trained perceptual bias. The pen nib qualifies as micro-setting; its warmth and click against brass constrain her micro-adjustments and later authorizes the Q.E.D. line. Environment charges the final image: smoke threading sky to earth mirrors the telescope’s inverted sightline, reweighting the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    The laboratory of lost sounds is no backdrop; its broken gramophones and violet tubes throttle the stakes—proximity to the console dictates who hears the static. Micro-setting objects—amber, cradle, vacuum tubes—are tactile extensions of guilt; the amber’s false bottom literally hides the letters that rewrite the past. Spatial choreography is clean: drawer → console → forearm → machine core. The final image of dawn folded over rooftops re-weights the entire sky as a stitched blanket, making environment charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Grotto as micro-setting is tactile—dripping stone, scent of wet limestone, mist curling like “second skin”—and directly shapes action: the absorbent walls squeeze sound into the mandala.

    The greenhouse, rope bridges, and wrapping-paper journals are not backdrop but tactical objects: the seed’s crimson tendril coils up the very shelf that holds bark-fiber journals, charging the final replanting image. Olfactory micro-setting—wet iron, distant lightning—constrains Elira’s timing and forces her barefoot sprint. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating boughs. Environment directly shapes the decisive act: she buries the husk in the same recycled paper that once mapped root-systems, completing the setting-to-closure circuit.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    The planet’s physics—floating boughs, lichen-glow, inversion hour—constrains every tactical choice: she can only fly and plant while gravity is upside-down. Sensory triage is POV-sharp: “mist pooled like liquid memory” anchors setting inside her professional attention to water flow. The broken arrow itself functions as micro-setting, its warmth and thrumming guiding the final insertion beat. One slip: “granite arch slick with inverted runoff” momentarily confuses spatial orientation during the landing, a hairline glitch that does not derail closure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.1)
    Container labyrinth is not backdrop but antagonist: wind funnels, thermal updrafts, and shifting walls constrain every tactical move. The patch, the anemometer, and the investigator’s own ribcage operate as micro-settings that charge the final image—patch pressed against ribs “like a compass needle.” Spatial choreography is immaculate; containers track cleanly as they reroute drafts. Weather is not described; it is weaponized, forcing the protagonist to re-instrument the maze in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ice cavern functions as both cathedral and instrument; prism-bell, quartz veins, and aurora concretely constrain how sound becomes color and vice versa. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—she tastes G-minor as burnt caramel—never touristic. The final image of “sculpted hush” breathing is inseparable from the setting’s physical transformation, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    Thunder-echo Range functions as micro-setting: its canyon hush literally presses eardrums and forces the keeper to use breath, not blast, constraining her method. The cracked amphitheater and silver driftwood are not postcard details—they are tools whose precise angles she must calibrate to wind-memory, so environment shapes tactics. Sensory economy favors hush and ash-colored grit; sight and sound collapse into a single perceived density. Final image—the flute surrendering gold to lichen—evolves causally from weather and time, charging the monument with ongoing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.1)
    Topaz panels refract starlight into moving glyphs that mirror her emotional equations, constraining her belief that grief can be graphed; the workshop itself becomes a tool. The halo’s pulsing light and ozone-scented violet ink provide tactile immediacy. Spatial choreography stays clean—press, bench, fragment, door—across a single continuous scene. Weather is the vanishing stars, a live clock that forces her final typeset beat.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Aurora-lit ridgeway, moth-wing canopy, and frost-crunch act as micro-settings that filter through POV bias and charge the final blue-after-aurora image; the dragonfly-wing pendant itself becomes mobile setting, constraining her route and then exiting to reweight the sky.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    The quartz arbor, mist, and frost-covered windshield are not backdrop: the crystalline trellis literally holds the prism that focuses the vision, and the melting frost supplies the final release image.

Sensory hierarchy favors touch and refracted light, matching the POV’s epistemic priority.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Bamboo stillness, upward-falling plum blossoms, and the amber micro-sun constrain the ritual’s tempo and supply the final beacon. Weather and grove react causally to the weaving—leaves curl, blossoms invert—so environment is not backdrop but active resistor/accelerant. Spatial choreography stays clean: puzzle assembled on warp beam, bead tied to crossbeam, body dissolving into the weave. The orchard’s forgotten status heightens the stakes of impossible distance without needing exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Micro-setting (silk, forge, mine wall) constrains every beat; floating orchard arches mirror the upward release after underground pressure. Sensory economy is exact—"orchard blossoms drifted…like silent kites"—and filtered through blacksmith’s eye (metal, soot, resonance). Final image of arches humming recharges opening vista, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned repair bay is not backdrop but instrument: rusted console, broken gantries, and residual warmth after transition constrain how Elira moves and where the shard can spin. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered—she reads scent, vibration, electric hum—never tourist catalog. Micro-setting qualification met: the shard itself functions as portable environment that charges the final image when it cools. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions across the viscous transition.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    Environment (abandoned lantern room) and micro-object (cobalt sea-glass) constrain choices: the spectral snuff forces the glass onto the sill, and the cairn mechanics depend on stone-on-stone tension. Sensory hierarchy skews to salt, rust, and velvet dark, mirroring internal hollowing. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from skiff to spiral stairs to western window. Setting detail never stalls momentum; each noun (oil drum, wick-case, cairn) doubles as tool and emotional lever.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Emerald tower, salt-slick cliffs, and lantern-wick micro-setting are filtered through the herald’s storm-tuned senses and directly charge the final image; the lighthouse glass literally enables the total-internal-reflection steering that reconfigures fate. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single aerial vantage.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating tea house, moss ledge, and valley mist are never backdrop: the hovering “tethered by belief” mirrors the protagonist’s suspended identity, while the mist curls “like a question” to charge the final image. The morpho wing serves as micro-setting—its ridges mapped by breath and memory—constraining her method and final dye. Spatial choreography is immaculate; light angle, body position, and silk motion track cleanly. Sensory hierarchy tilts to the visual, but that bias is POV-true for a dye master.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    Micro-setting (sextant, brass seams, mossy root) constrains every tactical move—she can’t wrench parts, must wait for moonlight, must set device on root to receive oak’s offering. Stormlit tower and rain-slick parchment provide sensory hierarchy filtered through maintenance-worker eye: damp stone, gutter song, silvered rooftops. Spatial choreography clean: spiral stairs → workbench → slit-window → forest gate → first arch of oaks. Environmental mirroring (leaves tremble though no wind) externalizes her interior shift without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mica window is not backdrop but active battery—its hoarded dawn-light fractures only when vibrated by song, turning setting into antagonist and then conduit. Micro-setting (the iron spiral staircase grafted to the citrus rune-tree) constrains the keeper’s ascent, forcing her to climb barefoot across etched bark that “pulsed faintly, feeding on residual hope.” Sensory triage is POV-specific: she notices dew temperature, rune glow, and the whispering pane because these bear on her mission, while broader geography is rightly withheld. The greenhouse’s night-shroud persists, yet its internal logic—light as memory, song as key—remains consistent and charges the final image of cracked mirrors reflecting reclaimed community.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    The library’s derelict-municipal disguise, frescoed owls, and creak-for-truth rule are not backdrop but tactical: the floorboard response to her spoken name triggers the shelf realignment. Dust, moonlight, and the invitation function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice. Spatial choreography is clean: invitation retrieved from Paradox shelf → smoothed on knee → pinned back to shelf. Only the city outside remains a faint postcard sketch, but it never bears on choice, so no deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.1)
    Wisteria-choked archways, moss-muffled marble, and the cracked fountain provide tactile resistance that guides her barefoot pacing and seed placement. The gray shawl and spring-wheat dress function as micro-settings constraining her degree of exposure; their swap charges the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track her from courtyard → fountain → tea-house floorboards without drift. The secret spring’s new drip evolves from prior environmental stillness, giving the ending physical credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    The frozen library is not backdrop but instrument: frost constrains gloved dexterity, quartz silence compresses sound so frequency needles can be heard, the obsidian lectern conducts cold into Elira’s palms. The micro-setting (palm-sized slide in platinum cradle) literally constrains the final action—once sealed, the slide can never again be read, making the setting coterminous with the irreversible closure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Salt-rotted timbers, swaying gin lanterns, singing eels—selection is urgent, POV-filtered, and guides movement; the watch fob itself becomes micro-setting that physically bridges generations and catalyzes the rupture. Spatial choreography stays clean through crowd swells and knee-drop recovery. One minor over-color (“lanterns swaying like drunken fireflies”) but it pays off by contrasting the later frozen hush.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lavender bluff, aurora, and mycelial electorate create a textured micro-setting that is more than postcard; the soil she tastes becomes the ballot box.

Selective sensory detail (silent blue flames, silica veins pulsing) is filtered through machine perception, keeping the world rules consistent and lived-in without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    Jasmine and waking birds are selective, but the courtyard never physically constrains choices; it’s backdrop rather than tactical space. The locked mailbox functions as micro-setting and recurs with state change (closed → organic click), satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across the four-day stoop vigils.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sunken lab is not backdrop but tactical skin: coolant vents, biometric plates, and bay doors are seized by dance. Micro-setting triumph: the dice as portable gallows-court become the ignition key. Every object is handled; spatial layout stays trackable as she pirouettes. Final image—the red master-cipher eye drowned in harmonic collapse—recharges every prior detail.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: “encrypt vulnerability as strength” is signaled in line 1 and tightens when she refuses the submersible seat. Escalation is agency-driven: each dance step flips a subsystem, narrowing Overseer options. Cost accumulates—oxygen, time, and finally her corporeal self—until the harmonic implosion forecloses rescue. No coincidence; pressure coils like spring steel.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bruised horizon, cathedral ribs, and salt-chandelier vault give immediate scale, while the copper plate and pressed aster become micro-settings that literally gate the climax. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Elira notices gravity fluctuations through sideways-sliding teacups, not exposition. Spatial choreography is flawless—she kneels, places, steps; the pocket yawns above her head. Only nit: “ley lines only gravity could draw” is slightly abstract, but forgiven in the lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mist-body-shell triad functions as micro-setting that constrains every move: visibility limits options, shell warms to cue transitions, tide determines stance. Spatial choreography is flawless—sideways drift, pier re-entry, water lapping boots. Sensory hierarchy narrows to sound (shell whispers) and touch (ink-rain) under lyric pressure. Final image of red-coat cameo is charged by prior geometries.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.3)
    The arbor functions as micro-setting: its remembered creaks and dew-fed vines constrain how Elara moves (kneeling, wrist wrapped) and supply the only channel for rekindling song. Sensory selection follows Elara’s tinkerer eye—brass goggles reflect amber, gear-forged flute—so detail never feels touristic. Spatial choreography is clean: the vine’s curl, the oak-knot’s mouth, the wreath at the end track without drift. The final image of the circular vine wreath charges the closure by offering the next singer both invitation and burden, nailing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    Frost-laced bark, mercury-silvered vials, fox-fur wrap—each tactile detail is filtered through the alchemist’s professional eye and immediately used.

    Micro-setting triumph: the crystal lens and moon-brushed chronometer face function as geography, constraining the final hum and shimmering the sonic closure. Rain-scent petrichor is threaded through action—moss, wet stone, ink bloom—rather than postcard weather. Spatial choreography is immaculate: spiral stairs, forecourt, stool, desk, stained-glass diagonal at dawn all track clean. One hairline slip: “glacial hush” risks temperature mis-cue, but context recasts it as temporal patience, so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Canal-side micro-setting is tactile and choice-guiding: moss-slick edge dictates cautious footing, violet light angles the sundial, water temperature tests readiness. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV bias—visual and haptic dominate, sound narrowed to canal murmur and radio silence. The locket evolves from glint to mirror to relic, its scratched face charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dock, snow, fog, tarred hemp—each detail is filtered through her digger’s eye and used: cold slows fingers, fog muffles sound, rope texture teaches. Micro-setting (rope in palm) constrains every knot attempt. Fulgurite glint at the end recharges the opening image, locking environment to closure. No sensory checklist; selection is spare, purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Shadowed autumn garden is rendered through selective, POV-filtered detail (brittle gold-rimmed leaves, marble nymphs weeping lichen) that mirrors internal desolation without overt symbolism. Micro-setting objects—thread, parchment, rosebush—constrain final gesture: folding paper against thorny roots literalizes the map-as-offering. Spatial choreography stays clean within a single cross-legged locus; weather (bruised twilight, breeze lifting parchment) affects paper and ink, hence choice. Palace-carpet backstory is seeded early and paid off when thread pulses, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    Micro-setting (brass cradle, velvet moss) constrains the final palm-press; palace chains and stalactites supply both physical vibration and acoustic metaphor that charge the closure. Selective sensory triage—mineral tears, rust perfume, “steam-whistle shrieks”—mirrors the prince’s narrowed attention. Spatial choreography survives the single scene; no floating bodies. World rules stay consistent: mechanics cannot birth life until grief is wired into circuit.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Black sand, obsidian lagoon, and copper coin each constrain movement and meaning: sand clings like a blessing, lagoon’s glass surface mirrors and distorts, coin’s drilled hole turns it into a tuning fork. Details are filtered through firefighter perception—she notes “no sirens, no smoke” before anything else. Spatial choreography is clean: boots sink, knees gritty, thread taut across water. The final image of coin glinting beneath surface fuses setting with thematic reweighting, passing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    The city is not backdrop but antagonist: pigeon-bone basins, moss-choked throats, and condensation tears guide her acoustical mapping; Fountain Twelve’s shattered tiles literally cut her knees, forcing kneeling that enables key retrieval. Brass key and stained-glass box function as micro-settings whose material states (tarnish, fracture, weight-loss) constrain each tactical beat. Sensory hierarchy obeys her scientific lens: humidity readings, condensation patterns, acoustics—never tourist catalog. Final single drop is environment striking back, reweighting every prior dry basin with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Nebular petals, ionized plasma, and hydrogen clouds are lavishly sensory yet always filtered through the POV’s patience and glow-schema; selection is purposeful, not touristic. Micro-setting is the gear itself; its rust-flake and sighing teeth constrain the sentimentalist’s gentling tactic and charge the final lighthouse image, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography drifts—no clear ground plane—but the garden is intended as dream-space, so impossible positions are rule-consistent. Weather equals falling petals; descent slows in direct response to successful ping, proving environment evolves with event.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Greenhouse glass, moss-slick flagstones, and iron rafters are tactilely navigated as Elias knots ribbons overhead—environment constrains posture and tool angles. Butterfly panes become parchment metaphor, recharging the epitaph’s texture at closure. Spatial choreography holds: distance from lemon tree to stone block remains consistent across beats. Dusk violet light evolves with migration timing, mirroring internal dusk-to-night emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal obsidian ridge is not backdrop but crucible: salt-wind, slick glass, broken rake all constrain footing and metaphor, charging the final altar image. Micro-setting (pendulum bob as “cathedral”) doubles as emotional confessional. Sensory hierarchy favors touch over sight, matching Elias’s tactile profession. No spatial drift; bodies/props track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    Cemetery rows, cobalt silo, and tapestry border function as micro-settings that constrain action: the silo’s rusted rungs force descent, the tapestry’s warp dictates tactile decoding. Candle-blue core and meteor streak are selective sensory flashes that charge the final image. Environment literally shapes tactics—she can only “untangle” what the beam’s height and fabric decay allow.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Obsidian spire, fox-fur glove, kingfisher nib, thermal parchment—each object is handled, not catalogued, and directly shapes what she can do (write in cold, write responsively). The frozen lake’s groan mirrors the page’s eventual hum, turning environment into active instrument. Closure is charged by the same lake/spire circuitry, meeting the 9- gate requirement for environment-as-constraint; only minor overloading of iridescent adjectives keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Micro-setting dominance: the glowing dial and cooling hearthstone function as both workspace and emotional barometer, their heat literally guiding her midnight choices. Mist, embers, and moth-wing cloth recur with shifting temperature, constraining when she tunes and how she hides tears. Final beacon-image reprises these thermal cues, charging the closing line without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Gallery’s creaking floorboards, velvet pouch, and grandfather rocker function as micro-setting that constrains her barefoot ritual and times the final stillness; ash settling “like snowfall” recharges the dim room with tactile specificity, anchoring the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Environment, body, tool triad all constrain: tilted cathedral spire limits ascent, oilcloth sleepskin shapes nightly ritual, cog’s tick calibrates his refusal. Sensory economy is lean yet specific—“phosphorescent glow of fungi” charges the final image; no spatial drift.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is not backdrop but instrument: the zither-carved table functions as micro-setting that absorbs and releases sound; the velvet drapes absorb footsteps, making silence a navigable medium. Autumn leaf outside window is returned in the final sentence as barometric indicator of earned stillness. Spatial choreography is minimalist yet precise—reader tracks Elara from table to window to chair without drift. Deduction only for slight over-reliance on visual; other senses (touch of grooves, low hum felt in ribs) appear later but could have entered sooner for balance.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rusted greenhouse is no backdrop; its iron rot, fractured panes, and blunted rose trellis directly constrain where and how the seed can root. The moonlit glass and silver-blue sapling reciprocally charge the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate—every prune cut, soil scrape, and pane cleaning is trackable. Micro-setting (the seed pressed beneath the old trellis) decides the sapling’s sideways, ruin-mapping trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bay’s salt-cool stones, the orris root’s violet exhale, and the streetlights’ butter-yellow lean are filtered through her synesthetic bias; the shard itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final gesture. One hairline slip—“manicured hedge three blocks inland”—momentarily floats the geography, but the sensorial scaffold re-anchors instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kelp ankle-wrap, snail-silted plinth, and bioluminescent parchment are selective, sensorily cross-wired details that constrain retrieval choices and charge the final light-spiral. Spatial choreography keeps diver, statue, and fracture tracked without drift. Garden environment evolves from static ruin to breathing afterlife, mirroring the thematic shift from monument to fluidity. Slight over-reliance on visual over other senses keeps it from 9+.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.4</question>
    <comment>Dominant stake—will certainty be cracked open?—tightens when the ampoule empties yet demands fracture against stone. One meaningful escalation: historian’s single narrative vs. cascading truths; cost legible in her tear-salted mask and new burden of mutable testimony. Agency remains hers to shatter, not luck. Could use one earlier obstacle beat to push score higher.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    The staircase functions as micro-setting: its refusal to acknowledge up/down and its 37-step rhythm directly constrain tactics—counting, carving, rolling. Stone that turns liquid glass for three seconds supplies the climactic tactile mirror; the velvet/ozone arcade fragment is conjured through sensory recall anchored in present touch. Spatial choreography is immaculate—he sits, is carried upward scraping, stands again; no impossible positions. Economy is extreme yet selective: “hollow promise of progress,” “geometry of infinity” deliver world-rules in two phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Greenhouse glass, soot streaks, meteorite ink, and the airborne salt/jasmine puff give tactile specificity; the rooftop’s oxygen-starved height and moon-path alignment constrain how and when she can paint, so setting actively shapes tactics. Micro-setting doubles as tool, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Grotto acoustics, damp stone, and rosewater rot are filtered through Elara’s curator eye, constraining her choice of performance sites and charging the final fungal chandelier image. Micro-setting (lens, bread initials) doubles as architecture; every prop is handled, not backdrop. Spatial choreography is pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lighthouse, tide, hunger stone, and meteoric-iron mainspring are tactile, smell-of-kelp specific, and directly constrain the initiation ritual. The stone’s “petals of obsidian unfolding” re-images the setting into the closure beat, satisfying the 9+ constraint test. Spatial choreography stays clean across spiral descent and ascent. One minor over-cluster of adjectives (“rustic, salt-gnawed, rocky”) slightly dilutes economy.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Funhouse compresses into micro-setting: cracked mirrors breathe, floorboard snaps like femur—details constrain movement and camera angles of dread. Recurring object, the clasp, is handled in at least two beats (pulse-throb vs. final cool), charging the closure. Sensory hierarchy narrows to visual/tactile under crisis. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Environment evolves: walls exhale, calliope reverses, then permanent stillness—change is causal, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.2)
    The orchard-buoy constrains every action: roots become percussion, apples become projectiles, driftwood becomes stage. Micro-setting (whalebone mallet, conch-shell ledger) is handled tactilely and reappears at closure. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV—salt-sap scent, subsonic throb—guiding choices (Prophet kneels on wood, not water). The final glowing rings could only emanate from this exact floating orchard, charging the image irreplicably.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    Turtle-shell city isn’t backdrop; cracked carapace desk literally guides finger-maps and therefore tactics. Micro-setting tool—reed whistle—constrains every tactical move (breath, pitch, humidity). Watchers on horizon act as living topography; their salt-shadow texture tightens dread. Final image of midnight ridge re-weights same shells from map-desk to potential grave.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Damp-gloom station, brass edge of a secret hollow, crimson petal in a puddle: selective sensory triad that doubles as tool and mirror.

Spatial choreography stays coherent across knee-deep water and crumbling keystones.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    Environment constrains every move: salt-clouded lantern beam, kelp-choked skylight, hollow pillars venting air. Brass stamp, bone stylus, waterproof vellum are micro-tools that decide tactics. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis—she notices tilted lectern, watermark on beam, not panoramic vistas. Final image—stamp clicking codex shut—fuses tool, body, and archive into one charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.0)
    The basilica’s prismatic spires, tea cups that never cool, and camellia roots drinking sky are not backdrop but tactical: they constrain Silas’s ritual and charge the final image when petals unfold in reverse. Micro-setting dominance—dream-glass, gem essence, paper wings—functions as environment-body-tool hybrid. Spatial choreography remains clean through the nave-to-window crane ascent. One hairline slip: “into a dimension where grief and grace share the same breath” abstracts momentarily, but the next sentence re-grounds via the falling sapphire.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mirrored domes refracting starlight into “spectral grids” is tactile and specific; zero-g grating constrains every step. The geode functions as micro-setting—its violet ripples alter air density she breathes. South-Pacific coordinate emerges as future setting that already pressures choice. Environment charges final image: she flees toward emptiness the observatory itself was built to watch.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Observatory stones, drone beam, and chip each return with shifting thematic charge; the broken celestial dial physically constrains access and later mirrors internal fracture/repair. Dust, amber twilight, and drone shadow create tactile spatial hierarchy; spatial choreography remains coherent as she pries stone and activates ceiling projection. Weather and light actively pressure visibility and mood; environment is handled, not backdrop. Final image of “brilliant dimness” reweights earlier dusk motif, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is micro-specific: cobalt tiles cool beneath bare skin, watch hand rusted yet ticking, tide that "gnaws" and reclaims. Each object constrains choice—warm carving versus cold tile, salt-slick cradle figure hummed, silent watch becomes ballast. Driftwood sieving mechanics are grounded in sensory choreography rather than symbolism for its own sake. The final blanked shore is causal, not decorative, erasing the evidence even as it frees her.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    The parapet’s hostile exposure directly shapes the tactic of silence-as-currency; wind and salt are returned in the final image, charging the “shared path.” Sensory selection stays urgent—cold iron, gravel crunch—without tourist checklist. Micro-setting (the two relics) also constrains choice, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Underground lake, engineered algae, and maintenance-shaft disguise constrain access and force the seeker’s clandestine descent—environment shapes tactics. Micro-setting object—the baseball—functions as portable past; its leather wear and fresh ink charge the final image when abandoned. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: ozone, wet stone, low-frequency hum mirror internal hollow. Spatial choreography clean: ball tossed, floats, drifts center; ripples branch; seeker turns, climbs—no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    The silver-bark pear, sideways-time cinnamon, and moon-pulse orchard are not backdrop but catalyst: their blossoms feed the conjured spark and their branches lean to witness. Spatial choreography stays clean (“landed on her shoulder, lighter than memory”). The setting’s micro-objects—spice dust, petal snow—literally compose the phoenix-form, so environment constrains the final image and meets the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    The midnight glade above clouds is evoked through selective synecdoche—“silvered edge,” “amber air”—rather than panoramic description. Body and shard function as micro-setting: the saucer’s fracture maps forgotten afternoons and literally opens into the archive of evaporated seconds. Spatial choreography is immaculate—she kneels, crawls, descends—every motion tethered to moss or vapor. Weather is not backdrop but actor: clouds thicken into spectral hands that stitch vapor into porcelain.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ship is sketched in rust, solar wind, and failing gravity plates—each detail filtering Elira’s body and choices. Kwan Yin’s Tear and the viewport act as micro-settings that charge the final image; the birthday-photo tear re-anchors the entire dimensional logic, so the environment materially shapes closure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    The beach’s light-absorbing velvet sand and the volcano’s low purr are not backdrop but instrument: they constrain footing, absorb the glow, and finally quiet the volcano in direct response to the releases. Every sensory pick is filtered through the philanthropist’s barefoot fatigue; the bottles function as micro-setting that literally charge the closing image. One of the rare cases where environment and tool jointly crystallize the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    Light, stone, and shadow are filtered through the sentinel’s tactical attention; the sundial’s fracture and the gnomon’s moonless shadow charge the final image. The fort’s geography is sketched more than mapped—no distances or directions are fixed—so spatial clarity is approximate, not exact.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Tidal bluff, painted rocks, and eel bodies act as micro-setting objects that literally constrain tactics—no friction means he must exhale pigment instead of grabbing, and the meteor-dust fin becomes the conduit for memory transfer. Aurora is not postcard spectacle but living scripture whose mercury pool merges with ochre spirals to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel-spill-place-spiral sequence tracks body, stones, eels without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stormlit observatory is rendered through brass, glass, lightning forks that rattle lenses—selective, tactile, bias-rich. The envelope’s bus-timetable hiding place is particularized down to vanished neighborhoods; this micro-setting constrains later tactics (mundane camouflage vs. state scrutiny). Weather directly alters stakes: thunder howls like exiled muses, shaking the dome as she chooses stillness. Final lightning flash charges the envelope, turning setting into mirror of inner atlas—meets 9+ gate but overripe adjective strings (“ink in milk”) slightly blur spatial clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    Glass atrium, brook, and half-painted sundial are not backdrop but instrument: light-fissure, water-murmur, and gnomon shadow supply the only tools that can unlock the score. Negative space of the dial—unpainted hours—literally constrains when the code can be read, fusing setting to tactics. Sensory economy is ruthless: one prismatic shard, one hairline crack, one gnomon tilt do triple duty as image, clue, and leverage. Micro-setting (the brass-and-flesh arm seam) repeats the fusion of organic to mechanical, anchoring the body inside the same logic as the marble floor.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.4)
    Setting functions as active constraint and thematic amplifier: waterlogged tomes, kelp-choked skylight, and hidden vents directly shape discovery and preservation tactics. The library isn’t backdrop—it pressures choices (prying open fused ledgers, tracing air channels) and charges the climax (dry Master Index defies decay by design). Sensory detail is selective and urgent (“moss-slick shelves,” “groan of rotting wood”), filtered through the indexer’s professional perception. The sunken city’s physical logic remains consistent, with environmental cues driving plot turns.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.6)
    The floating isle, glass basilica, and tea garden aren’t backdrop but active constraints: gravity weeps, time curls like steam, petals drink sky. These elements directly shape tactics (cranes descend while ascending due to reversed thermals) and charge the final image (the basilica trembling as roots drink sky). Sensory detail is purposeful—chrysanthemum brew that never cools, humming spires—and filtered through Silas’s grief-soaked perception. The setting’s physics evolve causally, culminating in sideways drift into a dimension where “grief and grace share the same breath.”

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.3)
    The floating observatory functions as both macro-setting and micro-setting: its mirrored domes refract starlight into spectral grids that feed her simulations, and its steel grating enables magnetized movement essential to pacing. The geode—a recurring object—constrains choice (must be slotted into resonance cradle) and charges the final image (its violet flare synchronizes with her heartbeat). Sensory detail is selective and pressure-driven: chilled glass on forehead, humming air molecules, irradiated Earth below—all filtered through her trauma-tuned perception.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.1)
    The observatory functions as micro-setting: its eroded dial hides the chip; its dome enables star-trail projection; its “brilliant dimness” charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective—amber light on stone, humming air—and filtered through the pilot’s trained perception. The drone’s beam and obsidian case constrain action and deepen mystery. Environment directly enables the climax and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    The cobalt terrace, driftwood carvings, and watch hand function as micro-settings that constrain and charge choices: the shore is where truth washes up, the tiles shift from cold to closure, and the watch hand’s ticking syncs with revelation. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—warm wood humming with echo, salt-bile surf—filtered through Elira’s guilt-ridden perception. The environment doesn’t just mirror internal states; it enables the climax (kneeling, sifting, pressing object to carving). Final image of indigo dusk sighing relief ties setting to thematic resolution without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.1)
    The storm-worn parapet isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting: exposure forces vulnerability (“no shelter—only exposure”), mist hides nothing if one is willing to see, wind “doesn’t take sides.” These environmental pressures directly shape the characters’ stance and dialogue. The drawer pull and rusted key function as object-as-setting, constraining emotional access until exchanged. Final image—mist swallowing stone—charges closure by erasing division literally and symbolically, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.4)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the coastal launch, utility poles, and astronomical compass constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (salt wind tangling hair “like unresolved equations,” crows on crossarms) and filtered through the navigator’s fractured expertise. The poles evolve from “tired sentinels” to named waypoints, culminating in their “ragged salute” as she departs—environment directly shapes her redefined navigation. No white-room syndrome; every detail serves pressure or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.3)
    The bioluminescent lake functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its fractal ripples manifest unlived paths, forcing the seeker to confront buried cruelty. Engineered algae, damp stone, and silt-swallowed shoes are filtered through the seeker’s jaded yet receptive POV, avoiding tourist cataloging. Sensory hierarchy narrows appropriately during the climax (humming water, glowing signature), and the janitor’s-closet access point ties spatial choreography to the newspaper-decoding method. The lake charges the final image—empathy kindled where regret once pooled.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    The orchard isn’t backdrop but active crucible: branches lean, blossoms pulse, petals fall like “slow snow” to enable the ritual. Moonlight’s permanence constrains the setting’s logic while charging the final image (“walked deeper into the grove, where trees whispered secrets older than constellations”). Sensory hierarchy favors scent and touch over sight during climax, mirroring the whisperer’s inward focus. Every detail serves the theme—e.g., “sideways-in-time” cinnamon bark literalizes temporal defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    The midnight glade above clouds functions as micro-setting and crucible: its thin air and moss constrain action (kneeling, pressing palm), while spectral cloud-hands directly enable the vision. The dolls’ saucer—a recurring object—charges the final image when its sealed crack becomes “a compass, a covenant.” Every sensory detail (choking beauty, silver vapor, burnt sugar smell) serves emotional stakes without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    The recycled spaceship functions as micro-setting: its sentient decay (dimming lights, groaning panels) pressures choices and mirrors Elira’s emotional state. Kwan Yin’s Tear, fused to her sternum, constrains tactics via gravitational shifts tied to joy/sorrow. Final image—meadow under twin moons with translucent figures—is charged by the ship’s metallic exhale and the Tear’s misting dissolution. Every sensory detail (rust-lullaby, kelp-like hair, liquid silver gate) serves theme and closure without white-room vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    The black sand beach functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and charges: it absorbs moonlight (creating a “velvet stage”), warms under her knees, and receives burrowing lightning bugs whose glow alters its texture. Volcanic presence isn’t backdrop—it exhales in relief, purrs, then sleeps, mirroring her emotional arc without overt symbolism. Sensory hierarchy is precise: tactile (sinking sand, warm tea dissolution), visual (glowing embers, pink dawn), auditory (whispering hush)—all filtered through her cracked-heart perception. Final image (“black sand beach gleamed”) reweights the setting as transformed ground, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.1)
    The luminous fort isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains tactics (guards’ dulled attention in unnatural dark, stained-glass light angles studied for months). The bronze quill holder and fractured sundial function as micro-settings: their physical properties (hollow shaft, true-north alignment) directly enable the plot. Final image charges setting—the eastern ridge’s blush reweights the fort’s dimness as temporary, strategic cover. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: twilight’s violet fade sharpens into ember-light focus.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.6)
    The tidal bluff under aurora isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and catalyst. Frictionlessness alters every action (no grip, no speech), forcing hums and geometry. The painted stones function as micro-setting, their Fibonacci arcs shaping the eels’ ascent. Final image of humming rocks charged with star dust ties environment directly to thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    The stormlit observatory functions as both macro- and micro-setting: its glass eye mirrors the poet’s inward gaze, while the brass timer and rusted locker constrain choices (hiding/retrieving the envelope). Weather actively shapes tone—lightning illuminates the envelope “for a heartbeat”—and spatial choreography is precise (circular chamber, eastern window). The setting isn’t backdrop but crucible: clouds “churn like ink in milk,” fusing environment with theme. Every detail serves the final image of self-as-atlas.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.6)
    The glass atrium, brook, and half-painted sundial form a micro-setting that actively constrains choices: light fractures through panes to cast prismatic shards that “herald” the overture; the sundial’s negative space dictates timing; the brook’s gurgle marks approval only after alignment. The mechanical arm’s seam (“flesh met gear”) charges the final image as a symbol of embodied wisdom. Spatial choreography is flawless—characters move from observation to transcription beside the dial, then exit as the shadow slides onward. Environment doesn’t just mirror stakes; it *is* the mechanism of revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.3)
    The rusted library isn’t backdrop but active micro-setting: shattered skylight admits moonlight that “stitches fractures,” floorboard cracks receive seeds, corroded gutters frame silence. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—mildew/glue scent recalls prison sanctuary; wax pools “like liquid starlight” beneath the poem. Every object (tin, nail, teacup) constrains or enables choice, and the final image charges the setting as cathedral of decay. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.4)
    The tidal arbor isn’t backdrop—it’s an active instrument: its branches cradle mist-melodies, roots pull starlight, and vapor petals burst into prismatic spray under Elira’s chords. The moss-pulsing dais, cloud-sea ripples, and monochrome sky bent to color all constrain and enable her tactics. Final image—laughter behind her—charges the setting with irreversible consequence. Sensory hierarchy (condensation on keys, vinegar-ozone scent of film) filters through Elira’s pianist POV without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    The ridge functions as micro-setting and living archive—its early bloom pressures timing, its petals store memory, and its tremor triggers communal recall. The knowledge fruit seed, dew-laced grass, and twin moons are tactile anchors that constrain action (e.g., planting before monsoon). Final image—the glowing ridge—charges closure with sensory specificity (scents, glyphs, light) that embodies “empirically whimsical.” No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.3)
    The islet functions as micro-setting: rain-slicked loam, wind-sculpted pine, and tidal hollow directly enable Elio’s ritual. The driftwood cradle, tarnished compass, and antique lace are not backdrop but tools that constrain choice—the lace’s instructions dictate motion, the compass dictates direction. Final image charges the setting: the islet “sighs, lighter,” proving environment absorbed and released emotional residue. Sensory detail (salt-laced wind, damp stone, bruised indigo soil) is selective, urgent, and filtered through Elio’s bonsai-trained attention.
