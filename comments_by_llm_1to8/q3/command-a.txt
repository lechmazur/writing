    The greenhouse setting actively shapes the narrative as both decay site and transformation canvas. Sensory detail ("thin fabric barely insulating," "brackish water," "long shadows through broken glass") grounds the atmosphere. The micro-setting of dust patterns constrains and enables Elara's experiments throughout, earning the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.2)
    The canyon setting and frost patterns provide specific texture that enables the investigation method. Bioluminescent grotto and scorched kiln create atmospheric beats. However, the environment rarely constrains choices—Elara moves through spaces without physical obstacles or resource limitations that would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    The winterglass conservatory setting is vivid and constrains choice—Elara works here specifically because the glass walls create visual/emotional resonance with her heat-mapping device. Sensory details like "frosted ferns" and plants with "veins visible through the translucent material" mirror the theme of seeking hidden patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    The underwater library setting pressures choices effectively - Elias must navigate "aisles choked with seaweed," search "behind a waterfall of algae," and work within the drowned city's constraints. Sensory details like "breath fogging the cracked glass" and the water's constant pressure against windows create atmospheric tension that shapes his quest.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.4)
    The terra-cotta arbor setting is named but never constrains choices or shapes tactics. "Cracked tiles" and "weathered table" provide minimal texture without affecting action. The sanctions period context matters thematically but doesn't create specific environmental pressure that alters decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.2)
    The twilight viaduct setting with wisteria blooms creates vivid atmosphere, and the hidden alcove with Kwan Yin statue provides spatial progression. However, the setting functions more as mystical backdrop than constraint—the viaduct could be any atmospheric location without altering Elara's choices or the story's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.4)
    The living bridge garden and shape-shifting maze create atmospheric pressure, particularly when "the geometry of the hedges warping in ways that defied logic." The maze functions as more than backdrop, actively testing Elara through hyperbolic geometry. However, the setting's influence on the final choice remains indirect—the environment enables but doesn't constrain the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    The carnival setting effectively constrains choices through its labyrinthine layout and hidden vault location. Vivid details like "rusted Ferris wheel creaked like an old man's bones" and the piano bench discovery create atmosphere. The environment directly enables the escape route, making setting integral to resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse with shipwrecks creates a distinctive hybrid environment that mirrors the story's themes of decay and resilience. Sensory details like "lavender hum from wilting flowers" and "deep indigo rumble from iron beams" integrate Elara's synesthesia with setting. The ashen forge and aurora provide atmospheric pressure, though the physical logistics of a greenhouse surrounded by shipwrecks strain credibility without clearer spatial grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.2)
    The emerald station, moonlit clock tower, and flower arrangement create atmospheric specificity. The jar's ethereal glow and the frozen clock face at twilight effectively mirror the story's temporal themes. However, the setting doesn't meaningfully constrain choices—Lira climbs easily, the trap is navigated without consequence, and the environment remains largely decorative rather than pressuring action.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.4)
    The abandoned control room is vividly rendered with "cracked consoles and dust-laden screens," and the melting ice outside creates atmospheric pressure. The setting constrains Elara's work through temperature ("her breath visible in the cool air") affecting the glassblowing process. However, the environment doesn't meaningfully shape her final choice—the room could be any abandoned space without altering the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    The rusted library setting creates atmosphere and the child's cast functions as micro-setting that constrains choice. However, spatial choreography becomes vague in the mirror room sequence, and the setting doesn't actively pressure decisions beyond providing backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    The storm-tossed fort and "ambered hush" create atmospheric pressure that shapes the oracle's ritual timing ("when only one star remained"). Sensory details like "crackling like dried leaves" and walls "absorbing the quiet narrative" make the setting participatory, though it doesn't ultimately constrain the oracle's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.2)
    The frozen courtyard and ice crystal violin create coherent atmosphere, with twilight's "pale blue light" and spectral colors effectively rendered. However, the setting remains largely static backdrop rather than constraining choices—Unit-7 could perform this discovery anywhere. The violin's materiality matters aesthetically but its ice-crystal nature doesn't create specific pressure or fragility that shapes the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    The crystal forecourt functions beyond decoration—its whispers tell "tales of trust broken and rebuilt" that mirror the central conflict, and its "resonant hush" bookends the piece. Petrichor, damp edges, and the cracked lens create a cohesive sensory world. The setting actively participates in meaning-making rather than merely housing action.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    The garden maze constrains movement and provides the discovery site for the marbles, while sensory details like "tiny rainbows across the foliage" ground the mystical elements. The setting actively participates in the resolution as the garden "whispers back," though some descriptions lean generic ("lush greenery and hidden nooks").

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.4)
    The xenobiology station and alien landscape are adequately established, with some effective details (bioluminescent creatures, metallic surfaces). However, the setting doesn't constrain choices or shape tactics meaningfully. The "magnetic nexus" functions more as a plot device than a lived-in piece of technology with specific physical properties.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    The flooded opera house setting actively shapes Clara's discovery through water damage patterns and constrains her movements "water sloshing around her ankles." Sensory details like "flickering lanterns cast long shadows" and the "hush of unstruck chords" create atmosphere while the deteriorating program serves as both setting element and plot driver.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mountain weather station effectively creates isolation and liminality ("where the air was thin and the world felt closer to unraveling"), with sensory details like "the scent of pine and damp earth" and "metal frame etched with memories." The botanical illustration functions as micro-setting that constrains choice when Elara must decide whether to fix or transform the smudge.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.2)
    The tunnel setting provides vivid sensory detail ("damp earth and rusted metal," "cold stone walls") and the valve wheel serves as a concrete constraint on the final choice. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from entrance to central chamber. However, the factory machinery description remains generic ("gears hung mid-turn, belts draped like cobwebs") without specific details that make this particular ghost shift unique.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The overgrown library and obsidian refuge create atmospheric pressure that directly shapes Lira's journey, with the mirror serving as the transformative focal point. Vivid details like "vines crawled up the shelves, their tendrils embracing ancient tomes" and "walls dissolving into swirling darkness" establish setting as active participant rather than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sage Ridge's meadows and the eclipse create atmospheric pressure that enables the central encounter. The glowing grass and dimmed light during totality effectively mirror the story's theme of finding magic in ordinary moments. The setting constrains the moment to this specific celestial event, though the ridge itself could be any rural location without affecting the story's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.4)
    The silo library setting is vivid ("bronze quiet," "weathered walls") and the medieval/fantasy elements cohere. However, the environment doesn't constrain choices - Elara finds everything she needs conveniently within the library. The "displaced axis" worldbuilding remains abstract rather than affecting specific actions.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.6)
    The kitchen setting is adequately anchored with sensory details (dimly lit, clatter of dishes, hum of refrigerator), and the lighthouse image recurs effectively. However, neither environment constrains choices or charges the final image beyond atmospheric suggestion. The microdot specs could function as micro-setting but remain descriptive rather than choice-altering.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dimensional anchor as "vast and enigmatic space where reality bent and twisted" provides atmosphere but doesn't constrain choices or enable specific tactics. The black color on the palette functions more symbolically than practically. Setting details like "muffled clarity" and walls that shift create mood but don't shape the confrontation in concrete ways.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glass spire and frozen lake create a liminal space that mirrors the writer's suspended state between times. The nautilus shell's chambers effectively constrain the memory-mapping action, and the crystal harp transforms setting into instrument. The mirrored horizon motif charges the final image powerfully, making environment essential to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.9)
    The glowing viaduct that splits into fractals provides a concrete setting that enables the timeline exploration. However, beyond initial rain scent and wet asphalt, sensory detail vanishes in the middle sections. The labyrinth becomes purely conceptual rather than spatially embodied, missing opportunities for the environment to constrain choices.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.2)
    The cavern setting with its "humming walls" and tactile vibrations effectively serves as Elara's workspace where she experiences music physically. The broken phonograph needle and drums constrain her methods meaningfully. However, the external "turning seasons" remains abstract decoration rather than applying pressure to her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.4)
    The courtyard and industrial wasteland are adequately anchored with selective detail ("damp earth," "rusted factories"), but setting functions mainly as backdrop rather than constraining choices. The tower laboratory could be any mysterious location without affecting the story's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.4)
    Setting details effectively constrain choice (the vial's ultraviolet glow, greenhouse's extinct blooms, jasmine/rain scent anchoring memory). The shop's "crystal shadows" and "flickering warmth" create coherent atmosphere. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's scent-avoidance through selective attention, though some descriptions edge toward the ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.4)
    The grotto functions as more than setting—its patterns actively guide discovery and the alcove reveals the mirror that forces the choice. Terra-cotta textures and shifting starlight create atmosphere while the rope's physical presence grounds abstract concepts. The patterns constraining choice elevate this beyond mere description.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks creates a vivid, specific setting that constrains and enables action - the fractured glass catches light, the shipwrecks "creak in response" to music. The post-fire landscape actively shapes Elara's choices and the greenhouse functions as both stage and resonator for her performance.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    The amber grotto setting actively shapes the story through "molten gold" light, metallic scents, and static electricity that Elara uses as her sensing method. The environment's "stones holding their breath" during transformation elevates the setting beyond decoration. Strong sensory hierarchy filtered through Elara's professional priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.4)
    Settings function as backdrops rather than constraints - the "breezy library under stars" is picturesque but doesn't shape choices. The concert hall and library could be swapped without affecting the story's logic. Sensory detail is generic ("cool night," "salt and pine").

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor with shifting patterns effectively mirror themes of connection and belonging. Setting constrains choices through the crater's geography and the arbor as beacon, though some descriptions lean ornamental ("hues of violet and gold").

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rooftop canal system creates a distinctive vertical cityscape that actively shapes Mara's journey ("The water below churned with urgency, as if urging her forward"). The Heart of Cadence cavern with its golden pool and infinity carvings provides strong atmospheric payoff. Setting consistently enables and constrains choice, from the canal ledge navigation to the closing giant's nap deadline.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    The underground cavern orchard with luminous fruit and dripping stalactites creates a distinctive, coherent world that constrains choices—Elara must use the glass eyes as a lens, follow the mosaic patterns, search specific trees. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from orchard to workshop to specific tree locations. The setting actively participates in the mystery's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "sapphire hush" and "shadowed library" create consistent atmosphere, with pipe chases and crawl spaces providing concrete spatial grounding. Sensory detail focuses primarily on visual and tactile ("fingers brushing against walls"), missing opportunities for sound and temperature beyond brief mentions. The ferromagnetic fragments gain specificity through "pitted and worn" surfaces, though the setting doesn't meaningfully constrain choices.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.4)
    The nursery setting with storm, moss, and rain creates atmospheric texture that mirrors internal state. Physical details like "weathered hands" and "mossy trellis" ground the space. However, the environment doesn't constrain choices—Mara could have this realization anywhere. The storm functions as mood rather than obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Post-water-wars world with tidal islands, bioluminescent algae, and sunken ruins creates vivid, specific atmosphere. The amber brooch's warmth and the geometry-defying chamber add texture. Setting constrains choices through rain trails guiding movement and the cove's natural archway framing the exchange—environment actively shapes the narrative path.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.4)
    The musical crystal cave functions well as both setting and character, with crystals that sing and walls that shimmer. The cave pearl serves as a concrete focal object that enables the transformation, though spatial choreography during the merger sequence becomes vague.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    Setting effectively constrains choices through the harbor's physical state and the cliff location where discoveries occur. Sensory details like "ocean-spray clinging to her cloak" and "sand grew softer" are selective and purposeful. The harbor functions as more than backdrop, actively participating through its "whispered secrets" and responsive nature to the trumpet.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    Setting functions adequately—the abandoned station, mist-shrouded woods, and shimmering fortress create atmosphere. The "cracks forming arrows" provides concrete spatial guidance. However, descriptions lean generic ("rolling hills and whispering forests"), and the fortress's "material that shimmered like starlight" lacks specificity that would constrain choices.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.2)
    Setting functions adequately with the tower constraining choice and the whale migration providing temporal anchor. The "canvas of stars" and synchronized whale movements create atmosphere. However, spatial choreography at the tower summit lacks precision, and the village remains generic beyond its coastal location.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prismatic escondite creates vivid atmosphere with "light fractured into infinite hues" and colors that "twisted into chaotic patterns." The setting responds to Elyr's actions (shuddering, rippling). Yet it functions more as backdrop than constraint—the environment doesn't force specific choices or limit options in ways that shape the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.4)
    The funeral home prep room creates appropriate uncanny atmosphere with formaldehyde, cold marble, and flickering lights. The ink pot functions as micro-setting that enables Clara's mental shift. However, the setting doesn't constrain choices beyond mood—the conversation could occur anywhere.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bonsai forest labyrinth creates genuine atmosphere through selective detail like "moss-covered ground" and the interplay between miniature and giant scales. The setting actively shapes Elara's movement and amplifies the hum, functioning as more than backdrop. However, some descriptions edge toward the ornamental ("gilded-leaf stationer") without clear POV filtering.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.4)
    The labyrinth of shipping containers effectively constrains movement and discovery patterns, with tides dictating rhythm and revealing relics. Sensory details like "salt-laden air" and "rhythmic crash of tides" ground the setting. The hidden alcove sanctuary and the marked container with archives provide concrete spatial anchors that enable key discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    The observatory setting actively constrains and enables Mara's search—the crumbling cliff edge, the cracked dome, and especially the unfinished cello become instruments of discovery rather than backdrop. The painted seashell's glow responding to the cello's hum creates a micro-setting that charges the final realization, though some descriptions lean toward the ornamental ("walls streaked with moss and time").

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.4)
    The raft city setting is vivid in patches ("patchwork of barges," "amber and gold") and the foundation stone chip functions as micro-setting, but spatial choreography remains vague—we never understand the city's layout or how Lira navigates between discoveries. The perpetual carnival atmosphere is declared but not lived through sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lunar environment actively constrains choices through harsh conditions, limited time, and the ticking clock of terraforming arrival. Setting details like "regolith," the module's "dulled metallic surface," and dawn's approach create genuine pressure. The summit location and its "eerie stillness" enhance atmosphere while driving urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    The water features that cast light patterns Elara uses to navigate create a unique sensory architecture that directly enables her repair method. The depot atmosphere with mist, oil, iron effectively grounds the industrial setting. The environment actively constrains and enables her choices through the interplay of sound, light refraction, and tactile navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    The frozen lake setting effectively constrains and enables discovery through the thin ice and hidden current, with sensory details (frosted floorboards, vibration beneath ice) grounding the search. The condensation pattern bridges interior and exterior worlds meaningfully, though some descriptions lean generic ("pale winter sun," "desolate outpost").

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ghost town setting effectively establishes atmosphere through sensory details ("faint scent of pine," "cobblestone streets") and the archway constrains Elias's ritual path. However, the setting remains largely static backdrop rather than actively shaping choices—the town changes cosmetically but doesn't pressure decisions or create obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.4)
    The underwater temple setting effectively constrains initial choices through the cave-in and limited oxygen. The crystal chamber and shifting walls create atmospheric pressure, though the magical resolution undermines the physical constraints established early.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse prison's physical details—weathered stone, narrow door's scuffs, copperlight chamber—effectively constrain movement and discovery. The lattice functions as micro-setting that grounds Elias during descent and charges the final hovering image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through the spiral descent and return.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.4)
    The greenhouse setting provides vivid sensory detail ("air hung heavy with the scent of petrified blossoms") and creates effective contrast with the frozen world outside. The ancient tree serves as both anchor and constraint. However, the setting doesn't actively constrain choices at the closure moment - it transforms from prison to threshold conceptually but doesn't shape the final tactical decision.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    The labyrinth setting provides vivid anchoring and the canyon walls serve as both canvas and constraint for Elara's work. Sensory details like "thick with the scent of earth and time" create atmosphere. However, the setting doesn't meaningfully constrain choices or create obstacles - it's essentially a passive backdrop for her unimpeded artistic process.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.4)
    The catacomb orchard setting effectively constrains choices—roots "guide her toward the tomb's entrance" and the sundial base must fit precisely to open the chamber. Sensory details like "golden hue" and "soft earth" create atmosphere, though some descriptions lean generic ("fruit-laden branches stretched skyward"). The setting actively participates in the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.2)
    The golden arcade setting is vividly rendered with specific details (golden pillars, intricate mosaics, children's chalk drawings creating deliberate contrast). The setting provides both atmosphere and functional elements (chalk codes, mailbox location). However, it doesn't truly constrain choices or charge the final image beyond decorative resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cobalt observatory with its glass dome and velvet cushions creates immediate atmosphere, and sensory details like "amber leaves" and the flame's steady glow anchor the space effectively. The galaxy chart functions as micro-setting that constrains choices (the shifting patterns drive plot). Missing deeper integration where environment would force harder choices, but the setting consistently supports tone and provides resources for action.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mangrove labyrinth functions as more than backdrop—roots that "twisted like ancient fingers" and shift to guide Elara constrain her path. The moonlight pooling "like liquid silver" and the condensation forming messages integrate setting with action. However, the grove and pedestal feel generic compared to the vivid mangrove details, and the setting doesn't sufficiently pressure the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mist-clad atrium creates genuine atmosphere through "condensation that clung to the surface like tears" and sensory layering of jasmine, damp earth, and distant generators. The brain coral fragment functions as micro-setting that constrains choice. Minor deduction for some generic war-zone markers that could be more specific to this particular conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    The fog-shrouded ruins create atmospheric pressure that shapes Lira's journey, with fog becoming both obstacle and canvas. Sensory details like "cold stone" and "damp earth" ground the mystical elements. The setting actively constrains and enables choices, particularly when fog "guides" and becomes the painting surface.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.2)
    The sound wave garden with metallic flowers creates a distinctive sensory environment that enables the central transformation. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as Elara moves from kneeling at the wall to conducting the garden's harmonics. The setting functions as more than backdrop, actively constraining choices through sound frequencies. Missing deeper sensory texture beyond visual and auditory; the tactile qualities of restoration work remain vague.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    The greenhouse setting actively shapes the infiltration—loose panel entry, workbench discovery, glass/steel maze providing cover. Sensory detail ("faint scent of damp earth and jasmine," "hum of trapped insects") creates atmosphere while the space "warping" and "shadows shifting unnaturally" heightens tension. The greenhouse's dual nature as scientific front and resistance hub constrains how Elias must navigate, though it doesn't critically alter his final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    The gargantuan shell functions as both setting and co-character, its "whispering chambers" and "ancient walls" actively responding to the poet's work.

The shell constrains choice by providing sanctuary but never presents obstacles or resources that alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.4)
    The opal library's sensory details effectively establish atmosphere - "shimmering with hues of milky blue and pale green," glass orchids as "crystalline tears." The museum of extinct feelings provides evocative world-building. However, the setting doesn't meaningfully constrain choices or shape tactics at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    The archive setting actively constrains and enables Elara's quest—the inkwell serves as both object and catalyst for transformation. Sensory details like "dust motes danced in narrow beams" and the "glass surface shimmered" create atmosphere while the "labyrinthine shelves" shape her physical journey. The setting's integration with theme elevates it beyond mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dormant volcano amphitheater creates genuine atmospheric pressure with "thick with the scent of damp stone" and walls that seem to breathe. The setting actively participates through the glowing cracks and the amphitheater's apparent approval of Elias's solution. The spatial choreography as Elias paces with the chain trailing behind him is clear and purposeful, though some descriptions edge toward the ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    The attic setting functions as more than backdrop—its dust motes become the central discovery mechanism, the skylight frames the observational space, and the "musty air and crumbling books" create atmospheric pressure. The Mars meteorite chip serves as a grounding object that constrains choice and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout with selective, purposeful detail.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drifting prism terrace functions as more than setting—it actively enables the temporal fold and memory access that drives the story's revelation. The shifting prisms and fractured light create atmospheric pressure. The corn maze memory provides effective contrast and grounds the abstract in concrete childhood experience.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    The underwater facility constrains choices excellently—cracking domes create time pressure, viewport enables firefly discovery, and water pressure forces the final decision. Sensory detail like "bioluminescent lantern...casting patterns on the walls like stars trapped in a jar" filters through Elara's astronomical perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    The crystal geode cave with its "violet and gold" shimmer creates atmosphere, and the crater glass functions as a tool constraining Lira's work. However, the setting doesn't pressure choices—it provides "cheerful gloom" and "comforting darkness" but never forces adaptation or creates obstacles that alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    The tidal arcade setting is vividly rendered with its glass ceiling and celestial glow, effectively anchoring the who/where/when early. The bishop's movement mirroring the crowd creates spatial coherence. However, the setting functions more as atmospheric backdrop than constraint—it doesn't force choices or alter tactics in meaningful ways.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    The twilight garden functions as more than backdrop - its "obsidian grace" mirrors the night, flowers bloom "like pages of a forgotten book," and the earth becomes Lira's canvas for constellation-tracing. The moonstone dust constrains choice (one vial, one chance) and charges the final confrontation. Sensory detail balances visual with tactile effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    Pearl Bay emerges through selective sensory detail (mist, prism rainbows, glass atrium) that supports the light/clarity theme. The atrium as architectural centerpiece and the pond's ripple patterns provide concrete anchors for abstract concepts. Setting enables Elias's ritual and reflection but doesn't constrain choices or create pressure that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    The moonlit ridge setting effectively frames the piece with strong sensory detail ("soft silver glow," "charred oak"). The cracked porcelain box functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Minor deduction for some generic nature imagery ("celestial bodies...slowing their dance") that doesn't fully exploit the specific firefighter context.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.7)
    The tide-polished grotto functions as more than backdrop—its tidal rhythms constrain and shape Elara's pattern-making, forcing adaptation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("walls shimmered with centuries of oceanic caress"). The setting achieves micro-constraint through the tide's erasure of patterns, though it could pressure choices more directly.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vivid sensory work throughout: "walls breathing with whispers," "ivy seemed to watch her, its tendrils curling like fingers." The passage functions as more than backdrop—it actively constrains and guides Echo's journey. The environment directly shapes the final choice when the walls "choose" her, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement of environment constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.4)
    The terrace setting with prism parapet creates atmosphere and the mirrors function as active elements constraining choice. However, spatial choreography occasionally floats ("hands shaping the mirages as if sculpting air") and sensory detail skews heavily visual, missing opportunities for sound and touch during the singing.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ancient terrace and midsummer setting frame the negotiation effectively, with jasmine scent and celestial imagery creating atmosphere. The ebony clipboard functions as micro-setting that constrains choice. However, the valley camps remain generic, and sensory detail beyond the visual is sparse after the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    The salt flat functions as both setting and metaphor, with "crystalline surface" and "cracked mirror" creating strong atmosphere. The map of dried riverbeds and the final "patch of damp earth" constrain Elara's choices effectively. The setting evolution from barren to rain-nourished directly charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    The silver courtyard and prism sanctuary create vivid, specific imagery that constrains action - the threads must be physically untangled to enter. Sensory details like "breath visible in the cold air" and the synesthetic "humming with melodic vibration" ground the fantastical elements. The setting actively shapes choices through the sanctuary's sealed entrance.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    The radar dome functions as both setting and psychological mirror, effectively constraining the reflective space. Sensory detail remains selective and purposeful ("dim light filtered through cracked windows"). The dome's transformation from "symbol of inner conflict" to "sanctuary" parallels the protagonist's arc.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    The grotto setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail that supports the meditative tone, and the moss-covered stones and ancient vines create a coherent space. However, the environment never constrains choices or charges the final image beyond providing a backdrop for Elara's unchanged ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound sanctum functions as more than backdrop—its aurora pulses with Elara's movements and the ceremonial rope constrains her method. Strong sensory work: "air carried the faint scent of pine and frost." The setting actively shapes the ritual's execution and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.4)
    The vine-draped bunker and rewilded forest create atmosphere but don't constrain choices. Details like "precisely playful architecture" and "ethereal grit" remain decorative labels rather than forces shaping action. The storm adds urgency nominally but never affects Foresight's ritual or forces adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.2)
    The Babylonian palace setting provides atmospheric description but doesn't constrain choices or enable specific tactics. Details like "intricate stone carvings" and "towering ziggurats" remain decorative rather than functional. The observatory functions as a backdrop for the decoding scene but could be any location with a view of stars.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.9)
    The "soundless sanctuary" offers evocative naming but functions as generic mystical space without constraining choices or providing specific obstacles. The marble fountain and vast chamber remain stage dressing. The setting's ability to "reappear when needed" is stated but never dramatized as affecting the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ruined orchard district creates atmospheric pressure throughout, from "thick fog" pressing against windows to frost crunching underfoot. The workshop's "damp wood and polished glass" contrasts effectively with the ethereal creations. The setting actively constrains and enables choices, particularly when the fog thins to reveal the vibrant world beyond.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cathedral-orchard fusion creates vivid atmosphere ("sunlight filtered through shattered stained glass," "branches heavy with fruit"), and spatial movement tracks clearly from stairs to rafters to altar. However, the setting enables discovery (hidden compartment) rather than constraining choices—Elara could perform her realizations anywhere.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.4)
    The astral orchard with its "iridescent petals that shimmered like captured starlight" creates atmosphere, and the crystalline bathroom with thought-reflecting mirrors is inventive. However, the setting doesn't constrain choices—Elara wanders freely without environmental pressure affecting her decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    The labyrinthine bookstore effectively constrains movement with shifting walls and defensive mechanisms, while the chrono-blossom provides a specific, time-based puzzle that gates progress. The mountain setting actively resists intrusion and "sighs in relief" at resolution, functioning as more than backdrop. Minor deduction for the garden chamber appearing without sufficient spatial setup.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    The abandoned carnival ship constrains movement through its labyrinthine interior and enables discovery through its artifacts. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("scent of saltwater and decay," "rusted machinery"), with the environment directly shaping Elara's path via the glowing card. The foggy bay and deteriorating ship mirror internal states without overt symbolism, and the door of mist charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.4)
    The clock tower mechanism room with its gears and brass lamp creates atmospheric specificity. The rope's physical texture ("fibers frayed but still holding the weight of centuries") and the door's "warped and unnaturally smooth" frame provide tactile detail. However, the environment never constrains Elara's choices—she simply examines and manipulates without the setting creating obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.4)
    The harmonic caves are vividly rendered with crystalline walls and ancient ice veins that Lira reads as maps. The setting actively guides her journey through the crack patterns. However, the world-building relies on fantasy conventions without surprising specificity, and sensory detail beyond the visual remains thin.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.2)
    The glass pavilion setting is vivid and constrains action through the telescope and observation deck. The post-apocalyptic world context grounds the stakes. However, sensory detail beyond the visual remains thin, and the setting doesn't evolve with the transformation at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    The observatory and crystalline forecourt create vivid, purposeful atmosphere that supports the mystical tone. The fog wall functions as micro-setting that enables the vision sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.4)
    The fortress setting provides atmosphere but doesn't constrain choices meaningfully. Sensory details favor the visual ("glinting," "flickering shadows," "glowed softly") while other senses remain underutilized. The wilting gardens and dry fountain work as symbols but don't create physical obstacles that alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto setting actively participates through its "ancient silence" and star-filtered light creating "shifting patterns," with the jade cicada functioning as micro-setting that constrains choice. Strong sensory work with the cicada growing warm and humming, though the grotto could pressure choices more directly.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    The contrasting settings—oppressive bunker versus expansive trellis—effectively mirror Elara's internal journey. Sensory details like "the air was crisp" and the "symphony of nothingness" create vivid atmosphere. The xenial trellis setting constrains her choices through its fragility and limited time window. Minor deduction for some generic descriptors ("dimly lit corridors") that could be more specific.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    The drifting prism terrace with its "vaulting hush" and fractured light creates atmospheric pressure that shapes the entire journey. The floating garden's absolute silence becomes the crucible for Mira's transformation. Sensory details (jasmine scent, light/shadow interplay) are selective and support the dominant stake of finding comfort in silence.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall and bioluminescent cavern create vivid, purposeful settings that guide Lira's path. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from orchard to waterfall to cavern to throne room, with each environment constraining choices through specific details like the mechanism requiring sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.9)
    The "ashen charcoal sanctuary" and starlight filtering through ancient trees establish atmosphere, but the setting doesn't constrain choices or provide specific resources that alter tactics. The threshold functions more as abstract boundary than physical space with choreographed action.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm creates vivid atmosphere and the parallel dimension of physicalized concepts is inventive, but neither setting meaningfully constrains choices. The submarine bolt functions more as a key than an environmental pressure that shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sepia reading room anchors the frame effectively with selective sensory detail (aged paper, golden shadows), and the gramophone serves as a constraining object. However, the mystical bridge location appears without spatial logic, and occupational/dynasty details remain vague abstractions rather than lived specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    The alchemical greenhouse with bioluminescent vines creates atmospheric pressure, and the shifting patterns on the walls do constrain Alaric's final choice to trace them. However, the setting functions more as mystical backdrop than active constraint—the "endless night" and nightshade blooms remain decorative rather than shaping specific tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    The file room setting effectively constrains and enables discovery through its physical details—sagging shelves, dust patterns, the window's light revealing scratches. The micro-setting of dust as archaeological evidence particularly strengthens the central investigation and charges the final image of shimmering approval.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    The auric lagoon's shimmering waters and submerged door create atmospheric specificity, and the archive's "labyrinth of forgotten truths" provides tactile setting. The lagoon constrains choice by requiring Mara to wade in and find the hidden keyhole. Yet the archive description relies on generic "dusty records" and "holographic projections" without unique sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.4)
    The luminescent moss and prism atrium create vivid, specific atmosphere that evolves with the music (moss brightens, prism rotates and projects light). Sensory detail effectively layers mist, light, and sound. However, the setting functions more as responsive backdrop than constraint—nothing about the grotto's physical properties shapes the saxophonist's choices or creates obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.2)
    The ashen skyborne arbor creates consistent atmosphere with "perpetual gray" skies and ancient wood scents. Sensory detail supports the mystical tone but remains primarily visual and olfactory. The setting enables Elara's work but doesn't constrain choices—she could sort seeds and build monuments anywhere with minor adjustments.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong atmospheric work with the workshop, greenhouse, and subterranean chamber creating distinct sensory environments that guide the journey. The bioluminescent fungi and waterfall effectively constrain and enable discovery, though some descriptions lean toward the picturesque ("ghost of its former self") rather than actively shaping choices.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    The foundry setting actively constrains and enables key choices—the furnace becomes a portal, the rain-washed walls reflect internal states, and the industrial space grounds the mystical elements. Sensory details like "damp metal and herbs" and the kintsugi flask create purposeful atmosphere. The setting transforms from "rain-washed" to "aflame" then back, directly participating in Elara's revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.2)
    Echo Gorge functions beyond decoration—its "labyrinth of jagged rock and echoing whispers" creates atmosphere and the "hidden sunrise" bookends the piece effectively. Yet the setting doesn't constrain choices or force adaptation; Elara navigates without spatial difficulty, missing the opportunity for environment to shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.4)

    The amber pavilion, cathedral windows, and etched glass create vivid sensory anchors that support the artistic quest. The cathedral's "umbral tenderness" and colored light effectively mirror internal states, though the setting enables rather than constrains choices.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.2)
    The zeppelin library and obsidian lagoon create distinctive settings that shape Elara's choices—the aerial perspective enables her journey, while the lagoon's dark waters become the site of contact. Sensory details like "shadow stretching like a dark whisper" and boots sinking in sand ground the action. The beach debris arrangement constrains her communication method effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.4)
    Paper-Lantern Cove is established with atmospheric detail ("cobblestone streets," "windows like empty eyes") but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The amber bottle and lanterns provide visual texture without affecting choices. Setting description is competent but doesn't pressure action or enable specific tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rooftop orchard setting brilliantly tensions urban modernity against ancient preservation, with trees that "hum with forgotten stories" and bark "etched with symbols."

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.2)
    The icebound atrium and wild serenity landscape create vivid contrasts, with good sensory work ("breath visible in the frigid air"). However, the setting functions more as backdrop than constraint—the vortex opens too easily and the transformed landscape doesn't pressure choices, missing opportunities for environment to shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    The windblown sanctuary and belfry setting actively shapes choices - the rope's presence enables discovery, the tower's height isolates the moment. Sensory details like "frayed surface" and "strange warmth" ground the mystical turn, though some descriptions ("windblown sanctuary above the clouds") lean toward the ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.4)
    The station setting constrains through its isolation and purpose (tracking falling stars), and the lantern functions as micro-setting that enables Lira's journey. Sensory detail is selective ("skeletal frame etched against the infinite void"). The space setting could pressure choices more directly.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.4)
    The abandoned oasis setting provides vivid anchoring and constrains choices effectively through its wasteland isolation. Sensory details like "the faint hum of bees long gone" and the transformation from skeletal gardens to stirring life create atmospheric pressure, though the setting functions more as backdrop than active participant in key decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.4)
    The emerald silo and its hidden chamber provide atmospheric setting, but environmental details rarely constrain choices or create tactical pressure. The garage sale offers nice texture but functions more as plot device than lived-in space. The temporal weaver device introduction feels mechanically convenient rather than organically discovered.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.2)

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    Strong atmospheric grounding with the salt-and-decay air, blooming jetty, and twilight setting. The wildflowers "defying desolation" and the transformed jetty effectively mirror the thematic arc. However, the setting doesn't constrain choices—the coachman could plant seeds anywhere without the specific jetty mattering to his method or outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    The scrapyard setting actively constrains choices—Elias's cabin location reflects his desire for solitude, the phonograph factory provides the crucial device, and the "wild hush" atmosphere charges the revelation scene. Sensory details like "metallic tang of corrosion" and "acrid scent of burning wire" are POV-filtered through Elias's bloodhound past. The transformed leaf's glow casting "long shadows across the cracked wasteland" effectively uses setting to charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    The time dilation observation deck functions as both setting and thematic anchor, with its "patina of neglect" and "temporally stretched cosmos" creating atmospheric pressure. The gilded compass rose serves as a tactile focal point that Elara traces while sketching, grounding the abstract concepts in physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)

Setting could more directly pressure specific tactical choices rather than serving primarily as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.4)
    The whispering gallery and etched floor patterns serve the accumulative design, though spatial choreography remains vague. The chessboard's "worn surface" and "grooves where pawns should have been" provide tactile specificity. Gallery's acoustic properties underutilized given the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.2)
    The labyrinthine bookstore setting provides atmosphere but doesn't meaningfully constrain choices - Elara could perform this same internal journey anywhere. The "texture of a feather" memory offers specificity, but most sensory detail remains abstract ("whispers and shadows," "hidden thunder") rather than viscerally grounding the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    The time-frozen village and platinum labyrinth create a distinctive dreamlike atmosphere that supports the internal journey. The tapestry's frayed threads and the labyrinth's reflective walls function as more than decoration—they constrain and shape Elara's choices. The setting achieves micro-setting success through the chess piece and tapestry threads that directly enable key actions.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bone towers and pale spire create vivid, purposeful atmosphere that constrains choice - Lira must approach the spire to achieve her goal. The mist that "refracts" and the canyon's "endless echoes" actively participate in the transformation. Setting functions as more than backdrop, though some descriptions ("skeletal fingers") lean toward the expected.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    The acid sea and groaning workshop create persistent environmental pressure that shapes urgency. Sensory details effectively layer (oil/rust scent, metal creaking, gears grinding). The workshop functions as both setting and character, responding to Elara's actions. Minor deduction for some generic descriptors ("dim light," "ancient rhythm") that could be more specific to this particular workshop.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    The coastal cave network functions well as both literal setting and metaphorical space, with stalactites and the crystal pool creating genuine atmosphere. The "hidden oasis" discovery constrains Elara's artistic choice effectively.

However, sensory detail remains predominantly visual, and the station's transformation from prison to refuge could use more tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    The hanging orchard functions as more than backdrop—its "fractured grace" mirrors Elias's journey and the ravine setting isolates him appropriately. The glass eye's shifting colors and the truffle's "rich and earthy" scent provide selective sensory detail that supports the POV's focus. The village and Mara's hut feel generic, but the orchard's transformation from "heavier" to "exhaled" after the eye's return effectively charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.1)
    Strong atmospheric work with the aurora-lit archway, brass astrolabe, and cosmic imagery creating a coherent mystical setting. The "fragments of night" and "shards of glass that glimmered like captured starlight" establish a distinctive visual texture. However, the setting never constrains choice or creates actual pressure—it remains purely descriptive.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glowing dune and divergent archive create vivid, purposeful settings that directly enable choices—the dune guides Mara's path, the archive responds to the clock. Strong sensory work with "luminescent sand," "vortex of light," and "floating orbs." The environment constrains and shapes the entire narrative arc, particularly how the sand "shifted beneath her feet, guiding her path."

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The shadowed garden setting actively shapes the encounter—the fading light creates urgency, the stone bench provides the meeting space, and sensory details (fallen leaves, woodsmoke) ground the emotional terrain. The garden functions as a liminal space where "absences could be explained," directly enabling the story's central action.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.2)
    The suspended palace and cavern settings are vividly rendered with "crystalline spires" and "eerie, blue light." The environment constrains Kael's search effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    The forgotten fountains setting effectively constrains choices—Elara must navigate specific abandoned locations to find breadcrumbs. Sensory details like "cobblestones seemed to whisper secrets" and "water began to flow, its song echoing" create atmosphere. The setting transforms causally with the plot, from silent decay to renewed life, directly charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.4)
    The nebula garden setting provides atmospheric description but doesn't constrain choices or enable specific tactics. Bioluminescent blooms and falling petals create mood without affecting Elara's actions—she could perform the same meditation anywhere.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.2)
    The lightning collection tower and underground chamber provide atmospheric grounding, with selective details like "metallic frame etched with the faint hum of dormant energy." The lacquer box's shifting patterns and the glass orb's pulsating light create visual specificity. However, the setting doesn't meaningfully constrain Elara's choices - she moves through spaces without the environment shaping her decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.4)
    The quiet bay setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail ("soft hues of dawn," "whispering winds") that supports the hushed, contemplative tone. The displaced objects function as micro-settings that Elias interacts with physically, though they don't meaningfully constrain his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.4)
    The underwater garden setting provides atmospheric grounding and the ampoule's fragility creates a concrete constraint. However, spatial choreography remains vague—we don't feel water pressure, murk density, or Elara's physical navigation. The setting exists more as backdrop than active pressure on choices.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    The infinite staircase functions as both setting and metaphor, constraining movement (no retracing steps) and charging the final image through its "boundless confinement." The shifting geometry and chalk equations create atmospheric specificity, though some descriptions remain abstract ("walls pulsed faintly, as if alive").

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rooftop greenhouse constrains and enables Elara's work perfectly—the isolation allows focus while the moonlight through glass creates the specific conditions for her vision.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.2)
    The fairy-tale orchard with "permanent moonlight" and "fruit that shimmered like captured stars" creates a coherent magical atmosphere that supports the transformation narrative. The scent of spices (saffron, cardamom, clove) provides sensory grounding and functions as both guide and trigger for Elara's power. However, the setting remains largely static backdrop rather than constraining choices—the orchard "parts" conveniently rather than presenting obstacles that would elevate integration.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    The midnight glade setting actively shapes the narrative through its "choking beauty" that tightens like a noose, and the crystalline leaves create an otherworldly pressure chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.4)
    The fort setting is well-anchored with specific details like the sundial cipher and bronze quill holder. However, the environment doesn't sufficiently constrain choices - Elara navigates obstacles too easily, and the "luminous fort at twilight" shifts to unexplained darkness without spatial consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.4)
    The tidal bluff setting provides consistent spatial grounding with aurora colors shifting from "pale green to deep violet," and the eels' movements constrain Kael's choices throughout.

Setting details like "air grew thinner, the light dimmer" track coherently through movement, though the film world's physical rules remain underspecified.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.2)
    The ridge setting provides atmosphere and the Grove of Echoes anchors the quest destination effectively. Sensory details like "blooms opening and closing as if in rhythm with her heartbeat" create mood. However, the environment doesn't constrain choices—Elara's path to the seed is unimpeded by the setting itself.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    The islet setting actively shapes choices—slick rocks create physical difficulty, the hidden cove enables discovery, and tides literally carry away the letters.

Setting charges the final image, though it rarely constrains options beyond tone and attentional state.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    The icebound spire and the “lingering luminance” create a coherent, tactile atmosphere that influences tactics (mist, closing walls, anchor point). The harness and outcropping interplay with the physical space credibly. Sensory detail is selective and on‑task, though phrasing occasionally repeats. Environment charges the final image as the luminance brightens on exit.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Harbor hush, sky lanterns, and the submerged library are vividly rendered and filtered through his attention. The environment meaningfully shapes options (the underwater library offers the book; the glowing water guides him). A strong object-as-setting thread (the key) contributes to the charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ambered observatory, rusted metal, and humming apparatus create a specific, lived atmosphere that reinforces the science‑mystic tone. Tools and objects (apparatus, essence, coins) are integrated into action, not touristed. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain choice, the apparatus as micro‑setting charges the final image. Sensory selection leans visual and aural but stays purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory is specific and functional—dome, runes, platform, scythe—supplying both ritual mechanics and atmosphere. Environmental features directly enable the action and charge the final image. Sensory selection (stars, shards of light, thickened air) supports tone without overloading. World rules feel consistent and are learned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sapphire viaduct is vivid and functional: dew rhythms guide method, the arch provides a place to hang the bell, and its glow intensifies at the end, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (pale blue, lavender, cool surface, dew intervals). World rules remain consistent through observation rather than exposition. The environment constrains and enables choices, not just decorates.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful: ridgeway, reservoir, crickets, wind chime, and stars are filtered through Elias’s vigilance. The recurring object (sapphire label) charges the final image and the photo trail grounds spatial movement. While environment doesn’t sharply constrain choices, it meaningfully colors them and shapes cadence. Strong specificity without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)

World rules stay consistent and purpose‑driven for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    The nocturnal haven and brook are vivid and purposeful; the brook’s “flow” becomes the mechanism for the door’s reveal, materially shaping the final turn. Sensory details (storm-born silence, chill air, murmuring water) deepen atmosphere without clutter. World rules stay consistent within the piece’s magical logic. The setting does work rather than sit as décor.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    The echo chamber tunnel and the leaf blower function as environment and tool that shape acoustics, pressure, and the end image. Sensory specificity (wind, hum, echoes, warmth of the handle) is integrated into action rather than decorative. The setting constrains tactics—using echo to restore laughter—and charges the closing release. A few generalized flourishes (“the world itself”) broaden scale without adding new spatial texture, but not enough to blunt effect.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    The frozen, misted garden is vividly rendered and not merely scenic: it births the antagonist figure, houses the key choice, and its potential fading sets the stakes.

    The recycled ship, the core, and the golden-light world are specific enough to ground tone and action. Kwan Yin’s Tear functions as micro-setting/tool and charges the final image. Some details skew generic (“ruins,” “soft, golden light”), but the tool-environment interaction (relic into core; harmonic resonance) meaningfully shapes events. Sensory range is adequate, if not daring.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)

The bottled insects function as a micro-setting object that decisively charges the last image. While the environment doesn’t strictly constrain tactics, it meaningfully mirrors and intensifies the internal turn. Sensory selection is strong and atmospheric without becoming a tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    The fort’s darkness, the half‑painted sundial, and the bronze quill holder are tactile and filtered through Elara’s purpose. Setting details constrain action (cipher hidden under the sundial; blackout shaping stealth) and charge the final image (warm, inviting light vs blackout). World rules feel consistent, taught via action rather than expository dumps. Sensory balance skews visual but remains purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tidal bluff and aurora are vivid and integrated—light, water, and stones become functional components of the ritual. Recurring objects (painted rocks, dust) are environment‑charged and central to the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear, and the setting’s mood amplifies the stakes. The world’s rule‑set is legible through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observatory, storm, and darkroom timer are vivid, filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The environment charges choices—the isolation, lightning’s “urge,” and the timer’s final click function as micro-setting constraints shaping pace and closure. Detail selection is purposeful and consistent with tone; no tourist catalog. Weather isn’t mere wallpaper; it modulates pressure and inflects the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    The glass atrium, prisms, brook, sundial, and rune‑etched needle card create a precise, unified atmosphere filtered through Elias’s focus. The sundial functions as a micro‑setting that guides tactics (tracing angles), and the atrium’s optics subtly echo the theme. While not physically constraining, the environment charges images and final resonance. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.

    The rusted library, creaking iron gates, dust, and rooftop vista are vividly rendered and filtered through purpose. The coffee tin functions as a micro‑setting/object that charges the final image. Environment shapes meaning more than tactics; it doesn’t materially constrain options. Strong atmosphere and specificity, if not fully instrumental.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tidal arbor, embedded compasses, and archive chamber are vivid and specific; objects function as micro‑settings that guide action and charge the ending. The environment meaningfully shapes choices (following compasses, projector setup) and the final image (clock, horizon). Sensory detail stays selective and filtered through Elara’s priorities. World rules are consistent within the story’s lyric logic.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    “Ancient ridge in bloom,” crescent moon, Grove of Echoes, and the shadow-light creature create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere. Details are selective and tonally aligned, though the environment seldom constrains action beyond providing locus and mood. The final storm image reinforces setting but doesn’t alter tactics. Strong sensory texture, limited functional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the breezy, rain-slick islet and hidden cove shape movement and risk, the tide literally alters the outcome by dissolving the letters. Sensory economy is strong (damp earth, salt, cerulean glow) and filtered through Elias’s temperament. Objects-as-setting (compass, lace) integrate into environment-driven choice. World rules remain consistent and learned through action.

    The setting is the story's strongest element, functioning as more than a backdrop. The abandoned carnival is atmospheric and directly integrated into the plot, providing the tools for the central puzzle (arrow, piano) and shaping the protagonist's tactics during the climax (using "hidden paths" for evasion). The environment constrains and enables action, directly charging the final scenes with tension and texture.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.5)
    The setting is exceptional, a masterclass in economy and atmosphere.

This integration of environment into the core mechanism of the plot is exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting of Sage Ridge is evocative, but the details ("dreaming roots," "meadows") are more atmospheric than functional. The key environmental element, the solar eclipse, is used effectively to create pressure. The "keepsake baby hair curl" functions as a successful micro-setting, constraining the climactic action and charging the final image as its meaning is reconfigured, which elevates the score significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.5)
    The "reclaimed silo library" is an evocative and well-realized setting, and the initial atmosphere of "bronze quiet" is strong. The setting provides the necessary story elements and serves as a coherent stage for the action. However, it functions more as a container for the plot than an active force; it presents resources rather than constraints, preventing it from reaching the highest tier of integration.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.5)
    The atmosphere is the story's strongest element, successfully creating a "familiar enigma" in the Chinatown kitchen. Sensory details like the "clatter of dishes" and "hum of the refrigerator" are used effectively to ground the scene.

This integration of environment and object is seamless and indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.5)
    The setting is exceptional, a specific and evocative "sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks." It's more than a backdrop; it's an active force that initially suppresses Elara’s music ("chronic hush") and then participates in her performance ("the shipwrecks creaked in response"). The setting provides the key object (the bowl) that facilitates the climax, directly constraining her initial choice and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.4)
    The amber grotto is a superb example of setting as an active participant. Sensory details are specific and purposeful, from the "molten gold" light to the metallic scent and tingling static.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    The cavern orchard is a memorable and highly effective setting. It is not mere backdrop; the mosaic stepping stones are integral plot devices, and a specific tree is the objective. The environment constrains character (a sanctuary for a "secretive" conjurer) and powerfully charges the final image, where the entire orchard glows in response to her breakthrough, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is a standout success, functioning as a causal agent rather than a mere backdrop. The bonsai forest actively "amplifies the hum," is the subject of the climactic revelation, and seems to grant "approval" in the final moments, charging the closure. The integration of the fluorescent lamp as a key tool and the forest as a historical source is seamless and highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, functioning as a character and a direct engine of the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is evocative, with the "lightning collection tower" serving as a strong anchor and the "nectar dusk sky" establishing a consistent atmosphere. The lacquer box is a key object that effectively functions as a micro-setting, constraining the initial action and being meaningfully re-contextualized in the final image as a star map. However, the wider environment enables the plot more than it actively constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.5)
    The atmosphere of the "forgotten city" and "rusted library" is evocative and well-established.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is evocative, with strong atmospheric phrases like "ancient ridge in bloom" and "luminous doubt." The environment is described with a consistent, mythic tone, and the image of the ridge breathing with Elara is a nice integration of character and place. However, the setting primarily functions as a beautiful backdrop; it creates atmosphere but never constrains a choice or alters tactics, preventing it from being a truly active force in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptional, with sensory details that are both vivid and purposeful, creating a powerful, coherent atmosphere.

The carnival’s prior exuberance remains a ghost texture rather than a live weight on choice, slightly throttling its charge.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    The greenhouse’s warped glass and shipwreck ribs are not backdrop; they constrain movement and supply the literal absences Elara harvests. The ashen forge’s glow under aurora becomes the charged micro-setting that dictates the final beat. Spatial choreography is clean; every sensory detail is filtered through Elara’s synesthetic bias.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    “Emerald station bathed in moonlight” and the frozen clock tower anchor space and mood; the jar’s glow becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Selective sensory detail supports tone without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.1)
    Control-room relics and melting ice are vividly selective; the cracked bookmark as micro-setting constrains her final gesture, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean; sensory detail mirrors internal thaw without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.0)
    Rusted beams and starlight through gaps anchor time and place early; the library later constrains movement when Elara is funneled toward the locked door. Descriptive vividness is selective—“scent of rust and old paper”—though some labels (“whispering seashell”) border on atmospheric shorthand rather than tactile constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.1)
    The fort’s stones, the booklet’s flaking gold, and the dimming sky are vivid and selective, but only the booklet’s faint glow actively constrains the oracle’s next choice. The storm remains backdrop rather than tactical pressure, capping the score just below the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    Frozen courtyard is sketched with selective sensory strokes (pale blue light, refracted colors) that mirror Unit-7’s cooling cognition; the violin as micro-setting constrains the final choice. Spatial anchors are clear by line 3; weather remains static rather than actively pressing, capping the score just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    The crystal forecourt is vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara’s registrar vigilance; petrichor and resonant hush guide mood and choice. The projector lens functions as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture. Weather and crystals evolve causally with the emotional arc. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.1)
    Garden and marbles are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains Elias’s ritual; the cracked marbles’ glow and the maze’s turns guide his daily placement. The final image of light mingling with fading day charges the closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    Station, nexus glow, and wing-creature bioluminescence are integrated as living pressure gauges—luminal shifts intensify with triage urgency. The magnetic nexus’s changing glow colour-codes risk levels, directly constraining Elara’s tactical decision point at stabilisation.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lantern-gleam, lapped water, sogged paper—each sensory anchor is chosen to constrain mobility and make every footstep a slosh-threat.  The flooded pit functions as both physical obstacle and metaphysical threshold, charging the decisive hum.  Consistency and specificity are flawless, yet it doesn’t top 8.8 because the lanterns are mood more than lever.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.0)
    Station’s metal frame and ozone scent anchor the mountain perch; physical micro-setting informs Elara’s peripherality. Environmental pressure is subtle (thin air, storms) yet lacks direct constraint on the final choice, trimming the upper band margin.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tunnel’s damp air, jagged glass, and encrusted valve wheel are vivid, selective, and filtered through Mara’s explorer gaze. Environment constrains movement and supplies the key artifact. The final chamber’s frozen gears mirror the stalled lives, charging the release image. Sensory hierarchy narrows under rising dread, sustaining momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Library, refuge, and swan are vividly rendered and return in the final image to reweight meaning. Micro-setting (swan as map) constrains the choice to burrow. Spatial anchors hold; sensory detail is selective and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sage Ridge is sketched with selective sensory strokes—“grass seemed to glow faintly”—that mirror the eclipse hush. The clearing functions as micro-setting constraining their shared stance. Details are POV-filtered and purposeful; no white-room syndrome. Could edge higher if terrain actively blocked or enabled a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    “Reclaimed silo library” is vivid and tactile—metal walls, bronze quiet—and the altar at the center constrains the final ritual. Spatial choreography is clean; objects (tapestry, scrolls) are handled on the page. Micro-setting (altar) charges the closure image. Some atmospheric phrases (“thick with the bronze quiet”) verge on overwriting but stay legible.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kitchen’s clatter and refrigerator hum are nicely selective; the lighthouse image is atmospherically charged. However, neither setting constrains a concrete choice in-scene; they serve mood more than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    “Dimensional anchor” is evoked through resonant silence and shifting walls; the black palette becomes a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective—void, tremor, shimmer—filtered through the priest’s perceptual bias. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite the surreal frame.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.9)
    Glass spire and frozen lake are vividly selective, filtering through the POV’s yearning. The mirrored horizon constrains perception and charges the final image; micro-setting (nautilus shell) doubles as tool and canvas.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glowing, rain-slick viaduct and shifting fractal paths are rendered with selective sensory detail that mirrors Elara’s suspension; the tablet’s glow serves as micro-setting that constrains her next step, though broader city geography remains sketch.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    The drum maker’s cavern constrains resources: torch-lit stone, half-finished wood drum, and reversed vibration physics—all directly affect choices. Details filter through tactile POV bias (felt vibrations, smooth skin). No geographic drift; winter rustle outside signals temporal shift. Micro-setting (cavern walls) mirrors internal stasis and final awakening. Slight repetition in “dimly lit cavern” is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    The courtyard’s damp-earth dusk and the industrial wasteland’s cold hum are sharply evoked, filtering through Elias’s sensorium. Details guide movement—floodlights dictate stealth, the tower’s spiral staircase narrows options—but no setting element reconfigures the final image or exacts a concrete cost. Strong atmosphere, but the environment remains backdrop rather than constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    Neon-drenched shop, fogged greenhouse, and sterile hospital room are vividly selective and filtered through Elias’s scent-dreading bias. The greenhouse’s extinct blooms constrain the memory reveal; the shop’s lanterns echo the final softening. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome. Could use one more tactile anchor during the hospital shard.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    Terra-cotta grotto’s fractal etchings and starlight leaks constrain every tactile move Elias makes; the rope’s coils echo the wall-grooves, fusing micro-setting to final image. The prison-scar rope itself acts as embodied setting.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    The greenhouse, shipwrecks, and bowl form a micro-setting that constrains Elara’s posture and acoustics; fractured glass catches light that later mirrors the final “dance of reflections.” Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. The orchard’s sunken state subtly guides her decision to kneel. Meets 9+ gate but lacks a final physical constraint, capping at 8.1.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    The grotto’s mineral tang and molten-gold light filter every beat; the petal itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final act. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Elara notices static before sound. Final image of violet-orange dusk recharges the amber motif with conceptual cost. One minor drift: “metallic” scent is vivid but not tied to later choice.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.7)
    Salt-pine breeze and starlight are evocative but decorative; they neither constrain choices nor charge the final meeting. The library is sketched as postcard backdrop rather than lived space that alters tactics. Sensory detail is selective yet generic, lacking tactile specificity tied to Elara’s broker expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.5)
    The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are vividly evoked and return in the final image with reweighted meaning; however, the environment never physically constrains choices—its pressure remains atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.7)
    Rooftop canal, serpentine spires, and cavern pool are vivid and selective; the canal literally bends to her will, constraining movement. Sensory hierarchy favors sight and temperature, matching an illustrator’s eye. Micro-setting (pendant as key) charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.1)
    The cavern orchard is tactile—stalactite drip, luminous fruit, warm mosaic stone—and the glass eyes function as micro-setting that constrains her decoding. Spatial choreography is clean; the environment quietly guides every choice.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    The sapphire hush is vivid and selective, filtering through the dweller's cautious perception. The library's pipes and shadows constrain movement and hide the cache, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no floating rooms. The setting never evolves with events, remaining a static backdrop rather than an active force.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.9)
    The mossy trellis, rain, and greenhouse roof are vivid and selective; they shift from barrier to gateway, constraining her movement and then enabling the final stance. Micro-setting (leaf, trellis) charges the closure image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tidal island’s salt sting, bioluminescent horizon, and crumbling cottage are filtered through Elara’s sleepless urgency; the ruin’s impossible geometry and the cove’s archway physically constrain her path and charge the final image. Weather and terrain act as active pressure, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cave is not backdrop; its singing crystals constrain Elara’s choices—she must attune or be overwhelmed. The pearl’s pulsing light and the “overlapping shadows” function as micro-setting that literally pulls her through space. Final image: the cave’s glow now beats inside her, charging the closure. Slight over-reliance on visual shimmer; a tactile or sonic anchor earlier would sharpen immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    Ivory Harbor is rendered through selective, POV-filtered detail (“salt and petrichor,” “water pooled in patterns”). The setting constrains movement—soft sand, cliffs, half-buried hull—and the trumpet’s echo literally charges the stones, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; only the keeper’s cliff descent feels lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.1)
    The abandoned station, mist, and starlit vault are vivid and selective, filtering through Elara’s cartographer eye. The shifting symbols on the punch and fortress walls constrain her choice to proceed; setting actively guides action rather than decorating it.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tower’s ivy-choked spiral and starlit summit constrain movement and frame the climax. Sensory selection favors touch (warm tile) and sound (unheard symphony) over visual catalog. The whales breaching under constellations mirror Elara’s internal breach of skepticism. Environment actively shapes the final image rather than serving as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    Kaleidoscopic Escondite is vivid and specific, functioning as micro-setting: crystalline ledge allows perch, prismatic surfaces refract danger when dimensions rebel. Solar storm supplies timeline pressure that coheres tactics. Final image of “uneasy calm” reprises the initial dazzle with ominous reweighting. One notch below top band because storm largely reads as backdrop, not tactical constraint inside final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prep-room details (formaldehyde, wax, flickering fluorescents) are filtered through Clara’s wary attention and guide her discovery of the ink pot. The marble table and sealed pot physically constrain her reach and later the father’s anger. Atmosphere supports the deathly-yet-vital tone without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    The bonsai labyrinth is tactile and atmospheric, guiding her steps and amplifying the hum; the fluorescent lamp’s flicker becomes a micro-setting that charges the final image. Still, the environment constrains mood more than choice, capping the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Port container maze is vivid, selective, and causally active—mudflats reveal relics, tides dictate rhythm, archive container constrains discovery. Final moonlit image recharges earlier shadows, locking setting to theme. Micro-setting (label, letter) functions as charged objects.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cliff observatory’s salt, wind, echoing dome pressure choices via access/soil integrity; dying cello as micro-setting constrains how memory can be “played.”

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    The raft city is tactile (“patchwork of barges and houseboats cobbled together”), and the graffiti micro-settings constrain Lira’s path; final image of stone amid murals reweights the place as contested ground.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    The moonlit summit is rendered with selective sensory detail; the regolith crunch, visor fog, and slanted shadows all serve the hush. The setting constrains her pace and frames the hourglass grain’s final gleam, charging the last photograph with loss.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rail-depot mist and machinery noises are filtered through Elara’s other senses, constraining her navigation and guiding tactical repairs—“subtle shifts in air…the way light refracted through water features.” Spatial coherence is high; oil-and-iron scent anchors depot authenticity. The water-light prism becomes micro-setting that directly informs her non-visual diagnosis.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Valley, archway, cobblestones, bell tower are vivid and selective. The archway and cobblestones constrain Elias’s method; the bell tower’s sudden sound recharges the pattern. Weathered stone and retreating vines evolve causally with the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.7)
    Selective sensory filter—glow, stone breath, pulsing crystals—creates consistent underwater awe without catalog overload. The temple itself doesn’t physically block Maya’s moves; it supplies aesthetic armature rather than tactical constraint, limiting high-band charge to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.3)
    The lighthouse chamber, ore-veined walls and jagged reef function as active pressure—copperlight constrains his choice, reef offers fatal drop—but spatial choreography around the spiral stair and final exterior hover could be a hair cleaner to reach 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.1)
    The greenhouse’s “petrified blossoms” and “twisted branches” are vivid and selective; the bead-as-micro-setting constrains her final choice. Spatial anchors arrive early; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.0)
    Red canyon walls, tide-pool cracks, and etched plates are vividly rendered and filter through Elara’s poetic perception. The labyrinth constrains her looping paths, and the transformed walls charge the final image. Sensory selection favors the visual; other senses are underused.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid, selective, and purposeful; roots and bones constrain every step and echo the theme of life-death continuity. The sundial base itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    Golden arcade, chalk drawings, red-flag mailbox are vivid and specific; they guide proximity (arcade edge) and temporal pressure (flag position). Lacks a deeper environment or tool constraint that charges final beat, so 6.8, not 9.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.9)
    The cobalt dome, eternal candle, and shifting tapestry function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the candle’s steady glow anchors reality, the dome’s glass reflects mutable constellations, the fabric literally re-forms under Elara’s fingers. Autumn dusk and dawn bracket the scene with sensory economy. One spatial slip—door location relative to work-cushion is vague—keeps it from 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.1)
    The mangrove’s shifting roots and singing spirits function as micro-setting that actively guides Elara’s path and mood. Sensory selection narrows under crisis: “air thick with anticipation” just before the letter appears. The shard itself becomes an intimate setting object that constrains the final choice. Only the hut’s interior remains slightly white-room.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mist, condensation on doors, coral’s pulse—the details are selective and echo Elara’s shifting emotional gauge. Atmosphere is not mere drapery; the clammy jasmine scent limits how far she can see and thus how much risk she’s willing to shoulder once armed with the map.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ruined orchard and living fog are rendered with selective sensory detail that guides Lira’s path and ultimately becomes her canvas; the environment literally constrains and enables the final act. Spatial anchors are clear, and the fog’s mutable surface charges the closure image. A touch more specificity in the network chamber would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sound-wave garden is tactile and selective: metallic flowers, humming frequencies, obsidian-eyed echo-woman. The setting constrains the climax—Elara must attune her voice to the garden’s pulse—charging the final image with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    The greenhouse is vivid—glass, jasmine, drone of insects—and the gourd seed functions as micro-setting that constrains the next move. Spatial anchors are clear; condensation on panes mirrors rising tension. However, the environment does not physically impede or aid the escape; it’s atmospheric rather than tactical. Sufficient for publishability, but not yet constraining choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    The gargantuan shell is vividly tactile—“towering spirals,” “whispering chambers”—and its scale mirrors the poet’s inner vastness. Yet the shell never actively constrains her choices; it is backdrop rather than crucible. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, though slightly repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.0)
    The opal library and museum are not postcard backdrops; their luminous walls and extinct-feeling artifacts constrain Elara’s movement and literally house the stakes. The wind chime and Vessel act as micro-settings that charge the final image. Only the “above clouds” altitude remains ornamental, preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    The archive’s dust, narrow beams, and labyrinthine shelves are selective and POV-filtered. The inkwell evolves from mythic prop to active constraint, glowing under her quill. It doesn’t yet constrain a final tactical choice, so capped below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dormant volcano’s amphitheater breathes, cracks glow, and stone “expanding and contracting as if alive” constrains Elias’s pacing and final sketch. Sensory detail is selective—damp stone, glinting brass—filtered through Elias’s engineer’s eye. The setting evolves from menace to symbol of unity, charging the closure. It lacks one final tactile interaction to hit 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    The attic’s must, slanted light, and pigeon flutter are selective and purposeful, guiding her bodily movements and narrowing perception under pressure. The meteorite chip functions as micro-setting, its weight constraining her grip and charging the final image. Sensory detail never stalls momentum; every scent or shaft of light is filtered through Elara’s immediate goal.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.1)
    The drifting prism terrace is more than backdrop; its shifting panes physically constrain movement and mirror Elara’s fracturing certainty. Light and glass charge the final image when she lays the logbook down, making the setting indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    The algae-coated viewport and bioluminescent currents are selective, sensory, and filtered through Elara’s stargazer bias; they guide her attention and later constrain the dance space. The facility’s decay subtly mirrors her internal erosion, charging the final image when sunrise pierces the cracks. Environment does not directly block escape, so it stops short of 9-band constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    The geode’s iridescent walls and the crater glass supply both atmosphere and constraint: the glass literally reconfigures under emotional pressure, guiding Lira’s tactics. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the cave never becomes mere postcard scenery.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.1)
    The arcade’s glass ceiling and starlight are vivid and selective, filtering perception through Elias’s gaze. Micro-setting (the chess board, the skylight) constrains the final image, charging the beam of light that crystallizes the act. Spatial choreography is coherent; objects track cleanly. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias’s priorities—visual symmetry over sound or scent—supporting his analytical stance.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    The garden’s obsidian petals and dewy gaps constrain Lira’s dance steps and supply the ink medium; the moonstone dust’s glow charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent—feet trace constellations, sentinel halts at edge.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pearl Bay’s glassy water, lifting mist, and refracted dawn are filtered through Elias’s glazier gaze; the prism and atrium act as micro-settings that constrain his final insight, charging the last image with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    The moonlit ridge and porcelain box serve as micro-setting that constrains Elias’s solitude and frames the final placement; sensory detail is selective but occasionally drifts into atmospheric filler (“celestial bodies slowing their dance”).

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    The grotto’s wet stone, shifting tide, and refracted light are sensuously specific and directly constrain her iterative art; the gauge’s trembling needle becomes micro-setting that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    Passage itself becomes a felt character; ivy constrains movement and fireplace yields diaries—setting alters tactics and decision chain. Sensory density is selective (breathing walls, humid air) without tourist overload. Meets 9+ gate: walls/fireplace directly constrain retrieval of diaries and key.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prism parapet after rain is handled twice: first as refractive tool, finally as shimmering farewell. Wet glass fracturing light constrains how illusions form; the terrace’s echoing acoustics enable the lullaby’s reach. Selective sensory detail (sunlight fractured, spring air thick) filters through Elara’s painterly bias.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    The terrace and valley fires are sensuously anchored, but only the clipboard constrains a choice (draft treaty revealed). The midsummer stars serve as lyrical backdrop rather than tactical clock. Micro-setting succeeds; macro-setting is atmospheric, not instrumental.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    The salt flat’s reflective surface and damp depression actively constrain where the egg can be placed; the shifting crust resists her steps, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective—arid wind, distant thunder, damp earth—filtered through Elara’s urgency. Weather evolves from gray stillness to first rain, mirroring internal shift. Micro-setting (patch of damp soil) becomes the decisive locus.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.1)
    Silver courtyard, snow, and prism sanctuary are rendered with selective sensory detail that guides movement and stakes; the crystalline walls refract starlight into the final image, reweighting the setting’s promise. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    The decommissioned radar dome is evoked with spare, tactile detail—“cracked windows,” “warped planks”—and its vast silence mirrors Elias’s inner space. The campfire stick functions as micro-setting, constraining his tactile reflection. Sensory selection is biased to Elias’s calm attention. No physics or spatial drift.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    Grotto’s moss, vines, filtered light are vivid and selective; the moth wing and spiral serve as micro-setting objects that constrain the final gesture. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara’s priorities—texture of moth wing, sound of wind—without tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.1)
    The vine-draped bunker is tactile—light filtering through canopy, storm pounding the roof—and the wafer seal functions as micro-setting that constrains access. Spatial choreography is clean; the forest never becomes mere backdrop. Yet the bunker’s “precisely playful” architecture is asserted rather than demonstrated through action.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.1)
    The reimagined palace is evoked with selective sensory detail (marble floor etchings, observatory dome) that filters through Kael’s astronomical gaze. Yet the space never physically constrains or endangers him; it remains backdrop rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.4)
    “Soundless sanctuary” is sketched in two strokes—humming silence, marble fountain—enough to ground the scene. The music box serves as micro-setting and final image, but spatial choreography (distance between Elara and Kael) is vague. Environment does not actively constrain choices; it merely frames them.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Thick fog and ruined orchard are vivid, selective, and mirrored in Elara’s internal state. The sextant itself becomes micro-setting that constrains choice (must be restored before boundary can be tested). Frost twilight tightens temporal pressure. Details are filtered through Elara’s craft-centric attention—glass, brass, damp wood—without tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.1)
    The cathedral-orchard is sensory and specific, its rafters and roots constraining Elara’s climb and later offering the altar compartment. Light through shattered glass and glowing petals charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.9)
    The astral orchard is rendered with selective, luminous detail (“iridescent petals that shimmered like captured starlight”) and the crystalline bathroom mirrors reconfigure thought; however, the setting never physically constrains choice, capping the score just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mountain-bookstore is vivid (“shelves shifting imperceptibly,” “moss-covered leather”), and the chrono-blossom’s ticking petals constrain the final choice. Spatial anchors are clear early. A few stock phrases (“shadowed depths,” “whispers of forgotten tomes”) keep it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ship’s rusted hull, shattered mirrors, and salt-stink fog are selective and POV-filtered; they guide Elara’s path and echo her corrosion. The emerald card’s glow against decay supplies a micro-setting constraint that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; weather thickens atmosphere without clutter. One more tactile interaction with a decayed prop mid-journey would cinch 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clock-tower mechanism room is vivid, selective, and purposeful: gears’ rhythm mirrors Elara’s pulse, brass lamp pools usable light, rope fibers carry coded history. Environment constrains movement and supplies the key tool; no orientation drift.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.1)
    The echo chamber stone, spiral ice cracks, and seed pedestal are concrete, tactile tools that anchor orientation and later constrain Lira’s conjuring choices. Sensory hierarchy—first sound, then haptic ice, then faint interior pulse—mirrors the stakes into the body. The bloom’s final glow is charged as micro-setting, reconfiguring the perceptual space, satisfying the 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    Glass humming pavilion serves as both luminous micro-setting and atmospheric pressure—its walls literally vibrate when the prism re-forms, constraining and charging the final image. Spatial tracking is coherent, and “translucent walls now dulled by centuries of dust” grounds context. Still, weather and wider spatial relations stay thin outside the immediate tower.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.1)
    The stormlit observatory and crystalline stones are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara’s archivist gaze; the stones literally whisper and the fog-wall becomes a tactile interface, constraining her next move. Micro-setting (brass caliper, leather journal) grounds the action without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.1)
    Fortress, dusk, and rag knot are vivid and selective; the mosaic fountain constrains the final gesture, charging the image. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rippling starlight and moss anchor orientation fast; the grotto’s silence is more than tableau—it makes surveillance artifacts, a sensory constraint that seeds later silence-as-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.1)
    The xenial trellis above clouds is sketched with crisp sensory economy; the vines’ fragility directly constrains Elara’s speed and the doll’s near-loss, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, but “xenial” remains decorative rather than experiential.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    The drifting prism terrace is vivid yet selective; micro-setting (floating garden) constrains the final stillness. Sensory hierarchy aligns with Elias’s professional eye. Could edge higher if the terrace’s physics altered tactics more directly.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orchard, waterfall, cavern, and throne room are vividly sketched and filter through Lira’s urgency; the ruby flake’s glow and the spiral motif constrain choices. Yet no single environmental detail reconfigures the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ashen sanctuary is atmospherically rich and starlight is threaded through action, but the environment never physically constrains her tactics; micro-setting (her scarred body) does more work than the landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bioluminescent farm is sketched with evocative light imagery early and returns in the final image, giving spatial coherence. Sensory detail is selective—glow, hum, pulse—and integrated into action. The mushroom pedestal literally enables the portal, so the setting constrains choice. However, the parallel dimension is described in abstract catalog (“towers of time”) rather than tactile pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sepia reading room’s “golden shadows” and the gramophone’s brass constrain Eleanor’s movements and echo the past; the bridge vision is spatially coherent. The crank handle itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    Greenhouse is rendered with selective, synesthetic density; bioluminescent vines double as instruction and mirror, constraining Alaric’s final gesture. The “endless night” outside remains abstract, but the micro-setting of vines and gravel path is tactile and choice-shaping.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    The file room saturates senses (“old paper and forgotten promises”) and constrains choice—only here can dust histories be read. Spatial anchor is immediate and tactile. While room atmosphere is vivid, the micro-use of space (shelves, light, proximity of button) never quite tightens a final tactical beat.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.9)
    The auric lagoon’s shifting colors and submerged door anchor space early; the starlit water constrains stealth and hides the keyhole, directly shaping tactics. Micro-setting—the algae-encrusted lock—charges the final image as Mara slips away.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grotto’s shifting luminescence and prism beam actively constrain tactics: the saxophonist modulates volume to match the moss’s pulse. Sensory hierarchy is tight—sound, light, breath—anchoring POV without catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ashen arbor is evoked with selective, atmospheric detail; the moonstone speck itself becomes a micro-setting that constrains choice, though the broader geography remains lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Workshop, greenhouse, cavern, and waterfall are vividly sketched with sensory economy; the cracked glass and bioluminescent fungi constrain movement and mood. The compass rose itself functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. A few phrases (“ghost of its former self”) edge generic, preventing 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.1)
    The foundry’s iron mouth, damp-metal scent, and moonlit walls are selective and purposeful; the furnace itself constrains her choice to step inside. Micro-setting (coin, flask) functions as charged objects that guide action.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    Gorge is more than backdrop—its “luminous ache” mirrors Elara’s, and the echoing whispers literally carry the released laughter at the end. Sensory detail is selective: jagged rock, faint harp hum, glint of tooth. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible moves. Micro-setting (harp, tooth) constrains the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ultraviolet forest is vivid, selective, and purposeful; its pulsing bark and glowing petals mirror Elara’s internal state without overt symbolism. The environment constrains her movement and ultimately charges the final image when the strap sinks into the glowing stream, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.1)
    The alchemist’s market is rendered in selective, sensory strokes (“copper and burnt sage,” “ropes and pulleys”) that guide Lila’s movement; the tower’s ivy-covered doorway constrains her final entry. Micro-setting (lens fragment as tactile anchor) charges the ending. Spatial choreography is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    The abandoned ticket office is evoked through selective sensory hits—sawdust scent, flickering fluorescents, dust patterns—filtered by Marcus’s technician gaze. The ceiling void and clock serve as micro-setting that constrains the final insertion. Details feel lived-in, though “crumbling reminder of forgotten joy” edges cliché. Meets 9- gate: the clock in the rafters directly shapes the closing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    The glass orchard library is rendered with selective, sensory precision—crystalline spires, shimmering panes, swirling clouds—and the setting actively reconfigures at closure, constraining Elara’s new identity. Frost patterns and the bottle serve as micro-settings that guide choice. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. The environment’s shift from sanctuary to living entity charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.9)
    The baroque asteroid is rendered in selective, POV-filtered strokes; the shard and Hall function as micro-settings that constrain choice. Light-storm as temporal medium is taught early and pays off. Final image of shard in pocket recharges setting with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    The oak-root workshop, the river that “hummed,” and the cavernous Covenant of Rust are vividly sketched and tonally coherent. The philosopher’s-stone chip glows brighter under pressure, charging the climax. Spatial choreography is clean; only the “waterfall of stars” edges toward cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.1)
    Factory grit, tunnel damp, and glowing lagoon are vividly selective; the lagoon’s light reweights the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial tracking is clean, but the leap from basement door to vast cavern could use one more sensory anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.7)
    Storm-wracked archway provides vivid anchor, salt scent, gradient pressure. Iconic but underleveraged: it constrains no tactical choice, merely frames scenes—solid world, modest payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    The amber pavilion, cathedral interior, and etched glass are vividly evoked through selective sensory detail filtered by Elara’s painterly eye. However, none of these settings physically constrain her choices or supply a tool whose loss would matter; they remain atmospheric backdrops rather than active crucibles. The final image of the mural glowing “soft amber” mirrors the pavilion light, but this echo is decorative, not a constraint that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.1)
    The zeppelin’s drifting shadow and the obsidian mirror-lagoon are vivid, selective, and directly pressure the parley; the lagoon’s surface literally reconfigures to deliver the guardian. A touch more sensory narrowing under stress would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—warm bottle, crunching boots, lantern light on water—each image serves the beat. The cove’s ghostliness is evoked through empty windows and whispering sea, then transformed in mirrored sensory language. Environment does not constrain tactics, but the amber bottle functions as micro-setting that charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    The rooftop orchard is specific and atmospheric; its etched oak bark constrains Elara’s deciphering action. Micro-setting (phonograph shaving) also charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.1)
    The icebound atrium is vividly sketched—starlight on crystal, frozen archway—and the glowing feather supplies micro-setting texture. Setting guides action: the arch’s hollow receives the acorn cap, enabling passage. Yet the vortex interior (“wild serenity”) is generic pastoral, diluting specificity. No environmental constraint shapes tactics after crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    Wind-salt grit on lenses and inertia of rope strands give the sanctuary tactile presence; setting evolves into a pressure chamber that cancels wind at the exact beat zero hour arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.1)
    The station’s “skeletal frame etched against the infinite void” and the lantern’s warmth against cold vacuum create tactile specificity that constrains Lira’s choices. Micro-setting (lantern as portable sun) charges the final image, though spatial choreography on the observation deck is lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Scorched wasteland and skeletal gardens are vividly sketched, but the oasis itself remains backdrop rather than tactical constraint. The stained glass box functions as micro-setting and charges the final image. Sensory selection leans visual; wind and heat are noted but never threaten or enable the ritual. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    The emerald silo is sketched with selective sensory strokes (“weathered metal gleamed faintly”) and functions as both prison and crucible; the hidden chamber’s spatial logic tracks. The urn fragment’s texture (“suddenly timeless”) constrains Elara’s final action by guiding her to the weaver. Economy over breadth, but no orienting lapse.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cobalt lagoon, wet earth, salt air are vivid and selective; the drake feather and kite fabric act as micro-settings that constrain choices (repair, gift). Final image of kite ascending against lagoon recharges setting with thematic weight. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.1)
    The temple orchard is vivid and selective; living stone pillars and copper-wrapped oaks constrain Elias’s remodeling choices and charge the final tableau. Micro-setting (central oak) functions as both tool and altar, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tower’s rainwashed stone and spring decay/renewal scent are selective and purposeful, guiding ascent and mirroring internal shift. The fly amber functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—she must place her piece to complete the circuit. Spatial choreography remains clean; only the summit chamber’s “otherworldly light” edges toward cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    Blooming jetty, salt-stink, and creaking wood are vivid and selective. Environment constrains the only possible action—planting on ruined timber—charging the final image. Micro-setting (seed pods, soil between planks) functions as tactile “setting” that alters tactics. Twilight progression tracks cleanly across the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    The scrapyard’s metallic tang and “skeletal” factory are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elias’s nose and memory. The leaf’s glow becomes micro-setting that constrains his final choice. Weather is absent but not missed. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. One slip: “wild hush” is stated rather than evoked, muting the tonal charge.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.1)
    The deck’s “echoed silence” and star-bent light are selective, sensory, and thematically charged; the compass rose constrains her tactile choice and returns in the final gleam, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial anchors are clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    The spire’s shifting corridors and life-size ice board constrain tactics and mirror Kael’s inner thaw; selective sensory detail (crystalline glow, wind-whipped cloak) charges the final image without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    Gallery is evoked through echo, worn grooves, etched floor—selective sensory detail filtered by Elara’s listening bias. The chessboard and floor patterns function as micro-settings that constrain choice (missing pawns, spelled words). Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift. Environment evolves with the walking ritual, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mountain bookstore works as atmospheric labyrinth, but only the shifting aisles momentarily constrain movement; it never fully integrates as constraint or tool in the closure image, leaving the mountain more backdrop than crucible. Sensual detail is vivid yet mostly decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    The time-frozen village, platinum labyrinth, and tapestry border are rendered with selective sensory detail that mirrors Elara’s stasis. The chess piece functions as micro-setting; its final reweighting as talisman justifies the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.9)
    “Towers of bone” and “canyon of endless echoes” create tactile, reverberant space that literally constrains movement—the whisper walls physically absorb sound, forcing lyrical speech as the only viable tactic. Mist, spire, and refracted light evolve as dynamic environmental actors rather than backdrop. Bone towers become echo chambers that reshape poetry into magic; no cap applied.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.1)
    The floating workshop’s groans, oil stink, and tilting floor constrain Elara’s balance and attention; the acid sea’s hiss supplies audible urgency. Selective sensory triage under pressure—pockmarks, charm, statue glow—keeps description purposeful. The setting charges the final image when the workshop steadies in response to her words, meeting the 9+ gate condition narrowly.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cave is rendered with tactile specificity—“stalactites hung like chandeliers… mineral-rich water”—and the pool’s mirror constrains composition choices. Micro-setting functions as a catalyst rather than postcard: she’s forced to paint because the place offers an “inverted world.” Spatial choreography around the boulder detour is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt lighthouse, dawn cool, and garden scent are vivid and selective, filtering through Elias’s perceptual bias. The cork and lantern room act as micro-settings that constrain his attention and final choice. Setting does not merely backdrop but guides movement—scent leads him down the stairs and along the shore. Missing a deeper occupational constraint keeps it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    The windswept cliff station is sketched with selective sensory strokes—“weathered walls bearing the scars of countless storms”—and the censer foot’s moonlit glow integrates setting with tool, constraining Mara’s nightly labor. Spatial choreography stays coherent; the beacon’s hum and the cliff’s exposure jointly pressure her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    The hanging orchard’s damp rot and storm-scarred branches constrain movement and mood; the glass eye’s shifting colors mirror Elias’s loss of control. Final image of soil and truffle re-anchors the place as refuge. Could edge higher if orchard itself altered tactics more overtly.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.1)
    The opal dock, mist, and lighthouse beam are vivid and selective; the boutonnière and journal act as micro-settings that constrain Elias’s final choice. The Edelweiss scent threading through the mist charges the ending image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    The antique shop, bioluminescent cavern, and violet-sky world are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail. The creek’s rise is atmospheric but never constrains action; the cavern’s moss and archway provide texture yet don’t alter tactics. Micro-setting (the chip glowing on the desk) briefly functions as an object-as-setting. Overall, specificity is strong, but environment never becomes a limiting resource or final-image constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    Setting delivers: the ridgeline height, metallic scent, and temperature shift all guide her climb and mirror the stakes. The starfall chamber is rendered as a pressure site, not postcard, and its bleeding silver directly triggers the guardian pact. Final reprise—“first fireflies of summer had vanished”—does not constrain choice, so capped below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ember nexus is rendered with selective, urgent detail—“shimmered with hues of burnt orange and deep violet”—and the shell-as-micro-setting constrains the final ritual. Sensory hierarchy follows Elara’s alchemical gaze. Spatial choreography is clean; the shell’s spiral expansion tracks logically. Environment subtly guides choice, though it never threatens or limits her physically.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    The mountain cabin, birch scroll, and star-strewn expanse are selectively rendered and filter through Elara’s perception; the scroll’s glow and the cabin’s hum charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting breathes in fog and brass micro-detail; the worn birthing clamp charges choice and image. Only a mild white-room risk at entry because “nestled between cobblestone” remains generic, offset by tactile intimacy of tools and drip-clock heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.1)
    The archive’s “aged paper and forgotten melodies” and the orchard’s “silence of impending loss” are selective, atmospheric, and filtered through Elara’s grief. The perfume bottle functions as micro-setting, constraining her method and charging the final image. Spatial anchors are clear; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The temple is evoked with selective sensory detail (dust, shifting walls, mural pulse) that guides movement and mood. The dictionary itself becomes micro-setting, constraining the witness’s choices. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome. Final image recharges the mural and the hush.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.9)
    The “fjord quiet” and “sea of mist” are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elias’s professional gaze. The hydraulic clock’s brass face and the key’s worn edges function as micro-setting that constrains the final discovery. Environment mirrors interior silence without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.9)
    The mushroom farm’s glow, scent, and damp ground are vivid and immediately functional. The spatial layout is mapped cleanly, guiding footfall. It meets the 9+ quick test once the luminous gift acts as final hinge—it is part setting, part tool that recharges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.1)
    The rainwashed library is evoked with selective sensory detail (damp stone, mica refracting moonlight) that subtly guides Elara’s pacing and frames the final image. The lantern functions as micro-setting, constraining her movement and charging the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tunnel’s damp pulse and the fogged booth are sharply selective, and the glass disc’s shimmer under dim light becomes the micro-setting that constrains Eli’s final action; the environment is never mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.1)
    The jetty’s weathered planks and jasmine-salt air are filtered through Elara’s archivist gaze; the locket itself becomes micro-setting, warm against her palm and later reweighted by Mara’s recognition. Spatial choreography is clean—bench, roots, twilight light. The environment doesn’t yet constrain a tactical choice, so it stops just short of 9-band constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ivy-clad station is vividly textured—“damp wood and forgotten memories”—and its decay subtly mirrors Elara’s inner state. However, the environment never physically constrains her choices; it serves as mood board rather than obstacle or tool. Final image of the station fading back to ruin recharges the motif, but the ivy itself does not alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ultrasonic forest and platinum ring function as micro-settings that constrain her path; the pool’s liquid silence charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, though “otherworldly light” flirts with cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cracked earth, shimmering void, and the pen’s glint are selective and POV-filtered. The gravitational anomaly constrains movement and time perception, charging the final image; spatial choreography stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.0)
    Harbor moonlight refracts into micro-setting anchors—water stones, prisms on skin—tightening usable space around camera and body. Camera body itself constrains final gesture (“weight, history”) linking setting to closure. Sensory choices remain selective, no drift into postcard breadth.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.9)
    Archive is atmospherically sketched yet generic; lack of specific obstacle or resource from the setting keeps environment from constraining choices. Key sensory touches arrive but dissipate; setting never becomes a tool or adversary.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sound-wave garden is rendered through synesthetic specificity—“every leaf whispered secrets”—and the auric lagoon’s liquid memory glow constrains her final choice to seek others. Micro-setting (stone perch over luminous water) functions as both seat and threshold. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating geography.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.1)
    The container labyrinth is tactile—salt, rust, groaning metal—and constrains every move; the storm’s magnetic pulse is woven into the walls’ tremor. Micro-setting (key warming in pocket) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Environment earns its place in the 9-band gate but lacks a final, choice-altering detail to push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.9)
    Cobalt dock, rain-slick planks, and dental-mirror glints are selective and POV-filtered; the shutter constellation at the end constrains the stranger’s gaze and crystallizes the closure image, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.1)
    Cobalt library and mist are vividly sketched and return in the final image, but neither constrains a pivotal choice. The magnetic grotto is atmospherically rich yet functions more as inspirational backdrop than as an object that alters tactics. Sensory detail is selective and character-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sublittoral fringe is evoked with salt-silt boots and emerald shafts of light; the disappearing island itself constrains the climax by vanishing, charging the final image. Sensory selection is tight and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    Farmhouse and turbines are filtered through Elara’s fatigue—shadows, drone, pale light—each detail constraining her retreat and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; the turbines’ motion mirrors her enforced stasis without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    Cobalt atrium and frozen lake are rendered with selective, synesthetic detail that constrains movement and charges the final image. The quartz colonnade functions as both setting and active agent. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    Shards “glint like captured rainbows,” furnace hum and leaf-whisper create tactile micro-setting; the courtyard’s glass and plants actively constrain Elias’s choices (ivy bouquet for kiln stories, fern-notes for music plea), charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.1)
    “Laboratory of lost sounds” and carbide lamp are vividly sketched, but the lab never physically constrains choices; the lens gains symbolic heft yet lacks tactile handling in the climax. Sensory selection is evocative—golden shadows, whispers—though micro-setting (body, tool) doesn’t shape the final tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    Observatory atmospherics suffuse every move (curtains of intention, filtered starlight), functioning as micro-setting that constrains isolation and recharges the final illumination.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rain-beaded skylight loft is anchored early and re-enters as a living metronome; each rain tap tightens the hush of conspiracy. The inherited artifacts (dusty tomes, velvet cushion) constrain movement—Elara kneels, Mira crouches—space shapes posture and stakes. Final image of first light refracting through wet glass recharges the Tower motif. One more sensory tether to the city below would push 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    Archive, pagoda, and saffron veil are tactile, lived-in, and constrain choice: the shifting corridors force intuitive navigation; the pagoda’s bronze lattice channels the light that reconfigures her. Sensory hierarchy (amber-indigo shards, cool bronze) is filtered through Elara’s scholar-poet gaze. Micro-setting (the worn-smooth tiles) directly enables the climax. No orientation debt; spatial choreography tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.1)
    The blooming library is atmospherically lush and supplies the vial that triggers the climax; however, the setting’s rules (how dreams become shareable, how shadows enter physical space) remain evocative rather than constraining, capping it below 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.1)
    The misty workshop is more than postcard: the cedar scent, starlight, and chameleon’s terrarium constrain her attention and later frame the talisman’s placement. Micro-setting (the shelf, the tail tip) functions as charged object-as-setting that guides the final gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.3)
    The tower, tunnel, and cavern are sketched with selective, sensory detail; the hourglass itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography is coherent, though the cavern’s glowing crystals flirt with generic fantasy shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.1)
    The projection booth functions as micro-setting: dust, moonbeam, and sputtering projector constrain Elara’s sensory focus and guide her psychometry. Final image of the theater “humming with echoes” recharges earlier stillness, tying setting to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    Elaris and the archway are atmospherically rich; aurora light, brass cold, stone breath all filter through Lira’s perception. Details guide mood more than choice—no spatial constraint alters tactics. Micro-setting (astrolabe as tactile object) almost qualifies but doesn’t yet pivot the stake. Vivid, selective, purposeful; just shy of charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.1)
    The glowing dune is tactile—sand shifts, warms, guides—yet the archive interior slips toward white-room. The chess clock’s glow and the pendant’s cool metal serve as micro-settings that constrain the final gesture, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mechanical rainforest is vividly textured—“metallic vines twisted and gears bloomed like flowers”—and the micro-setting of the cog-leaf tree constrains Eamon’s moment of listening. Yet the environment never actively thwarts or enables his final action; it serves as gorgeous backdrop more than tactical crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.0)
    The veiled ridgeway’s mist and salt air are selective and atmospheric, guiding perception; the ticket punch as micro-setting constrains the final beat. Spatial tracking is clean, but the ridgeway itself never actively obstructs or enables choice, keeping it just shy of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.1)
    Cobalt fortress and snow are atmospheric but also functional: the cold seeps into Elias’s hesitation and the bolt’s gleam mirrors the ambient hue. The piano bench as micro-setting constrains his posture and choice, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    The temple library is evoked with dust-beams and humming stones, anchoring time and mood. Micro-setting—the iron-gall pellet and carved rune—constrains tactics. Spatial choreography is clear, but the shift from secluded stacks to coronation dais is elided.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Station, sea, and torn page are vivid and selective; the atlas page itself becomes a micro-setting that constrains her attention and finally charges the ending. Weather and metal hum are filtered through her professional eye without tourist excess.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.1)
    The abandoned spaceport is tactile—dust, amber fractured skylight, debris crunch under bare soles. Environment narrows choices: the stone circle’s hum is physically localized and becomes both oracle and constraint. Micro setting works: the opera glasses as small object and the hum as tangible force guide tactics to the end. Lacking one final constraining detail—how the repair bay limits exit routes—keeps it from higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.1)
    The volcanic hot springs function as micro-setting: heat vs. cool air, steam as ghosts, the earth’s fire meeting water—all constrain Mara’s ritual timing and bodily stamina. Sensory hierarchy is character-filtered: brittle kite fabric, amber warmth seeping into palms. The environment mirrors internal stakes—rebirth literalized in geothermal energy—without overt symbolism. One spatial glitch: the guard “vanishes like a shadow” without exit cue, a minor choreography wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.7)
    “Loose stone at cliff-edge,” “relentless crash of waves” directly constrain her physical crawl and echo interior precarity; however the arboretum’s flora remain mostly atmospheric backdrop instead of active leverage in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.5)
    Library-lighthouse is evoked with salt, dust, groaning shelves; the lantern room above acts as off-stage beacon that finally charges the ending. Spatial choreography is clean; the broken tarot box and scattered cards function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice. No white-room syndrome.

    The greenhouse’s “glass walls dulled by neglect” and the mirror orchard’s “fruit that glowed like captured dawns” are filtered through Elara’s urgency, constraining her path and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; only the off-stage communities keep it from indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bookstore’s hush and flickering neon anchor mood early; the blank book on the pedestal constrains the final choice, but the library’s “secret society” texture is sketched rather than leveraged for tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.3)
    Courtyard’s decay (crumbling statues, damp soil, plaque, lantern light) physically constrains planting tools, dictates angles of approach, and in final image recharges the earlier bread symbol; micro-setting (stone plaque) serves as pivot. Sensory specifics tethered to POV priorities ("scent of damp earth and fading blooms," "warm with chamomile and jasmine").

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.1)
    “Frozen library above the clouds” is vivid, selective, and mirrored in the biting air and crystalline shelves. The lantern slide itself becomes micro-setting that constrains choice when its frequencies spike. Final image of lantern bridging abyss charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rotting-pier market is sketched with salt/decay scent and hushed tones, grounding atmosphere. However, the setting constrains no tactical choice; Lila navigates it without spatial friction or resource use, so it charges atmosphere more than action.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lavender bluff and aurora are vividly sketched and filter through Elara’s perception. The ring functions as micro-setting, but the environment does not actively constrain her choices or charge the final image; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.1)
    The crystal cave is rendered with selective sensory detail—amethyst hues, prismatic shadows—that mirror Elara’s inner fracture. Environment constrains choice: isolation enables suppression yet also incubates rebirth. The broken lock and lantern light become micro-settings that charge the final image. One minor spatial drift: “vast chambers” is asserted but not navigated.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.9)
    The greenhouse domes, toxic sky, and damp undercity are rendered in selective, POV-filtered strokes that guide choice (the route etched on the plate).

    Drift-ice marina’s cracking timbers bodily pressure every move; brine-frozen scent tightens urgency, while the latent sunset clock shifts the last light to signal final choice; spatial choreography always coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    Basalt ridges, frost air that “crackled with restrained wildness,” and the magnetic viaduct’s glistening beams are vivid and specific. Setting constrains movement (cold limits pace, viaduct frames stasis) but stops short of shaping the final beat, keeping room under the 9 cap.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Tunnel is tactile—damp earth, rust scent tracked to action (“fissure in the wall” triggers next probe). One object, the lantern, constrains final image—its light “seems brighter,” anchoring the before/after shift. Economy noted: no generic postcard geography.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.2)
    Atmosphere of “aged wood and oil” and shelves of silent music boxes anchors us quickly in the workshop. Heart ticking under the lamp doubles as micro-setting that re-weights meaning at closure. Details are selective, filtered through Elias’s reverence, though the same “vibrant hush” phrase appears twice.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    Workshop and acid sea are vividly sketched and supply sensory texture, yet they never constrain Lira’s choices or charge the final image. The bell’s iridescence borrows the sea’s palette, but setting remains backdrop rather than active force.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    Few paragraphs total, yet social-network archive creates tactile specificity via interface verbs (scrolled, decoded) and environmental pressure (system locks her out). Body-as-setting (headset, terminal) constrains stealth tactics. Sensory selection mirrors bias: canted metadata attention.

Could edge higher if the glade’s rules (e.g., cloud physics) constrained tactics more explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    The recycled ship and golden dimension are sketched with selective, purposeful detail. Micro-setting (tool belt, tear) constrains action, but the ruins never press back on Elara’s choices. Sufficient specificity for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    The black sand, sulfur air, and volcanic archway are selective and sensory, filtering through Elara’s perception. The beach constrains her path to the hidden cove, and the archway literally frames the climax, so environment shapes choice. A touch more tactile interaction—sand scraping skin, heat on soles—would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    The luminous fort at twilight is sketched with selective sensory strokes (dying torches, star shimmer) that guide Elara’s stealth and hide Thorne’s approach.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stormlit observatory is vivid, selective, and purposeful—lightning timing Elara’s decision, glass dome reflecting inner storm. Micro-settings (desk, timer, envelope) constrain action. Environment charges the final image: storm becomes audience to uncensored words. Could be tighter—some weather lines verge on familiar tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Glass atrium and brook are vivid and selective; light fracturing across stone subtly mirrors the fracturing of certainty. The sundial’s angles and the needle card are integrated into action rather than backdrop. No environmental constraint alters tactics, preventing 9-band entry, but the setting charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rusted shelves, dust motes, rooftop skyline—selective, atmospheric, filtered through Elias’s patched coat. The library’s physical state (sagging spines, creaking gate) tracks with the rebuilding action, constraining what can be salvaged. Moonlight and star-framed silhouette charge the final image effectively. No spatial drift; micro-setting (coffee tin) handled tactilely.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    The tidal arbor is atmospherically rich and supplies the compasses and reel archive that guide choice; however, the setting does not physically constrain her final action—she simply returns to the piano—so it stops just short of charging the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ridge breathes with her heartbeat—lovely, but decorative. The seed’s glow under moonlight is the only setting detail that constrains choice, and even that is brief. Micro-setting (moss bed) is present but under-used; the grove never becomes a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    The islet’s post-rain scent and slick rocks constrain Elias’s steps to the hidden cove; the tide’s shimmer literally reveals the chest. Micro-setting (porch, cove, cottage wall) is filtered through his patient gaze, and the final absorption of letters into the sea charges the closing image with salt and loss.
