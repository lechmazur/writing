  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.4)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse is established early with sensory detail (broken glass, brackish water, skeletal frame) and recurs across beats. However, the environment does not meaningfully constrain Elara's experiments—she sprinkles dust freely without resource limits or spatial friction. The butterfly dust vial functions as a micro-setting object but its mechanics remain vague; we never see how shattered glass or damp soil alters her tactics. The setting charges the final image thematically but does not pressure the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.1)
    The canyon, campfire, frost patterns, and bioluminescent grotto are vivid and sensorially grounded. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the frost guides Elara's investigation but doesn't constrain her choices or impose a tactical cost. The grotto's kiln appears as revelation rather than obstacle. Spatial choreography is clean and the mood is consistent, but environment doesn't shape the final image or narrow options at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    The winterglass conservatory is vivid and purposeful: the "frozen waterfalls" shimmer, plants cling with visible veins, the space serves as sanctuary against the muted external world. The conservatory's cold stone bench and enclosed warmth contrast with the desolate landscape, grounding Elara's isolation and the defiance of life within. The tuning fork vibrations and heat-mapping device function as micro-setting elements that constrain her attempts and charge the final image when she strikes the fork at dawn. Sensory detail is filtered through Elara's musician-turned-translator perspective, specific to her priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.1)
    The underwater library is vivid (seaweed aisles, coral statue, reinforced windows) and supplies multiple fragment-hiding locations that enable the quest. Spatial choreography is clear across moves. The lens itself—fractured prisms, humming urgency, glowing at the end—constrains the quest structure and charges the final image, qualifying as micro-setting. However, the environment does not force a trade-off or complicate tactics; it is traversed without friction. One point of genuine constraint (finding fragments in impossible spaces) lifts the score above ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.2)
    The terra-cotta arbor anchors the setting and recurs at the gathering, but it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it remains atmospheric. Sensory detail is present (lanterns, moonlight, cracked tiles) but filtered more by narrator convenience than POV bias. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.9)
    The viaduct's wisteria, iron beams, and hidden alcove are vividly rendered and anchor the single-scene window. The pendant's physical presence (cool, smooth jade) recurs and the hollow in Kwan Yin's palm provides a concrete spatial constraint that guides Elara's final action. Sensory details—scent of wisteria giving way to damp stone—modulate with her movement and support atmospheric accumulation, though they do not force a choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.1)
    The living bridge garden and hedge maze provide vivid sensory grounding (damp earth, blooming flowers, rustling leaves, warping geometry), and the maze's shifting paths constrain Elara's navigation in the middle section. The pedestal and clearing supply the closure stage, charging the final beat. However, the hyperbolic geometry remains ornamental—mentioned but not dramatized in a way that alters tactics or deepens the spatial pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.1)
    The carnival setting is vivid and specific ("rusted Ferris wheel creaked like an old man's bones," "yellowed keys," "rotted floor"). The redemption booth's hidden vault and labyrinthine layout enable the liberator's escape tactics. However, sensory detail skews visual without body or proximity pressure; the "floorboards," "ladder," and "jars" remain postcard elements rather than micro-setting that constrains the final choice or charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory palette is vivid and selective (lavender hum, indigo rumble, ashen surface), filtered through Elara's synesthesia. The greenhouse and shipwrecks supply atmospheric detail but do not constrain a key choice; Elara moves freely without spatial friction. The forge appears late and serves as stage-prop rather than environment that pressures tactics. Micro-setting credit for the hearing aid as tool, which translates colors into navigational cues, though its utility is ornamental rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.1)
    The emerald station and clock tower are anchored early with concrete moonlight detail. The jar's glow and the flower arrangement receive focused description. However, the tower's interior never constrains movement or choice; Lira climbs "steadily despite the height" without tactical friction. The spatial choreography remains generic (pedestal, hidden panel) without lived-in specificity. Sensory detail is mostly visual; other senses are absent even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.1)
    The abandoned control room is anchored early with vivid detail ("cracked consoles and dust-laden screens") and the cracked bookmark appears in multiple beats. The setting and object do not constrain a choice or force a tactical shift, but the bookmark's placement in the final sphere offers a charged reprise that reweights its symbolic function. Micro-setting (the bookmark as talisman) qualifies and shapes the ending image, pushing the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rusted library under stars is vividly anchored early with "iron beams groaning," "rust and old paper," and starlight through roof gaps. The seashell and cast function as micro-setting objects that constrain the search sequence. However, spatial choreography inside the library remains vague—shelves, a table, a back door, a mirror room—without clear distances or access logic. The stars watch but do not pressure choice; the setting provides atmosphere more than tactical constraint, though the locked door and key do gate progress.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.4)
    Vivid sensory anchors ("storm-tossed ridge," "ambered hush," "flaking gold leaf") establish atmosphere and the fort "listens" in a purposeful way. The booklet's pages "turn themselves" and "grow heavier," which charges the ritual. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome—it remains backdrop. The final gaze at the ridge is observational rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.1)
    The frozen courtyard, twilight palette, and ice-crystal violin create vivid sensory grounding. The violin's "otherworldly energy" and refracting light are filtered through Unit-7's sensors, anchoring POV. The courtyard "dissolves" during the musical climax, which charges the final return to the unchanged physical space. However, the setting remains largely postcard description; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—Unit-7's epiphany could occur in any mystical venue with minor edits.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.1)
    The crystal forecourt is anchored early with sensory detail (petrichor, glow, hum) and the lens/ticket function as micro-setting objects. The lens returns at closure and Kian holds it to the light, which lightly charges the final image. However, the crystals' "whispering" remains ornamental mood-setting rather than constraining choice or altering tactics. The setting supports atmosphere but does not pressure the protagonist's decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.1)
    The garden maze is evoked with purposeful imagery (twisting paths, hidden nooks, rainbows cast through foliage) and the marbles interact with setting through sunlight and placement. However, the maze does not constrain a navigation choice or shape a tactic under pressure—it remains atmospheric rather than functional. The body and tool (hands, marbles) are described but do not force a micro-decision. Solid sensory work with POV filter, but the 9+ gate (setting constrains choice or charges final image) is not met; cap at 8.8 even without other issues.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.1)
    The xenobiology station is anchored with sensory detail (metallic surfaces, fogging breath, bioluminescent creatures), and the magnetic nexus physically constrains Elara's actions across beats (bolt-tightening, lever grip, manual override). Spatial choreography tracks clearly from workstation to control room and back. However, the holographic interface collapses mid-crisis yet Elara returns to a functioning "holographic display" at the end without causal explanation, breaking consistency and capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.4)
    The flooded opera house is vividly anchored with water, silt, flickering lanterns, and stage geography. The antique program constrains Clara's discovery and the water itself becomes instrumental (damage creating images). However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than forcing tactical choices; Clara moves freely without environmental resistance. The final beat where "water began to ripple in time with the melody" gestures toward setting-as-participant but arrives too late to shape prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.1)
    The mountain weather station is anchored early with sensory detail (metal frame, ozone scent, aging beams) and modulates with the wind gust when the wanderer arrives. The botanical illustration functions as micro-setting, constraining Elara's attention and charging the final image when she alters it. Spatial choreography (desk, doorway, Elara's finger on paper) remains clear, but the station itself does not pressure a choice—Elara could perform the same arc in any liminal space without structural change.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.1)
    The tunnel setting is vivid and atmospheric early on ("damp earth and rusted metal," "jagged shards of broken glass"). The beaded valve wheel is physically handled and the cavernous chamber is described with gear and belt particulars. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; Mara's path is unobstructed and the valve slot awaits her without complication, reducing setting to backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    The overgrown library is vividly sketched with vines and ancient tomes, and the obsidian refuge's light-absorbing stone is memorable. However, spatial choreography in the catacombs is vague—walls "shifting as if guiding her" without concrete distances or choices based on layout. The swan functions as setting-object but constrains no middle choice; the mirror appears only at the end. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric but does not shape a key tactic or decision.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sage Ridge is anchored early with selective sensory detail ("grass seemed to glow faintly," "roots beneath their feet stirring"). The eclipse itself constrains the timeline and charges the atmosphere, and the meadow setting frames the encounter. However, the setting does not pressure Elara's choices or supply resources that alter tactics—it functions primarily as backdrop. The curl, as a micro-object, does charge the final image, lifting the score slightly, but the environment itself remains decorative rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    The silo library is vividly sketched ("bronze quiet," "metal walls weathered by time") and the hidden compartment provides a spatial discovery beat. The fireplace in the abandoned manor and the stone altar in the silo center supply concrete anchors. However, setting does not constrain the climax; Elara places the tapestry and performs the ritual without environmental friction or tactical adjustment. The Orientation Test penalty in Q2 caps this category at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.1)
    The Chinatown restaurant kitchen is anchored early with sensory fragments (clatter of dishes, hum of refrigerator), and the lighthouse image recurs with visual specificity. However, the kitchen itself never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Li Wei's work is described abstractly, and no tool, spatial layout, or environmental detail pressures the decision to journey. The lighthouse remains postcard scenery in Li Wei's mind, not a lived setting that affects the on-page action. Spatial choreography is minimal; the desk, kitchen, and colleagues exist as static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.6)
    Setting remains abstract throughout: "dimensional anchor" offers no spatial constraints, access points, or tactile detail that shapes choice. The palette is mentioned but never handled or used as a tool; it "glows" and "fades" without altering tactics. Sensory detail is generic metaphor ("muffled clarity," "resonant" silence) rather than concrete perception. Orientation cap applied in Q2 carries forward: cap Q3 at 7.0 per the Orientation Test.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glass spire and frozen lake are vivid but ornamental; neither constrains a choice or alters tactics. The nautilus shell is handled twice (tracing ridges, inscribing) but remains static description. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the sensory hierarchy (silvery glow, fogged glass) reflects calm rather than crisis. Micro-setting could elevate if the shell's chambers or the harp's crystal strings shaped a choice, but they do not.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.4)
    The glowing viaduct and rain-soaked asphalt anchor the opening sensory field, and the tablet's glow provides a recurring visual motif. However, the procedurally generated fractal paths remain abstract—no spatial choreography clarifies how Elara navigates or chooses among them, and no environmental constraint shapes her choices. The micro-setting of wet surfaces and distant traffic does not return to charge the final image. Professional detail (gravity manipulation mechanics) is absent, leaving the viaduct as atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.7)
    The cavern is vividly established with torches, stone walls, and vibrations, and it returns meaningfully at closure when Elara picks up drumsticks. The phonograph and records function as tools that constrain her method. However, the environment largely serves as backdrop; spatial details don't pressure choices during the backward-song process, and the "faint rustle of turning seasons" remains atmospheric rather than a tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.1)
    The courtyard at dusk is anchored early with sensory detail (damp earth, thunder rumble), and the industrial wasteland provides spatial contrast. The stone bench and barred gate ground key beats. However, the quarantine compound interior—"eerily empty" medical tents, a shrouded tower—reads generic; no environmental feature constrains Elias's infiltration or shapes his final choice. The setting stages action but does not pressure decisions or charge the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.4)
    The terra-cotta grotto is vividly established with shifting patterns, cracked walls, and pulsing starlight. The rope's placement across the floor aligns with the grotto's etchings, constraining Elias's path toward the alcove. The environment shapes exploration and charges the final image, though the energy beings above remain atmospheric rather than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sunken greenhouse and shipwrecks are vividly rendered ("fractured glass catching the light," "wooden bones groaning"), and sensory detail is selective. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The mendicant's bowl charges the final image through return, earning modest setting credit, but the greenhouse itself remains ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.7)
    The amber grotto supplies vivid sensory anchors (molten light, damp earth, metallic minerals) and the petal functions as a micro-object. Spatial choreography is clean. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Elara's process unfolds without environmental friction. The setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure source, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "breezy library under stars" is vivid and recurs at closure, but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint—Elara could meet Clara anywhere without altering choice. Sensory detail is selective (salt, pine, stars through open roof) and filtered through Elara's broker perspective, but the setting does not pressure the friendship's initiation or shape tactics. The symphony hall and library anchor who/where/when early, satisfying orientation. Micro-setting allowance: the locket photo as recurring small object charges the final image but does not constrain a prior choice, so the 9+ gate is not met.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.1)
    The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are vividly rendered and return at closure, charging the final image. However, the setting remains largely backdrop; spatial details do not constrain Lira's search tactics or alter her choices under pressure. The arbor's shifting patterns are described but never handled or leveraged as a resource. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) opportunities—reed-sculpting gestures, tactile engagement with materials—are summarized rather than woven into action beats.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.4)
    The rooftop canal system and cavern are vividly sketched with sensory specificity (water "churned with urgency," air "thick with the scent of earth and time"). However, spatial choreography becomes vague during the canal walk ("towers leaned closer") and the environment does not constrain choices—the canal "shifted around her" and "bent to her will." The infinity carvings and pool serve as visual backdrop rather than resources that alter tactics. Micro-setting (pendant) does recur and charges the gate-opening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cavern orchard with dripping stalactites is vividly established and returns at closure when "the orchard seemed to glow brighter." The mosaic stepping stones constrain Elara's investigative tactics (she must decode patterns to locate the tree). Sensory detail is present (faint light, warmth of the unmarked stone) but remains largely visual; micro-setting (the glass eyes as lens, the hidden compartment) functionally charges the investigation. Spatial choreography is clean across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.1)
    "Sapphire hush," pipe chases, and the alcove are vivid and consistent. The library's spatial layout (aisles, corners, alcove descent) guides the search sequence and the cold air marks depth, meeting micro-setting utility. However, no environmental constraint forces a choice or charges the final image—the dweller moves freely, and the setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mossy trellis and storm-drenched nursery provide vivid sensory anchors ("scent of wet earth and blooming flora," "rain lashed against the trellis"). The trellis shifts from barrier to gateway, constraining the closure image. However, the nursery remains largely static—plants "whisper encouragement" metaphorically but don't supply tactical resources or physical obstacles. The linden leaf's warm, shimmering physicality charges the middle beat, lifting the score into mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal island setting is vivid and purposeful: bioluminescent algae, salt-and-earth scent, crumbling cottage, sunken ruin, natural archway all ground the world in post-apocalyptic recovery. The brooch is warm to the touch and the ruin's converging walls "defied geometry," providing concrete sensory anchors. The setting constrains Elara's exploration (muddy paths, storm, tides) and the cove's natural archway frames the climactic exchange, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across locations, and the micro-setting (amber brooch on desk, easel) brackets the opening and close effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.4)
    The musical crystal cave is vividly established with sensory specificity (shimmering walls, overlapping notes, iridescent pearl). The cave's song shifts during the merger sequence, and the pearl's glow anchors the transformation. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Elara moves through it without spatial friction or resource trade-offs. The setting charges the final image but does not narrow options or impose cost.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.7)
    The harbor setting—damp sand, salt-and-petrichor air, seaweed-tangled cliffs—is vivid and consistently filtered through Elara's archivist lens. The carved wood fragment and the valve are concrete props that anchor action. However, the setting largely decorates rather than constrains: the softening ground and ocean spray do not limit her search or alter tactics, and the cliffs serve as backdrop for the woman's entrance without creating spatial pressure. The harbor "exhaling" at the end is evocative but does not crystallize a choice-shaping environmental detail.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.1)
    The starlit vault, mist-shrouded woods, and shimmering fortress walls create vivid atmosphere, but setting remains largely decorative. The phantom punch is handled across multiple beats (desk, station, fortress gate, final pedestal) and its cold-to-touch brass detail recurs, qualifying as micro-setting that charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear (station → woods → clearing → fortress interior → back to station), though the arrows and mirrors don't constrain choice—they guide passively.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.8)
    Anchors are clear and varied (cottage, shore, tower), and the spiral staircase overgrown with ivy provides texture. The whale migration and star canvas offer atmospheric backdrop, but neither constrains a choice or charges the final image—they remain postcard detail. The tile warms in her pocket and the pedestal at tower-top serve minor functional roles, meeting the micro-setting allowance, but the setting does not pressure Elara's tactics or alter the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prismatic escondite is vivid and consistently rendered ("kaleidoscope of dimensions," "colors twisted into chaotic patterns"), and the solar storm applies temporal pressure. However, the setting remains largely descriptive; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. The fragment and magnetic fields are handled, but the escondite itself functions as backdrop rather than pressure point, missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.4)
    The funeral home prep room is vividly anchored (formaldehyde, marble table, flickering lights) and the ink pot receives concrete attention. The setting provides atmospheric pressure and the pot acts as a recurring object, but the environment does not constrain Clara's final choice—her confrontation with her father could occur in any private room. Spatial choreography is clear (table, shelf, door) and sensory detail is purposeful, yet the setting remains largely ornamental at closure rather than shaping tactics or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.4)
    The bonsai labyrinth is vivid and specific ("moss-covered ground," "miniature worlds"), and the fluorescent lamp anchors time. The forest setting is described but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome—it amplifies atmosphere without tactical pressure. The final image ("trees seemed to whisper their approval") is decorative rather than charged with cost. Spatial choreography (flat stone, paths) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.4)
    The shipping-container labyrinth is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (rusted frames, salt-laden air, mudflats revealing relics). The environment supplies the poison-bottle label and the archive container, shaping two beats. However, spatial choreography within the maze remains abstract—no use of proximity, access restriction, or navigational cost that alters a choice. The tidal rhythm is atmospheric but doesn't constrain a decision at closure. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) doesn't charge the final image beyond symbolic mention.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cracked dome, crumbling cliff, and half-finished cello provide vivid, purposeful anchors. Sensory detail—wind, salt tang, dust, old wood—reflects POV priorities and grounds each beat. The cello as micro-setting constrains Mara's choice to play and charges the closure image when its hum fades into "silence that felt alive." Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the observatory's transformation from abandonment to sanctuary coheres with the thematic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.1)
    The raft city, Cerulean Sea, and "perpetual carnival" are vividly named but remain postcard backdrops—no piece of the setting constrains a choice or charges the final image. The foundation stone chip is handled twice (discovery, placement) but its physical properties never alter Lira's tactics. Spatial choreography is clear, but the environment does not pressure decisions, so the micro-setting test for 9+ fails and the score stays mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lunar setting is vivid and specific: regolith crunch, metallic dulling, the horizon's first light. The nightwatch's hourglass sand grain functions as micro-setting, clutched and referenced across beats. The summit's "eerie stillness" and "dawning hush" filter through Elara's professional lens. The environment does not constrain a choice (she completes her task unhindered by terrain or clock), capping the score below 9, but sensory detail anchors mood and the final photograph's golden light charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mist-coated depot and water features are vivid and purposeful, filtering perception through Elara's blindness. Sensory hierarchy is clear: she listens to light refraction and air shifts, and the depot's ambient sounds pulse with the anchor event. Spatial choreography is clean, and the water features constrain her method. The environment charges the final image ("mist curled around her"), meeting the 9+ gate criterion, but occasional elevated diction ("mosaic of glass and liquid") drifts from the utilitarian voice expected of a rail-depot artisan.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and ice fissure are vivid and purposeful. The mist and condensation pattern anchor both perception and the discovery beat, fulfilling the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography is clean—desk to window to lake's edge to fissure—with sensory detail filtered through Elara's cartographic lens ("veins of a map"). One deduction: the phrasebook's "dog-ear marking the page for 'source'" is told rather than shown in handling, and "worrying tranquility" as an atmospheric phrase feels imposed rather than emergent from concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.8)
    Setting details (archway, cobblestones, pine scent, bell tower) are vivid and consistent, filtered through a consistent atmospheric lens. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Elias moves through it without friction. The archway and cobblestones are described but do not shape the outcome; they remain postcard backdrops. Spatial choreography is clear across the ghost town, and sensory hierarchy (sound, scent) remains stable, which prevents a lower score.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.8)
    The underwater temple is described in generic terms ("stone walls," "intricate carvings," "hidden passages") that could fit any forgotten ruin. Spatial choreography is vague—Maya moves through shifting walls and discovers chambers without clear navigation or cost tied to the environment's constraints. The crystals in the heart chamber are vivid but ornamental; they emit glow and energy without altering Maya's tactical options. The setting does not meaningfully constrain the final choice or charge the closure image, capping high-band eligibility per Q3's 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lighthouse prison and jagged reef are named early but function as backdrop; "copperlight repose" charges one chamber descriptively yet does not constrain Elias's choices. Spatial choreography is coherent across the descent and return. The lattice is handled in multiple beats but its physicality and constraint remain abstract, and the ending's visual sweep ("hues of gold and crimson") ornaments rather than pressures the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.1)
    The greenhouse is vivid ("petrified blossoms," "winter-cracked fields," twisted tree) and the carved bead recurs with glowing light, but neither constrains a choice or charges the final image with tactical consequence. Sensory detail supports atmosphere yet remains ornamental; the environment does not narrow options or supply a resource that alters the ending. Spatial choreography is clear (aisles, roots, center tree), meeting baseline scope for this length, but the micro-setting test for high bands is not satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.1)
    The labyrinth's red canyon walls anchor place early, but spatial choreography remains vague—Elara "moves deeper" without mapped turns or distances. The storybook plate's shifting illustrations are described but never constrain a tactical choice or force a detour. "Orchid solace" and "hauntingly optimistic aura" repeat as atmospheric labels without sensory grounding or perceptual filter. The final glow is asserted, not shown altering any on-page action.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.4)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered with recurring sensory anchors (roots snaking through bones, ivy, moss, golden hue). Spatial choreography remains coherent across the excavation. The sundial base functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final beat by unlocking the tomb, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Deduction: the orchard's pressure on choice is more atmospheric than tactical—Elara follows the land's "whispers" rather than concrete constraints altering her decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.1)
    The golden arcade is vividly described with mosaics and pillars, and dawn light is tracked across beats. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the mailbox and chalk drawings do not constrain Lyra's choices or alter her tactics. Micro-setting (the ebony clipboard) appears but does not pressure decisions. The environment charges atmosphere but does not shape the final image's stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cobalt observatory, velvet cushion, stained-glass window, and autumn leaves provide vivid sensory anchors filtered through Elara's craft focus. The eternal flame functions as both atmosphere and symbolic object. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (Elara at embroidery, door, back to work), though the "observatory hummed with energy" late in the piece drifts toward abstraction. The flame's steady/pulsing state does recur and subtly charges the final image, lifting the score slightly, but it does not demonstrably constrain a tactical choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.1)
    The mangrove labyrinth supplies vivid sensory anchors ("roots twisted like ancient fingers," "moonlight pooled like liquid silver") and the shard's glow provides a recurring spatial cue. The hut's fogged windows function as a micro-setting that constrains the reveal of messages. However, the singing spirits remain ornamental—they hum and harmonize but never block a path or force a choice, and spatial choreography within the grove is vague (pedestal appears without prior setup).

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.1)
    The mist-clad atrium is vividly rendered with scent (jasmine, damp earth) and tactile detail (condensation on glass). The coral fragment's glow and the cast's surface provide micro-setting anchors. However, the environment never constrains a choice—Elara's decryption proceeds unimpeded by spatial or material limits. The final image references the atrium as "threshold" but the shift is metaphorical rather than a function of setting pressure, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.1)
    The fog and ruins supply vivid atmosphere and the clearing/chamber provide spatial anchors. The fog becomes Lira's canvas in paragraph 7, which charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate partially. However, the "knowledge network" of mirrors and prisms is introduced late (paragraph 5) and operates off-page; its mechanics never constrain her choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.7)
    The sound wave garden and metallic flowers provide vivid, memorable anchors. The hobo nickel's etched surface and the obsidian eyes are sharply rendered. The garden's resonant hum subtly enables the mural's awakening, meeting the micro-setting test: the environment participates in the transformation. However, spatial choreography blurs when translucent figures "step out" and "interact"—specific blocking (distance, movement paths) is missing. The final image relies on abstract "stories" and "tapestry" rather than concrete sensory payoff from the now-awake garden.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.1)
    The greenhouse supplies vivid sensory anchors (jasmine, damp earth, drone of insects, fogging glass) and the gourd seed on the workbench serves as a concrete focal object. Spatial choreography remains clear through Elias's entry and Krane's reveal. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—the loose panel is labeled a "test" retroactively, and the protagonists simply leave. Micro-setting potential is present but not leveraged at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.1)
    The shell is vividly described in the opening with strong architectural specificity ("towering spirals," "whispering chambers," "hidden alcove"), and spatial anchors remain stable. However, the setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it functions as atmospheric backdrop without applying pressure to the protagonist's goal or shaping the closure image with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.4)
    The opal library and glass orchards are vividly rendered with multi-sensory detail (milky blue, pale green, chiming petals). The wind chime's cracked tube and the Vessel of Echoes are handled across beats and constrain her song at the climax. Spatial choreography is coherent. Setting does not, however, force a tactical choice or cost—Elara moves freely without environmental friction, and the museum opens without resistance. The setting decorates rather than pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.2)
    The extinct language archive is vivid in atmosphere (dust motes, narrow beams, labyrinthine shelves) and the glass inkwell is a central object, but setting functions more as backdrop than constraint. The archive's "forgotten voices" and "heavy atmosphere" are told rather than shown altering Elara's tactics. The inkwell does charge the final image, lifting the score, but spatial choreography and the mechanics of navigation remain generic. No environmental detail meaningfully limits or enables a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.1)
    The amphitheater's "breathing" walls and glowing cracks create atmosphere and recur at closure ("seemed less foreboding now"), reweighting the setting with a felt change. Spatial choreography is clear (center, walls, fissures), and the volcanic heat underscores tension. However, the setting does not constrain a choice: Elias paces and sketches freely, and the amphitheater's approval is metaphorical rather than tactical. The antique chain and adhesive details anchor the scene in specificity but do not alter Elias's access or options.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.4)
    The attic, skylight, and meteorite chip anchor setting with sensory detail (musty air, crumbling books, velvet pouch). The meteorite recurs but never constrains a choice—it is held, clutched, rested on her palm without altering tactics or shaping the closure image's pressure. The dust motes function thematically but do not supply a resource or obstacle that changes Elara's options. Spatial choreography is clear; the setting supports atmosphere but remains postcard-level rather than micro-setting that drives action.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.1)
    The drifting prism terrace is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (glass groaning, colors washing over her, fractured hush) and modulates with the scene's pressure. Spatial choreography is clear and the terrace constrains her movement physically. However, the terrace does not force a choice or charge the final image decisively; she leaves the logbook on it, but the setting remains backdrop rather than crucible at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    The underwater facility is vividly rendered: "glass domes cracked and algae-coated," "rusted machinery and faded maps," bioluminescent currents and deep-sea creatures. The viewport functions as a literal and thematic threshold, and the weakening domes apply time pressure (alarms signal structural failure). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (astrologer noticing constellation-like patterns). The facility constrains Elara's choice at the alarm—she must leave—and the golden sunrise through cracks charges the final image, lifting the score into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    The iridescent cave and crater glass supply vivid, purposeful detail filtered through Lira's recollectionist lens. The "cheerful gloom" and "walls shimmered with hues of violet and gold" create atmosphere, and the glass functions as both tool and mirror. Spatial choreography is coherent. The setting does not, however, constrain a choice or charge the final image in a way that alters tactics; it remains beautifully rendered backdrop rather than an active pressure on the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.1)
    The arcade is sketched with vivid details (glass ceiling, celestial glow, eclectic mix) and spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—Elias moves through it as a tourist catalog rather than tactile engagement. The skylight beam is used for spectacle but does not alter tactics or options. Micro-setting elements (board, bishop) are handled but remain props rather than pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.1)
    The twilight garden is vividly rendered with obsidian grace and midnight blooms, and the moonstone dust as micro-setting charges the tattooing beat. However, the garden's spatial layout remains vague—no clear anchors for where Lira stands relative to the edge where the sentinel appears. The setting contributes atmosphere but does not constrain her final choice; she could defy the sentinel anywhere.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    Pearl Bay at dawn is rendered with vivid sensory detail (mist, light, glass facets) and the prism atrium functions as a spatial anchor. The pond and its ripples provide a recurring image that charges the middle section. However, the environment does not constrain Elias's choices—he moves freely through the space without physical or social friction. The final image (prism catching light, walking into dawn) aesthetically reprises earlier motifs but does not materially alter his options.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.1)
    The moonlit ridge and cracked porcelain box are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail. The box's tactile presence (weight, jagged edges, faint hum) anchors the scene. However, setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the ridge functions as backdrop rather than active element. The final placement of the box on the ridge charges the image slightly but does not shift options.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.4)
    The grotto is vividly established ("tide-polished," "walls shimmered with centuries of oceanic caress") and the tide provides a recurring environmental pressure. However, the setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Elara "adjusts" without visible difficulty or cost. The altitude gauge sits beside her, described but not handled in a way that changes action. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, supporting tone effectively, but does not reach the gate for environment meaningfully shaping the final image or forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.9)
    The ivy-veiled passage, waterfall, and hidden chamber are vivid and consistent. The film strip catching light to reveal the map is a strong micro-setting moment that constrains Echo's next move. However, the passage functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active pressure: the ivy "seems to watch" and "parts for her," but these gestures remain metaphorical rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "echoing terrace in spring" and "prism parapet after rain" anchor the scene with vivid sensory detail (sunlight fractured through wet glass, spectrum of colors). The prism parapet functions as a stage but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it's descriptive rather than tactical. Sensory selection (spring air, bells tolling) supports tone and cadence, and the mirage-painting relies on the prism's light refraction, giving the setting mild causal relevance. Spatial choreography is clear (terrace, parapet, mirrors in ornate frames, shadows), but the environment remains more backdrop than pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ancient terrace and valley setting are established early with sensory detail (jasmine scent, flickering fires). The terrace functions as a ritual space with history, and the clipboard is handled multiple times. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice—Elara's path and actions would proceed identically in a generic neutral ground. Spatial choreography (descent, camp, terrace return) is clear but does not pressure tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.4)
    The salt flat is vividly rendered with selective detail ("earth shimmered like a cracked mirror," "crystalline surface"). The setting constrains Elara's path via the crack-map, qualifying as micro-setting pressure. However, spatial choreography remains static—she walks, kneels, stands—without environmental friction that alters her tactics. The damp earth miracle arrives on cue rather than being earned through her navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.1)
    The silver courtyard and prism sanctuary anchor space vividly ("crystalline walls catching starlight and refracting it into a kaleidoscope"), and snow recurs to frame the opening and close the piece, reweighting as a carrier of echoes. However, the sanctuary's interior and the threads remain visually vague—no tactile resistance, no spatial constraint that forces a harder choice. The courtyard does not pressure Elara's tactics; she walks in, works, and leaves without environmental friction. The final snow image charges the closure moderately but does not constrain the prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.1)
    The decommissioned radar dome is vivid and specific (cracked windows, dark screens, warped stage), and the stick's tactile presence recurs across beats. However, neither environment nor object constrains a choice that alters outcome—they function as atmospheric backdrop rather than shaping tactics or charging the final image. The dome's "sanctuary" status is told, not demonstrated through spatial pressure. Selective detail is present but does not meet the 9+ gate (constraint or charge).

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.1)
    The grotto is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (moss, vines, light, hum) filtered through Elara's esoteric perception. The moth wing and monarch wing function as micro-setting objects that charge the final spiral, satisfying the 9+ gate criterion of constraining choice (selecting which wing to add) and charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear. Some details (blushing stillness, twisting vines) verge on stock pastoral imagery, but the grotto's role as a place where "past and present converged" subtly frames Elara's ritualized action.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.4)
    The icebound sanctum and aurora are vividly sketched with sensory specificity (pine, frost, pulsing colors). However, setting remains postcard backdrop; the ice, rope, and punched card do not constrain choice or alter tactics—Elara's work proceeds unimpeded. The rope's glow and the aurora's flare are described but do not test her or narrow options. Spatial choreography is clear, but the environment does not pressure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    The vine-draped bunker and storm imagery are vivid and consistent. Sensory detail is selective (wafer seal glow, storm pounding, ethereal grit) and filtered through the protagonist's focus. The bunker's "precisely playful architecture" and "labyrinthine corridors" are mentioned but never constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page; the setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.1)
    The palace courtyard's schematic floor and observatory dome are described vividly, but remain postcard backdrops. The hidden compartment appears conveniently without prior spatial set-up. The tile's alignment with stars is told, not shown through tactile manipulation or environmental constraint. Sensory detail (dusky harmony, shimmering symbols) is generic and does not filter through Kael's professional astronomer lens or constrain a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sanctuary is anchored early with selective sensory detail ("faint hum of shifting realities," "marble fountain, its waters still"). The music box cylinder pin returns at closure, reweighting the opening image with thematic charge, which qualifies as micro-setting function. However, the sanctuary itself remains atmospheric rather than constraining; no choice hinges on its layout, and "shifting realities" is asserted but never dramatized in spatial or access terms.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ruined orchard and fog are vivid early, and frost "settled on the gnarled apple trees" supplies tactile detail. However, spatial choreography inside the workshop remains vague—no layout, tool placement, or body movement through space. The sextant's brass and prism are described but never constrain a micro-choice; Elara's interaction with it is passive observation rather than manipulation that reveals world rules. The final outdoor beat uses fog-thinning to charge the closure image, meeting the Q3 9+ gate minimally, but the lush dream-orchard appears only as visual reward without prior grounding in her sensory hierarchy or memory.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cathedral-orchard hybrid is vivid and purposeful, filtering light through shattered glass and roots entwined with stone. The orchard's branches "respond" and "sway in encouragement," but this remains atmospheric; the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics at the closure beat. The ribbon on Elara's belt is handled twice (climbing stairs, final weaving), satisfying the micro-setting allowance and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.4)
    The astral orchard is vividly sketched—iridescent petals, whisper gravity, crystalline bathroom with thought-mirrors—and the surreal details cohere tonally. The cameo's shifting etch and the blossoms' hum anchor Elara's physical experience. However, the orchard does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop. The bathroom setting enables the breakthrough by stated function but is not causally linked to the discovery itself. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding catalog mode.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.1)
    The labyrinthine bookstore and mountain setting supply vivid images (moss-covered leather, shifting walls, temporal energy shimmer) but remain decorative. The environment threatens ("books that snapped like jaws") yet Elara bypasses each obstacle off-page via unspecified resourcefulness. The chrono-blossom's clockwork petals are specific, but spatial choreography (how far she moves, where Kael stands) is vague throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    The carnival ship setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (rusted hull, shattered mirrors, faded posters, saltwater and decay). The fog and ship interior guide Elara's path and the bow provides the climactic doorway, giving the environment some structural role. However, the space never constrains a choice or imposes a cost; Elara moves freely through the labyrinth without spatial friction, and the "trapped freedom" atmosphere remains mood rather than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.4)
    The clock tower mechanism room is anchored early with vivid tactile detail (gears, brass lamp, frayed rope), and the hidden door's "unnaturally smooth" frame hints at constraint. However, the setting remains largely descriptive: the gears slow "as if in anticipation" but do not block or enable a choice. The rope is handled across multiple beats and its braids constrain the method, lifting the score into mid-band, but the environment itself does not pressure Elara's decisions or charge the final image—she moves through it without spatial or resource friction.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.4)
    The harmonic caves are described with consistent sensory texture—"gently luminous glow," "crystalline walls," "thick with tension"—and the ice-crack motif recurs across beats. The setting pressures Lira's path through the labyrinth structure and the storm's influence "strongest here" tightens the final chamber's stakes. However, the caves function more as backdrop than constraint; no environmental detail blocks a choice or alters tactics with cost. The echo chamber stone and ice cracks enable rather than complicate, and the pedestal's seed awaits her arrival without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.1)
    The pavilion's glass walls, spiral staircase, and telescope provide concrete spatial grounding and recur across beats. The telescope functions as a tool that enables plot action (star-path tracking), meeting the micro-setting criterion. However, the environment does not visibly constrain a choice or charge the final image beyond atmospheric presence; the prism could reform in any setting with minor edits. Sensory detail ("faint hum," "cracked but functional lens") is present but remains largely decorative rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    The stormlit observatory, crystalline forecourt, and solidified fog are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail—"scent of rain and ozone," "stones that shimmered like liquid moonlight," "fog wall that rippled like water." The setting is filtered through Elara's archival attention and provides tactile interaction (kneeling, pressing her hand, measuring with a brass caliper). However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics in a way that affects the ending; it serves as backdrop and atmospheric source rather than active pressure. The fog wall delivers visions passively rather than forcing Elara to navigate a dilemma or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.1)
    The fortress courtyard, dry fountain, and wilting gardens anchor space purposefully. The kerosene rag knot is handled across multiple beats (dipped, spun, ignited twice), constraining Lira's method and charging the closure image with flame-light on mosaic. Sensory detail leans visual ("shimmered faintly," "flickering shadows") with limited tactile or olfactory grounding; "thick with anticipation" remains abstract. The mosaic tiles and fountain base provide micro-setting that alters the final tableau, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.4)
    The grotto under stars is vividly rendered with moss, rocky ceiling, and shifting starlight. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's observer stance. The jade cicada functions as a tactile micro-setting object that constrains her attention and charges the final beat, satisfying the 9+ gate criterion. However, the grotto itself remains atmospheric backdrop; it does not impose a physical constraint or supply a resource that alters her choices. Spatial choreography is clear and the setting evolves with the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.2)
    The xenial trellis and bunker are vividly sketched with sensory specificity (thin air, narrow windows, swaying vines). However, the trellis does not constrain a key choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome; Elara's climb proceeds smoothly without environmental friction. Spatial choreography is coherent, but the setting remains postcard-like rather than pressure-exerting, capping the score below the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.1)
    The drifting prism terrace is vivid and distinct, with sensory detail filtered through the hush Elias curates. The floating garden and prismatic towers supply concrete spatial anchors. The storm glass vial functions as micro-setting, constraining Elias's course adjustments in response to noise. The train whistle echo recurs purposefully. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting charges the final image and enables the central action, meeting the 9+ gate test for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.1)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall and bioluminescent vines supply vivid visual texture, and the waterfall does gate the archway discovery. Spatial choreography is clear (orchard → wall → waterfall → cavern → staircase → chamber). However, the environment remains largely postcard-descriptive; no sensory detail meaningfully narrows Lira's options or charges the final image. The ruby flake functions as a magical compass rather than a constraint rooted in setting logic.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ashen sanctuary and starlight anchor the scene early. The doorknocker ring is handled twice (worn, then pressed against threshold), and scars glimmer under the night sky, providing visual specificity. Yet the sanctuary itself remains atmospheric rather than tactical; no environmental detail (proximity, access, resource) constrains Lira's choice or alters her method during the climax, keeping setting functional but not essential to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.8)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm anchors the opening with vivid sensory detail (soft glow, ethereal light). The parallel dimension offers striking images—towers of time, rivers of memory, equations like stars—but these remain postcard description without constraining Elara's tactics or choices. The submarine porthole bolt's magnetic property and the chamber's pressure-as-force are functional props, yet spatial choreography in the machine-activation beat is generic: gears, levers, slot. No environmental feature forces a trade-off or charges the final image beyond the bolt's "new purpose" claim.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sepia reading room is anchored early with sensory detail (aged paper scent, golden shadows, brass gramophone) and recurs at closure, charging the final image with coherent atmosphere. The gramophone itself functions as a micro-setting object: Eleanor physically engages it (places handle, turns crank), and it triggers the vision-bridge, constraining her path toward revelation. However, the bridge setting arrives suddenly without spatial grounding (worn planks, amber sky) and dissolves without consequence, reading more as lyric decoration than a space that alters tactics. The evening timeframe modulates light but does not tighten decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    The alchemical greenhouse with bioluminescent vines and nightshade blooms is vivid and mood-consistent. The vines guide choice by forming marionette-movement patterns, and the program physically vibrates in Alaric's hand, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (center of greenhouse, gravel path, walls), but the greenhouse remains largely atmospheric; it does not constrain a tactical decision with visible cost at closure, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.1)
    The foster care file room is established early with vivid detail (sagging shelves, old paper smell, dusty window light). The button and dust patterns supply concrete micro-setting that guides Elara's method and constrains her approach. However, spatial choreography is minimal—Elara moves from shelf to desk but the room does not pressure a choice or evolve causally. The setting functions as backdrop rather than obstacle, keeping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.1)
    The auric lagoon is vivid and anchored early (emerald/gold waters, starlight, damp sand) and it constrains Mara's access by requiring her to wade and locate the submerged door. The archive's sensory details (algae-encrusted door, dusty records, flickering holograms) build atmosphere but remain largely ornamental in the final beats. The setting does not charge the closure image; Mara's escape into "the night" with stars "winking in approval" is generic and ungrounded in prior spatial particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.1)
    The radiant grotto is vividly described (luminescent moss, prism atrium, dewdrops) and spatial choreography remains coherent, but setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The prism atrium "hums" and "rotates" in response to music, yet these changes do not alter the saxophonist's tactics or narrow his options—decoration without pressure. The micro-setting allowance (body, tool, recurring object) is not met; no element meaningfully charges the closure image or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly established with sensory detail ("thick with the scent of ancient wood," "perpetual gray") and returns in the closure paragraph. The moonstone speck constrains Elara's curiosity and shapes her monument-building action, though the arbor itself functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active constraint on her choices. Spatial choreography is clear (fire, flat stone, circle of seeds), and the setting's folklore tradition frames her task, but the environment does not visibly narrow options or alter tactics at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.4)
    The workshop labyrinth, neglected greenhouse, and bioluminescent cavern are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (cracked glass panes, swirling leaves, roar of the waterfall). The compass rose constrains the tinkerer's path, pointing him toward each location, and the charred map on the submerged pedestal becomes the object that reweights his understanding. The greenhouse's "air alive with movement" and the cavern's "pulse with life" slightly tilt toward overt symbolism, but the settings guide action rather than simply decorating it. The compass-as-constraint and the map's revelation anchor setting in the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rain-washed foundry anchors space and returns at the ending with the walls "no longer glistening," offering a modest lyric reprise. The cracked kintsugi flask is vivid but remains decorative; it never constrains a choice or resurfaces to alter tactics. Spatial choreography is clear (workshop, furnace mouth, inside furnace, stepping out), and the setting modulates with the vision sequence, but no environmental detail drives the final image or forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.1)
    Echo Gorge supplies mood and a "labyrinth of jagged rock," but spatial choreography remains generic—no turn depends on a crevice, distance, or climb. The harp returns in the final image ("strings now aligned"), reweighting the opening dissonance, which lifts the score moderately. The crocodile's tooth constrains nothing tactically; it is received, not used to alter a move.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ultraviolet forest is vividly described—glowing trees, warm bark, shimmering stream—but functions as reflective backdrop rather than constraining choice or supplying resources. The pewter mask strap is handled twice (coiled on wrist, dropped in stream), offering a micro-setting anchor, which lifts the score slightly. Spatial choreography is coherent (tree trunk, underbrush, stream), and sensory detail is selective, but the environment never pressures a decision or alters tactics; Elara moves through it without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.1)
    The alchemist's market is vividly sketched with ropes, pulleys, suspended platforms, and sensory detail (copper, burnt sage). The lens fragment constrains one choice—it illuminates the hidden doorway at the tower—lifting the score into the 6-band. However, the market itself functions as backdrop postcard; Lila moves through it without spatial negotiation or resource constraints affecting tactics. The tower's ivy-hidden door is the sole moment where setting pressure alters outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.7)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly anchored with sensory details (sawdust, popcorn, cracked window, dusty counter, fluorescent buzz). The mainspring barrel's tarnished brass and the counter's dust patterns ground Marcus's investigation. The ceiling—central to his motivation—functions as both setting and constraint, forcing the climb and revealing the hidden clock. Spatial choreography (counter climb, tile removal, void above) tracks cleanly. The setting presses the plot forward and charges the final image (lights flicker back, façade whole), meeting the 9+ gate, though the ghosts' forms and the "cracks in the façade" metaphor remain somewhat abstract rather than tactile environmental features.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.8)
    The glass orchard library floating on clouds is vividly rendered with concrete imagery (crystalline spires, frost patterns, swirling mist). The frost patterns function as a recurring motif that charges the inciting beat. However, spatial choreography during the cloud descent is vague—"the clouds enveloped her" without tactile specificity—and the library's transformation into a "living entity" is told rather than shown through environmental constraint. The setting does not visibly constrain Elara's final choice or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.4)
    Zahir-7's gilded spires, obsidian canals, and light-storms supply vivid sensory anchors. The Hall of Reflections and covered mirrors add atmospheric specificity. However, spatial choreography inside the Hall is vague—how Elara arranges the shard, where she stands, how the mirrors interact with the storm—and the environment doesn't constrain her choices or complicate the ritual. Setting enriches mood but remains largely postcard backdrop rather than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.1)
    The resonance chamber workshop and Covenant gears supply vivid imagery ("gears the size of houses," "fine red dust"). Spatial choreography collapses during the journey and inside the Covenant—no anchoring of Elias's position relative to the suspended box or turning gears. The chip's glow functions atmospherically but does not constrain a micro-choice. Sensory hierarchy (iron, age) appears but does not shift under urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sensory detail is vivid and varied: rust/rain scent, moss carvings, cool damp air, eerie blue glow. The lagoon's shimmering waters and jagged limestone cliffs create atmosphere, and the psychometry visions add textural depth. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Elara moves through spaces without spatial friction or resource scarcity altering her tactics. The compass needle guides but does not force a difficult navigation decision. For the 9-band, setting would need to pressure a choice or charge the final image more decisively; here it remains evocative backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    Storm imagery and the archway establish atmosphere early and return at closure. The chamber carvings mirror the slide patterns, creating visual cohesion. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop—the storm "stills" and "passes" without forcing tactical trade-offs. The passage and pedestal appear when needed rather than constraining her approach. Spatial choreography (archway → passage → chamber → pedestal) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    The amber pavilion and cathedral are anchored with sensory specificity (latticework, weathered stone, shards of color), and the stained glass windows constrain Elara's observation, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Spatial choreography is coherent across locations. However, the autumn-to-spring timeframe and the pavilion's physical layout do not alter tactics or choices in a legible way; setting functions more as backdrop than active constraint, limiting the score despite vivid description.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.7)
    The zeppelin library, obsidian lagoon, and dunes are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (shadow "like a dark whisper," lagoon as "mirror of the sky"). Spatial choreography is clean: descent, approach to water's edge, arrangement of debris, figure emergence. The beach debris functions as micro-setting that constrains Elara's method of contact, pushing the score toward higher bands. However, the zeppelin interior remains postcard description; no environmental feature pressures a choice or charges the final image beyond backdrop, capping the category below 7.0 despite strong atmospheric control.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.1)
    Setting anchors early with vivid details: cobblestone streets, crumbling buildings, paper lanterns. The amber bottle is handled across multiple beats and the lanterns return with intensified meaning at closure, charging the final image. However, the environment never constrains a choice; the cove is backdrop rather than crucible. Spatial choreography is clean, but the setting does not pressure tactics or alter the protagonist's options, limiting integration to atmospheric function.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    The orchard atop a skyscraper is vivid and specific, with gnarled trees, etched bark, and golden sunset light. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elara's priorities (she notices symbols she'd never seen before under pressure). The phonograph in her study and the wax shaving constrain one choice (fitting the shaving to play the recording), and the symbols on the oak guide her decipherment. Spatial choreography is clear throughout; the garden's paths, center, and edge are coherently tracked. The setting subtly mirrors her internal search (ancient preservation project echoes her own archival task) without overt symbolism, and the final image—standing at the center, hands on soil—charges the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.6)
    The icebound atrium is vividly sketched—crystalline spires, frozen archway with glowing symbols, starlight filtering through—and the setting shift to rolling hills and ancient trees is clear. However, the atrium functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint: the acorn cap unlocks the archway without resistance, and the spatial details do not pressure Elara's choices. The body, tool, or recurring object does not constrain a choice or charge the final image beyond ornamental presence.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    The windblown sanctuary and belfry setting are vividly anchored early and the bell rope functions as a micro-setting object that constrains choice (Elias reaches for it, pulls it, and the hum responds). The "microclimate anomaly" and "pocket of stillness" reflect his priorities and guide the final action. Sensory detail is selective—"frayed surface," "strange warmth," "vibrations that seemed to align with the rhythm of his own pulse"—and filtered through his POV. The rope itself charges the final image when the bell rings, satisfying the 9+ gate that an object or tool constrains a choice or charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.6)
    Setting details are vivid ("skeletal frame etched against the infinite void") and the station's machinery recurs across beats. The observation deck provides a spatial anchor for the midpoint turn. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Lira moves freely without physical or social friction. The lantern functions more as symbol than tool; its warmth and glow are described but never limit or enable a concrete action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.1)
    The scorched wasteland, skeletal gardens, and broken greenhouse establish a vivid frame anchored by sensory particulars (amber and crimson sunset, hum of bees long gone). The oasis environment returns at closure when "skeletal remnants" tremble and "new leaves" rustle, charging the final image with ecological rebirth. However, spatial choreography during Elias's exploration is vague—symbols, flower beds, and a hidden well are mentioned without clear proximity or physical engagement that constrains his search. Micro-setting (the stained glass box as a handled object) is present but does not measurably alter tactics; it functions more as talisman than tool.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.8)
    The emerald silo's weathered metal and hidden chamber supply vivid anchor details. The garage sale as recurring venue pressures Elara's tactics (embedding cryptic descriptions). However, spatial choreography inside the silo remains vague—"deeper into the silo" and "hidden chamber" lack the proximity or access friction that would constrain movement. The urn fragment's intricate patterns return at closure but function as symbolic recurrence rather than micro-setting that alters the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.2)
    The cobalt lagoon after rain is vividly rendered with sensory detail (wet earth, salt, burnished hush) and the setting anchors early. However, the environment functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice or supplying resources that alter tactics—the repair could occur anywhere. The drake's tail feather as micro-object charges the exchange moment but doesn't enable or prevent a consequential action. Spatial choreography (tide line, water's edge) is clear but static, and the kite's descent and ascent provide visual punctuation without environmental friction that shapes the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.8)
    The temple orchard, living stone pillars, and copper wire are vividly described and recur across beats, but they remain postcard elements—none constrains a choice or alters a tactic. The hollow pillars with carvings are discovered but do not force Elias to adjust his remodel plan. Spatial choreography is clear (central oak, surrounding pillars, branches forming arches), yet the setting functions as backdrop rather than crucible. The final golden-light image is purposeful but the environment itself exerts no pressure on the protagonist's decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)
    The rainwashed tower, overgrown path, and spring setting are vivid and purpose-driven, anchoring mood and filtering perception through Elara's POV ("paradoxical blend of decay and renewal"). The moss-covered ledge and inscribed chamber supply spatial texture. However, environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elara's path is linear, and the tower functions as backdrop rather than tactical pressure. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric but does not charge the final image, capping the score below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sensory detail is present and occasionally vivid ("scent of salt and decay," "knees creaking like old hinges"), and the blooming jetty contrasts desolation effectively. However, the setting remains largely decorative: neither the jetty's structure, the twilight timing, nor the post-reef ecology meaningfully constrains the coachman's choices or alters his tactics. Spatial choreography is minimal (he kneels, stands, returns to carriage) but clear. The "gloom-hill" and reef-death frame are named but never dramatized as obstacles or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.7)
    Rustveil's scrapyard specificity—"rusted sheets of steel and shattered glass," "skeletal ruin of steel beams"—grounds the world, and the phonograph factory's dust and machinery anchor the key beat. The leaf's warmth and the cylinder's glowing symbols engage multiple senses and guide Elias's choice to use the phonograph. However, spatial choreography inside the factory is vague (workbench appears without prior mention; no sense of Elias moving through the space), and the wasteland functions more as backdrop than constraint—no resource scarcity or environmental pressure alters his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.1)
    The observation deck is described vividly with "sleek, metallic surfaces" and "faint patina of neglect," but remains static postcard setting. The gilded compass rose appears twice yet never constrains a choice or alters tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent, but the environment does not pressure decisions or charge the final image; Elara could sketch anywhere without structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.4)
    The icebound spire is vividly anchored with "crystalline peaks shimmering with an otherworldly glow" and "ice-carved corridors," and the life-sized chessboard dominates the climactic chamber. The environment provides obstacles (shifting walls, puzzles) that test resolve, but these constraints are summarized rather than shown shaping specific micro-choices. The "pocket sundial lid" pulses with "faint, golden light" at the pedestal, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.4)
    The whispering gallery anchor is present and tonally coherent (echoes, silence, worn chessboard). The floor's "intricate patterns" appear only when Kael introduces them—late and convenient—but they do constrain the walk action. Spatial choreography is clear (center, section of gallery). However, the chessboard and floor patterns do not materially alter Elara's choice at closure; they charge the final image but remain more symbolic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.1)
    The labyrinthine bookstore is vividly sketched ("whispers and shadows," "stained-glass windows") but functions primarily as backdrop. The lost language stone constrains one choice—Elara uses it to decode symbols—but the bookstore's rearrangement occurs passively in response to her actions rather than forcing a tactical adaptation. The "clearing" that forms around her at the end is spatial choreography without pressure, and no recurring object or environmental feature charges the final image with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.2)
    The time-frozen village, cobblestone streets, platinum labyrinth, and tapestry are visually sketched but remain postcard elements; spatial choreography inside the labyrinth is vague ("walls a maze of reflections"), and no environmental detail constrains Elara's choices. The chess piece recurs across beats and charges the final image as a talisman, which qualifies as micro-setting; this lifts the score modestly. Sensory selection is generic (pale light, cool air, faint shimmer) and does not reflect urgency or professional bias.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.4)
    The towers of bone, canyon of endless echoes, pale spire in mist, and swirling mist are vivid and consistent. Sensory detail is selective: "cold, damp stone," "forged hush," "silver and blue" hues charge the atmosphere. The spire constrains Lira's approach ("cautiously") and the mist's thickening tracks her emotional escalation, satisfying the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. However, the bone towers frame the opening but never reappear to pressure choice or charge the closure, remaining postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.1)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop and acid sea establish vivid particulars (metal hull creaking, hissing waves, oil and rust scent). The charm's alignment with statue pockmarks constrains one beat (the matching action), lending mild micro-setting function. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, the workshop's gears and acid sea pressure Elara atmospherically more than tactically—she never reroutes a choice because of corrosion risk or clockwork failure, so the setting does not substantively alter her final image or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    The oasis is vividly rendered (stalactites, mirrored pool) and drives the decision to paint, constraining her physically in one location and charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across cave, oasis, and quay. However, the caves function primarily as backdrop; no environmental detail narrows a tactical choice or imposes cost during the painting itself. The painted seashell and pool constrain the conceptual frame, elevating slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.9)
    The cobalt lighthouse, dawn light, and garden scent are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Elias's perception. The vial cork's vibrations and the grove of shimmering blossoms constrain his choices (he follows the scent, approaches the woman). Spatial choreography remains coherent (lighthouse interior, shore, grove). The micro-setting (the cork, the lantern room) charges the final image enough to lift the score into the 7-band gate, though occupation-level lighthouse detail is thin and the garden scent's mechanics are more symbolic than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.4)
    The starlit signal station on a windswept cliff is established early with sensory anchors (weathered walls, scars of storms, floorboards). The censer foot's moon-phase fluctuation provides a recurring environmental constraint that shapes Mara's work timing. However, spatial choreography during the building sequences remains vague—what parts she scavenges, where she places the device, how the station's layout affects her labor. The final image defaults to generic stargazing rather than using station-specific detail to charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.7)
    The hanging orchard is vividly rendered with storm-battered branches and damp air, and the ravine setting provides spatial coherence. The glass eye's physical properties (shifting colors, warmth/cold) are concretely tracked. However, the orchard functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice—Elias could perform the same actions in any isolated location. The first sunbeam's role in the ritual is the closest the setting comes to pressuring the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.2)
    The opal dock, mist, and lighthouse beam establish vivid atmosphere through selective sensory detail (weathered planks glistening, mist as "living thing"). The boot print and journal anchor micro-setting participation. However, environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as backdrop and symbol rather than spatial pressure that shapes the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.1)
    The blooming cavern's bioluminescent moss and violet sky supply vivid sensory anchors. However, spatial choreography falters: Elias kneels at a wall crack, it "gives way" to reveal a passage, yet the passage leads to a cavern with a stone archway—the physical relationship between shop, passage, and cavern remains vague. The creek rises in paragraph one and recedes in paragraph six without constraining any choice or altering tactics. The matrix chip's warmth and glimmer are described but never used as a tool or obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.6)
    Sensory details are present (gravel crunch, metallic scent, pulsing light) and the grotto's warmth escalates as she climbs. The cobalt grotto and ember glow anchor location, and the bleeding starlight cascades in the final chamber. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the closure image—it remains descriptive backdrop rather than a tactical element that alters her options.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ember nexus is vividly evoked ("burnt orange and deep violet," "pulsing with a rhythm") but functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint. The nautilus shell is handled twice (held, then touched), yet its physical properties do not alter tactics or enable a meaningful choice. Spatial choreography is clean, and the twilight modulates with the ritual, but no environmental element narrows Elara's options or charges the final image with causal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.7)
    The mountain ranger cabin is anchored with sensory detail (pine-scented walls, kerosene lamp, sea of clouds) and the birch bark scroll is handled across multiple beats. However, setting remains largely atmospheric; the cabin does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome. The scroll's glow and shifting markings charge the final image but remain decorative rather than mechanically integral to Elara's shift. Micro-setting criterion is partially met but the environment does not pressure the protagonist's options in a way that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.4)
    The water clock shop is vividly anchored (fog, brass gears, drip echoing heartbeat) and the screw is handled across multiple beats, satisfying micro-setting and object-as-setting criteria. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's compensatory senses. The screw constrains Elara's attention and charges the final exchange, nudging the piece toward the 9+ gate, but spatial choreography during Mira's return is compressed and the shop's physical layout doesn't alter tactics or constrain choice in a high-pressure beat, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating rock tea ceremony platform is vivid and purposeful, suspending Elara above a misty abyss to underscore her emotional stakes. The crow quill's obsidian surface and crystallization provide tactile, recurring detail that constrains her internal state. Sensory selection (rain tapping, steam curling, mist enveloping) is filtered through her urgency and modulates with pressure. The platform's sway syncs with her thoughts, charging the final image as a sanctuary, which lifts setting integration toward the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.4)
    The archive is anchored early (aged paper, shelves, flickering lamp) and the perfume bottle's tactile presence (ridges, scent) recurs. The orchard outside supplies atmospheric pressure but does not constrain a choice. The bottle's hum and scent at closure charge the final image, qualifying as micro-setting. Spatial choreography is clean, though the archive's transformation ("sheet music glowed faintly") reads decorative rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    The temple library is vividly rendered with dust, shifting walls, and fluid time, and the setting supplies resources (the mural, the shimmering room) that guide the witness's path. The dictionary as micro-object returns across multiple beats and charges the final image when it merges with the mural. However, the environment does not meaningfully constrain a choice or force a trade-off; the witness navigates freely without spatial friction or resource scarcity. Sensory detail leans heavily visual; other senses are absent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.1)
    The horizon measurement station and hydraulic clock anchor setting early and purposefully. The mantle clock key's notch charges the discovery beat, and the mist clearing at the end functions as a purposeful environmental shift that mirrors the internal revelation. However, the station's occupational function (measuring the horizon's curve) remains abstract; the brass face and hidden slot serve plot convenience more than spatial constraint. Micro-setting (the key, the stone floor) does constrain one choice (kneeling to retrieve), lifting the score into the functional band.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rainwashed library, mica-pane lantern, and midsummer setting are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (damp stone, old books, rain rhythm). The lantern's refracted light charges the final image and the library aisles function as a spatial metaphor for "corridors of possibilities." Micro-setting (candle, glass pane) constrains perception and primes the closure moment, lifting the score into the 7-band despite the lack of a causal choice driven by environment.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    The subway utility tunnel is viscerally anchored (slick walls, rust, condensation, hum) and the phone booth's physical enclosure is felt. The glass disc is handled across multiple beats, its warmth at dawn marking change. The booth "shrinking" as sound grows and the grates filtering morning light both support the closure image. Micro-setting (booth, disc) effectively charges the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.2)
    The jetty setting is vividly rendered (weathered planks, jasmine scent, golden light) and returns at closure, but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it remains a postcard backdrop. The locket as micro-object is handled in multiple beats and charges the investigation, lifting the score slightly. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered, avoiding catalog mode.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.1)
    The overgrown railway station is vividly rendered with ivy, damp wood, and decaying grandeur. The clock appears as a prop that enables the ending rather than constraining prior choices. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The setting charges the final image when it transforms, but this transformation is delivered to Elara rather than shaped by her interaction with the environment under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ultrasonic forest and platinum compass ring are evocative and consistently referenced, but neither constrains a choice or alters tactics on the page. The forest's hum "guides her path" passively; the ring points toward the pool but does not require navigational trade-offs. Spatial choreography is vague (clearing, pool, workshop locations never grounded). The setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a crucible that shapes the protagonist's moves.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.1)
    The gravitational anomaly and void setting are vividly rendered with sensory detail (shimmering surface, hum vibrating through bones, sea of light and shadow). The pen as micro-setting object constrains one choice (the writing act) and charges the final image when it "went cold." However, spatial choreography inside the void lacks grounding; Elara floats without tactile anchors or constraints that shape her tactics, reducing the setting to backdrop during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.8)
    The luminous harbor by moonlight is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (moonlight, brass gleaming, prisms on water) and the setting contributes atmospheric charge. The camera as micro-setting object appears in multiple beats and its glow at the ending attempts to serve closure, though the mechanics remain vague. Spatial choreography is minimal but coherent (Elara at dock's edge, water below), and the moonlight modulates from silver wash to prism refraction, reflecting emotional progression.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.6)
    The archive is described in generic terms ("labyrinth," "maze of corridors," "stone floors") without spatial choreography or sensory hierarchy. No recurring object, tool, or body constraint shapes a choice. The mural and door appear as stage props rather than pressure points. Orientation debt from Q2 caps this category at 7.0 per the global rule, but execution would remain mid-band regardless.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.1)
    The sound wave garden is vivid in sensory language ("every leaf whispered secrets") but remains postcard description; no environmental feature constrains Elara's choices. The auric lagoon glows and hums, yet its mechanics are unexplained and its response feels authored rather than arising from established world rules. Spatial choreography is minimal—Elara approaches, perches, leans—but the garden itself supplies atmosphere, not tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.7)
    The port-city labyrinth is vivid early ("salt and rust," "metal corridors"), and the geomagnetic storm pulses through walls to raise atmospheric pressure. Spatial choreography remains coherent across moves. The key grows warm and the map shifts ink, but neither object physically constrains Eli's route or alters a tactic—they guide without friction. The storm intensifies at the climax but does not force a trade-off; it remains scenic rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cobalt dock, rain-slick planks, and twilight establish atmosphere early. The dental mirror catches light in "fragmented bursts" and reflects the stranger's potential self, giving the object spatial presence. The shutter patterns create a visual constellation but remain decorative—they do not constrain the stranger's choice or alter available options. The body and immediate tools are present but do not pressure the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cobalt library and magnetic grotto are introduced with atmospheric language but remain postcard backdrops. Spatial choreography is vague—Elias sits at a table, the grotto is "beneath the library," but no concrete access, proximity, or environmental constraint shapes his choices. The grotto recurs but only as a place for reflection, not as a feature that alters tactics or charges the closure. Sensory detail ("amplified quiet," "ethereal beauty") is abstract rather than specific and filtered through POV priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    The sublittoral fringe is vivid and purposeful: "soft silt," "emerald shafts," "wet sand" ground the opening and middle. The disappearing island constrains the sequence (she must step onto it to access the heart), and the scrimshaw's glow functions as a micro-setting object that enables the barrier's dissolution. The "barrier of water and light" is evocative but remains a static obstacle rather than a setting detail that alters her tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.2)
    The farmhouse and turbines anchor locale early and recur at the window beat and closure. The whittled wood and dried bouquet function as micro-setting objects that constrain attention, but neither alters a tactical choice on the page. Sensory detail is selective (pale light, humming turbines, worn table) and filtered through Elara's priorities, yet the environment remains atmospheric rather than an active pressure that shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cobalt atrium and frozen lake are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("lantern-moth hush," "humming quartz colonnade"). However, the environment remains a passive backdrop; no spatial detail constrains a choice or alters the poet's tactics. The ice shards floating and the atrium "bowing" are decorative rather than functional pressures, keeping the score below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.4)
    The glassblower's courtyard anchors who/where/when early and supplies vivid sensory detail (glass shards glinting, furnace hum, moonlit glow). The concertina reed tongue as micro-setting object constrains one choice (Elias's decision to arrange ferns/daisies), and the courtyard's spatial elements (stone bench, easel, plants) remain coherent across beats. However, setting description sometimes stalls momentum (long opening paragraph) and the courtyard's "spirit" mechanics lack concrete constraint—plants "whisper secrets" without altering tactics or options in a legible way.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lab setting is anchored with vivid, selective details ("cluttered shelves," "golden shadows," "ruins of an old industrial district") and sensory filtering through Elara's auditory focus. The carbide lamp lens acts as a micro-setting object that charges the final image and constrains her methodology. However, the lab itself does not pressure any choice—it remains a static backdrop rather than a spatial or resource constraint that alters tactics. The coal town and factory are purely summary recall, not grounded present environments.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.4)
    The observatory is vividly rendered—brass fittings, glass panes, ethereal glow—and the "genuinely artificial" paradox is signaled early. The tattoo stencil on vellum and the curtains of intention are handled objects that recur. However, the environment does not constrain a choice: Elara's transformation is triggered by the curtains' autonomous glow rather than spatial access or resource scarcity. The observatory functions as atmospheric backdrop more than a crucible that alters tactics or charges the final image with material consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft is vividly rendered with selective detail (worn velvet cushion, dusty tomes, iron door, rain as Morse code) that establishes atmosphere without catalog excess. The measuring tape becomes a purposeful micro-setting element, though its use to "quantify the intangible" remains somewhat abstract. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (cards on cushion, data spread on floor, mural before them at dawn). The setting subtly supports the inherited-mystery tone and the cartomancer's methodology, earning the higher-mid band.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.4)
    The archive setting is vivid—shadows, stone tablets, bronze surface—and the worn tiles function as micro-setting that prompts Elara's key insight. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her historian's lens. However, the environment never constrains choice; the "labyrinth of secrets" and shifting layout are told rather than demonstrated through navigation that alters tactics. The pagoda's light charges the final image but doesn't press back against her goal, keeping the band solidly mid-range.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.4)
    The blooming library and its crystalline vials create a vivid secondary-world frame, and the river stone recurs with tactile grounding ("coolness," "heavier now"). Spatial choreography is clear (glass wall, archives, forgotten corner), and the shadow's materialization uses the room itself. The stone does not constrain a choice—it enables the climax without resistance—so the 9+ gate is not met, capping at 8.8, but pervasive specificity (aged paper, ethereal glow, twilight horizon) keeps the score in mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.1)
    The misty workshop under stars is established early and returns in the final image, providing a clear spatial anchor. However, the setting remains largely decorative: tools are "arranged in a new pattern" without specifying how cedar scent, mist, or starlight constrains any choice. The chameleon's tail tip functions more as a thematic token than a physical object with properties that alter tactics. Sensory detail is present but does not guide or pressure the protagonist's micro-decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.1)
    The frosted hourglass on the sill and the tower's ivy provide concrete anchors, and the basement door and tunnel offer spatial progression. However, the cavern's glowing crystals and the second pedestal materialize without prior spatial logic, and "meteor hush" (the required tone element) never translates into sensory detail or spatial constraint. The setting does not meaningfully limit Elara's choices—she descends, walks, and finds exactly what the plants tell her to find—so it remains descriptive rather than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.7)
    The projection booth is vividly rendered with dusty reels, cracked window, and moonlight, and the film strip is handled across multiple beats. However, the setting mostly provides atmosphere rather than constraining choice; Elara could perform this reading almost anywhere. The projector's mechanical failure (sputters and dies) does not alter her tactics or force adaptation, and the theater's "living thing" quality at the end is asserted rather than demonstrated through spatial pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.1)
    The aurora-lit archway and astrolabe are vividly rendered and return across beats, and the sensory detail (emerald/violet hues, cold stone, visible breath) is selective and purposeful. The archway anchors the spatial frame and the astrolabe's trembling needle offers a tactile cue. However, neither environment nor object constrains a choice or charges the final image—they remain atmospheric rather than causal, capping the score below high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.4)
    The glowing dune is vividly rendered with sensory detail (luminescent sand, warm air, swirling vortex), and the divergent archive's floating orbs and shelves of jars provide concrete imagery. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the dune's "guidance" and the archive's response are external conveniences rather than constraints that force Mara's choices. The environment does not pressure her tactics or charge the final image with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mechanical rainforest supplies vivid, purposeful detail—cog-shaped leaves, uphill streams, root-language—that charges atmosphere and reflects the conceptual premise. The small gear becomes tactile when it "vibrated" and fits the socket, constraining the final action. However, spatial choreography across translocations is loose, and the colossal machine's sudden appearance lacks prior setup, weakening the causal link between setting and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.4)
    The veiled ridgeway, twilight, and ferry are vivid and anchored early, with sensory detail filtered through Mara's perception. The ticket punch and star stamp appear in multiple beats and carry symbolic weight, but the ridgeway itself does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Mara ascends without obstacle or decision shaped by terrain. The ferryman's age shift and the cliff setting arrive late without spatial grounding, blurring the final geography.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.7)
    The cobalt fortress, snow, and piano are vivid and purposeful. The dusty staircase and hidden chamber create spatial progression that drives discovery. The piano bench bolt functions as micro-setting, returning with reweighted meaning at closure and constraining Elias's ritual. Sensory detail is selective (yellowed keys, rusted bolt, eerie cobalt light) and filtered through the contemplative POV, though the oppressive silence could be rendered more tactilely. The bolt's gleaming transformation in the hidden chamber charges the final image when Elias pockets it and plays.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.1)
    The library setting provides vivid sensory anchors (dust in light, humming stones) but remains postcard-level—Elara never uses spatial layout or book proximity to constrain a tactical choice. The iron gall ink pellet is named but not handled with tactile specificity until the final beat. Micro-setting potential (books, ink, rune carvings) is described rather than integrated into choice architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    The monitoring station is anchored with functional detail (weathered metal, automated systems, daily data upload ritual). The torn atlas page is handled multiple times and its physical state (frayed edges, watermark) matters. Sensory economy is solid—no tourism—but the station itself never constrains a tactical choice or charges the closure image; it remains backdrop. The page's micro-setting role lifts the score, but missing the 9+ gate (environment must constrain choice or charge closure) caps the upper range.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.7)
    The spaceport repair bay is anchored early with concrete details (cracked concrete, fractured skylights, amber glow, debris-buried stone circle). Sensory hierarchy shifts appropriately when Lira kneels and the hum intensifies, narrowing perception. The opera glasses function as micro-setting, transforming her view and thus constraining her next move (she steps out to reignite the rebellion). The stone circle's vibration pressures her stance, meeting the choice-constraint gate for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.6)
    The volcanic hot springs anchor the scene with sensory texture ("steam rose like ghosts," "heat a stark contrast to the cool air"), and the ferns' roots "spreading like a silent army" is a vivid image. However, the setting does not constrain Mara's choices—she decodes the kite and unseals the embryo without the environment imposing cost or altering her tactics. The springs' eruption is spectacle, not pressure. Spatial choreography is clean, but the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges closure) is not met.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.9)
    The arboretum and cliff setting provide strong sensory grounding (salt, jasmine, waves crashing) and spatial choreography is clear throughout. The cliff edge constrains Zara's photograph retrieval choice with physical danger, and the setting's legacy (lighthouse keeper's dedication) charges the final thematic realization. However, the arboretum functions more as backdrop than active constraint after the cliff scene; the bench where she sketches could exist anywhere without altering her options.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.1)
    The forgotten library and lighthouse are vividly anchored with sensory detail (aged paper, salt air, groaning walls, roaring sea) and mood. The tarot cards function as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and charged in the final assembly. Spatial choreography is clear from library floor to spiral staircase to lantern room. The environment does not constrain a key choice—Elara's gathering and reordering happen without external friction—but the recurring card imagery and ascent structure the final reconfiguration, elevating the score to mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.1)
    The wind-carved encampment and post-eclipse light anchor setting early, and the tent interior with diagrams and ink scent provides spatial grounding. The drone's metallic wings and the vial's cool glass offer tactile moments. However, the desert itself remains largely ornamental; sand and wind do not constrain Elara's choices, and the encampment's layout or resources never alter tactics. The setting charges atmosphere but does not pressure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    The cryogenic library is anchored early with vivid sensory detail ("breath visible in the frigid air," "frosted glass," "icy walls"), and the descent into the deeper section creates spatial progression. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining Elara's choices—the terminal is exactly where she expects it, the cold imposes no tactical cost, and the snow outside remains decorative. The archives' "secrets too volatile for the waking world" and "contraband truths" are described but never made concrete through specific objects or visible constraints that shape her access or escape.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.5)
    The glass-domed desert rose farm is vividly anchored with sensory specificity (scent of blooms, barren wasteland beyond). The sandbag scrap and trowel ground Elara's work tactilely. However, the enclosure remains largely atmospheric; it does not constrain a key choice or alter tactics in a dramatized beat—fortification happens off-page. The final image uses the setting (glass dome, desert beyond) to charge meaning, lifting the score into mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.6)
    The sound wave garden is vividly described with layered sensory detail (silence with voice, feral-yet-soothing atmosphere), and spatial choreography remains coherent. However, the setting does not constrain a single choice or alter tactics; Kael's walk and the goddess's arrival occur independently of environmental pressure. The rail spike and pool are mentioned but never used as resources that shape outcome, capping the score below 7.0 per the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.4)
    The observatory setting is vivid and specific—glass dome, brass telescopes, dusty charts, misaligned lenses—and the misalignment directly drives Eleanor's investigation. However, the spatial choreography during her wandering and the director's office tea scene remains vague; we don't track her movement through corridors or feel how the building's architecture constrains or enables her snooping. The rosewood pen nib is described but never handled on the page in a way that shapes a tactic or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.4)
    The laboratory's "glass chambers and humming machines" and the amber piece are vivid but remain backdrop until the antique cabinet surfaces mid-story. The cabinet's drawers enable the letter discovery (one constrained choice), and the amber's final glow charges the ending image, lifting this past pure description. Spatial choreography is clean; the "laboratory of lost sounds" frame is maintained. However, the setting does not pressure Elara's choices until the cabinet—most action is internal. The amber and cabinet together provide micro-setting constraint that matters at closure, qualifying for mid-6s under the short-form allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.1)
    The grotto, mist, and tiles provide vivid sensory anchors early. The tile flake and sand mandala function as micro-setting objects that charge the vision sequence, satisfying the constraint test for mid-band entry. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. However, the mandala dissolves "as if in relief" without altering Elara's tactics or the final image in a concrete way, limiting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.3)
    The plaza, minaret, shattered sky, and mosaic are vividly rendered and remain spatially coherent throughout. The tesserae constrain Elara's method (she traces, brushes, rearranges) and the mosaic charges the final image as the transformed canvas. Sensory detail is selective (acrid tang, ash, faint gleam) and filtered through Elara's retrocognitive focus. Micro-setting (the single gleaming tessera) briefly pressures her choice to rebuild, lifting the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.1)
    The hedge maze, orchard, fountain, and night flowers are vividly described with sensory detail (blooming petals, moss-covered basin, silver moonlight). However, the setting remains ornamental: no spatial choice is constrained by the maze's layout, the dry fountain does not alter tactics, and the hedge walls serve only as theatrical backdrop. The "mystic orchard garden concealed within a hedge maze" is named but not leveraged—Mara and the woman could conduct this encounter in any atmospheric locale without structural change. Micro-setting (the tarot coin as object-in-hand) appears but does not constrain action beyond serving as prop for color-shift magic.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.1)
    The light painting studio supplies adjustable LEDs, mirrors, cameras, and the geode placement, grounding the spatial work. The geode's "fractally precise edges" and reflective setup are vivid but remain postcard details; no environmental constraint alters Elara's creative choices or complicates her access. Spatial choreography is coherent, yet the studio functions as backdrop rather than pressuring tactics or charging the closure image, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.1)
    Cave sensory details (salt, damp earth, bioluminescent algae) are vivid and filtered through Elara's professional lens. The fossil's warmth and the pedestal in the hidden chamber constrain her path and charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent across moves. Minor deduction: the "heat-mapping tools" and their tactile operation remain abstract, missing the micro-setting texture that would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.1)
    The amber warehouse is anchored early with vivid details (glowing walls, dust-filtered sunlight, shelves of preserved moments), but these remain decorative postcard elements that do not constrain Elara's choices or tactics. The bone button's symbols match the jar's markings, a purposeful detail that shapes one beat, but the cliffs and canyon function only as backdrop. The micro-setting (workbench, jar, buttons) does not impose meaningful friction or cost—objects appear and resolve at convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.4)
    Zephyr Bluff, mist, and snow codes create a vivid sensory frame and the hollowed tree functions as a micro-setting anchor. However, the environment does not constrain a single choice—Elara walks forward without spatial pressure or tactical consequence. The pillbox is handled twice (opening, closing) but its contents never alter her path. Sensory details are selective and atmospheric but do not charge the final image or force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.4)
    Fog, river, rain gutters, and the yarn needle are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail ("dark mirror reflecting the heaviness of the sky"). The setting provides atmosphere and the gutters function as a time constraint, but neither the environment nor the needle materially constrains a choice at closure—the coachman receives wisdom passively. Spatial choreography is clear (carriage atop, figure approaches, river below) and the fog's lifting signals thematic closure, lending the setting some structural role.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.6)
    The beekeeping oasis and scorched wasteland are described vividly in the opening, and the lantern glass receives concrete sensory detail (patterns, thrum, glow). The glass qualifies as micro-setting and returns in the climactic moment when patterns align at sunset, charging that beat. Spatial choreography remains clear across Elara's studio, worktable, and the oasis environs. However, the glass's mechanical rules shift subtly—first "phototropic to kindness," then "attuned to fractured timelines"—without clear on-page demonstration of how these properties differ or constrain her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.4)
    Moonlit harbor, fire escape, docked boat, and lantern light provide vivid sensory anchors. The lockmaster's bitting gauge tooth catches moonlight in two beats, and the lantern's carved handle mirrors it—object detail constrains the final exchange and charges recognition. Spatial choreography (third floor to dock, boat arrival) tracks cleanly. However, the harbor functions more as postcard backdrop than environment that alters tactics; the tooth's material specificity (edges, intricate design) is mentioned but does not force a micro-choice with visible consequence during the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tidal library setting supplies vivid, layered imagery—moss-covered stones, clouds, brass mechanisms, shifting shelves—and the library "testing her worthiness" adds mild atmospheric pressure. The brass sundial unlocks the stone door, a functional use that constrains one choice. However, the environment does not narrow tactics or force trade-offs at the closure; it provides stage dressing for Elena's ascent and descent. Spatial choreography is clear; sensory detail is filtered through Elena's perception, though the final beats lean on abstraction ("every fiber of her being") rather than concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, and post-rain scent provide vivid sensory grounding. The installation *Rejoin* appears late (final third) and functions primarily as closure device rather than constraint shaping earlier tactics. Spatial choreography is clean—Elara's movement from pond edge to temple center tracks coherently—but the thrush's nest spiral and the installation groove feel convenient rather than integrated into the environment's pressure. The setting anchors atmosphere but does not force a meaningful choice until the climactic placement.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.4)
    The radio station is vividly anchored—vintage microphones, tangled wires, concrete floor—and the spectrograph/subwoofer function as tools. The station provides resources (equipment) that enable Elara's counter-move, crossing the 6.0 threshold. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; the "ethereal glow" at sunset reads ornamental rather than purposeful, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.2)
    The shadowed nexus, labyrinthine streets, stone archway, and cavernous chamber provide vivid atmosphere. The compass and crystalline shard are handled on the page and guide movement. Yet the environment functions primarily as scenic backdrop; the narrow passage briefly pressures Elara's claustrophobia, but the chamber's shifting walls resolve conveniently rather than forcing a spatial choice or constraining the outcome. Sensory detail is present but generic ("ancient stone," "otherworldly glow") without POV-specific filtering or micro-setting tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.4)
    The quarry's mist and jagged edges are vividly rendered and purposefully atmospheric. However, the environment remains postcard-like: no physical constraint (gravel, cold, sight-lines) alters Elara's tactics or the mysterious figure's approach. The lancing tool is mentioned but never used to test spatial pressure. The final dawn-lit path is symbolic flourish rather than micro-setting that charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.1)
    The experimental weather station supplies vivid atmospheric detail (cracked glass domes, rusted dials, broken barometers) and the map etched into the floor constrains the final ritual by providing a physical nexus. However, spatial choreography remains vague—Elara moves through "abandoned corridors" without clear layout—and the station's transformation into mist and back feels arbitrary rather than bound by established rules. The copper nail's interaction with the floor groove is the lone micro-setting move that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.1)
    The mountain pullout is visually sketched (peaks, railing, breeze) but supplies no spatial constraint or resource that alters tactics. The hidden clearing appears when the plot requires it; overgrowth and scaffold wraps are mentioned without showing how Bridge-Song navigates or uncovers them. The glass flake is handled repeatedly but never charges the final image through specific environmental interaction—it simply "feels warm" and then becomes "clear and whole" without materialized mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.1)
    The abandoned circus train supplies vivid anchors (rusted, ivy, tattered costumes, territorial markers) and recurs across the sequence, shaping Elias's investigation. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric ("dusky harmony," "silvery glow"). The train constrains movement through its car-by-car structure and charges the final platform image. However, specifics like "territorial markers" are mentioned but not shown altering a choice; the train functions more as backdrop than as micro-setting that imposes cost on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    The observatory is vividly anchored (dome, telescopes, cool air) and the daylily-pressed telegram gains tactile presence ("edges frayed"). The variable stars constrain Elara's method: she must align telescopes and decode rhythms, which shapes her tactics across multiple beats. The final dawn image charges the closure moment, lifting the score into mid-6s despite some decorative star-gazing that does not alter choices.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cursed lake, swirling orchard vortex, and moss-covered ground are vividly rendered with sensory detail (otherworldly glow, scent of ripe fruit and decay). The vortex constrains Eira's movement—she must unbend and move through expanding circles rather than resist—which directly shapes her tactical choice. The seed anchoring into the vortex's core and the plant's tendrils absorbing chaotic energy provide micro-setting that alters the outcome. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt glade and maze are vividly sketched with sensory detail (shifting hedges, thorns catching cloak, silver light). However, the environment never constrains a choice—Elara walks through unimpeded, and the maze's "twists and turns" do not force a navigational dilemma or resource trade-off. The hedges function as storytellers (leaves etched with tales) but this lore-delivery does not alter her tactics or the final image. Micro-setting engagement is present but ornamental rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered with specific images (roots snaking between bones, half-lit corridors, earth and decay scent) and the tangled roots actively resist Elara's planting, constraining her action. The burned tarot card functions as micro-setting, recurring with shifted meaning at closure. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout; the chamber with etched walls provides a concrete anchor for the climactic encounter, and the environment continuously reflects the story's theme of meaning woven into decay.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.4)
    The quarry office trailer is anchored early with vivid specifics: "scarred metal desk," "fluorescent lights flickered," "faint hum of machinery outside," "scent of dust and diesel." The trailer's emptiness and the quarry's "vast, hollow expanse" mirror Elias's internal void, though the connection leans overt rather than oblique. The speaker grille scrap functions as a micro-setting object that appears in three beats and charges the final image, lifting the score. Spatial choreography is clean: desk, window, exit.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.1)
    The magnetic arbor is vividly signaled and the humming field creates atmosphere. The knowledge fruit seed's glowing symbols and the tree's growth provide concrete sensory anchors. However, the setting primarily functions as backdrop; the arbor's magnetic properties never constrain a choice or alter Eliara's tactics. The seed touches earth and energy ripples, but spatial choreography and the arbor's mechanics remain decorative rather than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.7)
    The tidal atrium is vividly rendered with bioluminescent runes, a reflective pool, and tidal breathing walls. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. The pool constrains Elara's action (she kneels, dips her hand, uses it as a gateway), satisfying the 9+ gate requirement for one key choice. However, spatial choreography beyond the pool edge remains vague, and the bamboo creel—though carried throughout—never supplies a resource or constraint that alters her tactics in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    The crystal caves supply vivid sensory anchors (luminous walls, quartz veins, mosaic ceiling) and the setting enables the discovery sequence. The pearl hidden in a crevice and the pedestal chamber guide Elara's path, fulfilling micro-setting pressure. However, the caves function more as backdrop than constraint—no blocked path, environmental hazard, or choice forced by spatial layout. The recurring "resonant hush" charges atmosphere but does not alter tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.4)
    The disused station is vividly rendered (ivy, shattered windows, golden beams) and the graffiti provides a thematic anchor. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining Elara's choices or supplying resources that alter tactics. The accordion—though handled multiple times—never mechanically affects an outcome (e.g., its weight, its contents obstructing movement). Spatial choreography is clear, but the environment does not pressure the protagonist in a way that charges the closure image beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.6)
    The glowing library, mist, and shifting symbols provide vivid sensory anchors and the watch hums in sync with the space. The setting shapes one key moment (the desk with quill and parchment) but does not constrain later choices—the protagonist moves freely without spatial friction. Micro-setting (the watch, the parchment) charges the final image, lifting the score above ornamental description, though the library itself remains a backdrop rather than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.4)
    The velvet observatory, midsummer air, and nightshade scent are vivid in the opening, but the setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image. The balcony becomes a convenient stage for the climax without prior spatial work that would make it the necessary choice. The coffee stains and plants are described but do not function as environmental pressure; the vines that snake up the walls in the finale are introduced for effect rather than prepared as a resource. Micro-setting (coffee cup, violin surface) is present but ornamental. The piece does not meet the Q3 9+ gate (environment must constrain a choice or charge the final image).

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.4)
    The grotto's crystalline walls, aurora, and emerald chip are vividly rendered with sensory specificity. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; no choice is constrained by spatial layout or resource availability. The aurora's color shifts and the grotto's "radiant hush" support tone but do not alter tactics or pressure a decision. Micro-setting (the emerald chip as tool) does charge the resurrection beat but does not recur with evolving constraint at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.1)
    The grotto, garden, and lake are described with elevated diction ("umbral," "luminous," "iridescent") but remain postcard backdrops. Spatial choreography is vague—how Elara climbs, retrieves the pin, or steps into the lake lacks tactile grounding. The scallop shell and lake do not constrain choice; they deliver exposition. "Vineyard hush" as a recurring phrase attempts atmosphere but never modulates with pressure or anchors a micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lighthouse setting is anchored early with sensory specifics (salt air, wooden floors, wind chimes on the balcony), and the hollow mirror shard is handled across multiple beats. However, neither the environment nor the shard constrains a choice or alters the outcome—Elias's task unfolds identically whether in a lighthouse or any reflective space. The wind chimes function as atmosphere rather than a tactical resource; no spatial or environmental pressure shapes the letter-writing decision.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.4)
    The floating obsidian platform and magnetic grotto supply vivid anchors ("shimmering faintly under the starlight," "grotto's hum"), and the thrown stones return as concrete actions that charge two beats. However, spatial choreography is vague—Elara's position relative to the water's edge shifts without clear blocking. The "sycamore hush" appears twice as atmosphere but never as a physical element that constrains choice. At this length, the grotto's magnetic amplification of thoughts is asserted in exposition rather than shown altering tactics, keeping setting functional but not indispensable to the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.4)
    The canyon and bone towers are vividly rendered and return at closure ("Kael stood tall, their form blending into the shadows"). Sensory hierarchy tilts heavily visual; other senses appear sporadically. The arrowhead—handled twice, vibrating in response to the flock—functions as micro-setting and charges the final image. However, the environment never constrains a choice: Kael's waiting and deciphering occur without spatial friction or resource limits, reducing the towers to atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.1)
    The icebound spire is vividly sketched with "frozen corridors," "shimmering chambers," and "lingering luminance," establishing atmosphere effectively. However, the environment remains postcard-static: ice outcropping appears only when needed for the harness, and the closing walls serve plot convenience without altering Eli's tactics in a character-specific way. The "garden folly keystone" as micro-setting object appears late and is described ("impossible geometry") but never handled or constrained by Eli in a meaningful choice. The spire "awakens" at the end as thematic flourish, not dramatized consequence of prior interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.1)
    The forgotten library inside the sunken ship is vividly rendered with glowing books and dry air, and the hatch/staircase sequence grounds spatial movement. The skeleton key tag's warmth and glow tie setting details to the closure moment. However, the library functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain Elias's choices or supply a resource he must work around. The pier and harbor anchor the opening but do not return to charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ambered observatory and distillation apparatus are vividly described and establish a distinct atmosphere. The coins are handled on the page (selected, submerged) and the observatory "hums with anticipation," giving some tactile grounding. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; Lira's actions proceed without spatial friction or resource limits, reducing the setting to backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.7)
    The observatory is vividly anchored (stone walls, marble railing, circular platform with runes, opening dome) and the dusk light plays through the space purposefully. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Elara walks to the platform without friction, and the runes flare cooperatively. The atlas page functions as a micro-setting object, but its mechanics are given rather than discovered through trial. Sensory detail is selective and supports tone, yet the space never resists or complicates her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sapphire viaduct at dawn is anchored early with vivid color and the dripping-rates rhythm that becomes tactically relevant; Eliard kneels on its "cool surface," uses materials "gathered at the viaduct's base," and hangs the bell from its "lowest arch," so the setting supplies resources and frames the final image when its "sapphire glow intensified." Sensory detail is present (pale blue, lavender, golden light, dew drips) but leans heavily visual; the method of noticing is consistent but not deeply POV-filtered. The viaduct constrains by providing the dripping pattern and charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, though spatial choreography of Eliard's movements could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ridgeway, reservoir, and town square anchor space clearly. Sensory details—"glassy surface," "mirrored hush," "stars like pinholes"—are vivid but largely decorative; they do not constrain Elias's choices or alter tactics. The wind chime's silence and return provide a bookend but function as atmospheric marker rather than a tool or constraint that charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall, ancient tree, and stone altar are vivid and atmosphere-rich. The crystal's physical properties (size, warmth, glow) register concretely. However, the orchard does not constrain a choice or pressure tactics—Elara moves freely without environmental friction. Spatial choreography is clean (grove, clearing, altar), and the setting charges the final image with "ancient freshness" and the waterfall's renewed vibrancy, lifting the score into mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.1)
    The nocturnal arbor supplies vivid imagery ("branches twisting like silent guardians," "leaves rustled softly") but remains postcard description—no environmental constraint shapes a tactic or alters a move. The parachute buckle "clinked softly" but its physical state or mechanics never pressure a choice. Clouds "forming shapes that mirrored the seeker's thoughts" is symbolic convenience without spatial grounding. The arbor's glow "intensifies" at triumph, a visual reward rather than a setting element that constrained or enabled the solution.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.1)
    The floating dojo is vividly sketched ("suspended between clouds and the endless void") and the brain-in-jar receives concrete sensory detail (glass, amber fluid). However, setting remains decorative: the void, pedestal, and swords do not constrain Kael's choices or provide resources that alter tactics. The dojo walls "seemed to dissolve" without consequence, and spatial choreography during the duel is vague—no tracking of distance, position, or how the brain "responds with movements."

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.1)
    The echo chamber tunnel is vividly rendered with sensory detail ("walls whispering secrets," "shadows danced like old memories"), and the pull cord handle returns with tactile presence across beats. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining Eli's choices or supplying resources that alter outcome; the tunnel's transformation (echoes softening, walls exhaling) is passive response, not active pressure. Spatial choreography is minimal—Eli's movements are vague ("moved with purpose," "steps deliberate")—and the world outside at the end is generic ("brighter," "lighter"). The setting charges the mood but does not reach the micro-setting threshold where environment shapes tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.1)
    The frozen garden is vividly described with sensory detail (mist, ice-encrusted trees, cold). However, it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice—Elara moves through it without spatial friction. The pendant warms and glows, but its physical properties do not alter her tactics. The garden's "history, longing, fear" are told, not dramatized through obstacle or resource. No micro-setting element (tool, body limit, spatial feature) shapes the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ember nexus is vividly named and returns at closure (glows brighter, ground trembles), charging the final image. Sensory detail is present ("scent of ash," "air crackled with power") but remains largely visual and atmospheric without constraining a tactical choice. The frozen bloom is referenced twice (backstory, then analogy at the climax) but functions as symbol rather than physical object that alters action. Spatial choreography is clear; the setting supports tone but does not force a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.1)
    The gorge, towers, and lunar perigee supply vivid images ("skeletal fingers," "shimmer") but remain postcard backdrop. Spatial choreography is vague: Elara stands atop the tallest tower, yet "the city below began to stir" and towers "lean closer" without clear mechanics or distance. The shard's glow affects atmosphere but does not constrain a tactic or alter a choice. The body, console, and moon are present but ornamental—no micro-setting pressure on the ending decision.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "spectral grotto under starlight" is described with atmospheric adjectives but never constrains a choice or alters tactics. Spatial choreography is vague: Mara stands "at the edge of the dock," then "the grotto's walls," then "into the rift," then "a dimly lit chamber" with no legible transitions or distances. The hourglass and radio are handled but their physical presence does not shape movement or cost. The Q2 Orientation Test penalty caps Q3 at 7.0, but execution issues independently lower the score.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.7)
    The gallery's optical illusions are vivid and integrated into action—walls melting, floors sprouting roots—and the setting responds dynamically to Elara's weaving. However, the environment never constrains a tactical choice or provides a resource that alters her moves; it remains atmospheric backdrop. The sinew thread is handled across beats and does charge the final image, which lifts the micro-setting score slightly, but the gallery itself doesn't gate a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.1)
    The benthic city and alien ships provide vivid anchoring detail ("bioluminescent streets," "inverted stalagmites," "shards of moonlight"). The harbor and anchor chain recur across beats. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The micro-setting (chain link on pedestal) charges the ritual scene modestly but does not reshape the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.1)
    The mist-clad atrium and hearing aid anchor setting and object; the photograph's sepia tone and frayed edges add texture. However, the environment does not constrain choice—mist parts obligingly, corridors lead cleanly to the goal, and the marble archway functions as backdrop rather than pressure point. The hearing aid's "faint pulses" are mentioned but their mechanics remain vague, and the atrium's spatial choreography is loose (center, corridors, archway, exit) without grounded distance or barrier.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.1)
    The facility's tidal breathing and flooded chambers are vivid and recurring, and the vault's "colder, thicker" air modulates atmosphere. However, the setting never constrains a meaningful choice: water "rises and falls" but doesn't force a tactical adaptation, and the "crumbling walls" are mentioned but don't impede progress. The fleck on the pedestal charges the climax, satisfying the micro-object allowance. Spatial choreography is vague—Elena "descends deeper" and later the "rising water" guides her "upward," but distances, thresholds, and the labyrinth structure remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.1)
    The opal observatory under snow is vividly established with sensory detail (frosted dome, aged wood, visible breath). The porcelain shard and inkblot function as micro-setting anchors that charge the final image. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elara's keyboard work proceeds unimpeded, and the snow serves atmospheric function rather than pressure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.1)
    The towers of bone, canyon moss, and tunnel walls supply vivid anchoring detail and appear in the final paragraph with softened edges, creating a lyric reprise. However, the environment does not constrain a tactical choice during the peak beat; Lira's path through the tunnel is unobstructed. The flock of birds remains external observation rather than a spatial or sensory pressure that alters her actions in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.4)
    The underground garden supplies vivid sensory details (moss-covered stone, glowing mushrooms, ozone scent) and the arrowhead's "gravitational pull" guides Lena into the alcove, constraining movement at a key beat. However, the garden's metamorphosis and return to "original state" occur without spatial consequence, and the pool reflecting the cryptid rather than Lena reads as convenient symbolism. The setting shapes one turn but does not charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.1)
    The enchanted orchard and sky-bridge provide vivid spatial grounding; the statues and roots are concretely staged during the climax. However, most environmental detail remains postcard description—"tapestry of tarnished wonder," "iridescent surface"—rather than shaping Elara's choices. The locust shell constrains one choice (pressing it to her chest) and charges the final image (glowing, then inert), meeting the micro-setting test for the 9+ gate, but the orchard itself never limits tactics or resources during the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt arcade provides atmospheric anchoring and a metaphor (frozen clock = stalemate), but doesn't constrain Elias's choices or tactics. Spatial choreography during the drone flight is present (narrow crevice, clearing), yet the environment functions as backdrop rather than active pressure. The bottle's glow and the clearing's truce-flag context add texture, but neither materially alters what Elias can or must do. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through urgency (scanner beams, crackling air), meeting baseline standards without charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.1)
    The abandoned circus train, hidden oasis, and weathered carousel are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("scent of blooming flowers," "creaking floorboards"). The setting does constrain choice—the wrong turn leads to discovery—and the oasis environment charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The wind bells function as both atmospheric detail and navigational cue, though their mechanism for "guiding his steps" remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.1)
    The library is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (whispers, groaning shelves, moonlight through dusty window). Books physically constrain her rearrangement choices across three beats, and the scarf returns at closure to charge the final image. However, the patron presence is mentioned but never pressures Elara's actions, and the "infinite expanse" inside the doorway lacks spatial grounding—no distances, no tactile interaction beyond "fingers brushing."

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.1)
    The archipelago, pier, palette, and camera are named and visually sketched, but none constrains a choice or alters tactics. Sensory detail is generic (salt-laden breeze, golden glow, damp sand) and tourism-catalog in register. The "luminous absence" and "whispering archipelago" recur as atmospheric tokens without grounding Elara's body or the photography mechanics in space. Spatial choreography is vague—tripod placement, palette beside her, brush work—never pressuring the action.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.4)
    The shadowed nexus, starlight, and Obsidian Vault establish atmospheric anchors and spatial coherence. Sensory detail (damp earth, distant pine, pulsing ribbon) is present but often decorative rather than constraining choice. The vault's "living entity" quality is asserted but never tested on the page—the lock yields after a single whispered phrase without material resistance. The lock of hair (object-as-setting) does charge the final beat, pushing the score into the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.1)
    The greenhouse and shipwrecks anchor early and recur, creating atmospheric texture. The fairy ring's missing mushroom and soil imprint provide tactile detail that enables the locket discovery—one causal constraint. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the shipwrecks "lean closer" metaphorically but do not alter Elara's tactics or choices. The final image uses the setting (fairy ring glowing, stars aligning) to charge the moment, meeting the micro-setting allowance for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.4)
    The forgotten library is vivid (dust motes, cracked windows, aged paper and damp wood) and the shard-mirror appears in multiple beats. Setting detail is purposeful but does not constrain a choice at closure—Elara completes her task without the environment supplying friction or altering tactics. The tea-leaf parchment and oolong steam are sensory and specific, but the annotation method feels ornamental rather than spatially urgent. Strong sensory work; spatial choreography is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.6)
    The waterfall and parapet are mentioned repeatedly but do not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; they function as postcard backdrop. The heirloom seed receives more specific handling (warmth, glow) and does charge the final image, partially meeting the micro-setting allowance. Sensory detail ("scent of blooming flora," "golden glow") is present but generic and not filtered through Elara's professional or personal priorities. Spatial choreography is minimal—no bodies in motion, no tactical use of terrain.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prism sanctuary is vividly established with stained glass, starlight, and shifting prismatic shadows; sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. However, the setting remains largely decorative—it doesn't constrain Elara's choices or supply resources that alter her tactics. The net and needle are handled, but the sanctuary itself functions as backdrop rather than pressure. The micro-setting (body, tool) does more work: the needle's resistance and the net's worn fibers engage tactilely, though neither forces a trade-off that changes the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.1)
    The rain-scoured vault and henge are described vividly but remain postcard details—neither constrains Elara's choices nor supplies resources that alter her tactics. The video footage on the tablet and excavation tools are mentioned but never depicted in use with spatial consequence. The chapel's wooden beams and altar appear only in the final summary, untouched and unexplored. Sensory detail (frescoes, shadows, rain) is filtered through generic poetic diction rather than Elara's professional map-framer bias. Spatial choreography is vague: is she inside the vault, beside the henge, or moving between them?

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sunken library setting is vivid and purposeful: damp planks, waterlogged tomes, dim headlamp light, and descending waterline all guide Elara's path and constrain her movements. The snow globe's glass integrity amid decay provides a strong recurring object that charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.6)
    The misty courtyard and storm imagery provide atmospheric grounding, and the flower press bolt plate is handled twice (found, then used). However, the setting does not meaningfully constrain Elara's choices—she works unimpeded in the courtyard, and the storm functions as ambient décor rather than tactical pressure. The bolt plate's function is asserted ("it was a key") but its mechanics remain vague, reducing specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.4)
    The icebound spire is vividly rendered with aurora light, frosted interiors, and thinning air by the fifth floor. Sensory detail (breath clouds, prism rainbows, scattered light) is purposeful and reflects urgency in mid-floors. However, spatial choreography within each floor remains vague—crates, clocks, portraits float without clear layout. The goggles and scattered light charge the final observatory image, qualifying the micro-setting function and lifting the score into the 6-band despite limited tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.4)
    The gondola, telescope, and sky are vividly described with consistent atmospheric texture. Spatial choreography is clean (gondola edge, railing, suspension in cloud). The telescope constrains one choice (she raises it twice to scan, once before the leap) and the glowing cumulus charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate in principle. However, much of the setting detail (patchwork fields, brass reflections, dusty starlight) remains decorative rather than pressure-shaping. The gondola's broken string and floor creaking supply mild constraint but do not alter tactics meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.1)
    The hollowed oak trunk library is vivid and purposeful, guiding Elara's search through carved patterns and shelves. The coin's indentations and the book safe's constellations supply tactile detail that charges the final image. The condemned building's groans and collapsing walls function as a live constraint that tightens the timeframe, meeting the micro-setting standard.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    The airship interior is anchored with purposeful detail (brass hull, navigation chamber, hopscotch board, stern hatch) and the starling murmurations outside create atmospheric texture. The hopscotch board constrains Elara's method and the hidden hatch at the stern shapes the discovery. Sensory selection remains visual-heavy; other senses are underused in the crystalline chamber. The setting provides resources (the board, the hatch) but does not pressure a choice with cost—Elara follows the beam without environmental resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    The frozen library, moonlight through frosted windows, and hall-of-mirrors shimmer provide vivid sensory anchors. The unseen ticking clock recurs and the cold sharpness of the hall physically constrain movement ("her breath visible in the chill"). However, spatial choreography inside the hall is vague—mirrors "shift" and "pull her into a vortex" without clear mechanics—and the gears rest on a pedestal whose positioning in the mirrored space remains abstract. The micro-setting (gears, mirrors) charges the final image, lifting the score into the 6-band, but the frozen-library premise functions more as backdrop than active constraint on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.1)
    The orchard planet, floating arches, and butterfly garden are richly described but function as painted backdrop. The watering bell is handled once at the climax; no earlier constraint from environment or tool shapes a tactic. Spatial choreography during the garden work remains vague—"footsteps crunching" and "shadows" without tactical use or proximity pressure. Sensory detail is present but ornamental, not filtered through urgency or character priority.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lighthouse at dusk anchors who/where/when early and charges the final image ("beam steadied, cutting through the dusk like a blade of hope"). The puppet fragments function as micro-setting, handled across beats (arranging, blood-dripping, glowing), constraining Elara's physical engagement. Sensory detail is selective—stone floor, violet and ash sky, rough shard edges—filtered through urgency. No occupational depth beyond "adjuster," but the setting pressures her tactile work and the ending reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.7)
    The cliffside labyrinth and mechanical birds supply vivid, purposeful detail that pressures Elara's rescue. The orchard's gnarled trees and the nut's etched surface are handled concretely. Spatial choreography during the chase is clean ("hidden alcove," "dodged"). However, the mechanical birds' "wings whirred like broken gears" and "graceless yet precise" read as stock contradictions rather than POV-filtered observation. The setting does not constrain the final planting choice—Elara simply presses the nut into soil without environmental resistance—so the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges closure) is not met.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.2)
    The ravine's jagged rocks, river foam, and twilight are vivid and selective. However, the environment remains backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters Elena's tactics. The chrysalis is handled twice but functions as symbolic ornament rather than a tool or micro-setting that pressures action. Sensory detail is competent but does not reach the threshold where setting shapes the final image with causal force.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glass orchard library and swirling clouds supply vivid visuals but remain postcard description; no environmental constraint shapes Elara's choices or tactics. The vial's ledge location and the incision task read as conveniences rather than earned spatial pressure. Micro-setting (the blade, the vial) is handled but does not charge the final image or foreclose an option.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.1)
    The coral icebound pavilion is vividly described and its structure (frozen corridors, etched walls) is clear. The body (Elara's palms on walls) and recurring objects (the shard) appear across beats and shape the final image. However, the desert fortress and tidal pools remain largely ornamental; they do not constrain choices or alter tactics in a way that would elevate the score into high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    The astronomical clock tower is vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (aged wood, oil, narrow windows, celestial etchings on the brass weight). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the climb and the square gathering below. The tower constrains Elara's choice by providing the mechanism she must awaken, and the brass weight's placement on the pedestal serves as a concrete anchor for the ritual, reaching the lower threshold for setting that shapes a key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.1)
    The moonlit canyon is vividly rendered with shadows, lunar glow, and whispered wind, but remains largely atmospheric rather than constraining choice. The broken periscope mirror is handled in multiple beats and its shards shape her action, though the modification itself lacks physical specificity. Spatial choreography is coherent and the setting supports tone, but the environment does not pressure a key decision or supply a resource that alters outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.1)
    The grotto's luminescent veins, mist, and serpentine walls are vividly rendered and recur across beats. Gravity inversion transforms spatial layout, opening hidden passages—this constrains navigation and charges the middle sequence. The crystal and pedestal function as micro-setting that guides the final action. Sensory detail is purposeful but leans visual; no clear evidence that the environment forces a trade-off or shapes the closure choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    The siskin alder grove is anchored early with sensory specificity ("sunlight filtered through the canopy like whispered secrets"). The hedgehog's uncurling provides a time marker and the ancient alder roots supply spatial detail. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure. The porcelain insulator is handled twice but does not shift spatial options or charge the final image in a way that depends on setting.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.1)
    The magnetic nexus provides atmospheric anchoring and the worry stone's "polished basalt" and "dent" offer tactile specificity. However, the nexus functions primarily as backdrop for contemplation; it does not constrain Alara's choices or supply resources that alter tactics. The chessboard is handled across beats but remains metaphorical rather than a spatial constraint. The "twilight draped in indigo and amber" and the nexus's hum modulate with pressure but do not pressure the final decision—Alara's resolve emerges from internal reflection, not environmental friction.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.1)
    The workshop and stars are mentioned repeatedly but function as backdrop—spatial choreography (stool, window, machinery) never constrains a choice or alters tactics. The clasp's "intricate design" is described but its mechanics do not shape the attempt. The fireworks timeframe is stated but never tightens decisions; the clasp opens at an unspecified moment within "the final stillness." Sensory detail (hum of machinery, rustle of wind) is present but ornamental, not pressure-bearing.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.4)
    The treetop village is vivid and purposeful—"homes built into sprawling canopies," "bridges of woven vines"—and the "wildflower hush" creates a coherent atmosphere. The garden's height ("edge of the highest bough") and the moon's glow anchor the pivotal evening scene. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains scenic rather than functional. The corpse flower sprout emits scent that drives the insight, meeting the micro-setting allowance, lifting the score into mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.4)
    The orchard planet's floating rock arches, bioluminescent moss, and gravity inversion create vivid sensory anchors, and the massive archway's cooler air and emerald glow are specific. The grove's towering trees with star-shimmer fruit and the monolithic stone provide a charged final setting. However, the environment remains decorative; gravity inversion is declared imminent but never constrains a choice or alters tactics on the page, and the river's flow guides navigation in summary rather than through embodied spatial problem-solving. The setting supplies atmosphere but does not pressure the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.4)
    The container labyrinth is vividly rendered with "rusted edges," "jagged skyline," and "funnel effect" that grounds the disaster's mechanism. Sensory detail—saltwater, metal, oil, shattered glass—creates atmosphere. However, the environment remains scenic backdrop; it does not constrain Elara's choices or shape her tactics during the survey. The setting supplies information but does not pressure decision.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ice cavern is vividly described with stalactites, fractured ice, and aurora colors, but these details remain ornamental—they do not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics. The amber sheet and prism-song bells are present but function as props rather than tools that impose limits or shape outcomes. The aurora "responds" passively without mechanical friction or cost, and the cavern's "exhale" at the end is metaphorical rather than a physical change that matters to the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.6)
    Setting provides atmospheric detail (thunder-echo range, canyon walls, amber glow) but remains largely postcard description. The alcove and pedestal are generic staging; no spatial feature constrains Elara's approach or choice. The flute's pedestal and the driftwood markers are mentioned but don't pressure tactics—she simply follows them. Micro-setting (the flute itself) charges the final image but doesn't constrain the decision to play it.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.1)
    The Topaz workshop is anchored early with vivid details (shelves, open ceiling, starlight), but these remain postcard elements that do not constrain a choice or charge the final image. The halo fragment is handled in two beats (observation, touch) yet functions as a passive prop rather than a micro-setting that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is clean, and sensory selection (light pulsing, trembling fingers) is purposeful, lifting the score into mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.2)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway is vivid and consistent, sensory detail ("breath visible in the cold air") anchors perception. However, setting remains postcard backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The pendant's hum syncs with the aurora in one beat but this moment carries no consequence. The scholar's cottage appears late and functions only as a destination.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    The quartz arbor and mist are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (crystalline structures, diffuse light, thickening mist). The prism's facets "catching rainbows" and the frost-on-car-window method anchor micro-setting. The arbor mutes sound and the mist clears at closure, subtly reflecting Elara's internal shift. The environment does not constrain a key choice but does charge the final image when "the air felt heavier" after her realization, narrowly meeting the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.1)
    The orchard-in-bamboo setting and shifting puzzle images provide vivid anchors ("trees that sang," "streams that flowed backward"). However, setting functions as spectacle rather than constraint: none of these phenomena alter Elara's tactics or close off an option. The bead warms and glows, but its temperature never forces a choice or redirects movement. Micro-setting test not met.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.1)
    Floating rock arches and molten core are vivid and recur across beats. The mine shafts constrain Eli's descent tactically (crumbling walls, calculated steps). However, the orchard planet's healing is told in summary ("blossoming," "vibrant") rather than shown through specific sensory shift. The arches "hum with life" and gain "blooming vines" in the final paragraph, charging the closure image modestly and meeting the 9+ gate prerequisite.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.1)
    The repair bay's "rust and old grease" and the "lush, alien forest" are vividly described but remain postcard backdrops. The green shard is handled in two beats (lifting, combining), meeting minimal threshold, but the settings do not constrain choice—Elara moves freely between worlds without navigation cost or spatial friction. The repair bay's "warmer air" and "humming consoles" change state without causal trigger, and the forest's "symphony of whispers" is atmospheric rather than tactile pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lighthouse lantern room, jagged cliffs, and roaring sea are anchored early and sensory details (waves crashing, gulls crying, sea glass glow) are vivid. The hidden compartment and stone-stacking constrain one mid-story turn. However, the setting does not pressure the final choice or charge the closure image—Elias lights the lamp, an act unimpeded by environment. Spatial choreography is clean, but the setting remains atmospheric rather than essential to tactics or outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lighthouse setting is vivid (emerald beam, glass walls, stars) and the wick's material ("shimmered with its own light") returns at the climax to steer the beam, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (lantern room, railing, horizon fog). However, "total internal reflection" remains a physics label without tactile constraint—we never see how the wick's mechanics limit or enable a choice. The "after the last print newspaper" anchor is ornamental, never pressing tactics. Body and tool engage the ending, lifting the score into mid-6s despite the passive postcard fog description.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.1)
    The floating tea house and cloud-kissed plateau anchor the frame with evocative detail. The blue morpho wing functions as a recurring object across beats (windowsill moment, table placement, final exit), and its iridescence shifts with the light to charge key moments. However, the setting doesn't constrain a choice or alter tactics—it remains a postcard backdrop. The wing's physical properties (catching light, casting colors) pressure the scene's mood but don't enable or block an action.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.4)
    The stormlit tower, moonlight through cracked window, and dusty table create coherent spatial grounding. The sextant's brass and shattered glass receive tactile attention across beats, and the moonlight acts as a physical catalyst (healing the glass). Spatial choreography (chamber, corridor, descent) tracks cleanly. The setting does not constrain a tactical choice at a pressure point, capping high-band eligibility, but micro-setting (the table, the sextant as object-setting) charges the ending image sufficiently for mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.1)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse and mirror world are vividly sketched ("fruit that glowed like captured dawns," "bark etched with lyrics that shimmered like mica"). Spatial choreography is coherent across the threshold and the stream. However, the environment does not constrain a single choice or alter tactics; Elara wanders freely, and each location yields its song fragment on cue. The mica window appears in beats but functions as scenic description rather than a tool whose properties shape outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.1)
    The bookstore anchor is vivid early ("neon lights," "urban sprawl," "ancient tomes") and the deepest chamber supplies atmospheric detail. However, the library constrains no choices—Elara moves freely through archives and chambers without spatial friction. The crumpled invitation and leather-bound volume function as props but do not pressure tactics. The city's "chaos" awaits in the final line but remains abstract, never tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.4)
    The overgrown palace courtyard is vivid and consistent, with sensory detail (damp earth, fading blooms, chamomile and jasmine) filtered through Elara's focus on restoration. The secret tea house provides spatial coherence across moves. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Elara encounters no locked door, rival gardener, or physical obstacle. The setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.1)
    The frozen library above the clouds is vivid and establishes tone early: crystalline shelves, biting cold, misted breath, velvet casings. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elara's professional attention. The magic lantern and measuring device constrain her process, and the tremor provides a physical beat. Spatial choreography is clear. However, the setting does not materially alter a choice at closure—it frames rather than pressures—so the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is not met.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.4)
    The pirate market is vividly anchored (rotting pier, salt and decay, vendors hawking stolen goods) and Lila's navigation shows spatial coherence. The watch fob is handled across multiple beats and the necklace charm creates a visual link that enables her tactical approach. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The micro-setting (the pier edge at dawn) charges the final image without becoming a postcard. Minor: the fortune-teller's booth adds atmosphere but does not constrain a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lavender bluff and aurora are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (scent, metallic/sweet taste, color intensity). The tin compass ring returns with functional detail (warmth, tingling, taste communication). However, setting does not constrain Elara's final choice—she could accept the call anywhere. The spatial anchoring is clean and the atmosphere coheres, lifting the score into mid-range, but the environment remains backdrop rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.7)
    The subterranean crystal cave is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (amethyst, quartz, dripping water, prismatic shadows). The crystals "come alive" and cast dancing shadows during the climactic painting, but this remains atmospheric rather than constraining a choice or altering a tactic. The cave functions as symbolic mirror (cage → womb) without spatial pressure that shapes Elara's decisions on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.2)
    Verdania's greenhouse domes and toxic sky are vivid in the opening, and the undercity offers sensory contrast (decaying plants, rusting metal). However, the hidden chamber itself—the closure location—receives only generic treatment ("wall covered in ancient script"). The zinc-etched plate is handled twice but never constrains a choice; it hums faintly but doesn't shape Elara's tactics. Spatial choreography in the chamber is vague (we don't know how she moves, what she touches beyond "the first letter"), preventing the setting from charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.4)
    The Whispering Bluff is vividly described—clouds, thin air, cerulean sky—but never constrains a tactic or complicates Elara's work. The iceberg fragment is handled across two beats (carving, spinning) and charges the final image with its dimming light, meeting basic object-as-setting criteria. Spatial choreography is clean, though the bluff functions more as backdrop than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.9)
    The glass dome and desert roses are seeded early and return at closure, constraining Elara's choice to contain the chaos rather than let it spill. The "strangely organic" wood pulsing is vivid, and the dome shimmering with magnetic fields charges the miniaturization scene. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The roses' "fragile yet enduring nature" provides a concrete anchor for Elara's stance crystallization, meeting the micro-setting standard for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.1)
    The courtyard at dawn is vividly rendered with jasmine scent, cobblestones, and amber light. However, it remains postcard description; the setting does not constrain Clara's choices or supply resources that alter tactics. The locket and mailbox are props moved by plot convenience rather than spatial or environmental pressure. Sensory detail is present but does not modulate with urgency or filter through Clara's professional lens as a curator.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.1)
    The sunken laboratory is rendered through atmospheric generalities ("shadows danced," "moss-covered surfaces," "scent of decay") without spatial grounding or object-level specificity that constrains choice. The glowing journal and shifting walls provide set-dressing but do not limit Elara's options or force tactical adjustments. Micro-setting detail (water dripping, humming chamber) does not tie to her decisions or charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.1)
    The salt crystal chamber is vividly described ("walls encrusted in shimmering salt formations," "ethereal light"), but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. Sensory detail is present but does not narrow options or shape tactics. Spatial choreography is stable. The wildflowers and chamber do not materially constrain Eli's final "step forward" or alter the outcome, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.1)
    The nocturnal haven, brook, and moss-covered stone are vividly rendered with sensory detail ("scent of damp earth and pine," "gentle gurgle of water"). The brook's rhythm mirrors Elara's internal state and the crane's wing casts "intricate shadows," but these details remain atmospheric rather than constraining a choice or altering tactics. The setting does not pressure the ritual's outcome or supply a resource that changes the ending. Spatial choreography is clear, and the environment evolves ("the brook's flow seemed to pause"), but this is decorative rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.4)
    The rooftop garden during a meteor shower is vividly anchored with wrought-iron railing, brick chimney, and celestial light. Sensory detail (scents of herbs, hum of the city) is selective and atmospheric. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—the garden functions as a picturesque backdrop rather than a tactical element; Clara could receive the same lesson indoors with minimal rewrite. Spatial choreography is clear but not pressure-bearing.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.1)
    The velvet garden, orchid, and fountain supply vivid anchors and the twilight-to-morning timeframe provides atmospheric momentum. The shell's etched patterns and the orchid's color shift create memorable micro-details. However, the environment remains decorative—none of these objects constrain Elara's choices or supply tactical resources. The shell does gate the metaphysical journey, lifting this slightly, but spatial choreography inside the vision-space (translucent figure, sea of light) is vague and the garden's physical rules disappear once she enters the resonance realm.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.1)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, and stalactite drip are vivid and purposefully atmospheric, filtering through Elara's emotional state ("hushed embrace," "solemn metronome"). The stalactites' rhythm synchronizes with her heartbeat, anchoring the scene in sensory detail that supports the meditative tone. The sanctuary shifts from "place of sorrow" to "alive with possibility," a transformation that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (cross-legged on floor, thorn to parchment, standing at end). The setting constrains the pace and mood but does not directly alter a tactical choice, keeping it just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.6)
    The nexus remains generic dreamscape description ("labyrinth of shadows and light," "liquid starlight") without physical constraint or tactical pressure. Spatial choreography is vague—Elara "wanders," "approaches," "steps through"—without legible distances or obstacles. The seashell grows warmer but does not alter her next action. The environment never narrows a choice or charges the final image; it functions as backdrop only.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.6)
    The glacier-ice shrine and melted snow globe supply vivid details, but neither constrains a choice or charges the closure beyond decoration. Spatial choreography is clear (shrine interior, altar, stepping out), and sensory selection (flickering flames, crystalline walls, murky liquid) fits the tone. The body and tool (gloved hand, journal) appear but do not alter tactics. Accumulation caps Q3 at 7.0 per the Orientation Test penalty applied in Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.1)
    The whispering parapet after rain is vividly evoked with scent of damp stone, jasmine, fireflies, and moonlight, filtered through Elara's philosophical lens. The bamboo tea whisk recurs as a tactile anchor (cool surface, smooth texture) and the parapet stones are described as imbued with prior stories, creating micro-setting texture. However, neither environment nor object constrains a choice or alters tactics—they serve as backdrop and thematic mirrors rather than pressure points. The setting is present across the narrative and charges the final image lyrically, reaching mid-6s under the lyric-resonance allowance, but does not gate a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.1)
    The wasteland orchard is vivid ("cracked earth," "radioactive dust storms") and the stillpoint hum is embodied. Spatial choreography is coherent across the camp scene. However, the orchard does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—it remains backdrop. The diamond's glow and the shadows' movement are described but do not alter Elara's tactics in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.1)
    The stormlit observatory above clouds is vivid and returns across beats (opening, climax storm, dawn balcony), charging the final image. Sensory details are selective—"cobalt surface shimmering," "winds howled," "clouds parted"—and the portico's physical state (whole, fracturing, whole again with symbols) tracks causally. However, the setting does not constrain a choice: Elias faces no environmental obstacle (altitude, storm danger, equipment failure) that alters his tactics or complicates the activation.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    The loft's "cracked wooden beams" and windowsill anchor early; the dunes recur at opening and close, framing the piece. The music box as micro-setting object constrains one beat (jammed gears force Elias to whisper, coaxing the note), satisfying minimal 9+ criteria. Sensory detail is selective (pale light, cold metal, wind pausing) and POV-filtered. However, the loft itself never pressures a tactical choice—Elias could perform this ritual anywhere—limiting setting's causal role to atmospheric backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.1)
    The drift-ice marina is vivid and atmospheric in the opening ("frozen sea met the jagged shore," "brine and ancient secrets"), and the lighthouse staircase provides spatial grounding. However, the environment does not constrain Elara's choices or alter tactics during the confrontation—she descends, faces the figure, and the key itself resolves the encounter. The setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure, preventing high-band entry despite strong initial detail.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.4)
    The basalt sanctuary and frozen lake anchor the opening clearly. Sensory detail is generic ("glistening with residual moisture," "silver light") and never filtered through Elara's professional or personal priorities. The viaduct is described but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as static symbol rather than lived environment. The setting never pressures an on-page decision.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    The tunnel setting is anchored with rust, damp earth, fissures, and carved symbols that guide Elara's path. The lantern provides light but remains largely atmospheric; it does not constrain a choice at closure. Spatial choreography is clear, and the hidden chamber discovery depends on physical details (false wall, junction). The environment supplies clues but does not actively limit options or charge the final image beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    The repair shop is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (aged wood, oil scent, dim light, shelves of silent music boxes) filtered through Elias's contemplative attention. The clockwork heart functions as a micro-setting object: Elias handles it, Alistair repairs it on-page, and its ticking return charges the ending image. Spatial choreography is clean (counter, workshop, shelves, specific music box with floral design). The shop subtly mirrors the theme of mending broken things, though the constraint on choice is implied rather than direct—Elias could have this conversation anywhere. The environment supports atmosphere and thematic layering without forcing a tactical decision tied to the space itself.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.2)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop on the acid sea is vividly rendered with sensory specifics (fogged windows, corrosive mist, clanking metal). The kaleidoscope and arrow tip anchor micro-setting beats. However, the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics; the acid sea "stills" at the bell's ring but this is atmospheric response, not a constraint Lira navigates. The setting reads as postcard backdrop rather than pressuring the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.6)
    The archive setting is functional but mostly abstract: "vast digital expanse" and "old terminal" lack sensory specificity or spatial choreography. The patch—frayed fabric with faded gold emblem—is described twice but never handled or used to constrain a choice. The song plays in the background without altering Elara's perception or tactics. Micro-setting opportunity (body, tool) is missed; the final image does not charge the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lighthouse orchard and vintage store are vividly anchored with sensory specifics: "crisp scent of salt and apple blossoms," "aged wood and dust," shifting mirror frames. The ice floes provide atmospheric grounding but do not constrain a choice. The crystal ball fragment is handled across multiple beats and returns at closure, charging the final image. Spatial choreography inside the store is clear (largest mirror, smaller mirror, pedestal at center). The setting serves mood and motif well, reaching the mid-6s, but does not force a tactical decision that alters outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.4)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered with sensory specifics: "jagged shards," "broken teeth," "creaking piers," northern lights. Spatial choreography remains clear across dock, shelter, and return to dock. The parasol appears in multiple beats but does not constrain a choice or charge the final image beyond symbolic presence. The setting pressures atmosphere more than tactics; survivors and the ice whisper thematically but do not alter Elara's options in a legible way.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.7)
    The amber pavilion, vineyard rows, and vacant station anchor the setting with sensory clarity and purpose. The pavilion's warm glow and the vineyard's symmetry serve as metaphors that guide Elara's reflection, and the spatial choreography (bench, edge of pavilion, distant station) remains coherent. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as backdrop and symbolic resonance rather than active pressure. Autumn detail and cool night air are noted but do not shape outcome, capping the score below 9-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.1)
    The murmuring pavilion and kinetic parapet are vividly named and described with sensory detail (silken walls, pulsing stones, sand shifting). However, spatial choreography is vague—Elara's movements between pavilion and dunes lack clear geography, and neither location constrains a choice or alters tactics. The parapet glows on cue but does not impose cost or enable a turn; it remains atmospheric set-dressing.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    The lavender field and rusted factory create a vivid, purposeful contrast that anchors mood and frames the healing theme. Sensory detail (lavender scent, golden dusk light, vines on iron) is selective and evocative. However, the setting remains largely backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters Elara's task. The photographs and map case function more as props than environmental pressures. Strong atmospheric work, but the setting does not charge the final image or drive a turn.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.1)
    The shadowed library, dawn light, and worn oak desk anchor setting vividly and filter through Elias's scholarly perspective. The crystal is handled across multiple beats (tracing, humming into it, cradling) and its properties—sonically reflective, vibrating—constrain his method. The final image is charged by the crystal's spent state and the lifted hush, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that setting or object shape the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.1)
    The fog sculpture garden is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (metal loops, rusted archway, stone figures, still pond) and filtered through Elias's metaphorical lens (archway as "doorway to a forgotten childhood"). The chalk and driftwood serve as micro-setting tools that constrain his method of navigation. The setting charges the final image: the pond and damp earth anchor the moment he hears the sound and drops the chalk. Spatial choreography is clear across the wandering path, and the fog modulates with narrative rhythm (thickening, then lifting).

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lunar observatory is vividly anchored early with strong sensory detail ("air was thin," "stars burned with intensity"), but it functions primarily as backdrop. The cold stone floor and workbench appear in passing; no environmental constraint shapes Elara's choices or alters her tactics. The clock and its mechanism are handled twice, but the "device" she creates is summarized rather than shown through tools or materials that pressure her approach.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "radiant haven above the clouds" is vividly established with sensory detail (lavender, eucalyptus, soft glow), and the vinyl fragment recurs as a motif. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the environment does not constrain Elara's choices or alter tactics. The vinyl fragment on the windowsill "catching the light" charges the final image modestly, but spatial choreography and the sanctuary's mechanics remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.7)
    The floating isle, observatory, and workshop are anchored early with sensory specificity (star-charted ceiling, brass runes pulsing under moonlight, half-finished automaton). The setting shapes one key choice: Elara returns to the workshop to close the first loop, and the precipice at noon provides the stage for the void encounter. However, neither location constrains tactics with visible cost—Elara moves through them without spatial friction or environmental pressure altering her options. The micro-setting (the key in her pocket) recurs but functions more as talisman than constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory detail is vivid (damp earth, blooming jasmine, glowing flowers) and the hedge maze, fountain, and garden are spatially coherent. However, the environment remains postcard-pretty rather than pressuring choices—Elara navigates the maze without visible constraint or cost. The tooth hums and the waters erupt, but these remain ornamental effects that do not alter tactics. The garden feels like a set piece for the symbolic exchange rather than a crucible that shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    The serpentine grotto with its luminescent moss and swirling mist is vividly rendered and sustains atmosphere throughout. The setting anchors the reflective tone and the sea glass's glow is amplified by moonlight, charging the final image. However, the grotto does not constrain a choice or alter Lira's tactics—she polishes undisturbed, and the environment functions as backdrop rather than pressure. Spatial choreography is clear (grotto interior, then path to village).

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.3)
    The abandoned data center setting is vividly rendered with moss, cracked windows, and mineral streaks, creating a coherent atmosphere of decay-into-life. The amber pendant recurs but functions more as talisman than constraint. The icicle patterns and ferns guide the tour but do not visibly alter Elara's choices; they illustrate rather than pressure. The setting charges the final image (amber light casting the garden) without forcing a tactical decision, landing solidly in the mid-7s for purposeful mood but missing the constraint or cost needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "feral nexus in mist" and "forgotten shore" remain abstract placeholders without spatial grounding or sensory specificity. The glowing tree at the heart of the nexus supplies a symbolic anchor but does not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics. Micro-setting (the shell fragment) is handled across beats and returns at closure, lifting the score slightly, but the larger environment functions as atmospheric wallpaper rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.1)
    The arbor is vividly described with selective sensory detail (dew sparkling, leaves rustling), and the vine tendril functions as a micro-setting object across multiple beats. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Elara's actions proceed as planned without spatial friction. The setting charges the final image atmospherically but does not impose cost, capping the score in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.8)
    The subarctic crater and withered orchard anchor location early and provide atmospheric texture ("frost-kissed ground," "ghostly moon"). However, setting elements do not constrain choice or alter tactics; the orchard functions as scenic backdrop rather than active pressure. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the illustration plate gains visual charge at closure, but the body, tools, and environment remain passive rather than forcing trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.1)
    The marble cavern supplies vivid sensory anchors—"shimmered with ancient veins of silver and gold," "faint glow of twilight seeped through a crack"—and its reflective surfaces tie directly to Elias's method (studying reflection angles). The timer's alignment with dusk angles at the breakthrough moment demonstrates setting constraining choice. Spatial choreography remains coherent (crouched, buried depths, ceiling crack). However, the cavern does not evolve causally; it remains static witness rather than a dynamic pressure that alters tactics or raises cost across the sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bronze grotto is anchored early with sensory specifics (damp earth, metallic tang, flickering shadows) and the kerosene lamp functions as a tactile grounding object across multiple beats. Starlight filtered through the ceiling mosaic pulses "in time with her breathing," linking environment to interiority. The grotto's silence and the lamp's flame modulation subtly mirror Elara's shift at closure, charging the final image. Micro-setting (lamp, air, stone) constrains and reflects without postcard excess.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rain-beaded skylight and the loft's tool arrangement create vivid atmosphere and the setting is filtered through Elara's grief-laden attention. The carving blank and tools constrain her work process across multiple beats, charging the final image when she holds the completed lion. Spatial choreography (rug, stove, skylight) remains coherent, and sensory detail (steam curling, rain tapping) modulates with the scene's rhythm. Minor deduction: occupational carving detail is light, but sufficient for this length and the tools do shape her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.6)
    The kinetic lagoon is vivid in atmosphere ("waters alive with currents," "clouds thinned") but functions as backdrop rather than constraint; Mara walks its edge without the environment altering her tactics or choices. The camera wheel is handled across multiple beats and returns at closure, satisfying micro-setting criteria. Spatial choreography remains vague—mud, rock, lagoon edge—without clear distances or movement logic.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.1)
    The terminal setting is vivid (cracked tiles, torn banners, broken vents) and Eli's manipulation of air and light mirrors his thematic work, lending mild constraint to his activity. Detail remains selective and atmosphere coheres, but the space does not pressure a key choice or charge the final image with cost—it serves as backdrop rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sanctuary, forecourt, and clock anchor space and constrain choice: the crystals whisper only after rain, the blank clock face mirrors emptiness, and Elara's tools enable the closure act. Sensory detail (petrichor, translucent stones humming, dew-kissed surfaces) is vivid and filtered through POV. The clock—a micro-setting object—charges the final image by becoming complete, altering the sanctuary's felt weight. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.4)
    The twilight barge canal supplies vivid atmospheric detail (damp earth, distant machinery hum, rotting barges, moss-covered names) and the decaying barge functions as the discovery site. However, the environment does not constrain Elara's choices or complicate her goal—she walks, finds the exact barge she needs, and opens the chest without spatial friction. The sundial's glow and the canal's "serene upheaval" charge the mood but do not alter her tactics or enable a trade-off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.4)
    Setting details are vivid and consistent: golden dock, snow, fog, harbor waves, dim light. The fulgurite glass returns across beats with purposeful attention. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Elara works undisturbed, and the fog/snow function as mood rather than pressure. The micro-setting (dock, rope, glass) shapes atmosphere but does not charge the final image with cost or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "scent of fallen leaves and damp earth," "golden patches on the ground," "faint scent of woodsmoke." The garden's twilight atmosphere coheres and supports the tone of lonesome splendor. Spatial choreography is clean—bench, path, trees, horizon—and the thread objects are handled concretely. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or charge the closure; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than a pressure that alters tactics or the final image, capping the score below the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.4)
    The suspended palace, stalactite chamber, and mechanical fragments anchor the world vividly. The egg on its pedestal and the blue-lit cavern supply atmospheric detail filtered through Kael's weary determination. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the passage and chamber are traversed without spatial friction. The egg's warmth and the machine's hum charge the final beats, but the setting itself remains postcard rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The obsidian lagoon, black volcanic sand, and migrating clouds are vivid and consistent. The sand's sterility and the coin's tactile presence constrain her planting action, and the lagoon's "held breath" charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's focus. The setting does not guide a key turn or choice under pressure, limiting the score, but it shapes atmosphere and the symbolic closure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.1)
    The city of forgotten fountains provides vivid, purposeful atmosphere—dried basins, frozen clock tower, moss-covered stone—that guides Elara's path and mirrors the trapped-memory theme. Spatial choreography across locations (apartment, windowsill, fountain, clock tower, library ruins) remains clear. However, setting remains largely decorative; the fountains do not constrain Elara's choices or supply tactical resources. The final fountain's return to life charges the closure image with symbolic weight, meeting the micro-setting allowance for a recurring object that reweights meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.1)
    The nebula garden supplies vivid sensory texture—bioluminescent blooms, falling petals, liquid silver light—but remains a postcard backdrop that does not constrain choice or alter tactics. Spatial choreography is vague (Elara "stands," then "transits" through memory without clear physical or perceptual stakes). The gear as micro-setting object receives multiple touches and charges the final image, lifting the score modestly, but the garden itself exerts no pressure on Elara's options.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.4)
    The greenhouse is vividly rendered ("glass panes humming with the weight of centuries") and the butterflies provide atmospheric texture, but the setting remains postcard rather than tactical. The workbench, chisel, and marble are mentioned but do not constrain Elara's choices or evolve causally. The final image of the greenhouse "reflecting the stars" is decorative rather than meaningfully charged by prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.4)
    The obsidian ridge, tower interior, and pendulum bob are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (weathered hands, brass constellations, hypnotic arc). The pendulum's pause functions as micro-setting that structures Elias's reflective moments and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. However, the ridge itself remains postcard backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome, keeping the score out of the 7+ band despite strong atmospheric control.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    Setting anchors are vivid and purposeful: "velveteen gloom," "cobalt silo," and "willow tree" create atmosphere and spatial coherence. The silo functions as sanctuary and workspace, housing relics on organized shelves, which supplies context but does not constrain a choice in the scene. The stars and tapestry constellations mirror each other thematically, and the chess clock marks elapsed time, yet neither environment nor object alters Elias's tactics or charges the final image with a visible tradeoff. Micro-setting qualifies (the workbench, the case, the tapestry), but none becomes indispensable to the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.1)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake anchor setting vividly, but function as postcard backdrop. The lake's thaw and the spire's glow occur as metaphorical atmosphere shifts rather than spatial constraints that alter Ignorance's tactics. The quill and inkwell are handled twice (dipping, writing) and the scroll is rolled, qualifying as micro-setting use, but none of these objects impose a visible trade-off or limit his choices. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (pine scent, iridescent blues) yet remains ornamental to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.2)
    The ember alcove is vividly detailed (crumbling manuscripts, aged paper, damp wood, mist-clad windows), and the radio's spreading luminescence creates atmospheric charge. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint shapes Clara's choices or tactics. The desk, parchment, and radio are handled, but their presence does not alter options at closure. The "threshold" claim in the final third remains metaphorical rather than spatial, missing the chance to let architecture constrain or enable the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.2)
    The gallery's "high ceilings," "polished marble," and "dim lights" establish atmosphere, and the rocking chair and porcelain mask supply vivid, recurring objects. The mask's "jagged edges catching light" is specific and purposeful. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome; it functions as backdrop rather than pressure. The chair's slowing rhythm charges the final image modestly, earning mid-range credit.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.6)
    The sewer and sunken city ruins are anchored with sensory detail ("scent of decay," "damp stone ledge," "flooded streets"), and the chronometer cog is handled across multiple beats. Spatial choreography is coherent but the ruins function primarily as atmospheric backdrop—Kael moves "through the sedimentary layers" without those layers constraining his choices or altering tactics. The collapse mentioned by Lira never materializes as an on-page obstacle; artifacts are "carefully extracted" in summary, so the environment does not pressure the final image or shape the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    The velvet library, autumn light, and stained glass anchor the setting early with sensory detail filtered through a reverent POV. The rosette functions as a micro-setting focal point across beats, but spatial choreography of the students and the performance venue remains vague. The library's transformation from "mausoleum of silence" to "living cathedral" is declared rather than shown through changed environmental detail. Autumn recurs but does not constrain a choice or charge the closure image with new meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rusted greenhouse is vividly established early ("iron frame twisted," "patches of rust like scars") and Elara's pruning physically transforms it, altering the space by dawn. The cracked terracotta pot and the luminescent seed supply concrete anchors. However, the greenhouse does not meaningfully constrain choice—Elara works unimpeded, and the celestial alignment's energy is described atmospherically ("beams glowing faintly") without altering her options or tactics. Spatial choreography is clean, but the setting remains a backdrop rather than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.8)
    The lightning tower, lacquer box, and underground chamber are visually specific and tonally consistent. The box's "patterns that seemed to shift" and the orb's "faint, blue light" anchor sensory details in the present action. However, spatial choreography in the descent and chamber is vague—no distance, stair count, or tactile detail grounds the movement. The setting does not constrain Elara's choices; the hidden panel and chamber simply open when the key is used, offering no friction or tactical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.6)
    The bay setting is vivid ("quiet waters mirroring soft hues," "whispering winds") and spatially coherent, but it remains postcard description—it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The orris root shard is handled twice (picked up, placed at center), qualifying as micro-setting presence, and the final paragraph's "houses whispering" offers a lyric reprise that reweights the stake modestly. However, the environment supplies no resources or friction that affect outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.1)
    The underwater garden is vividly anchored with coral arches, tangled seaweed, crumbling fountains, and muted silence. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, filtered through centuries of stillness. The setting constrains Liora (immovable statue) and provides the discovery context for Elara's arrival, charging the final image of the buried ampoule in the garden. Micro-setting (the statue's marble surface, the flashlight cutting murk) integrates well with character and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.4)
    The infinite staircase is vividly rendered ("walls pulsed faintly," "geometry defying logic") and spatially coherent. However, it functions primarily as metaphorical backdrop rather than constraint; Elara's choices aren't pressured by the environment's shifting geometry in a causal way. The chipped die's fall ("the staircase would not allow her to retrace her steps") briefly imposes a rule, but this constraint feels declared rather than established through prior action. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, elevating the score within the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.4)
    The rooftop greenhouse is vividly anchored with sensory specifics (fogged panes, smog, jasmine scent shift). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single scene. However, the setting never constrains a choice or materially alters Elara's tactics—it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure. The moon and greenhouse shift passively around her rather than forcing a decision, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.1)
    The grotto setting is vividly described (waterfall roar, bioluminescent fungi, moss-covered arches) but remains largely decorative. The opera lens glows and chimes; the waterfall mists; neither constrains a choice or alters tactics. Spatial choreography is clear (workshop, city square, altar) and sensory detail is purposeful, but the environment does not pressure Elara's plan or charge the final image. Micro-setting credit is unavailable because the lens and bread function symbolically rather than as tools that shape action.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.9)
    The lighthouse setting is vividly rendered with specific details (rusted gears, shattered glass, "broken tooth" tower) and the tidal timeframe creates atmospheric pressure. The hunger stone embedded in the lighthouse base provides a spatial anchor for the key action. However, the environment primarily supplies backdrop rather than constraining Elias's choices—he works methodically without the setting forcing tactical adaptation. The final image of the lighthouse's counter-clockwise gears charges the closure, meeting the 9+ gate criterion, but earlier beats don't show the setting altering his approach.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.4)
    The funhouse setting is vivid early (warped mirrors, broken windows, tattered dictionary, spinning clocks) but functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint. No environmental detail narrows Clara's choices or supplies a resource that alters outcome. The mirrors "shift" and "shatter" without spatial choreography clarifying how she navigates them. The opera cloak clasp and lingering luminance are props that illustrate rather than pressure; micro-setting potential unrealized.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating orchard on driftwood is vivid and consistently tracked; sensory details (blue hour hues, leaves whispering, seashells in the xylophone) are selective and atmospheric. The xylophone itself—driftwood and seashells—subtly constrains Leeward's action (he must use what the orchard provides) and charges the final beat. Spatial choreography is clean, and the sea-and-sky setting modulates with the narrative pulse, meeting the micro-setting test for higher-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.1)
    The turtle-shell city is vivid and specific, anchoring the premise effectively. The tunnel's glowing symbols and the chamber's golden light create atmosphere. However, spatial choreography in the chamber is vague (watchers' positions, pedestal distance), and the setting functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraining Elara's choices or charging the final image. The crack in the turtle shell enables the descent but does not recur to shape tactics or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.4)
    The disused station is vividly rendered with ivy, rust, crumbling walls, and the cracked mirror. The rosebush and its falling petal anchor the timeframe poetically. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; the stationmaster's office and basement are discovered without spatial constraint shaping tactics. The setting charges the atmosphere but does not narrow Elara's choices or complicate her path in a way that alters the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.4)
    The submerged pavilion is vividly anchored with sensory detail (brine, decay, silt-buried arches, hands reaching upward) and the mosaic reveal charges the final image. However, the environment does not constrain Elias's choices—he wades, wrests, and repairs without obstacle. The drawbridge and lagoon frame the action spatially but remain backdrop rather than pressure. Micro-setting earns credit for the inkwell and journal as tactile objects, but neither alters tactics or imposes cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.1)
    The sunken city frame and bioluminescent algae anchor atmosphere early. The stamp returns at closure, charging the final image modestly. However, spatial choreography is unclear (shelf positions, chamber locations), and the library functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no access, proximity, or environmental pressure alters Elara's choices. Meets micro-setting allowance via the stamp as object-setting, but the broader environment remains postcard-descriptive.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.1)
    The floating island tea garden, glass basilica, and workbench are vividly sketched and spatially coherent. The basilica's "translucent walls glowing with recorded dreams" and "thick with whispers" create strong sensory atmosphere. The island's paradoxical motion ("descended while ascending") registers as thematic rather than a physical constraint that alters Kael's choices. The workbench and tools (dreamstone, gems) remain mostly postcard detail; gem polishing is mentioned but its mechanics never pressure a decision. The crane at the altar charges the final beat, lifting the score into the mid-6s, but overall the setting functions more as backdrop than as a constraint that narrows options or supplies resources affecting outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating observatory is vividly rendered with electromagnetic fields and geode-lined walls that create a distinct atmosphere. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The crystals function as more than backdrop—they anchor her contemplation and the final revelation. The setting's suspension "between earth and sky, between destruction and creation" works as metaphor but also constrains her physical space for reflection, lifting this above pure decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    The observatory is vividly rendered (stone walls, cracked stained-glass, star charts, spiral staircase, underground vault) and the micro-settings (hidden alcove, eastern tower, vault) organize the hunt. However, the environment never constrains a choice or complicates tactics—each location simply reveals the next piece. "Brilliant dimness" is invoked twice but remains ornamental rather than a sensory filter that alters perception under pressure. Spatial choreography is clean and the setting supplies resources, but it does not pressure the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt terrace and forgotten shore are vividly anchored with selective sensory detail ("scent of salt and decay," "sieved hush"). The driftwood carvings function as micro-setting that charges the final image when Elias aligns the watch hand with the carved clock. Spatial choreography (terrace above, stone steps, beach below) remains coherent throughout. However, the beach operates more as symbolic backdrop than constraint—Elias could have reached his realization anywhere, and the environment doesn't materially narrow his tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.2)
    The parapet and mist are established early and modulate with storm intensity. Sensory detail (cold air, lantern flicker, wind howl) supports atmosphere but remains ornamental—the environment does not constrain a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The drawer pull is handled twice (pocket touch, final exchange) yet its physical properties (tarnished brass, etchings) do not shape a decision. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting charges mood but does not meet the 9-band gate of constraining choice or charging the final image causally.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    The coastal kayak launch, utility poles, and kayak are concretely rendered and filter through Mara's priorities ("scarred hull," "predictable spacing"). The poles constrain her navigation method and are present in the opening and middle, reweighting her reliance on the compass. The final image—poles shrinking as she paddles, sun climbing—charges the ending with spatial movement and environmental shift. Sensory detail is selective (salt, seaweed, waves) and integrated into action. The micro-setting (body, tool, water) functions as a constraint and closure anchor, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    The bioluminescent lake is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (glow, warmth, carved symbols) and the water acts as a spatial constraint when Elias wades in. However, the lake functions primarily as metaphor rather than tactical obstacle—no choice hinges on its physical properties. The baseball's interaction with the water (sinking, illuminating fish) charges the final third but does not constrain a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.8)
    The orchard setting supplies vivid sensory anchors—moonlight, shimmering fruit, saffron/cardamom/clove scents—and the clearing's silver light frames the climax. However, spatial choreography is thin: Elara walks, the trees part, the guardian stands "at its center," but distances, obstacles, and tactile engagement remain abstract. The fortune cookie falls into her palm without resistance, the conjuring happens via "ancient patterns" and "energy" without physical cost or environmental feedback. The orchard does not constrain choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it functions as backdrop. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) is not leveraged to charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.4)
    The midnight glade offers vivid sensory anchors ("crystalline leaves," "mossy ground") and the saucer functions as a recurring constraint across multiple beats. The cloudbound setting provides atmospheric charge but does not meaningfully alter Elara's tactical options—she could perform this ritual anywhere. Micro-setting strength: the crack in the saucer becomes a charged object that shapes the final image, lifting the score above postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.8)
    The recycled spaceship hull and console are anchored early, and the dimension's "soil that felt alive" and "ruins" provide sensory grounding. Kwan Yin's Tear functions as both object and micro-setting when placed in the ship's core, constraining the portal-opening sequence. However, the "gravitationally lighter when happy" attribute is told ("the ship felt different—gravitationally lighter") without spatial consequence—no floating tools, altered movements, or tactical adjustments appear. The final image shows Elara stepping "back into her ship," but the recycled hull remains postcard description rather than a constraint that shapes her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.4)
    Black sand beach, sulfur scent, volcanic peak, and hidden cove are vivid and consistently tracked. The natural archway frames the celestial alignment, and the bottle is handled across multiple beats. Spatial choreography remains clear (beach to cove to archway). However, the environment does not meaningfully constrain Elara's choices—she walks freely, and the cove discovery feels presented rather than earned through navigational friction. The celestial bodies and volcano loom as backdrop without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.1)
    The fort at twilight, dying torches, and half-painted sundial provide vivid anchors and the sundial's angles constrain Elara's investigative moves. Spatial choreography remains clear when Elara presses against the wall and Thorne emerges. Yet setting details lean descriptive rather than tactical—the blackout creates atmosphere but doesn't force resource trade-offs, and the inhabitants' darkened windows remain backdrop. The bronze quill holder functions as a tool in one beat, meeting the micro-setting criterion modestly.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal bluff and aurora are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("jagged edges kissed by the faint glow," "colors shifting from pale green to deep violet"). The setting constrains Kael's actions (tides, eels' movements) and the aurora's pause during the ritual charges the climactic moment. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The rocks and dust function as micro-setting elements that shape the key action, though the final image doesn't lean heavily on environmental cost.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.1)
    The stormlit observatory supplies vivid atmosphere and the glass dome reflects Elara's shadow at a key beat, creating spatial presence. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elara could perform the same envelope-opening in any isolated space. The storm functions as mood amplifier rather than tactical pressure, missing the micro-setting constraint needed for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.1)
    The glass atrium, brook, and sundial are vividly described with prismatic light and fractured rainbows. The sundial's "coded angles" and the needle card on the pedestal anchor the space with specificity. However, the environment does not constrain a single choice—characters stand and gesture but never use proximity, angles, or tools to alter tactics. Sensory hierarchy and POV filter are weak; the setting reads as backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rusted library is vividly anchored (iron gates, dust, sagging shelves, rooftop view) and recurs across beats. The coffee tin's "dented and worn" surface and "secret false bottom" are concrete, though the tin itself does not constrain a choice—it delivers letters, not pressure. Sensory detail is selective (moon clearing skyline, air smelling of dust) but remains postcard-level; the setting does not alter tactics or charge the final image beyond backdrop. Spatial choreography is clean, and the library-as-symbol is consistent, earning mid-band placement.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.1)
    The tidal arbor, floating islands, and flickering compasses create a vivid fantastical setting with purposeful details (weathered bench, ancient projector, beam of sunlight). Sensory selection is competent but leans visual; the arbor's labyrinth and the chamber with the reel are sketched rather than inhabited with tactile constraint. The clock and piano anchor micro-setting but do not constrain a key choice—Elara moves freely through the space without friction. The final image (horizon inviting night, arbor sighing) adds atmospheric charge but remains decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.8)
    The ancient ridge and Grove of Echoes are vividly named but function as postcard backdrops; blooms "opening and closing" with her heartbeat is decorative rather than constraining. Spatial choreography is clear (ascent to peak, return to village). The crescent moon and moss bed provide concrete staging for the key beat. The seed's physical warmth is noted but does not alter a choice. Sensory selection is broad (air, blooms, light) without urgency-driven filtering or POV bias.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.7)
    Setting detail is vivid and purposeful: damp earth, salt air, jagged rocks, weathered cottage, and the hidden cove all guide Elias's path and pressure the journey. The compass and lace pattern function as micro-objects that constrain choice (needle settles, pattern whispers instructions). The breezy islet after rain charges the final atmosphere, and the cerulean glow at sunset colors the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean. However, the setting does not block or complicate Elias's choices; it facilitates them, reducing the sense of environmental resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    The orchard setting actively guides choices by shifting to reveal the guardian, with sensory details like shimmering fruit and rare spices filtering through Elara's POV. The environment constrains her path and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is vividly specific ("midnight glade above clouds," "crystalline leaves") and actively pressures choices—the glade's "choking beauty" and the saucer's crack constrain Elara's actions and charge the closure. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (e.g., "shadows that whispered"), with the saucer functioning as a micro-setting that evolves meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting elements like the recycled spaceship and Kwan Yin's Tear constrain choices and charge the final image, with selective sensory details (e.g., humming engines, cool tear surface) filtered through Elara's POV. The dimension's scarred ruins mirror internal states, and micro-setting objects actively shape outcomes.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    The black sand beach and volcano create a vivid, sensory-rich atmosphere that pressures Elara's journey, with the cove and archway constraining her path. The bottled lightning bugs recur and charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ test by altering the closure. Details are selective and purposeful, filtered through her POV.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vividly woven into action, with the fort's twilight atmosphere and blackout pressuring Elara's choices. The sundial and quill holder function as micro-settings that constrain tactics and charge the final image, avoiding generic description.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tidal bluff and aurora are vividly specific, constraining choices through the rocks and eels, and charging the final image with the new pattern. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail, e.g., "stormlit observatory" and "ticking timer," mirroring internal states and constraining choices. The observatory's isolation and storm's fury charge the final image, while objects like the envelope function as micro-setting. Spatial choreography is coherent, and details are filtered through Elara's POV. Economy of detail supports momentum without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the glass atrium and brook weaving sensory detail into action. The sundial and needle card constrain choices and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.2)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse is vividly established—the shattered glass, brackish soil, and skeletal frame create a strong atmosphere of post-catastrophe decay. Details like damp soil and broken panes integrate with her experiments, turning the space into a literal and thematic canvas. However, the environment rarely constrains concrete choices; it mostly mirrors her thematic preoccupations rather than altering what she can or must do. The recurring greenhouse imagery does charge the final transformation moment, but more as echo than as active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.0)
    The canyon, frost, and bioluminescent grotto are vividly rendered, with sensory choices that match Elara’s artistic eye. The environment occasionally informs action (reading frost patterns, the hidden caches and kiln) rather than serving as mere backdrop. Still, the setting rarely constrains her choices under pressure; the land feels accommodating rather than resistant. The final image of stars and canyon does help charge the closing sense of belonging, but more tactical interplay with the space would deepen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    The winterglass conservatory and frosted world are vividly rendered and sensorially specific, with details like veins in plants and frozen-waterfall panes. Setting is integrated with mood—sanctuary against desolation—and the dawn through winterglass helps charge the final moment. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics or forces choices; it’s more backdrop than active pressure. As a result, atmosphere is strong but not fully exploited structurally.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    The underwater library and drowned city are vivid, with strong images (seaweed-choked aisles, warped shelves, reinforced windows holding back fathoms of water) that support tone and concept. The setting meaningfully shapes the story—impossible spaces, hidden fragments, and the sense of pressure from the ocean outside—but rarely constrains specific on-page choices beyond mood. The recurring object-as-setting (the lens and lantern light in this submerged archive) charges the final image effectively. A bit more tactile interaction with the environment during the search phase would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.0)
    The terra-cotta arbor, ridge, lanterns, and cracked tiles provide a plausible, gently atmospheric frame, and the silver bell functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. Details are selective and not overdone, maintaining clarity and tone. However, the environment rarely constrains action or meaningfully alters options; it mostly serves as backdrop and symbolic stage. The sanctions-world is gestured at rather than textured in lived, sensorial ways.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Twilight Viaduct in Bloom and its wisteria-draped iron are vivid and sensorially rich, with setting details (hidden compartment, alcove, statue) directly driving plot. Atmosphere—twilight, blossoms, scent, damp stone—supports the liminal, spiritual tone without confusing spatial logic. The environment constrains action in a meaningful way: the path of sparks along the viaduct leads to the alcove and Kwan Yin. A slight excess of lush description risks purple prose but does not seriously impede clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The living bridge garden and hedge maze are vividly rendered with concrete sensory detail (damp earth, rustling leaves, breathing arches) and a coherent fantastical logic. Setting and atmosphere strongly support tone and theme—nature as a living temporal fabric—but mostly as backdrop and ritual space rather than an active constraint on her choices. The pedestal clearing and vortex are especially effective images that feel of-a-piece with the world. Strong, if more evocative than functionally determinative.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    The abandoned carnival is vividly rendered—the creaking Ferris wheel, faded banners, redemption booth—and it meaningfully shapes tactics (labyrinthine layout for evasion, hidden bench, floorboards concealing the vault). The environment’s decay mirrors the depleted world and contrasts with the living potential of the vault. However, sensory range stays mostly visual and atmospheric rather than fully tactile under stress, and the setting could constrain physical choice more tightly in the climax. Overall it’s an asset and feels integrated rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse, shipwreck ring, aurora, and ashen forge are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Elara’s synesthetic perception, giving the piece a clear atmospheric signature. Setting is not mere backdrop: the shipwrecks supply the “absences” she needs and reappear conceptually at the end as “monuments to resilience,” charging the final image. The forge and aurora at the climax concretely stage her encounter with the sound. A slight excess of evocative detail edges toward decorative at moments, but it rarely stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    The emerald station, moonlight, and frozen clock face create a distinct, moody backdrop and consistent atmosphere. The glowing jar and flower arrangement are specific and visually striking, and the final image of jar-light over the station pays off that ambience. Still, the environment rarely constrains action or tactics; the tower could be almost anywhere high and abandoned without much change in the mechanics. The piece relies heavily on visual description, with other senses and lived-in texture comparatively thin.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    The abandoned control room and melting ice are vividly evoked and carry tonal weight, and the glassblower’s tools feel tactile and specific. The setting and recurring objects (especially the bookmark and spheres) strongly charge the final image, even if the physical environment doesn’t heavily constrain her choices. Their integration through the piece gives a cohesive atmosphere that supports the introspective mode.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.6)
    The “rusted library under the stars” is vivid and sensorial, with iron beams, rust, old paper, and starlight creating a strong, cohesive atmosphere that mirrors her internal decay/awakening. The space evolves slightly—stacks to cast-table to locked back door to mirror room—adding visual variety and thematic echo. However, the environment mostly serves as mood rather than a concrete constraint on choices; it rarely forces or redirects tactics. Even so, the setting’s specificity and recurrence give the final image a tangible backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.3)
    The fort, storm, dimming sky, and tactile booklet are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through the oracle’s attention (“the fort itself seemed to listen,” “ambered hush”). Atmosphere is rich and coherent, and recurring environmental details (the last star, the storm, the humming walls) productively echo inner stakes. However, the setting seldom constrains action or creates tactical pressure; it’s more backdrop and resonance engine than active shaper of choice. This keeps the work just shy of top-tier for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.5)
    The frozen courtyard, twilight, and ice-crystal violin are vividly rendered and sustain a consistent, hushed atmosphere. The violin, especially, works as a charged object that frames both the entry into and exit from the transcendence. Most of the detail is visual; other senses and tactile constraints are underused, and the courtyard doesn’t significantly shape choices. Still, the setting feels more than a white room and supports the mood and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.5)
    The crystal forecourt after rain, petrichor, and humming crystals create a distinctive, immersive atmosphere that’s carried through to the ending (“The crystals whispered their approval”). Setting details are filtered through Elara’s mood and help externalize her inner quiet, tentativeness, and desire for clarity. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain action, but the recurring crystals and the lens do charge the final image. Overall, specificity and tonal fit are strong without becoming over-elaborate.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    The estate garden and maze are well-anchored and atmospherically strong, and the maze structure meaningfully frames his ritual of walking to the center. The marbles and foliage interact nicely in the “tiny rainbows” image, and the environment clearly charges the final image. Still, much of the setting is gestured at in broad terms (“labyrinth of lush greenery”) rather than concretely inhabited through tactile, sensory specifics tied to his work. A little more lived-in physicality under pressure would bring it into top-tier territory.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.0)
    The xenobiology station, twilight sky, and bioluminescent winged creatures create a distinct, atmospheric backdrop with coherent spatial anchors. Details like the humming nexus, observation windows, and holographic displays are well-integrated into Elara’s work, not just static description. However, the xenobiology angle and the alien ecosystem mostly serve mood rather than constraining choices or tactics—only the creatures’ stirring lightly echoes the station’s turmoil. Strong mood work, modest functional integration.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    The flooded opera house, silt, flickering lanterns, and rippling water are vivid and recurrent, with the environment responding to the melody (lanterns brightening, water rippling) in a way that meaningfully charges the climax. Details are filtered through Clara’s musical sensibility, which keeps them thematically aligned with silence and sound. Still, the setting rarely constrains tactics beyond ankle-deep water; she doesn’t have to work around the ruin in concrete ways. The atmosphere is strong and coherent, even if not fully exploited for pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.0)
    The mountain weather station is vividly evoked through sensory detail (metal frame, aging beams, ozone, gusts of wind) and functions as a liminal, edge-of-the-world space that mirrors Elara’s epistemic margins. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, but it does shape the mood and thematics of isolation, altitude, and thin air where “the world felt closer to unraveling.” The botanical illustration, as a micro-setting/object, is well integrated into that environment. Overall, atmosphere is strong and purposeful rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vividly realized with damp earth, rust, frozen machinery, and spectral shadows, and the tunnel/factory environment meaningfully shapes what can happen (following sounds deeper, discovering the machinery, using the valve). Sensory specificity is strong, especially visually and texturally, and generally filtered through Mara’s goal-focused attention. The ghost chamber at the heart of the tunnel nicely mirrors the “frozen in time” theme of the trapped workers. While atmospheric, the details lean familiar for the genre and don’t quite achieve singular distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The overgrown library, catacombs, river, and obsidian refuge are vividly drawn and tonally coherent, with concrete images like vines “embracing ancient tomes” and the refuge absorbing light. Setting works thematically, mirroring impermanence and buried knowledge, and it meaningfully charges the final image when she returns to the same library now reinterpreted. The environment doesn’t much constrain physical choices—her journey through the catacombs is more atmospheric than tactical—but it does shape psychological stakes. Overall, the world feels specific and lived-in without lapsing into tourist-catalog description.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sage Ridge, the glowing grass, and “dreaming roots” create a consistent, lyrical atmosphere that supports the story’s quiet magic. The eclipse and meadow are integrated into action (where she walks, where they stand, how the light behaves) rather than feeling like postcard description. Still, the environment mainly mirrors mood rather than constraining options; the same emotional beat could almost occur in any quiet natural space.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    The reclaimed silo library, “bronze quiet,” and tactile objects (tapestry, scrolls, rusted panel) create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s strongly filtered through the premise. The space is specific enough to be memorable and anchors the story quickly. While the environment doesn’t seriously constrain Elara’s options, the final image of the library humming and lit recharges the opening mood effectively. A slightly tighter link between physical layout and what she can or cannot do in the ritual would raise this further.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.0)
    The Chinatown kitchen at midnight is a solid, if lightly sketched, anchor; details like the clatter of dishes and hum of the refrigerator help. The lighthouse on the rocky island is evocative but more archetypal symbol than place with constraints—weather, access, danger never materialize as concrete pressures. Setting is mostly backdrop and metaphor rather than an active shaper of choice. Still, the recurrence of kitchen and lighthouse does create a coherent atmospheric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.0)
    The “dimensional anchor” and resonant silence create a distinctive, coherent atmosphere that suits the metaphysical conflict. Details like “muffled clarity,” “voids between existence,” and black paint in air are vivid if abstract. The setting, however, rarely constrains action beyond mood—it doesn’t force tactical choices so much as provide a thematic backdrop. Strong tone and imagery, but not fully leveraged as a pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, and mirrored horizon are vividly rendered and integral to the story’s atmosphere; the frozen lake as a literal mirror elegantly underpins the thematic motif. The nautilus shell and crystal harp are specific, tactile anchors that recur and charge the final image. Environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, but it does conceptually shape what’s possible (this is clearly a place designed for this ritual). Overall, setting is a major strength, though more interaction with the harshness or constraints of the environment could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.0)
    The opening viaduct and rain-soaked city are vivid and sensory, and the glowing structure provides a nice visual metaphor for branching timelines. However, the setting mostly frames rather than constrains action: Elara’s choices and risks would be similar in almost any liminal or elevated location. The world’s rules (glow, tablet resonance, timeline fractals) are consistent enough to feel intentional, and the final return to the whole viaduct gives a satisfying atmospheric bookend. Still, the environment rarely affects tactics or imposes concrete limits.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cavern, torches, drums, and phonograph create a vivid, tactile environment strongly filtered through a deaf character who feels sound as vibration rather than hearing it. Setting is not a postcard; the cavern’s resonance and isolation directly support her method and internal state, and she returns to it in the final image to claim a personal rhythm. Environmental and object details (needle, records, drumhead) are well integrated into action and theme. The “turning seasons” add a gentle temporal and atmospheric layer without confusing the geography or rules.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.3)
    The courtyard, industrial wasteland, and quarantine compound are all clearly sketched with some sensory texture (damp earth, rusted factories, hum of machinery), giving a serviceable sense of place. Setting mostly functions as backdrop rather than as a constraint on tactics or behavior; the storm and environment rarely corner Elias into specific choices. The strongest use is the courtyard as a framing space that accrues thematic weight by the end, but this too is more conceptual than tactile. Overall, atmosphere is competent but not especially distinctive or integrated with the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.4)
    The shop, city edge, and especially the scented spaces (greenhouse of extinct plants, antiseptic hospital, jasmine-filled yard) are vivid and sensorially persuasive, with details filtered through Elias’s sensitivity to smell. The lantern shop and “crystal shadows” provide a coherent atmospheric frame that returns in the ending image. However, the environments mostly serve as evocative backdrops for memory rather than constraints on choice; they mirror his inner state more than they shape tactics. The world feels textured but not yet uniquely indispensable to the plot beyond the olfactory motif.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    The terra-cotta grotto and the rewritten starlit sky are vividly and consistently rendered, with the shifting patterns nicely mirroring the time-texture theme. The environment participates in meaning through the arches’ designs, the alcove, and the responsive “listening” walls. Still, the grotto serves more as resonant container than active constraint; it frames his realization rather than forcing a concrete tactical choice. Strong atmosphere, just short of truly indispensable, choice-shaping setting.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and particular—the sunken orchard greenhouse, ash, fractured glass, and surrounding shipwrecks create a strong atmosphere that clearly mirrors loss and stubborn beauty. Environmental details (creaking shipwrecks, humming greenhouse, ashen soil) are integrated into the musical and narrative act rather than sitting as postcard description. The place charges the final image but doesn’t fully constrain tactics, keeping this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    The amber grotto at dusk is vividly evoked through light, scent, and mineral presence, and the environment is consistently filtered through Elara’s sensory and professional bias. Setting details (amber light, metallic tang, thick grotto air) support the mood and mirror the liminal emotional work she’s doing. The grotto, however, functions more as atmosphere than constraint: it doesn’t significantly alter tactics or force a particular choice beyond supplying an evocative workspace. This is strong, economical atmosphere rather than setting-as-pressure, which keeps it below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    The settings—the concert hall, the salt-and-pine night, and especially the “breezy library under stars”—are vivid and pleasant, giving the piece a clear, gentle atmosphere. Details like the open roof and sea air help tone more than they shape decisions. Environment rarely constrains options or exerts pressure; it mainly provides a lyrical backdrop for reflection and connection. The recurring library location at least anchors both Elara’s solitary and shared moments, lending some spatial coherence to the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    The crystalline orchard and crater edge are vividly drawn and consistently refract Lira’s inner state, particularly the “luminescent ache” and the pulsing obsidian arbor. Details feel particular rather than generic SF/fantasy window-dressing. The arbor’s recurring presence and its final reappearance as a charged image effectively anchor the ending. The environment’s constraints remain more symbolic than tactical, so it enriches mood and theme rather than shaping concrete choices.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.5)
    The rooftop canal system, towering city, and subterranean cavern are vividly sketched and consistently filtered through Mara’s sensibility. The pendant and the pool of still water function as charged environmental anchors that frame the journey and closure image. However, the setting mostly serves as atmosphere and conduit rather than as a constraining force—nothing in the environment meaningfully endangers or obstructs her. Strong specificity, but the world could shape choices more aggressively to reach a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cavern orchard is vividly rendered—stalactite drips, glowing fruit, mosaics—and the environment recurs rather than feeling like a one-off backdrop. The setting is meaningfully tied to action: the orchard is the laboratory and sanctuary, the mosaics and roots hide the clues, and the final image of the brightening orchard charges the thematic shift. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain options (she isn’t forced into or limited by it in crisis), it does shape discovery and infuses mood and symbolism with specificity. The balance of concrete image and integration with plot is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “shadowed library at dawn,” pipe chases, and “sapphire hush” are vivid, sensorially specific, and consistently threaded through the piece. Setting and atmosphere are strongly integrated with action—the pipes guide the search, forgotten corners yield fragments, and the hush mirrors the hidden voices in the tape and the dweller. The environment feels lived-in rather than touristic, and it meaningfully charges the final image of retreating shadows and morning light. What’s missing for a higher score is concrete environmental constraint on choice (no locked doors, hazards, or spatial limits that really force tactics).

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.0)
    The nursery, mossy trellis, wet earth, and storm are vividly evoked and integrated into Mara’s perceptions, with the weather mirroring her inner turbulence. Sensory detail is strongest in smell and touch, with the leaf’s warmth and rain on the trellis anchoring emotion. However, the setting rarely constrains options or tactics—it mainly reflects and amplifies mood. The trellis framing first and last paragraphs adds a nice spatial echo but remains more symbolic than operative.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and specific—“parched lands and reclaimed seas,” bioluminescent algae, the impossible geometry of the ruin, and the tidal island all contribute a strong, cohesive atmosphere. Details are generally filtered through Elara’s perception and mood, integrating worldbuilding with her restlessness. While the environment rarely constrains concrete choices beyond providing paths and ruins to explore, the island-as-archive and the brooch as object do subtly charge the final image. Overall, the place feels lived-in and tonally aligned with the piece’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    The musical crystal cave is vivid and sensorially anchored, especially through sound and light; the crystal songs, shifting walls, and the pearl’s glow create an evocative atmosphere that fits the premise. The environment does more than decorate—it houses the consciousness Elara merges with and shapes the magical logic. Still, the cave rarely constrains her choices or poses concrete obstacles; it’s more a beautifully rendered vessel for revelation than an active pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    The harbor, rain, cliffs, and wreckage are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Elara’s attention to fragments and patterns. Environmental details (softening sand, seaweed at the cliff base, half-buried hull) integrate with action by guiding her search and the discovery of the carved wood. Weather and sea presence support the elegiac yet hopeful tone without feeling like generic backdrop. The setting also charges the final image as the harbor “exhales,” refiguring space from ruin to potential.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.0)
    The misty town, abandoned station, starlit vault, and shimmering fortress are clearly and often evocatively rendered, giving the story a consistent, slightly fable-like atmosphere. Details like mist “curling around her ankles” and mirrors reflecting past scenes integrate setting with the emotional arc. However, the environment rarely constrains her choices; it decorates rather than pressures, and the rules of the world (e.g., shifting symbols, moving pavement) remain abstract tools of wonder. Strong mood, moderate functional integration.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    The coastal village, whales, and tower are evocative and give the story a tangible, if familiar, atmosphere; the image of whales breaching in synchrony with constellations is the strongest. The tower and sea are used more as poetic backdrop and magical conduit than as constraints on choice or movement. Sensory detail is primarily visual and aurally suggestive (the “unheard symphony”) but could lean more into tactile or environmental pressure. Overall, the setting is clear and pleasant but not yet doing maximal narrative or thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    The “prismatic escondite” and its kaleidoscopic light, along with the solar storm, create a vivid, unified atmosphere and a clear speculative locus. Imagery like “colors twisted into chaotic patterns” gives the setting some emotional mirroring of Elyr’s internal state. Yet the environment rarely constrains tactics or options; it’s more stage than active pressure. The final image doesn’t meaningfully reweight the setting elements, so they remain textural rather than structurally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.3)
    The funeral home prep room is vividly sketched—the marble table, formaldehyde smell, flickering lights—and the “deathly vitality” idea is echoed by the rebirth of Clara’s stance. The vintage ink pot serves as a micro-setting object that channels atmosphere into the character’s interior shift. That said, the environment doesn’t materially constrain choices; they could largely have the same conversation in many back rooms. The specificity is strong but more tonal than tactically integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.5)
    The bonsai labyrinth, mountaintop, and town below are vivid and specific, with sensory detail that fits the contemplative mode. The environment supports tone and concept (the forest “amplifying” the hum, gifting a story) and recurs meaningfully at the end as she descends. However, the setting rarely constrains or complicates her choices; it is more atmosphere than active pressure or resource. Strong, lyrical worldbuilding that stops short of fully instrumental integration.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific—“towering labyrinth of shipping containers,” cranes, tides, mudflats, relics—and consistently filtered through the wanderer’s sensibility. Environmental details like high/low tide and the container maze are well integrated into the texture of discovery, especially in the mudflat artifacts and the hidden alcove. The special container marked with a faded symbol effectively becomes a charged micro-setting that anchors the turning point. However, the environment rarely constrains concrete choices under pressure; it’s more evocative backdrop than active obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    The observatory on the cliff, the sea, and the half-finished cello create a vivid, coherent atmosphere woven through action rather than static description. Sensory details (wind, salt, dust, old wood) are selective and purposeful, supporting the liminal, haunted tone. The seashell and observatory both feed the final image of the place as sanctuary. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain her choices, so it’s more mood than pressure, but at a high level of execution.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.0)
    The raft city—“patchwork of barges,” “perpetual carnival,” Cerulean Sea—offers a vivid, specific atmosphere that feels lived-in and tonally apt. The setting supports theme (precarious, floating, susceptible to gentrification) more than it constrains concrete choices, which remain mostly independent of physical geography or weather. The foundation stone chip and graffiti are the most effective micro-setting elements, returning to charge the final image. Overall, description is selective and evocative, but could more directly shape tactics to reach a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lunar summit, regolith, module remains, and approaching dawn are vividly and consistently rendered and clearly anchored early. The environment meaningfully charges the images of preservation (footprints, module, “untouched remnants”) and the final dawn photograph, though it rarely constrains physical options in a concrete way. The hourglass sand grain as micro-object and the shifting light at dawn both support the mood and thematic frame. Description is purposeful and rarely lapses into generic “space” imagery, but the setting could pressure choices more directly to reach the highest band.

    The mist-coated rail depot, scent of oil and iron, and the water features with refracted light create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels lived-in and specific to Elara’s way of perceiving. Environmental details (mist, anchor, crowd, trains) are threaded through action and interiority, not parked in static description, and the water features directly relate to her method of “seeing.” The anchor/ship imagery gives the setting thematic weight in the final comparison between the ship’s departure and her shop as an “anchor of its own.” The setting could do more to constrain choices, but it already meaningfully charges the tone and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rusted outpost, frozen lake, condensation on glass, and fissure in the ice are vivid, selective details that shape both mood and outcome. Environment directly constrains discovery—the hidden current under the ice and the mist line are how she finds the river’s source. The setting also mirrors the thematic tension between mapped order and hidden origins without feeling over-explained. This is a strong, purposeful use of place, even if not quite astonishing.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.5)
    The ghost town, archway, cobblestones, and bell tower create a strong, coherent atmosphere with selective, moody detail. The “faint scent of pine,” “crumbling under the weight of neglect,” and the slowly sharpening carvings all support the tone and the revival motif. The environment, however, mostly serves as backdrop and symbol rather than an active constraint on choice or movement. Even so, the setting is vivid and integrated enough to be one of the piece’s strongest elements.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.0)
    The underwater temple, carvings, and crystal chamber form a coherent and atmospheric setting that aligns with the story’s mood. However, details skew generic and heavily visual; there’s little sense of pressure from depth, water, cold, or equipment that would shape her choices as a marine biologist. The environment transforms (“walls shifting and changing”) but mostly as an abstract magical response rather than a tactically navigated space. The temple supports tone and premise but rarely constrains action in specific, felt ways.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, and copper-lit chamber are vivid and coherently imagined, giving the piece a strong, moody atmosphere. The confessional lattice and glowing ore feel particular rather than generic, and the environment fits the mythic tone. However, the setting rarely constrains tactics beyond providing a staircase and a pedestal; the reef and storm-battered walls don’t materially affect choice. The final outdoor moment gestures toward setting-charged freedom, but the environment’s pressure could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.0)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse, endless night, and winter-cracked fields create a vivid, unified atmosphere that’s strongly tied to her condition (prison/anchor vs outside frozen fields). The ancient tree and bead under its roots are well-integrated micro-settings that both embody and constrain her haunting. Environmental detail generally arrives through her relationship to the place rather than neutral description, and the final threshold image meaningfully reweights the setting. A slightly broader sensory range (beyond primarily visual/olfactory mood) could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.5)
    The labyrinth in red canyon walls, the relics, and the “gallery of orchid solace” create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that clearly frames the action. Sensory and imagistic choices (earth and time scent, glowing walls, tide-emptied landscape) feel selective and tonally aligned. That said, the setting rarely constrains choice or forces concrete tactics; it is more canvased backdrop than active pressure. Its strongest work is in charging the final image of a transformed, glowing labyrinth that now embodies the stories.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid and specific—roots threading through bones, a sundial half-buried in soil, and a chamber mural that meaningfully charges the final realization. Setting is well integrated into action: the roots “guiding” her and the sundial base physically keying the tomb are concrete uses, not just atmosphere. The tone of life braided with death supports the thematic work around continuity and faith. A bit more sensory variety and environmental constraint on choices (beyond mystical guidance) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    The golden arcade at dawn, chalk drawings, and the red-flag mailbox are concrete and atmospheric, creating a convincing old/new collision. Setting is well-integrated into action (she kneels to the chalk, walks to the edge to reach the mailbox) and supports the nostalgic tone. However, the environment rarely constrains options or imposes pressure; it colors the story more than it shapes tactics. The ebony clipboard and dawn light recur but stop short of truly charging the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt observatory, glass dome, autumn wind, and eternal candle create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels particular rather than generic. The observatory as a “nexus” and the flame as an anchor give the setting story-level relevance beyond décor. Physical interaction with the environment is modest—this is more backdrop than constraint—but the recurring flame meaningfully charges the final image. Sensory detail and tone are well chosen for the calm, occult mood.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mangrove labyrinth and singing spirits are vivid, sensorially specific, and integrated with mood and theme, from “roots twisted like ancient fingers” to moonlight pooled like silver. Environment subtly shapes her route (roots “guiding her,” clearing, grove, pedestal) and the shard and moonlight function as charged objects that carry into the final image. The world rules are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition. The setting enhances atmosphere and resonance more than it concretely constrains tactical choices, which keeps it short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mist-clad atrium, damp earth, jasmine, and the bombed-out aquarium relic create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that matches the story’s grief and tenuous hope. Setting details are filtered through Elara’s sensibility and recur meaningfully, especially the coral’s glow and the mist’s “held breath” cadence. The environment doesn’t physically constrain choices but it strongly charges the emotional stakes and the final threshold image. It feels specific and lived-in rather than generic war rubble.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ruined orchard district, fog, fresco, stone table, and cavernous chamber are all vividly evoked, and the fog-as-canvas concept is an excellent image that charges the final scene. Setting is integrated into action (fog revealing the path, serving as projection medium), not just backdrop. Some details remain safely atmospheric rather than constraining choices—the orchard itself and “centuries of thick fog” are more mood than active pressure. Still, the environment plays a meaningful role in the climax, especially the fog as living canvas.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sound wave garden, metallic flowers, and humming murals are vivid and consistently integrated into action rather than feeling like backdrop. Sound as a quasi-physical environmental force (harmonizing waves, Elara humming along) does some work in shaping what’s possible. The rules of this world (sound awakens art; echoes carry voices) are suggested through events without heavy exposition. The setting could constrain choices even more sharply, but as-is it strongly charges the atmosphere and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    The entomologist’s greenhouse is vivid—“damp earth and jasmine,” the drone of insects, glass and steel, fogged panes—giving a tangible atmosphere. Details feel plausibly filtered through Elias’s urgency, with the seed and workbench emerging naturally from his search. However, the environment seldom constrains or redirects action; it sets mood more than it shapes tactics or choice. The final image returns to the greenhouse in a quiet way, but it doesn’t significantly reweight the stakes beyond “secrets safe for now.”

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    The gargantuan shell is vividly and consistently evoked—spirals, chambers, wind—and it shapes mood and metaphor nicely, even becoming “a character in her story.” The setting coheres and evolves across the piece, culminating in her stepping out of it, which charges the final image. However, many details remain atmospheric rather than tactically specific; we don’t often see her physically negotiating the shell in ways that constrain options. The postcard functions as a micro-setting/object with some charge, but interactions with it are more symbolic than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    The opal library, glass orchids, clouds, and the museum of extinct feelings create a vivid, coherent fantastical environment that’s strongly filtered through Elara’s caretaking perspective. Setting is more than backdrop: the artifacts and the Vessel of Echoes directly shape what she can do and what’s at risk. However, the environment rarely constrains her options or tactics; it mostly mood-paints rather than exerting pressure. The recurring objects (wind chime, Vessel, orchids) do charge the final image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    The extinct language archive is vividly evoked (“dust motes,” “labyrinthine shelves”) and clearly anchored as the locus of both magic and memory. Details feel filtered through an arcane linguist’s sensibility, which helps the environment double as a reflection of her inner world. The inkwell as a charged object is effectively embedded in the setting and directly involved in the climax. However, the archive rarely constrains options or tactics; it’s more atmospheric than actively pressuring her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    The crumbling amphitheater within a dormant volcano is vivid and sensorial (“thick with the scent of damp stone,” “amphitheater seemed to breathe”), and the environment tracks consistently. The chain, cracks, and faintly glowing walls form a coherent micro-setting that echoes the theme of fractures and alignment. Setting does exert some soft pressure—Elias moving toward “the heart of the volcano” and the breathing walls mirroring his rising stakes—but it doesn’t significantly constrain tactics beyond mood. Still, for this length, the specificity and integration of environment with atmosphere are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    The attic of the vintage bookshop is vivid and specific—skylight, dust motes, yellowed manuscripts, pigeons, meteorite—and repeatedly returns as a charged micro-world. Environment and objects are not mere backdrop: the skylight and dust enable the mapping method, the attic is sanctuary-turned-laboratory, and the meteorite chip charges the final contemplative posture. Sensory detail is selective and attuned to Elara’s obsessions. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, it meaningfully shapes the story’s emotional and conceptual field.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.5)
    The drifting prism terrace is vividly rendered with selective, evocative detail (“sky fractured by light,” “glass groaning softly”) and the “fractured hush” supports tone. The setting meaningfully mirrors the thematic concern with fractured time and thresholds, though it rarely constrains her choices beyond being a mystical site of convergence. Environmental details are integrated into action and interiority rather than dumped. For a higher score, the terrace itself would need to more directly shape or limit what Elara can do at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.0)
    The underwater research facility and its cracked glass domes, algae, and bioluminescent sea life create a vivid, distinctive atmosphere tightly tied to Elara’s perceptions. Setting isn’t mere backdrop: the viewport, surrounding darkness, and external pressure physically and symbolically shape her experience and the looming danger. Details like “stars trapped in a jar” and “shadowseam wonder” sharpen mood without losing spatial clarity. The environment does influence choice via the failing domes and escape pod, though those constraints could be even more tactically felt for top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.0)
    The iridescent cave and geode are vividly rendered, with color and light choices that mirror the story’s mood, and the crater glass is spatially and texturally clear. Setting details are integrated into Lira’s perception rather than dumped, and the “cheerful gloom” of the space meaningfully supports theme. However, the environment rarely constrains her options or tactics; it remains mostly atmospheric rather than an active pressure on choice. As a result, the setting enriches tone more than it shapes narrative necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tidal arcade under a glass ceiling is vivid, and details like the starlight through the central skylight directly charge the climax image of the bishop. Setting and atmosphere are tightly tied to tone—urban hum versus celestial quiet—and the environment frames Elias’s philosophy well. The final sense that “the arcade under the stars felt a little less ordinary” shows the place subtly altered in meaning. It stops short of fully constraining choices, but it does strong thematic and imagistic work.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    The twilight garden is vividly rendered (“obsidian grace,” midnight and silver flowers, petals like pages) and atmospherically supports the illicit, liminal act. Setting details are consistently filtered through Lira’s perception and echo the themes of memory and forbidden past. While the garden doesn’t strongly constrain tactics beyond isolation and secrecy, it does meaningfully charge the final image (flowers whispering “fledge”). The world rules (nostalgia ban, moonstone dust) feel internally consistent at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pearl Bay at dawn, the mist, the pond, and especially the glass atrium are sensorially clear and visually appealing, and they feel consistent with Elias’s vocation and worldview. Setting is tied to action (throwing the stone, entering the atrium, the mist clearing), so it’s more than a white-room backdrop. Still, the environment rarely constrains his options or introduces concrete pressures; it mainly amplifies mood and theme rather than shaping choice.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.5)
    The moonlit ridge, charred oak, and porcelain box are rendered with strong, consistent atmosphere that supports the contemplative, almost mythic tone. The moonlight and ridge return in the ending image to charge his transformation, and the scarred landscape silently echoes his internal damage. However, the environment rarely constrains or enables concrete choices; Elias could undergo much the same realization almost anywhere quiet and isolated. The setting works more as poetic backdrop than an active pressure, keeping it below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.0)
    The tide-polished grotto is vivid and specific, with “walls shimmered with centuries of oceanic caress” and the encroaching tide physically interacting with her patterns. Setting is well-integrated into action: the rising water repeatedly threatens and erases her designs, shaping how she works and underscoring impermanence. The recurring object (altitude gauge) and the environment both charge the final image, tying ascent/measurement to inner journey. A slightly wider sensory range beyond sight and touch could deepen atmosphere further, but what’s here is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the ivy-veiled passage, waterfall, moss, and fireplace with half-burned diaries all build a coherent, tactile atmosphere that matches the story’s preoccupations with memory and erosion. Environmental details are filtered through her attention as a cartographer of echoes, which keeps them purposeful rather than touristic. The passage and hidden chamber also shape action (narrowing walls, dead end, secret door), not just mood. The “after climate shifts” detail is the only note that feels under-integrated into the environment’s functioning.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    The terrace, prism parapet, mirrors, spring air, and bells create a vivid, coherent environment that strongly supports mood and concept. Details like light through wet glass and echoing space feel purposeful and recur, with the terrace becoming a “sanctuary” and the parapet shimmering in the final image. The setting charges the tone and theme more than it constrains concrete choices, so it reads as highly effective atmosphere rather than fully tactical environment. Nonetheless, its specificity and integration with the ending image are notable strengths.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and sensorially grounded—the jasmine, terrace, valley of campfires, and celestial imagery establish a strong atmosphere that fits the quasi-mythic tone. The terrace’s history as a site of treaties and the ebony clipboard function as recurring objects that charge the opening and closing images. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics or creates practical obstacles; it is more sacred backdrop than active pressure. Still, it effectively mirrors the thematic concerns of legacy, repetition, and fragile peace.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    The salt flat is vividly rendered (“shimmered like a cracked mirror,” crystalline surface, damp earth beneath the salt) and coherently anchored in space. Environmental details (cracks as map, hidden damp patch, approaching rain) are meaningfully integrated with action and theme rather than postcard description. Weather and terrain subtly shape her route and the discovery of the sanctuary, though they don’t fully corner her into hard tactical trade-offs. The final rain washing the salt away nicely charges the closing image without feeling overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    The silver courtyard, snow, and prism sanctuary are vividly and consistently realized, with strong visual specificity and an atmosphere that supports the piece’s lyrical mode. Setting is well integrated into action (threads humming, door glowing, snow “pausing” to listen) rather than static description. The final image of snowflakes carrying fragments of echoes nicely charges the environment with thematic meaning. However, the environment rarely constrains or complicates Elara’s choices; it frames mood more than it shapes tactics, which limits the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    The decommissioned radar dome is vividly rendered and thematically apt, with the obsolete machinery and cracked windows mirroring his sense of disused purpose. The campfire story stick functions as a recurring object that subtly charges the reflective beats and final image. However, the environment doesn’t significantly constrain or redirect his options; it’s more an atmospheric echo than an active pressure. Description is selective and integrated rather than touristic, which keeps the mood cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.0)
    The grotto above the clouds, the vines, moss, light, and wings are rendered with strong sensory specificity and a consistent, dreamy atmosphere. Details are filtered through Elara’s sensibility, so environment and objects carry thematic weight (fragility, transformation, absence). The moth and monarch wings especially charge the final image, even if the physical setting itself doesn’t materially constrain action. Overall, the piece achieves a distinctive, immersive atmosphere that feels intentional and unified with the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    The icebound sanctum and aurora are vividly rendered and tonally cohesive, with strong sensory anchoring in cold, light, and the carved glacier walls. The rope as a centuries-old ceremonial object and the hint of pine scent add specificity that suits the piece’s lyric aspirations. However, the environment rarely constrains action or introduces concrete obstacles; it’s more cathedral-backdrop than active pressure. The final aurora flare nicely charges the last image but still feels more decorative than determinative of choices.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The vine-draped bunker, rewilded forest, and storm are vividly rendered and tonally aligned, with good visual texture. The bunker-as-mind parallel and the storm as a heartbeat drum nicely against the abstract work. Yet the environment rarely constrains action or forces different choices; it’s more evocative backdrop than functional pressure. The wafer seal carries some micro-setting charge, but could be pushed further as a tool that limits or enables tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.2)
    The Babylonian palace, courtyard schematic, and observatory provide a clear spatial frame, but they remain broadly sketched, relying on generalized grandeur rather than sharply selected, lived-in details. “Dusky harmony” and similar phrases set mood yet rarely translate into concrete sensory experience or constraints on action. The environment doesn’t significantly shape his options beyond providing the schematic and the observatory, and could easily be swapped for any ancient temple-like space. As atmosphere, it’s functional but not yet unforgettable or indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.8)
    The “soundless sanctuary” and the hum of shifting realities are evocative, but the setting mostly functions as backdrop rather than a lived environment that constrains or shapes choices. Physical specificity is sparse (marble fountain, velvet music box) and rarely interacted with beyond symbolic pointing. The sanctuary’s reappearing and reality-bending qualities are stated, not dramatized in ways that affect tactics or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ruined orchard, thick fog, frost, and lantern-lit workshop are vivid and consistently integrated into mood and action. The fog in particular is thematically charged, doubling as literal environment and metaphorical boundary that the sextant thins. Setting feels coherent and lived-in without becoming a catalogue, and the orchard’s transformed version in the vision sharpens the final image. The environment does shape the conceptual stakes, though it only lightly constrains physical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    The orchard-in-rafters cathedral is vivid, specific, and consistently threaded through the story in visual, olfactory, and tactile ways. Setting meaningfully shapes the narrative: the altar contains the scroll, the soil receives the petals, and the glowing tree with the ribbon charges the final image. Details feel filtered through Elara’s priorities, reinforcing themes of reclamation and renewal. The environment’s symbolic resonance is strong without becoming confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    The astral orchard on a lonely asteroid is vividly and economically rendered, with strong images like “iridescent petals that shimmered like captured starlight” and the humming blossoms. The crystalline bathroom of mirrors reflecting thoughts adds a nicely specific, surreal micro-setting. These spaces strongly support atmosphere and theme, though they rarely constrain action or meaningfully limit options. The orchard and cameo do charge the final image, but more as backdrop and symbol than as active constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mountain-sized labyrinthine bookstore, moss-bound books, and chrono-blossom garden are vivid and tonally consistent, giving the piece a strong, specific atmosphere. Setting occasionally shapes action (shifting shelves, traps, the garden as threshold), though these pressures are often told rather than experienced in-scene. The environment recurs through to the end with the mountain’s “sigh” and whispered approval, which nicely charges the final image. A bit more tactile, moment-by-moment interaction with the space under stress would move this toward top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    The abandoned carnival ship and foggy bay are vividly evoked with purposeful detail (rusted hull, shattered mirrors, faded posters, ghost-laughter atmosphere) that supports mood. The environment functions as a labyrinth that shapes her path and delivers her to the bow and the mist-door, so it is more than mere backdrop. However, the ship rarely constrains her options or behavior in a concrete, tactical way; it mostly operates as an evocative stage for internal movement. Still, the recurring ship imagery meaningfully charges the liminal, haunting tone.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    The clock tower mechanism room, gears, and ceremonial rope are vividly realized and integrated into action rather than feeling like backdrop. The environment meaningfully constrains and enables choices: the rope and hidden door are spatially and functionally central to the plot. Atmosphere of time, craft, and secrecy supports the theme of absence and recovered stories. Some sensory range beyond sight/sound (e.g., smell, temperature) could deepen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    The harmonic caves are vividly evoked through recurring sensory details—hum, glow, crystalline walls, ancient ice—and feel like a specific, coherent environment rather than a generic fantasy cave. Setting meaningfully interacts with action: the ice veins provide the map, the caves’ hum responds to magic, and the final “chorus of stillness” fuses place with outcome. However, the environment seldom constrains choice or creates tactical dilemmas; Lira essentially moves through a welcoming, if tense, space. Strong atmosphere and integration, but not yet at a level where setting actively pressures decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glass pavilion, edge-of-ruin setting, and telescope are clearly sketched and tied to action—the humming walls and star view are functionally necessary to the plot. Details like dust-dulled glass and the cracked lens give a lived-in, post-collapse atmosphere without overloading description. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical options beyond “this is where the stars can be tracked,” but it does charge the final image when the pavilion vibrates with the shard’s melody. Sensory range is mostly visual and auditory yet effective.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the stormlit observatory, crystalline forecourt, and solidified fog all feel sensuous and integrated rather than decorative. Environment and objects meaningfully shape discovery: the monument shadows and fog wall directly generate the central encounter with memory. Weather and light affect perception (stretching shadows, dawn’s softening) and charge the final ascent back to the observatory. World rules stay internally consistent and are learned through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The blooming fortress, wilting gardens, dry fountain, and starless night create a strong, coherent atmosphere that reflects the emotional state of the people. The fountain as a “forgotten relic” becoming the canvas for fire and mosaic is an effective use of environment to embody transformation. The final image of the fortress turning from dusk to dawn and acting as a beacon directly charges the setting with thematic weight. Some details remain generalized, but overall, place and mood are vividly and purposefully rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    The grotto under star-filtered rock is vividly evoked and tonally congruent with the mystical inquiry into time, and the jade cicada functions as a recurring, charged object within that space. Details like “tidal-pool chronicler” and the light “filtering through the rocky ceiling like a celestial tapestry” create a specific, memorable atmosphere rather than a generic cave. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or tactics; it’s a beautiful backdrop and resonant container rather than an active pressure. The setting does charge the final image (her stepping out of the grotto under the stars), but largely at the level of mood, not stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bunker, trellis above the clouds, and gravity inversion are vividly evoked and integrated with Elara’s perceptions of comfort versus suffocation. The setting supports tone and theme well, especially in the contrast between the “gilded hush” below and the spacious, “alive” silence above. The porcelain doll functions as a micro-setting object that charges a few beats, though the environment could constrain tactics more concretely during the climb. Overall, atmosphere is strong and purposeful without becoming a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drifting prism terrace, floating platforms, prismatic towers, sea of clouds, and garden are vivid and sensorially rich, and the recurring train whistle nicely textures the hush. Setting is well integrated into mood and theme, especially the garden as a space “where they need to hear themselves.” However, the environment rarely constrains choices or introduces real pressure; it’s more backdrop and metaphor than an active shaper of tactics. The storm glass as tool-object approaches micro-setting strength, especially in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    The orchard, kaleidoscopic waterfall, crystalline ground, and bioluminescent cavern are vivid and sensorially specific, giving the piece a strong, distinctive atmosphere. Setting is not just wallpaper: the murals on the wall and the hidden door behind the waterfall actively guide Lira’s path. World rules (ruby flake responding to truth, mural clues) are consistent enough for this length. Some details lean decorative rather than pressure-bearing, but overall the environment is well-realized and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    “Ashen charcoal sanctuary” and starlight filtering through remnants of ancient trees create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that supports the story’s solemn tone. The darkness manifests concretely via “tendrils of shadow,” which helps tie environment to threat. However, the sanctuary remains more mood-piece than functional space; it rarely constrains tactics or offers specific obstacles/resources beyond being something abstractly at risk. Strong lyric texture, but not yet using setting as an active pressure on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm and the concepts-made-physical dimension are vivid and memorable, with strong visual specificity (towers of time, rivers of memory, sky of equations). The bolt, mushrooms, and conceptual chamber recur effectively enough to create a coherent atmosphere. Still, the settings mostly act as backdrop; they rarely constrain choice or tactics beyond “this is where the portal/machine is,” so they feel more scenic than functional. The final image reuses the farm and bolt nicely but doesn’t fully exploit their material constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.5)
    The sepia reading room, golden shadows, and the bridge with “amber and violet” sky create a strong, coherent atmosphere, with details like aged paper, brass, and wooden planks giving texture. These settings are well-filtered through Eleanor’s concerns about legacy and sound, and the gramophone as a tool-object meaningfully anchors action. However, the environments mostly serve mood and symbolism rather than constraining options or tactics in concrete ways. The final image of her back in the room with the handle on the table does nicely echo and charge the opening space.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vivid and sensorial—the nightshade scent, bioluminescent vines, and endless night create a strong atmospheric frame. Crucially, the setting is not mere backdrop: the vines become moving instructions and the environment’s glow and patterns actively mediate his transformation. The final image of a lighter, brighter greenhouse with possibility “taking root” charges the closure in a way that is inseparable from place. A bit of sensory variety beyond the visual and olfactory could deepen embodiment further, but the integration is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    The foster care file room is vividly realized—“smelled of old paper and forgotten promises,” sagging shelves, dust trails—and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Dust, the button, and the ribbon function as a micro-setting ecosystem that charges the atmosphere and the final re-seeing of the room as a “sanctuary of unknown histories.” The environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices but clearly shapes perception and theme. Economy of detail is good: nearly every setting element supports mood or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    The auric lagoon and the submerged archive are vividly rendered and anchored early, with strong sensory detail (emerald and gold hues, algae-encrusted door) and clear spatial logic. The environment actively constrains choices: she must enter the lagoon, find the underwater door, and use the archive’s fixed systems, and the lagoon’s final mention helps charge the closing image. Some atmospheric phrases veer toward fantasy-generic rather than uniquely textured through Mara’s particular sensibility. Overall, setting is a real asset and more than mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is vividly and consistently rendered—the luminescent moss, mist, and prism atrium are sensorially rich and recur with purposeful variation. The environment is not just backdrop; it amplifies his music, responds to it, and the rotating prism beam centers the climax. Rules of this magical grotto feel internally consistent and are learned through his playing rather than exposition. The final image of restored, glowing tranquility is strongly charged by the established space.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.0)
    The ashen skyborne arbor, falling leaves, and tree-libraries are vivid and tonally coherent, with a strong sense of atmosphere. Details feel filtered through Elara’s sensibility, especially in how she reads the leaves and builds seed monuments. However, the environment rarely constrains or complicates her choices; it mostly provides mood and lore rather than active pressure. The setting is memorable but not yet fully instrumental.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    The workshop, neglected greenhouse, and bioluminescent cavern are vividly and economically sketched, with tactile detail like cracked glass, withered plants, and the subterranean waterfall. The compass, map, and environment interlock to create a cohesive atmosphere that supports the fable-like tone. The setting occasionally feels more decorative than constraining—he rarely has to struggle against it—but it still meaningfully frames his journey and final stance. Overall, place and object are well-integrated and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rain-washed foundry and furnace are vividly evoked and recur in ways that mirror Elara’s internal state (from silent, rain-soaked calm to flame and back to cooling moonlight). The environment constrains and shapes action—she must choose to step into the cold iron furnace, and its transformation into a safe-but-intense fire chamber frames the central vision. The sensory details (damp metal, herbs, glistening iron, heat that doesn’t burn) feel purposeful rather than touristic, and the foundry’s “witness” presence in the final paragraph charges the ending image. It stops just short of 9-band because the physical environment never materially endangers or blocks her, serving more as charged backdrop than active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.3)
    Echo Gorge and the “hidden sunrise” are vividly rendered, and the acoustic/echo motif ties neatly to confession and laughter. The setting feels tonally apt and atmospheric, but it rarely constrains options or forces tactical choices; it’s more stage than pressure. The harp and tooth function as micro-setting objects that do charge the final image. Overall specificity is good, if sometimes leaning toward generalized lyricism rather than grounded, tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ultraviolet forest is vivid and sensorially specific, with glowing trees, pulsing bark, and the UV stream all clearly filtered through Elara’s perception. Setting and atmosphere are thematically engaged, mirroring her displacement and gradual rooting (“The tone of the place was displaced yet rooted”). The stream and forest light actively charge the final image when the strap sinks, giving the environment more than postcard status. It does not strongly constrain choices, but it meaningfully frames and deepens the journey.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    The alchemist’s market and rooftop city are vividly rendered with specific sensory touches (ropes, pulleys, copper and burnt sage), and the ruined tower interior with murals feels concrete. These details are filtered through Lila’s sensibility as someone attuned to encoded stories, which helps integrate worldbuilding with character. However, the environment seldom constrains her choices or meaningfully alters tactics; it decorates more than it pressures. The lens fragment functions as a charged object but mostly as a guide rather than a source of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.0)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is textured and specific—sawdust, popcorn scent, cracked windows, flickering fluorescents—creating a strong, eerie atmosphere that feels lived-in rather than generic. The setting does more than decorate: the ceiling tiles, counter, and hidden void physically structure Marcus’s investigation, and the building’s “cracks” and later “healing” also carry thematic weight. The circus aspect could arguably shape his tactics more (e.g., more circus-specific constraints or tools), but as is, the environment meaningfully guides action and charges the final image. This is a clear strength of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.5)
    The glass orchard library and the cloud-sea are vivid, specific, and sensorially rich, with images like crystalline spires, whispering books, and frost patterns doing real atmospheric work. The environment participates somewhat in action—the rupture in the frost, the descent through the central spire, the clouds cradling her—but more as a lyrical conduit than a constraint. World rules (negotiable reality, living library) feel internally consistent and are learned through her movement rather than exposition dumps. The setting charges the tone and imagery strongly, though it only lightly pressures choice.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and particular—“baroque asteroid,” “gilded spires and obsidian canals,” and storms of light that leave temporal visions—and these details are filtered through Elara’s sensibility rather than reading as a catalog. Environment and objects (asteroid architecture, mirrors, storms, and the Hall of Reflections) genuinely shape tactics: she must time her act to the storm, enter a specific chamber, and manipulate its mirrors. World rules about time becoming visible are consistent and learned through action (light storms, visions) rather than pure exposition. The shard functions as a micro-setting object charging the final image, though the broader physical constraints of the asteroid could matter even more to choices.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.5)
    The settings—oak-root resonance chamber, singing forests, whispering rivers, the gear-filled Covenant of Rust—are vivid and sensorially specific, strongly supporting mood. Details feel filtered through the premise (music, gears, rust, light) in a coherent way, with the Covenant’s red-dusted machinery particularly effective. The environment mostly frames wonder rather than constraining Elias’s choices in concrete ways; he moves through it without having to adapt tactics. Strong atmosphere, but not yet using setting as an active pressure or tool.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and sensorially rich from the first line: rust, rain, gravel, moss, and the glowing lagoon build a coherent atmosphere that reflects her attraction to forgotten places. The subterranean lagoon and limestone cliffs are not just scenic; they embody the story’s hinge-between-worlds concept and charge the final image. Environmental details are filtered through Elara’s collector’s eye (bottling petrichor, reading stone memories), which keeps description purposeful rather than touristic. The piece stops short of having the environment physically constrain a specific choice, but it does meaningfully shape tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    The storm, archway, and hidden chamber are vividly rendered, and details like the scent of salt and carvings that mirror the slide’s patterns create a strong atmosphere. The environment does influence the story in that the archway is the literal threshold and the chamber the site of revelation. However, weather and terrain mostly color mood rather than constraining choice or tactics. Strong, evocative setting that could further deepen by exerting more tangible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.5)
    The amber pavilion, weathered cathedral, and stained-glass windows are vividly rendered with strong sensory and tonal cohesion. Setting is strongly filtered through Elara’s artistic gaze, which helps the atmosphere feel lived-in rather than touristic. Still, the environment rarely constrains her choices or tactics; it mostly amplifies mood and theme. The etched glass matters conceptually, but the physical space never truly limits or pressures her in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    The floating library, zeppelin, dunes, and obsidian lagoon are vividly rendered and create a distinctive atmosphere that supports the theme of lost histories and buried truths. Details like the shadow over the sands and the lagoon as a “mirror of the sky” feel purposeful rather than generic. However, the zeppelin and library mostly function as decorative backdrop or transport rather than constraints on choice. The lagoon does carry narrative weight, but the environment rarely forces or reshapes tactics beyond mood and destination.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    The opening image of Paper-Lantern Cove as a deserted, whispering place is vivid and quickly orients us in space and mood. The transformation—paper lanterns blooming over the water, buildings smoothing, windows lighting—nicely mirrors the story’s thematic movement from desolation to revival. Sensory detail is mostly visual but purposeful, and the recurring lantern motif charges the final image. The world remains somewhat generic beyond the cove itself, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rooftop orchard atop a skyscraper, the silent harbor foghorn, and the phonograph are vivid and atmospheric, and they’re woven through action rather than dumped as backdrop. The environment mirrors the piece’s liminal mood—ancient/natural nested inside modern/industrial—in a way that supports the themes of memory and preservation. The soil-as-emotional-reservoir meaningfully charges the closing image when she places her hands on the earth. However, the physical setting rarely constrains her choices; it’s more evocative than tactically consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    The icebound atrium and later “landscape of wild serenity” are vivid, visually specific, and tonally consistent, giving the piece a clear atmospheric identity. The crystalline spires, frozen archway, and swirling vortex integrate setting with action rather than functioning as pure backdrop. However, the environment rarely constrains options or forces tactical choices; it’s more ceremonial space than pressure source. The recurring objects (acorn cap, feather) carry more charge than the rooms themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sanctuary above the clouds, the belfry, the rope, and the weather are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s attention to wind and microclimate. The environment actively participates: the tower’s height, the bell, and the stilling of the wind all charge the final image and make this choice possible only here. Textures of air, light, and sound are specific without feeling like a tourist catalog. A slight tendency toward atmospheric generalities (“the world was loud”) keeps it shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    The shooting star tracking station, its “skeletal frame” against the void, and the observation deck give a strong, tonally unified sense of place. Details like humming ancient machinery and the lantern’s glow against the cosmos feel selective and purposeful rather than touristic. The station and lantern also recur in the final image, giving the atmosphere a satisfying circularity. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; it’s evocative backdrop more than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    The scorched wasteland and abandoned beekeeping oasis are atmospheric and specific, and images like “skeletal remnants” and “broken glass of the greenhouse” effectively mirror the covenant’s broken state. Setting participates in the logic—revival of the oasis is the visible sign of restored balance—rather than serving as a neutral backdrop. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics or forces different choices; Elias moves through it with relative ease. Strong mood, modest functional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    The emerald silo, garage sale, and hidden chamber are distinct and visually anchored, and the recurring metal/emerald imagery supports the time-tech atmosphere. The silo clearly matters to the plot (it houses the core, capsule, and device) rather than being a generic backdrop. Sensory detail leans visual and tonal rather than fully embodied, but what’s present feels purposeful and not touristic. The final image of the urn fragment on the desk charges the setting modestly but could go further in entwining environment and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lagoon is vividly rendered (“cobalt,” “wet earth and salt,” “burnished hush”) and the kite’s fall is spatially clear and integrated with the environment. Setting details consistently mirror the characters’ inward quiet and attentiveness and recur in the final image. That said, the lagoon mostly supports atmosphere rather than constraining choices; nothing they do depends uniquely on this place’s physical demands. The piece still achieves a strong, unified mood-world even if the environment is more backdrop than engine.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    The temple orchard and living stone pillars are vividly realized and thematically integrated, with good concrete details (hollow pillars, interior carvings, copper-wrapped branches echoing architecture). Setting is not mere backdrop; it mirrors the nature/structure harmony and charges the final image of the transformed orchard. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or forces tactics—it’s more symbolic and atmospheric than operative. The specificity and consistency are strong enough to carry substantial weight despite that limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific: “rainwashed tower in spring,” “overgrown sculpture path,” wet stone and blooming flowers anchor the piece sensorially and tonally. Environmental details are consistently filtered through Elara’s gaze and mirror the theme of decay/renewal and convergence of human/alien architecture. The tower and amber meaningfully charge the final image, even if they don’t severely constrain physical choices. Overall, atmosphere and world-building are a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and specific: “blooming jetty,” “salt and decay,” post-reef world, twilight shadows—all filtered through a melancholy, mythic register that suits the premise. Environmental details (flowers blooming through desolation, dead reef, birds over the water) harmonize with the themes of loss and renewal. The jetty and coastline don’t much constrain his choices—he could perform this ritual almost anywhere—but they strongly charge the imagery of the final garden reclaiming a battlefield. The sensory palette leans visual and atmospheric, yet it feels cohesive and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    The scrapyard settlement, cracked wasteland, and ruined phonograph factory are vividly drawn with atmospheric sensory detail (“sun bled… amber and ash,” metallic tang, burning wire). Setting is well-integrated into action, not just backdrop, and the final image of their walk with the glowing leaf over the wasteland nicely recharges earlier description. Still, the environment rarely constrains concrete choices; it’s more mood than a true pressure system.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.0)
    The time dilation observation deck is vividly rendered with tactile detail (sleek metallic surfaces, patina of neglect, gilded compass rose) and serves as a coherent locus for the piece’s mood. The setting coheres with the SF premise (temporally stretched cosmos, shutdown aftereffects) and is consistently filtered through Elara’s reflective state. The compass rose and the dawn light charging it at the end give the environment some thematic weight, though it doesn’t strongly constrain her choices. Description leans visual but is effective and proportionate for this contemplative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.9)
    The icebound spire and wrong-colored sky are vividly sketched, especially in the opening image and the chess chamber with ice and obsidian pieces. Description leans visual but is purposeful and maintains a consistent, chilly atmosphere. Yet the environment rarely constrains tactics or forces concrete choices; it’s more a beautiful backdrop than an active pressure. Strong mood, moderate integration with action.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    The whispering gallery, the echo motif, and the pawnless chessboard are vivid and tonally cohesive, and the environment meaningfully charges the final image (whispers shifting from past echoes to future promises). The space feels specific and purposeful rather than generic, and the etched walking-path is a well-chosen, concrete device. Setting is integrated into action rather than tacked-on description. Still, the gallery doesn’t quite constrain choices so much as elegantly mirror them, which keeps it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.5)
    The mountain-sized labyrinthine bookstore and the stained-glass light create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that matches the story’s introspective magic. The environment participates in the arc: corridors rearrange in response to her actions, and the shelves form a circle for the climax, so setting is not mere backdrop. Detail is largely visual, but the “whispers and shadows” and “hidden thunder” add aural texture that supports tone. A stronger sense of physical navigation or constraint in the maze under pressure would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    The time-frozen village, cobblestones, platinum labyrinth, and tapestry all create a vivid, coherent atmosphere, and the recurring metallic/threads imagery supports the reflective mood. Details are selective and mostly filtered through Elara’s mindset, especially the chess motifs and woven imagery. However, the “time-frozen” aspect and the environment rarely constrain her choices or alter what she can do; they read more as mood than active setting. The final serene sky callback is effective but familiar as a mirroring device for internal calm.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    The bone towers, canyon of echoes, and mist around the pale spire are vivid, specific, and tonally unified with the story’s mood. Setting isn’t mere backdrop: the “endless echoes” and refracting mist physically manifest her search for multifaceted truth, and the spire’s light and the parting mist shape the final image and path. Details are well chosen rather than encyclopedic, though occasionally they verge on decorative rather than constraining choice. Overall, the environment feels integral to the piece’s atmosphere and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop on an acid sea is vivid, specific, and sensorially grounded; details like the hiss of the sea against the hull and the groaning machinery integrate with her actions rather than sitting as backdrop. The environment exerts pressure (risk of collapse, corrosive exterior) and then participates in the resolution as the sea calms, charging the final image. The recurring objects—the statue and charm—are well-situated spatially and atmospherically. It stops short of 9-band because the acid sea’s constraints feel more gestural than fully exploited tactically.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.5)
    The coastal cave network and hidden oasis are vividly rendered with selective, sensory detail (stalactites like chandeliers, the mirrored pool) that supports the contemplative tone. The environment does some light plot work—the fallen boulder forcing the wrong turn—but mostly functions as atmospheric backdrop and metaphor rather than an active constraint. The quay framing at the end ties setting back into the closure image effectively. Strong, if not yet using place as a true pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt lighthouse, dawn light, and especially the recurring garden-at-night scent create a vivid, atmospheric setting that feels inhabited rather than postcard-like. Sensory detail (cooling air after heat, jasmine, damp earth) is selective and thematically consonant with quiet renewal. The setting participates in the story’s meaning by mirroring internal change—heat wave ending, cool tenderness rising—more than by constraining physical choices. It stops just short of being structurally indispensable but significantly elevates mood and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.5)
    The starlit signal station on a windswept cliff, the weathered walls, and the censer’s glow create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that matches the story’s contemplative tone. The setting does some functional work—the ruined station provides salvage, the station becomes a refuge—but often feels more like a strong backdrop than an active constraint. The censer as object-setting hybrid successfully charges the final image, though the environment’s physical pressures (storms, isolation) barely affect concrete choices. Worldbuilding around “reverse migration” remains evocative but thinly dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.3)
    The orchard-in-a-ravine setting is vivid and thematically integrated (“fractured grace,” storm-twisted branches, damp air), and the mud-brick village contrasts nicely in mood and texture. Details are filtered through Elias’s work habits and the final return to truffle-foraging neatly echoes the opening with added resonance. However, the environment mostly provides atmosphere and origin/return site for the eye rather than strong physical constraints on choice or movement. The storm damage and ravine are evocative but could pressure action more directly to reach a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dock, mist, and lighthouse are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Elias’s gaze, strongly supporting the tone. Weather and light (“nautical twilight,” the sweeping beam) mesh with the themes of liminality and partial knowledge. The Edelweiss and journal function as charged micro-setting objects that recur into the ending image. However, the environment rarely constrains what he can or cannot do; it’s more atmospheric than tactically shaping.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.0)
    The settings (shop, creek, glowing cavern, violet-sky world) are vivid, with strong visual and sensory detail that creates atmosphere and situational clarity. The environment occasionally matters—ants, wall fissure, archway—but mostly feels like evocative backdrop rather than an active constraint on choice. The blooming cavern and bioluminescent flora are especially strong images, though their emotional relevance to Elias is underused. Overall, the piece clears “white room” by a wide margin but doesn’t let setting fully shape tactics or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    Setting and atmosphere are the story’s strongest asset: the ember grotto, crystals “like captured stars,” and bleeding starlight create a vivid, coherent visual field. Details like the metallic scent and changing glow of the grotto support tone and worldbuilding. However, the environment is more backdrop than constraint—very little of the queen’s choice-set is shaped by the physical realities of the grotto beyond mood and direction of travel. The “cobalt grotto above the clouds” versus “ember grotto” distinction is slightly muddy and never meaningfully used.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ember nexus at twilight and the glowing nautilus shell produce a vivid, coherent atmosphere, with specific color and light motifs returned to at the end. Setting and object are well integrated into action (the nexus pulsing, the shell expanding to envelop them), not just backdrop. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; it mostly decorates the already-planned ritual. The final image is charged by the richer air and more vivid sky, but that charge remains conceptual rather than concretely pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mountain ranger cabin, thin air, and sea-of-clouds view establish a vivid, coherent atmosphere, and the star-strewn inner expanse contrasts nicely with the grounded physical setting. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (pine-scented walls, creaking floor, kerosene lamp), and the environment tonally supports liminality and introspection. However, the setting rarely constrains choices or tactics; it frames mood more than it exerts pressure. The final mountains-humming image charges the ending aesthetically but still reads more as backdrop than as an active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.1)
    The water clock shop, fog, and brass mechanisms are vivid and integrated into mood rather than feeling like a backdrop; the opening image is especially strong. Sensory detail smartly compensates for Elara’s lost smell, filtering the setting through touch, sound, and sight in a character-specific way. The recurring presence of the clock and screw at the bench helps micro-setting function almost as an emotional stage. The environment does not significantly constrain choices, but it does charge the tone and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    The floating rock tea platform, misty abyss, and weather create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels particular to this world. Setting details are filtered through her anxiety and ritual focus, with the storm and the abyss subtly mirroring her internal stakes. The crow quill and the platform themselves function almost as micro-settings, returning at the end recharged (platform as sanctuary, quill smooth again). The environment shapes tone and mood more than tactical choices, but it does so with specificity and consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sheet music archive and the doomed orchard are vividly evoked and tonally aligned with the story’s preoccupation with memory and loss. Details like “aged paper and forgotten melodies” and the trees “marked for demolition” create a coherent, melancholic atmosphere. The setting charges the final image (walking away from the archive, whispering leaves) but doesn’t materially constrain her tactical options beyond mood and metaphor. Still, as an emotional landscape, it’s strong and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    The temple library is vividly evoked through light, dust, tomes, and the living walls, and the mural and glowing dictionary give the setting concrete anchors. The environment actively participates in the story—the shifting walls, time fluidity, and mural all shape the witness’s path and the final act of unification. Sensory range leans heavily visual and conceptual, with limited tactile, auditory, or atmospheric specificity beyond “hush.” Still, the place feels coherent and integral rather than a generic mystical backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.1)
    The horizon measurement station between “jagged peaks and a sea of mist,” the “fjord quiet,” and the hydraulic clock are vivid and tonally aligned with a meditative, slightly uncanny atmosphere. Setting is filtered through Elias’s professional lens just enough (hydraulic clock shepherd, horizon measurement) to feel lived-in rather than purely decorative. However, the environment rarely constrains choices; it frames the mood and theme more than it shapes tactics. The recurring clock and key function as a micro-setting that charge the final image, which helps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vividly evoked and gives the piece a strong, specific atmosphere—the pulsing glow, maze-like rows, and blue clearing all feel tangible. Setting is consistently filtered through Elara’s movement and attention, avoiding white-room syndrome. The environment lightly shapes action (the labyrinth, the glowing cluster that signals disturbance) and charges the final image of the gifted mushroom. Still, the farm mostly decorates rather than deeply constrains choices; its properties could matter more to the conflict to reach a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rainwashed library and the lantern with its mica pane are rendered with strong, selective sensory detail that shapes the piece’s atmosphere. Setting is firmly anchored and consistently filtered through Elara’s perception, with weather and light echoing her inner state. The lantern in particular recurs and charges the final image, functioning as a micro-setting/anchor for her emotional arc. The environment, however, rarely constrains concrete choice, so its influence is more tonal than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    The subway utility tunnel and the forgotten phone booth are vividly drawn and strongly atmosphere-building, with tactile details like condensation, rust, and the city’s “pulse.” The environment reinforces Eli’s isolation and liminal role between worlds but rarely constrains his choices beyond mood. The glass harmonica disc functions as a charged object-as-setting that meaningfully shapes the final image. Overall, the specificity is strong and purposeful, though the setting could more directly pressure action to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    The jetty, jasmine, twilight light, and worn wood are vivid and recur with purpose, especially when the jetty is reframed as “a character in the story.” Sensory detail is strong and thematically aligned with regeneration and memory, particularly in the opening and closing images. The environment doesn’t materially constrain choices, but it clearly charges the final image and undergirds the covenant’s meaning. Overall, atmosphere is a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.5)
    The disused station and ivy are vivid, tonally apt, and nicely mirrored when the ivy retreats during the transformation, then returns. Sensory detail is primarily visual but selective and purposeful, with the station’s decay paralleling Elara’s interior state. However, the environment rarely constrains her choices; it is more atmospheric and symbolic than a true pressure source. The clock as an object-as-setting works well as a focal tool for the magical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ultrasonic forest, musical notes, and stillpoint pool create a vivid, atmospheric environment that is strongly tethered to Elara’s sensory mode and the story’s tone. The world’s rules (sound, vibration, language absorption) feel internally consistent and are learned through her movement rather than exposition dumps. The setting primarily supports mood and theme rather than constraining tactical choices, but the forest’s hum faltering and resuming does frame the story’s arc effectively. Overall, it’s specific, textured, and meaningfully tied to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.0)
    The gravitational anomaly, cracked earth, and “sea of light and shadow” void produce a clear, atmospheric setting that matches the concept. The dried-up pen as a recurring object is well integrated with the environment and charges the final image. That said, many details skew abstract or familiar to genre (“fragments of time…kaleidoscope of possibility”) rather than sharply particular to Elara’s sensibility. The anomaly constrains events conceptually but could more directly shape her tactical choices or physical experience to deepen immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.5)
    The harbor and moonlight are vivid, recurring anchors—the still water, prisms of refracted moonlight, and quiet docks are tightly integrated with Elara’s emotional state. The micro-setting stays coherent and supports tone without devolving into a tourist catalog. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, it does charge the final image of the “still” harbor now “alive with meaning.” This makes setting an effective atmospheric and thematic scaffold, if not an active pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.5)
    The lost civilization archive is established quickly and consistently—the labyrinth of corridors, murals, and relics gives a coherent backdrop and supports the quest frame. Details, though atmospheric, remain fairly generic (“stone floors,” “chambers,” “dust”) and rarely constrain action or materially alter tactics. The tapestry, mural, and sketches provide some object-centered texture, but they function more as clue markers than as fully realized environments. The setting tone supports mystery and reverence yet could use sharper, more idiosyncratic specificity to feel truly lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    The “sound wave garden” and “auric lagoon” are vividly imagined, with consistent sensory motifs (hum, glow, symphony) that create a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting is filtered through Elara’s sensitivity to sound and resonance, which helps keep it character-specific rather than a generic fantasy backdrop. The environment does shape the central supernatural turn (the lagoon responding to her drumming), but beyond that it mostly serves as lyrical stage rather than a constraint on choice. Strongly evocative, slightly more ornamental than fully instrumental.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.0)
    The port-city container labyrinth is vivid and specific—smell of salt and rust, metal corridors, groaning containers, and the geomagnetic storm all build a strong atmosphere. Setting is well integrated with action (blocked passage, shifting maze, echoing footsteps) and echoes the themes of isolation and subtle movement. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics beyond generic difficulty; Eli doesn’t have to solve a concrete spatial or procedural problem specific to this world. The storm in particular feels more like atmospheric color than an active time or safety constraint on decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    The “cobalt dock,” wet planks, twilight, and still water create a strong, consistent atmosphere that supports the piece’s contemplative mode. Environmental details like the echoing footsteps and moving shutters are well integrated into action rather than tacked-on description. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain choice, but it does charge the final image of reflected stars and quiet departure. Overall, specificity is above-average and tonally apt without becoming cluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.0)
    The cobalt library, mist, and magnetic grotto create a distinct, atmospheric locus with a consistent tonal palette. The grotto’s return as a contemplative space that “amplifies” his ability gives the setting some functional resonance beyond mere backdrop. However, neither the library nor grotto materially constrains his options; they inspire rather than pressure. The specificity is strong, but its impact on choice is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.5)
    The sublittoral fringe, docks, shallows, and emergent island are sensuously rendered and integrated into action (boots sinking into silt, seabed rising into an island). The disappearing island and ocean environment do more than decorate—they frame the magic and the inner journey. Still, the setting largely supports atmosphere rather than tightening options or materially constraining tactics at the climax, keeping it just below the highest band.

    The farmhouse and wind turbines are vividly evoked and tonally aligned, with the turbines’ shadows and hum reinforcing the oppressive, drained atmosphere. The dried bouquet and window pane function as micro-setting elements, charging the emotional space around Elara’s gestures. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, it does consistently mirror and frame her inner state. Detail selection is purposeful and not overdone, though the turbines’ role stays mostly symbolic rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt atrium, humming quartz, and frozen lake are vividly rendered and recur as active participants in the ritual (the hum syncing with heartbeat, the lake cracking, the atrium “bowing”). Atmosphere is strong and consistent, with details like “lantern-moth hush” and “cobalt light” shaping tone and imagery. The environment primarily functions as charged backdrop rather than a constraint on options; the poet is never forced to navigate physical or social obstacles tied to place. Still, the final image—atrium glowing in farewell, hush following—shows the setting meaningfully charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    The glassblower’s courtyard is vivid and specific—glass shards, kiln, plants, and phoenix lore all feel sensorially grounded and thematically aligned. Setting details are filtered through Elias’s perception (textures, light, movement) rather than a neutral tourist catalog, reinforcing his non-color-based experience. The environment materially shapes the story: access to glass, plants, and the kiln’s history defines his barters and the instrument’s awakening. The final image with the painting and glassblower’s recognition is charged by the courtyard’s accumulated significance.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    The “laboratory of lost sounds” and ruined industrial district are vivid and tonally apt, with selective, evocative details like the carbide lamp lens and coal-town celebration. The setting supports the themes of memory, industry, and loss in an integrated way. However, environment mostly functions as atmosphere rather than a constraint on action—nothing in the space forces or limits Elara’s choices. Strong mood and specificity, but not yet fully leveraged as pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    The observatory is vivid, specific, and tonally apt: brass telescope, glass panes, and intention-woven curtains all reinforce the theme of trying to see and understand loss. Details are filtered through Elara’s sensibility—she chooses the place for its stillness and out-of-time feel—which keeps the setting from feeling like a museum tour. The environment meaningfully charges the final image, with the observatory as a bridge between grief and renewed purpose. At this length, the setting is rich without becoming bloated.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    The skylight loft, rain, shelves of artifacts, and the onyx cards are vivid and strongly atmospheric, and they’re filtered through Elara’s sensibilities in a consistent way. The measuring tape and Tower card recur as charged objects that explicitly frame how she reads scale and collapse, and they reappear in the final image. The environment doesn’t substantially constrain tactics (they could almost do this work in any quiet room), so setting is more mood than pressure. Nonetheless, the atmosphere is specific, textured, and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lost archive, shifting layout, and bronze pagoda are vividly rendered and filtered through Elara’s sensibility, giving the piece a strong, cohesive atmosphere. The environment shapes action: the labyrinthine, “steadily unpredictable” archive and the worn tiles of absence directly guide her interpretive move. Details like the saffron veil and prismatic light are specific and purposeful rather than touristic. The setting charges the final image of her leaving the archive, though it stops just short of constraining a truly hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    The blooming library above the clouds, glass wall, and dream vials create a vivid, specific environment that strongly shapes the story’s atmosphere. The setting is consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a “dusk noticer,” integrating sky and light into mood rather than reading like a catalog. The river stone and the glowing blooms charge the final beats, with the library “sighing in relief” tying environment to resolution. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, it is inseparable from the piece’s tone and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.5)
    The “misty workshop under stars” is sensorially vivid and consistently threaded through cedar scent, nocturnal hums, and starlight filtering the mist. The environment functions as a sanctuary mirroring her internal state and charges the final image where the workshop shifts from “place of sorrow” to “birthplace of renewal.” While the setting does not tightly constrain action, the recurring interplay of light, mist, and stillness helps reweight the emotional stakes at closure. Overall, it feels specific rather than generic, even if more atmospheric than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.5)
    Setting and atmosphere are strong: the quiet tower, frosted glass, humming ivy, shadowed tunnel, and crystal cavern create a coherent, gently uncanny world. Details are filtered through Elara’s sensibility (plants’ voices, coffee rings as divination, scars as stories), which helps avoid a generic fantasy backdrop. The recurring objects (tower, hourglass, plants) return at the end and charge the final image of endless flowing sand and peaceful whispers. While the environment doesn’t significantly constrain choices, it does effectively shape tone and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    The vintage movie palace and projection booth are vividly rendered—dusty reels, cracked window, “time capsule” feel—and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Environmental details (moonlight, hum of the projector, the theater “humming with echoes”) establish a strong, cohesive atmosphere that supports the mystical tone. The setting charges the final image by making the theater feel like a living repository of emotion. However, the space doesn’t significantly constrain her choices; it’s more evocative backdrop than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    The aurora, archway, village, and astrolabe are vividly rendered and integrated with Lira’s ritual, creating a strong sense of place and atmosphere. Environmental details (cold stone, visible breath, shifting symbols) are filtered through her cosmic attention and support the tone. The setting does not strongly constrain her choices, but it does charge the final image as the archway “awakens.” Overall, the world feels textured and specific, if more decorative than functional at key turns.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glowing dune and subterranean archive are vividly rendered and conceptually coherent, with selective, evocative detail (luminescent sand, jars of embers, floating orbs). The environment meaningfully shapes events: the dune “guides” her, responds to the charm, and acts as threshold; the archive’s dimming establishes immediate stakes. Objects-as-setting (the chess clock, the charm) charge the final image and help define the world’s rules. A bit more integration of physical constraint (heat, effort, danger) could further lift this into top-tier territory.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mechanical rainforest is vivid and specific—metallic vines, cog-leaves, uphill streams—and consistently filtered through Eamon’s perceptions. It meaningfully participates in the climax via the colossal machine and the way the environment mirrors his inner landscape. However, the setting seldom constrains his choices or creates friction; it mostly provides evocative backdrop and metaphor. Strong atmosphere and imagery, but not yet fully weaponized as a pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.9)
    Setting is vividly evoked—the dock, twilight river, and “veiled ridgeway” with mist and ancient groves create a tangible, atmospheric world. Details are consistently filtered through Mara’s liminal emotional state and support the theme of in-betweenness. However, the environment rarely constrains concrete choices beyond providing a single serpentine path; it reflects more than it pressures. The recurring ridgeway and mist do lightly charge the final image of her descent.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cobalt fortress, snow, and eerie upper chamber are vivid and tonally consistent, giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine. The piano and bolt work as micro-setting elements that meaningfully charge the final image. However, the environment mostly frames mood rather than constraining tactics or forcing specific choices—Elias’s actions would largely be the same in any suitably isolated sanctuary. Strong sense of place, just shy of using setting as a true pressure mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.0)
    The ancient temple library is vividly sketched—“dust danced in beams of forgotten light” and the labyrinth of tomes feels atmospheric and appropriate to the premise. The world’s rules (runes, ink, constellations) are consistent enough for this length. However, the setting rarely constrains choices or tactics beyond providing books to write in, and “lost in time” never meaningfully affects events. The environment supports tone more than it exerts pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sea level monitoring station and altered coastline are clearly and efficiently evoked, with the opening image of the “sentinel” structure and reclaimed territories setting tone and context. Details are selective and POV-filtered enough to avoid the white-room problem, and the world-building (post–fossil fuel ban, vanished coasts) feels coherent. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or tactics; it mostly frames the meditation, so the setting is atmospheric rather than functionally binding.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay, fractured skylights, and stone circle are vivid and integrated, with strong sensory anchoring and a clear mood. The setting is not just backdrop: the hidden stone circle and view of the stars through broken glass shape what Lira can discover and decide, and the opera glasses are embedded in that environment. Worldbuilding hints (lost theaters, rebellion, stripped skies) feel specific enough without becoming exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    The volcanic hot springs and caves are strongly realized, with steam, heat, and rebirth imagery threaded through (“where the earth’s fire met its waters”). The environment participates in the climax when the springs erupt in a fountain of light, charging the unsealing moment. Details feel filtered through Mara’s sensibility as a plant-telepath elder, not like a generic fantasy backdrop. The setting could constrain choices more directly, but it still meaningfully shapes tone and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    The arboretum and cliff are vividly evoked through salt, jasmine, wind, and crashing waves, and the cliff’s edge concretely shapes the central danger beat. The environment is not just decorative: the wind causes the crisis, the precipice focuses her choice, and the ocean’s expanse charges the final image of loss and possibility. Description is selective and generally filtered through Zara’s state, though a few lines verge on postcard-poetic rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.1)
    The lighthouse library is sensorially and atmospherically rich—“aged paper and salt,” groaning shelves, the roaring sea—and it tracks consistently throughout. The environment meaningfully mirrors and charges the arc: the beacon/light motif, the enclosing walls, and her final ascent concretize the thematic shift. The setting does more emotional and symbolic work than practical constraint, but it’s still strongly integrated. A touch more tactile interaction with the space during the turning point could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.0)
    The wind-carved encampment, desert light, and eclipse remnants create a coherent, gently atmospheric milieu that suits the story’s reflective mode. The tent interior—ink scent, diagrams, vial—provides concrete, tactile specificity that anchors the speculative element. Still, the environment rarely constrains options or behavior; it colors rather than pressures the scene. The drone as tool-object and the eclipse as backdrop frame the final image but stop short of fully charging the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    The “echoing library under snow” is vivid and recurrent, with cold, frost, and muffled sound creating a strong atmosphere that mirrors Elara’s isolation. Details like cryogenic archives and frosted glass feel specific and world-building is efficient. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics beyond mild time/stealth advantages (“snow outside muffling even the sound of her footsteps”), so it’s more mood than active pressure. The final image of her stepping into the snow-charged quiet does effectively charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glass-domed desert rose farm is vividly and economically drawn, with the contrast between lush interior and barren exterior carrying both atmosphere and thematic weight. Details like scent, petals, and the enclosing glass feel lived-in and recur in the ending image, charging the final view of the desert beyond. World logic around the “tower’s collapse” and the broader wasteland is intentionally sketched but stays consistent. The environment constrains choice (she can’t easily flee and must fortify this specific sanctuary), though that pressure could be heightened more explicitly in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sound wave garden and the sleepwalking constellations are specific, atmospheric, and consistently filtered through Kael’s attention, giving the piece a clear sensory and conceptual locus. The idea of “silence with a voice” and vibrations as guiding cues does real work in staging his movements and the goddess’s presence, not just decorating the prose. The rail spike functions as a charged object-as-setting in the final image, physically embodying the bridge between earth and sky. The environment rarely constrains concrete options, though; it shapes mood and metaphysics more than tangible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.0)
    The observatory above the clouds, glass dome, and misaligned telescopes create a distinct, atmospheric setting with consistent imagery. Setting is integrated conceptually—the telescopes’ direction embodies the misuse of science and allows the final act of repointing one to the stars. Still, the environment rarely constrains options or tactics beyond providing equipment to turn; the halls and height don't impose concrete pressures. The specificity and mood are strong, but the setting could be used more dynamically under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “laboratory of lost sounds” is vivid and cohesive—the glass chambers, humming machines, and haunted firmware all reinforce atmosphere and premise. Details like the amber with the insect and the metallic sheen versus golden glow are specific and filtered through Elara’s state of mind. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain her physical options, but it strongly shapes her psychic reality and the story’s tone. The closing image of the silent machines reweights the entire setting effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    The whispering grotto, mist, tiles, and sand mandala are vivid and tonally aligned, with strong, sensuous specificity. The setting is not mere backdrop: the tile walls, the flake, and the mutable sand are the mechanism through which the story’s truth is accessed and reweighted. Environmental elements evolve with the action (whispers to hush, mist thickening then lifting) and charge the final image of her leaving with the hush. A touch more tactile interaction with the space under stress could push this to an even higher level.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ancient plaza, shattered sky, minaret silhouette, ash, and the tactile mosaic are vivid and coherent, with strong visual and tactile detail. The environment is filtered through Elara’s sensibility and thematically aligned—ruins versus her project of reassembly. The tessera and plaza recur and clearly charge the final image, though they rarely constrain concrete choices beyond providing a canvas. Sensory range skews visual and conceptual, but at this length it still supports a strong atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    The mystic orchard/hedge maze is vividly rendered with strong sensory detail (night flowers, cracked fountain, shimmering air) and consistently filtered through Mara’s ghostly, synesthetic perception. The setting feels integral to tone and premise—the “stage” on which timelines fracture and are mended—rather than a generic backdrop. However, it rarely constrains tactics or choices; it is more a charged atmosphere than an active obstacle or resource. Even so, its recurrence and final-image presence give it substantial narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    The light painting studio, cameras, LEDs, mirrors, and the geode create a distinct, coherent atmosphere that is strongly filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Details like the “fractally precise edges” casting patterns and the lingering static effectively mirror her mental state and thematic concerns. The geode-as-object functions as a micro-setting anchor, reappearing at the end to charge the final image. The environment rarely constrains her choices in a hard way, but it meaningfully shapes the ritual and tone of her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.0)
    The coastal cave network is vividly evoked—salt air, damp stone, bioluminescent algae, and the carved hidden chamber all create a coherent, atmospheric world. Details generally feel filtered through Elara’s professional gaze as a sensory map maker, which helps specificity. The environment, however, rarely constrains or complicates her choices; it’s more an evocative backdrop than an active pressure. The recurring cave/fossil/algae imagery does charge the final chamber scene enough to be memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.5)
    The amber warehouse, jars, cliffs, and canyon atmosphere are vivid and consistent, creating a strong visual and tonal container. Details like dust-filtered light and rows of jars feel purposeful and filtered through Elara’s work. While the setting contributes heavily to mood and thematic resonance, it rarely constrains her choices or tactics in a concrete way. The environment charges the final image more texturally than causally, which is strong but shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and consistent, with “silver hush,” mist, snow, and the bluff all contributing to a coherent, atmospheric world. Details like the accumulated snow codes and the hollowed-out tree are functional rather than decorative and support movement through space. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or tactics beyond providing a path and some mild urgency about another storm. The final image of dawn and lifting mist does charge the ending thematically, but more direct environmental pressure could heighten its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    The fog-bound river, ticking gutters, and dark water are vividly rendered and tightly aligned with the story’s meditative, liminal mood. The fog’s dual role as barrier and bridge, and its lifting at the end, effectively mirrors the thematic shift. Still, the environment rarely constrains concrete choices; it’s more atmospheric than operative. Strong mood and specificity, but only moderate integration into action-level stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    The scorched wasteland versus the preserved oasis, plus the ruined hives and lantern glass, create a tangible, atmospheric setting that feels particular rather than generic. The environmental contrast underpins the central question about resilience and change, and the recurring glass-as-object clearly charges the final image. Still, the setting rarely constrains choices or tactics—heat, distance, or ruin don’t meaningfully shape what Elara can or can’t do—so it functions more as evocative backdrop than active pressure. World rules around the oasis’s temporal oddity are sketched lightly but remain internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    The harbor, docks, moonlight, fire escape, and lanterns are vividly rendered and integrated into action (her vantage on the fire escape, the boat’s approach, the lantern revealing his face). The recurring use of light and reflection ties setting directly into the thematic fabric. However, the environment rarely constrains options or tactics; it colors the mood more than it shapes what they can or must do. Still, the luminous harbor and lantern-charged final image provide a strong atmospheric frame that feels particular rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal library above the clouds is vividly realized, with strong, specific images (floating island, shifting shelves, brass mechanisms, clouds like a “restless sea”). Setting is integrated into action—the rise and fall with celestial tides, the hum from below guiding her descent, the stone circle buried in the core. Environmental logic remains consistent and supports tone and worldbuilding rather than reading as a postcard tour. While the setting does not heavily constrain tactics, it does meaningfully charge the journey and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, rain-washed air, and reflective installation are vividly rendered and consistent, creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. Details like the dragonfly, marble petals, and pulsing light feel specific and sensorial rather than generic. The environment doesn’t meaningfully constrain her choices, but it does charge the final image of unity and serenity. Overall, setting and atmosphere are a clear strength, even if they function more as stage and mirror than as active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.7)
    The university radio station is vividly evoked early—dim light, outdated equipment, vintage microphones—and anchored well as the story’s locus. The environment provides the tools for her solution (subwoofer, spectrograph, gear), so it’s more than a white room, though the constraint isn’t heavily pressed. Campus protests expand the setting conceptually but are delivered in summary rather than as textured, pressure-bearing environment. Overall, the atmosphere fits the tone but doesn’t quite charge the final image beyond generic “ethereal glow” and “small bastion” language.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, from the “shadowed nexus under starlight” to the shifting-symbol archway and the glowing cavern chamber. Details are generally well-integrated into Elara’s movement (brushing away dirt, squeezing through the narrow opening) rather than static description. The micro-setting of constricting passage vs. expanded chamber effectively mirrors and then literalizes her internal shift. World rules around the nexus and fallow period stay somewhat impressionistic, but they don’t break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    The quarry and mist are vividly rendered and recur throughout, shaping tone and giving the scene a strong sense of place (“her boots crunching on gravel,” “jagged edges of stone”). The environment exerts some functional pressure—limited visibility, eerie isolation, and the edge of the quarry as implied danger. The setting also participates thematically, especially when the quarry becomes an explicit metaphorical chasm and is then drawn as a portrait. However, beyond obscuring the figure and framing mood, it rarely constrains concrete choices in a way that would push this into the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)
    The experimental weather station and cliffside environment are vivid and well-integrated, with humming machinery, cracked domes, and an atmosphere-map literally embedded in the floor. The environment meaningfully constrains action when the glowing map and its groove dictate where the nail must be placed, making the setting function as a tool and threshold. Weather and atmospheric detail (unnatural chill, ozone scent, jet stream shift) support tone and stakes rather than sitting as ornament. A bit more use of the physical dangers of the station or cliff in her decision-making could have pushed this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.1)
    The opening at the mountain scenic pullout is nicely anchored in time and place, with light, peaks, and breeze integrated into Bridge-Song’s attention. Environmental specificity thins once the character leaves the pullout—“wilderness,” “clearing,” and “hidden structure” are evocative but generic, with limited tactile or spatial constraint on choices. The glass flake as object-as-setting works well, especially when its images begin to align with the landscape and then clear at the end. Overall atmosphere and tone are supported, but the world never quite becomes as physically distinct as the conceptual imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    The abandoned circus train is vividly realized—rust, ivy, tattered costumes, broken props—and the dusk light (“dusky harmony”) supports a wistful, elegiac tone. Elias’s movement through specific cars grounds the story spatially and provides a natural structure for his investigation. The train’s history as the carcass of a failed startup integrates setting with backstory in a plausible way. However, the environment rarely constrains his options or behavior; it functions more as atmospheric symbol than as active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    The celestial mapping observatory is vividly and consistently evoked—the dome, machinery, cool atmosphere, shifting sky, and dawn light all contribute to a strong sense of place. The stars and their variable rhythms are integrated into the decoding process rather than serving as mere backdrop, and the final image of stepping into dawn underlines the setting’s role in her transformation. However, the environment does more mood work than constraint; it rarely limits or forces choices. Still, the specificity and integration with theme are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cursed lake and “swirling orchard vortex” are vivid and sensorially rich, with the fruit/decay paradox effectively mirroring Eira’s inner state. The environment constrains and shapes action—she must move into the vortex, endure its pressure, and the plant roots physically into its core—so the setting is not mere backdrop. Details like the scent, the charred tree, and the pulling currents are economical yet evocative. Still, the lake’s larger world-context and rules remain more impressionistic than rigorously grounded, which keeps this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cobalt glade, living maze, and etched hedges create a vivid, coherent atmosphere with strong visual specificity and some tactile presence (thorns catching her cloak, glowing clipping). The environment feels enchanted and thematically aligned with memory and covenant, and the pedestal in the clearing gives the setting a focal anchor. However, the maze’s threat never quite materializes—it rarely constrains choice beyond mild inconvenience, functioning more as a scenic corridor than an active pressure. Strongly evocative, but not fully weaponized against the character.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.9)
    The catacomb orchard, bones and roots, and half-lit corridors are vivid, specific, and tonally coherent with the story’s necromantic economy of meaning. Sensory details (earth, decay, petals, etched walls) are well chosen and filtered through Elara’s reverent, workmanlike gaze. The setting charges the final image conceptually—this place as her chosen “fabric” to work in—though it rarely constrains concrete choices beyond leading her via the roots. A slightly stronger sense of physical hazard or logistical constraint would push this toward truly top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.5)
    The quarry office trailer and surrounding pit are vividly rendered—dust, diesel, maps, flickering fluorescents—and consistently filtered through his sense of desolation. The quarry-as-scar metaphor and the echo/void imagery effectively mirror his internal state without becoming totally overbearing. The speaker cloth functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. The main limitation is that the environment shapes mood more than it constrains options; it could be swapped for another desolate workplace with limited structural change.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.5)
    The magnetic arbor above the clouds, the humming field, and the glowing knowledge fruit tree are vivid and tonally consistent, giving the piece a strong, gentle speculative atmosphere. Setting details are selective rather than exhaustive, which suits the calm, contemplative mode. The environment, though, is mostly decorative: it rarely constrains options or sharply shapes tactics beyond supplying a plausibly mystical lab for the seed to activate. The final image of the ripe, glowing fruit does effectively charge the setting motif as an emblem of her journey.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.3)
    The tidal atrium, wintersun, bioluminescent runes, and identity-pool are vivid, integrated, and consistently filtered through Elara’s task-focused gaze. The environment isn’t just decorative: the pool as “gateway to the depths of identity” and the responsive runes directly shape how she can intervene. The details feel purposeful and tonally aligned, though we rarely see the setting physically constrain her options beyond necessitating that the work happen here.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    The crystal caves are vividly rendered—“mosaic of crystals,” “veins of quartz that pulsed faintly”—and the environment’s luminous, echoing qualities strongly support the meditative tone. Setting details are well-filtered through her perception, often mirroring the story’s preoccupation with latent potential and hidden voices. The caves, however, rarely constrain action or choices; they are more shrine than obstacle. Still, the recurring interplay of light, crystal, and sound does charge the final sense of carrying light into darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The disused, ivy-choked station is vividly evoked and tonally apt, with details like rusted tracks and cathedral-like interior doing effective double duty as atmosphere and emotional mirror. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices but does conceptually function as a liminal, abandoned transit point turned sanctuary, which supports the thematic “between journeys” state. The accordion and maps operate as micro-settings that meaningfully charge the final image. Overall, specificity and integration are strong, if more symbolic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glowing library in the mist is vividly rendered through light, scent, and shifting symbols, producing a strong, coherent atmosphere. Details like pulsing walls and unreadable glowing books feel particular to this world and are consistently filtered through her awe. The setting does exert some narrative influence—guiding her via the hum, enclosing her in the archway, acknowledging her with a tremor—but it rarely constrains or complicates her choices. Overall, the environment is memorable and tonally apt, if more evocative than functionally pressuring.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “velvet observatory” with nightshade scent, brass telescopes, and the surrounding gardens gives a vivid, specific atmosphere that supports the tone. Setting becomes functional when plants animate, vines surge up the walls, and the balcony vantage lets us see the Dominion scouts’ defeat. Environmental elements (plants, architecture, night) genuinely participate in the climax rather than remaining backdrop. A touch more tactile interaction with the space under pressure could push it even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.0)
    The skyborne grotto, crystalline walls, and aurora create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that suits the meditative tone, and the aurora’s response to events ties environment to emotion. However, the setting rarely constrains tactics or forces choices; it is more an evocative backdrop than an active pressure. The emerald chip as object-functions-as-setting does some additional work, but the grotto itself remains largely static.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    The umbral grotto above the clouds, vineyard hush, rare ethereal plants, and luminous lake are vividly evoked and maintain a consistent, hushed atmosphere. Details are generally well-integrated into Elara’s movement and perception, avoiding white-room syndrome. That said, the environment rarely constrains choices or imposes concrete pressures; it mostly functions as mood-rich backdrop rather than an active force on the story’s decisions. Strong atmosphere and specificity lift this above average, even if the setting’s causal role remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lighthouse, dawn light, wind, and sea air are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through Elias’s reflective stance, giving the piece a strong, coherent atmosphere. The hollow mirror shard and wind chimes recur and charge the final image, especially when the shard travels with the letter. That said, the environment mostly serves as tableau and metaphor rather than as a constraint on choice or action. The setting enriches tone and theme more than it drives behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the floating obsidian platform, magnetic grotto, and starlit hush all reflect and enable the story’s meditative, reality-bending mode. Environmental elements (magnetic hum, reflective water, stones and ripples) are not mere backdrop; they structure how revelation happens and charge the final act. World rules about the grotto’s thought-amplifying power stay consistent and are conveyed economically. The setting could constrain choices even more explicitly, but it already does significant thematic and structural work.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    The canyon of endless echoes and towers of bone are vividly rendered and recur throughout, their acoustics and age suffusing the piece with atmosphere. Details like “centuries of layered dust” and the canyon’s “sigh in approval” at the end integrate setting with theme and closure. The environment mostly shapes tone and metaphysical resonance rather than concrete options, so it feels more like a charged backdrop than an active constraint. Still, the specificity and consistency are strong enough to carry a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.5)
    The icebound spire, frozen corridors, and “lingering luminance” create a vivid, coherent environment that fits the tone and premise. Setting meaningfully shapes tactics—the collapsing chamber, the ice outcropping for the harness, and the mist-filled interior all affect what Eli can do. Some phrasing (“lingering luminance,” “brilliance dimness”) feels repetitious rather than deepening. Still, the spire is unmistakably more than a white-room backdrop and informs both action and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and coherent, from the “meteor hush” pier and sky lanterns to the underwater library glowing inside a sunken ship. Details like the cold, pulsing key tag, blue light under the water, and dry interior pressed by the sea build a strong, unified atmosphere. The environment doesn’t significantly constrain tactics—nothing in the pier or ship forces hard choices—but it does charge the imagery and the final re-seeing of the sky lanterns. World rules (dry library underwater, glowing books) are accepted as fabulist and remain consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    The “ambered observatory deck” with rusted metal, static bursts, and the distillation apparatus creates a distinct, atmospheric location that feels coherent with the cosmic-contraction premise. Setting details are consistently filtered through Lira’s purpose—they’re not just postcards but charged (the observatory “hums with anticipation,” the amber glass refracts the essence). The recurring objects (coins, apparatus, essence) function almost as micro-settings that structure action. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain her choices, it does charge the final image as a liminal bridge between what was and what could be.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ancient observatory, the dome opening to stars, and the rune-lit platform are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elara’s melancholy. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the architecture enables the ritual (“circular platform,” “ancient runes”) and the echoing walls literalize the thematic “echo of sacrifice.” Light and stone recur to charge the final image of scattered light fading and new echoes in the walls. A slightly broader sensory palette beyond sight and temperature could deepen immersion further, but what’s present is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.0)
    The sapphire viaduct and dawn light are vividly rendered, and the dripping dew is not just decorative but built into the magic system (“understanding dripping rates”). The environment feels specific and charged—its glow and hum intensify as the world begins to mend, so setting clearly participates in the closure image. Spatially and sensorially, the scene remains coherent and grounded. The setting could constrain choices more overtly, but it already does solid work for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.5)
    Setting and atmosphere are the standout strength: “mirrored hush of twilight,” the ridgeway, reservoir, and woods all feel sensorially grounded and tonally unified. The environment is filtered through Elias’s watchful role and memory work, which gives the details purpose beyond prettiness. The sapphire label and wind chime act as recurring micro-anchors that help frame the emotional space. However, the setting very rarely constrains choices or tactics; it’s more backdrop than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.5)
    The orchard, kaleidoscopic waterfall, starlings, and altar are sensually vivid and tonally unified, giving the piece a clear, lush atmosphere. Setting details are generally filtered through Elara’s perceptual frame and support the theme of balance (fire/water symbols, earth/sky crystal). The environment participates in the closure image as she leaves with the “ancient freshness” in her pocket and in her stance. Still, the landscape rarely constrains choice or creates pressure; it beautifies more than it compels.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.0)
    The “nocturnal arbor above the clouds” and shifting cloud-patterns create a distinct, lyrical atmosphere, and the environment recurs at key moments (the glow intensifying at success, the dawn on descent). Details like rustling leaves “whispering secrets” show some POV filtering rather than pure postcard description. Still, the setting rarely constrains choices or creates obstacles; it’s more backdrop and mood than an active pressure on tactics. Strongly evocative, but not yet integrated with decision-making at a publish-ready level.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    The floating rock dojo, void, and brain-in-jar pedestal are vivid, high-concept details that immediately define tone and atmosphere. The setting is integrated with theme (sanctuary of complementary opposites, dojo outside of history) and recurs through the swords, void reveal, and final fade. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; the “floating rock” and timeless void are more backdrop than operative pressure. The object-brain functions as a micro-setting anchor that charges the final image, which raises this above average despite some generic fantasy diction.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    The nocturnal haven, brook, and storm-heavy quiet are vividly evoked and anchored early. The brook does real story work: it’s not just mood but the literal site of the key’s activation and the hidden door. Environmental details (chill air, dawn light, the embedded bank door) support both tone and action without bogging the pace. While the atmosphere is strong, it doesn’t quite reach the level where environment feels like an adversary or deep constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.5)
    The echo chamber tunnel and the leaf blower form a strong atmospheric pairing, with reverberations and shadows that mirror Eli’s emotional project. Details like the warm pull cord and swirling dust-like fragments of joy are vivid and purposeful. The environment, though, mainly amplifies mood rather than constraining his choices or tactics in concrete ways. The final “exhale” of the tunnel nicely charges the ending image but stops short of fully inextricable world-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    The frozen, mist-laden garden is vivid and consistently filtered through Elara’s perception, with nice touches like ice-encrusted trees whispering in a half-decipherable language. The setting supports tone and theme (liminality, “eternal mist”) and is not just backdrop; the threat of the garden fading if she uses the key ties environment to stakes. However, the garden doesn’t materially constrain physical tactics in-scene—its influence is more conceptual than practical. The specificity is strong enough for a high score even if its functional pressure could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.5)
    The ember nexus, ash, ruins, crozier, and frozen bloom create a cohesive, moody atmosphere, with strong visual and tactile specificity. The environment is filtered through Elara’s sensibility and mirrored in the sapling emerging from the ruins and the crozier at its base, which charges the final image. However, the setting mostly functions as charged backdrop rather than an active constraint on choices—the nexus doesn’t significantly narrow tactics beyond “this is the ritual place.” Still, the object-as-setting work with crozier and sapling is notably effective.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    The “city of Silence” over a gorge, rusted radio towers, and lunar perigee light are vivid, specific, and consistently folded into action (climbing the tallest tower, sound/static in the wind, the gorge shimmering). The environment supports tone and theme—abandoned communication infrastructure mirroring hidden signals and “shard of hush.” While the setting does not sharply constrain tactical choices, it clearly charges the final image of the city coming alive. Overall, atmosphere and spatial sense are strong and distinctive at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    The spectral grotto under starlight, shifting symbols on the walls, and the sideways-clock world create a distinct and vivid atmosphere. Setting meaningfully shapes events: the grotto’s walls provide the patterns she reads, the rift is anchored there, and the final image returns to its starlight with the now-filled hourglass. Details are more visual than fully multisensory, and the environment rarely constrains her options tactically beyond being the access point to the rift. Still, the place feels specific, recurring, and thematically aligned with the time-fracture premise.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.5)
    The optical illusion gallery is vividly realized—fractured light, shifting walls, and bending floors all feel specific and image-rich. The environment responds to her weaving in concrete ways (walls melting into rivers of color, floors sprouting roots), so it’s not mere backdrop. That said, the setting colors the experience more than it constrains tactics; Elara’s choices would be similar in a differently strange magical space. Still, the atmosphere coheres and supports theme and tone effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    The benthic city, bioluminescent streets, inverted-stalagmite towers, and hovering alien ships are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Elara’s navigational mindset. The recurring anchor chain link functions as a micro-setting object that charges both the communal ritual and the final image. While the environment rarely constrains tactical choices in a concrete way, it strongly shapes tone and thematic frame, especially in the harbor and classroom motifs. World rules (humans + abyssal aliens + hybrid architecture) feel stable and internally consistent at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mist-clad atrium, twilight, and stone pedestal give a strong atmospheric frame, and the environment recurs and subtly reconfigures (“felt like a sanctuary now”). The hearing aid and photograph function as charged objects that anchor the supernatural premise and the ending image of warmth in her satchel. Most description is visual and emotional rather than tactile or constraining; the atrium doesn’t significantly alter tactics, it mainly colors mood. Still, the setting is cohesive, specific enough, and meaningfully reweighted by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    The undersea facility is vividly rendered—“crashing hush,” tidal breathing, silt-choked corridors—and the environment affects action (flooded chambers, rusted vault, rising water aiding escape). The liminal cable-space is a striking extension of setting that supports theme. Some details lean on familiar phrases (“submerged in time,” “silt and secrets”), but overall specificity and integration with mood and movement are strong. The setting never becomes a mere backdrop; it tracks with the story’s emotional and conceptual turns.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The opal observatory under snow, frosted dome, aged wood, and miniature-galaxy inkblot create a distinct, immersive atmosphere well beyond postcard description. Setting and objects (shard, ink, computers, radio) are well integrated into Elara’s perception and the story’s tone, with the shard and observatory both reappearing in the final image. The environment doesn’t seriously constrain her options, functioning more as mood and symbolic bridge than as an active pressure, which keeps it short of top-tier. Still, the specificity and consistency of the milieu are a notable strength.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.0)
    The towers of bone, canyon of endless echoes, luminescent moss, and the living tunnel create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that clearly belongs to this story. The environment is not just backdrop: the echoes are the mechanism of magic, and the final image of softened towers and birds over the canyon charges the resolution. Sensory detail is primarily visual and auditory but sharply chosen and filtered through Lira’s task. The world rules around sound, texture, and bone structures remain consistent and support the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    The herbalist’s underground garden is sensuously drawn—moss, glowing mushrooms, ozone—and it participates in the action by trembling, rippling, and reshaping into the alcove. Environmental shifts create a sense of otherworldly pressure and sanctuary without losing spatial coherence. The carvings and pool reflecting the cryptid effectively externalize the metaphysical encounter. Some phrases lean toward generic “mystical” texture rather than sharply particular, but the setting does real work.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    The enchanted orchard, sky-bridge, and obsidian statues are vividly evoked and integrated into action—the roots literally become the weapon of revolt, and the statues’ policing shapes the premise. The environment’s “tarnished wonder” both mirrors the world’s emotional state and actively constrains choices until the uprising. The locust shell and star-wood violin function as charged, recurring objects that help power the ending image. This is rich, purposeful setting work, just shy of the very top tier because the physical constraints in the climax are resolved almost too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cobalt arcade, frozen clock, flickering neon, and patrolled border create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that supports the “brittle hush” tone. Details are selective and thematically aligned (stalemated clock mirroring the stalemate at the border). However, the environment rarely constrains tactics or forces specific choices; it functions more as evocative backdrop than active pressure. The bottle and sky at the end hold more charge than the physical setting itself.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    The abandoned circus train and hidden oasis are vivid, specific, and tonally coherent, with nice sensory touches like rusted wheels, faded murals, mist, and blooming flowers. Setting supports atmosphere strongly and integrates key objects (carousel, wind bells, halo) into the space. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or generates friction; it’s more a beautifully painted backdrop than an active pressure. The world’s magical rules are lightly sketched but consistent enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.0)
    The “scientific poetry library” is vivid and particular, with concrete anchors like the spiral of Keats and Dickinson, the fractal science aisle, and the Möbius children’s section, all of which are used in action rather than as static décor. The setting is inseparable from the plot: her manipulation of the shelves literally alters reality and generates the doorway. Sensory touches (lavender, old parchment, groaning shelves, kaleidoscope walls) support atmosphere and theme without overloading the prose. The scarf as a recurring object charges the final image, though the environment itself doesn’t tightly constrain hard choices so much as enable a ritual she’s already decided to perform.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The whispering archipelago, pier, damp sand, and tide are vividly evoked and strongly tonal, with sunrise light functioning as a quasi-magical environmental agent. The setting is clearly anchored early and remains consistent, with the shifting light mirrored in Elara’s perception. However, the environment rarely constrains or complicates her choices; it mostly serves as a responsive muse rather than a structuring pressure. This keeps the atmosphere lush but slightly postcard-like in terms of narrative function.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    The shadowed nexus, Obsidian Vault, and sensory details (damp earth, distant pine, breathing shadows) create a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting is consistently filtered through Elara’s purpose and memories, avoiding white-room syndrome. While the environment does not strongly constrain tactics, recurring objects (key, hair, vault) are spatially and texturally grounded. The tone of cosmic quiet and ancient machinery is well supported by the worldbuilding.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is vivid, specific, and tonally apt, with sensory details like “glass walls fogged with age” and “scent of salt and decay” doing real atmospheric work. Setting is well-integrated into action (she kneels in the dirt, digs in the soil, steps outside among shipwreck shadows) rather than pasted on. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain her choices, it does charge the final image of aligning stars and glowing mushrooms in this exact haunted place. Overall, atmosphere is a standout strength.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    The forgotten library is vividly rendered through smell, light, and the physical fatigue of old shelves, and the shard-mirror and tea paraphernalia are integrated into action rather than toured. The atmosphere—dust motes, cracked windows, twilight—strongly supports the mood of quiet exile and possible return. However, the environment mostly colors the scene rather than constraining options or tactics in concrete ways. The setting charges the final image emotionally but not structurally, just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.0)
    The waterfall, parapet, and orchard are vividly evoked, and the atmosphere of lush, almost sacred nature is consistent throughout. Details like “verdant parapet beside a waterfall” and the scented air create a strong sensory frame, even if they lean more on sight and mood than tactile constraint. The setting, however, rarely affects options or tactics; Elara could perform this ritual in many other natural locales with minor edits. The environment thus feels richly painted but not yet structurally indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prism sanctuary, stained glass, and starlit hush are vividly rendered and recur throughout, giving the piece a clear atmospheric signature and anchoring emotion. The setting mostly supports mood rather than constraining choice, but the “accumulated silence” and prismatic light do subtly mirror Elara’s internal state and charge the final image of her walking into dawn. Details stay focused and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    The rain-scoured fresco vault, etched stone, and layered frescoes are vivid and consistent, giving the piece a strong atmospheric anchor. Setting details are tied to theme (layers of history, silence preserving wood) and reappear at the end with the frescoes “glow[ing]” in understanding. The environment, however, rarely constrains choice or tactics beyond enabling excavation; it’s more evocative backdrop than active pressure. Still, specificity and mood are above-average and coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “forgotten sunken ship library” is vivid and tonally apt, with damp planks, collapsed shelves, silt, and rusted artifacts filtering through Elara’s professional eye. The snow globe as micro-setting object is strongly integrated and clearly charges the final image. Environment mostly functions as atmosphere rather than constraint; the underwater/air/waterline conditions never meaningfully alter tactics or choices. Still, specificity is high and consistently supports the sophisticated melancholy mood.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    The misty courtyard above the clouds, the storm, and the glowing bolt plate all create a strong, unified atmosphere that supports the liminal, techno-mystical mood. Details like the shifting graffiti and the lightning/thunder window are specific and filtered through Elara’s sensibility, preventing “white-room” syndrome. The environment partially constrains choice via the timing of the storm rather than through spatial or physical limitation, so it feels more like a ritual stage than an active obstacle. Still, the setting is vivid, coherent, and thematically apt enough for high-band work.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    The icebound spire, aurora, frosted elevator, clocks, and portraits create a vivid, coherent atmosphere with strong, selective visual details. The environment occasionally constrains experience (thin air, cold, icy stillness) and echoes the emotional state, though mostly as mood rather than hard constraint. Overall the setting feels specific and memorable, even if it could more actively shape her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.5)
    The sky gondola, slack cables, patchwork world below, and “dusty starlight” create a strong, coherent atmosphere that fits the story’s liminal, metaphysical mood. Cloud types are described with specificity and inflected by Elara’s professional eye, grounding the abstract premise. The environment, however, rarely constrains her choices beyond the initial stranding; once she decides to leap, the physical specifics of the gondola matter less than the symbolic verticality. The telescope as object-setting is nicely integrated and helps charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    The condemned building, hollowed oak, and book-lined trunk are atmospheric and tactile, with details like “vein in a leaf” and “cracks in the plaster” sharply filtered through her eye. The tree trunk library is not just a backdrop; it materially houses the mechanism and frames the entire quest. The sense of an ancient, nearly-sacred space on the brink of destruction supports both mood and theme. The environment could constrain tactics more explicitly, but it still meaningfully charges the final image of her emerging into a changed stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    The airship, navigation chamber, hopscotch board, and luminous orbs are vividly rendered, and the starling murmurations outside echo the patterns Elara studies. Setting is filtered through her professional lens (maps, symbols, constellations), which sharpens atmosphere. Environment lightly constrains action via the hidden stern hatch and ladder descent, though it doesn’t significantly limit options or create danger. The recurring light and pattern imagery nicely charge the final image, even if the world’s rules stay on the suggestive rather than deeply grounded side.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.0)
    The frozen library above the clouds and the hall of mirrors are vivid, specific, and tonally coherent, with good integration of light, cold, and sound (“faint ticking of an unseen clock”). Details are filtered reasonably through Elara’s sensibility as a repair-focused locksmith-scholar. The environment supports mood more than it constrains action; the cold, height, and surreal architecture rarely alter her tactics. Still, the setting is a major strength and feels memorable and internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.0)
    The orchard planet, floating rock arches, and overgrown butterfly garden are vividly rendered and woven into the action rather than feeling like a backdrop. Sensory details (scent of blooming fruit trees, glowing chalk, bronze bell etched with constellations) support the fable-like atmosphere and thematic focus on renewal. The environment lightly participates in the climax (sound echoing through arches, nebula pouring over orchards), though it rarely constrains choices or tactics. Overall, setting is a major strength, but it stops short of fully shaping decisions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lighthouse, waves, and “bruised” dusk are vividly rendered and tonally integrated with Elara’s inner state. The environment participates modestly in the action—the beam’s stutter and later steadiness externalize the stakes and outcome. However, the setting rarely constrains her choices or tactics; it is more an atmospheric container than an active obstacle or resource. Still, the lighthouse and its hush clearly charge the final image and are memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cliffside labyrinth, cursed orchard, and mechanical birds are vividly drawn and consistently re-used, with atmospheric specificity (“fractured spine,” “wind and salt,” “wings whirred like broken gears”). Setting meaningfully constrains options: the birds create real external pressure, the labyrinth necessitates the map, and the approaching frost slightly charges the escape beat. Details are filtered through Elara’s lived familiarity, avoiding tourist listing. This is near high-tier work; only the frost feels more atmospheric than tactically operative.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ravine, braided river, and twilight are vividly evoked and clearly filtered through Elena’s mindset, with the foam and chrysalis functioning as recurring charged images. Sensory detail (cool air, damp earth, pine) is selective and supports tone without feeling like a generic nature catalogue. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, it meaningfully mirrors and textures the internal shift, especially in the foam’s splitting/rejoining and the final climb out. This is strong, purposeful atmosphere, just shy of truly indispensable environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glass orchard library and its cloud sea are vividly and consistently rendered, with strong, specific images (transparent towers, crystalline branches, shelves like fruit) that feel coherent. Setting evolves with the action: the climb reveals fragmentation and the final descent shows reordering, so environment participates in the story rather than functioning as a static backdrop. The floating height and glass ledge create mild physical stakes around the incision moment. Still, the library rarely constrains choices beyond mood and texture; it could pressure Elara more directly.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Imagery of the desert fortress after rain, the tidal pools, and the icebound coral pavilion is vivid and sensorially rich, with a strong, consistent mood. The environment is filtered through Elara’s perception—she “reads” pools and walls as stories—so the setting feels integrated with her gift. However, beyond providing an entrance puzzle and a beautiful container for remorse, the environment rarely constrains options or forces different choices. Atmosphere is excellent, but physical stakes and logistical constraint from the setting are relatively soft.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.5)
    The astronomical clock tower is vividly rendered with cobblestones, “borrowed starlight,” aged wood, and gears, creating a strong atmosphere. The tower does symbolic work as a former beacon of unity and literal location of the climax, and its awakening charges the final image. Still, the environment rarely constrains Elara’s choices beyond providing a stage; the setting is evocative more than tactically necessary moment to moment. Detail is well chosen and integrated, even if largely visual and thematic rather than pressure-bearing.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.0)
    The moonlit canyon, shadows, and relic tech create a coherent, atmospheric setting that supports the reflective, haunted tone. Details like the jagged mirror shards and lunar glow are specific enough to avoid white-room syndrome and recur meaningfully at the end. Yet the environment rarely constrains action or alters tactics; she doesn’t have to solve problems that only this canyon could create. As a result, the setting feels evocative but not fully exploited as a pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    The serpentine grotto, mist, and luminescent veins are vividly rendered and integrated into the action (the inversion reveals hidden passages, the glowing rock guides her path). The pool, pedestal, and crystal are all spatially clear and contribute to a strong atmosphere of secret, subterranean ritual. However, the environment rarely constrains her choices or threatens her; it serves more as evocative backdrop and mystical mechanism than as a true pressure source. Still, the specificity and consistency of the setting are a standout strength.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.0)
    The siskin alder grove, filtered sunlight, and hedgehog create a strong, coherent atmosphere that aligns with the “intensely quiet” tone. Details like the porcelain insulator and the roots of the ancient alder feel tactile and are filtered clearly through Elara’s artistic sensibility. The environment lightly constrains behavior via the hedgehog’s timing and the nocturnal working window, though it rarely pressures choices in a consequential way. Still, as a lyric, contemplative piece, setting and atmosphere are a pronounced strength.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.5)
    The magnetic nexus, twilight sky, basalt stone, and chessboard create a concrete, gently uncanny atmosphere, and details like the hum and pulsing energy are vivid without excess. The environment meaningfully participates when the nexus causes the pieces to move and amplifies her thoughts, charging the central ritual rather than serving as mere backdrop. Still, the setting remains largely lyrical; it doesn’t impose hard constraints or complicate tactics beyond being a mystical amplifier. Strong, well-integrated mood work, just short of truly indispensable environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “shadowed workshop under the stars” is vividly and repeatedly evoked, and small sensory details—the hum of machinery, distant chatter, wind—create a strong atmospheric cocoon. The diary as a physical object in that space is well-charged and returns meaningfully at the end as she closes it and goes to the window. The environment mostly serves mood rather than constraint—nothing in the workshop or the starry night forces or limits her choices—but for this quiet, lyric mode the atmosphere is a real asset. The fireworks as an external counterpoint to her inner stillness nicely sharpen the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.5)
    The treetop village, vine-bridges, “wildflower hush,” and high-bough garden create a vivid, sensorially rich atmosphere that feels specific and inhabited, especially through scent. Setting details are filtered through Elara’s vocation and nose, which gives them a character-specific bias. The environment mostly supports tone and theme rather than constraining choices; the story would still largely function in a differently configured quiet village. Even so, the world-building is above-average and coherently sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    The orchard planet, floating arches, bioluminescent moss, and inversion hour create a vivid, sensorially rich environment that feels particular rather than generic. Setting is well-integrated into action: she navigates via river flow, anchors in an arch, and enters a glowing, eroded archway that houses the crucial stone. The physics and textures of the world remain consistent and legible. However, the environment rarely constrains choices under pressure; it enhances atmosphere more than it actively shapes the stakes at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    The port’s container labyrinth is vividly drawn—the “metallic forest,” oil streaks, and creaking stacks give a strong sense of place and mood. Setting is not just backdrop; the stacked containers materially cause the disaster through wind funneling and create a maze Elara must traverse. However, in the present tense of the scene, the environment rarely constrains her choices or tactics beyond atmosphere. The sensory palette leans heavily visual but is still effective.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ice cavern and aurora are vividly rendered with tactile, visual, and conceptual specificity, and they’re not mere backdrop: the aurora is explicitly a conduit, and the ice physically responds to Elara’s bells. Details like “fractured ice that crunched underfoot” and “blues of distant whispers” are filtered through her synesthesia, tying environment directly to perception and action. The setting meaningfully charges the climax as the sculpted hush materializes within this charged space. A slight overabundance of adjectives occasionally edges toward decorative, but clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    The canyon, thunder-echo range, and “canyon hush” provide a clear, moody physical frame, and details like driftwood markers and the stone pedestal integrate setting with action. Sensory focus is mostly visual and sonic but effective, especially the contrast between distant thunder and oppressive nearby silence. The new realm of “shimmering light” is more generic and less grounded, feeling more like a placeholder transition than a lived-in space. Overall atmosphere is strong, but the environment rarely constrains choice beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.0)
    The Topaz workshop, shelves of ink and type, and open ceiling to the stars create a tangible, moody environment that matches the story’s contemplative strangeness. The halo fragment as object-as-setting is particularly strong, evolving from mystical artifact to a dimmed, spent collaborator in the final image. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; it mostly supplies atmosphere rather than pressure. The specificity is solid and purposeful, but not yet indispensable to the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.5)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway and “fade from memory to myth” are vivid, integrated images that establish a clear, atmospheric world and mirror the story’s liminal concerns. Details like the aurora pulsing with the pendant’s hum and the cottage at the edge of the fade feel purposeful rather than touristic. However, the environment rarely constrains options or tactics; it colors mood more than it shapes action. The recurring pendant-as-object partly fills the “micro-setting” role at the end but still functions more as symbol than as concrete constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    The quartz arbor, mist, and prism are vividly rendered and consistently threaded through the piece, giving it a strong atmospheric identity. The setting supports the mystical tone and the idea of amplified subtle energies, and the final image of her leaving the arbor with the prism charges both place and object. Still, the environment decorates more than it constrains; it shapes mood more than tactical choice, which holds it just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    The orchard within a bamboo forest, the dappled light, and odd phenomena (backward streams, singing trees) build a distinct, lyrical atmosphere anchored from the outset. The amber bead and the bridge of light charge the final image, though the environment rarely constrains action beyond offering a path and wonders to witness. Descriptions skew visual and pretty, with less use of other senses or concrete environmental pressure. Overall, the setting is evocative and coherent but functions more as backdrop and mood than active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.1)
    The orchard planet and floating rock arches are vivid, memorable images, and the sensory blend of “ripe fruit and molten metal” is specific and effective. Setting is consistently integrated—arches, orchards, mines, lava, and runes recur and evolve, especially in the healing surface image at the end. World rules (mine shafts to core, silk woven into runes) are sketched efficiently and remain internally consistent, though they stay more mythic than tactile. The environment lightly constrains action but rarely forces concrete tactical choices under pressure, which keeps it just short of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.0)
    The settings—the rusty, grease-scented repair bay and the lush alien forest—are concrete, sensory, and efficiently sketched, with some nice textural contrast. The spaceport-turned-nexus is an appealing idea, and the recurring presence of the bay at the end charges it slightly as a hub rather than mere backdrop. Still, the environments rarely constrain choices or tactics; Elara could behave almost identically in many other locales. Strong atmosphere is present, but setting is not yet fully integrated as a pressure-bearing element.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lighthouse, jagged cliffs, sea, and lantern room are vividly grounded, and details like gulls, sea glass, and the hidden compartment contribute to atmosphere rather than feeling touristic. The environment meaningfully charges the final image—the relit lamp and warmed sea glass are inseparable from the setting. That said, the setting could constrain choices more (weather, height, isolation affecting tactics) rather than mainly serving as mood and metaphor. Still, for this scope, the sense of place is textured and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.6)
    The emerald lighthouse, star canopy, green beam, and living fog are vividly rendered and consistent with the story’s mythic-fantastical tone. The environment is not just postcard: the height of the lantern room, the beam’s reach, and the fog bank’s position all matter to what can be perceived and affected. The lighthouse as a focused source of light meaningfully charges the final gateway image. Still, sensory texture leans heavily visual; other senses or more tactile interaction with the space could further deepen atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The floating rock tea house, cloud plateau, jasmine scent, and sunlit morpho wing are vividly realized and tonally coherent, and the setting is well integrated into the action (the wing on the windowsill casting colors, patrons pausing, the misty valley exit). The environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices—this conversation could occur in many quiet sanctuaries—but the altitude, light, and suspended stillness do thematically mirror the liminal, reflective state of the characters. World rules (floating rock, sun trails) are gestured at rather than deeply grounded, yet remain internally consistent. The recurring use of light and altitude charging the final image is a strong atmospheric throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    The stormlit tower, moonlight, and labyrinth of scattered dreams are vividly evoked and coherently sustained, with the sextant functioning as a charged object-as-setting. Environmental details are selective and on-tone, and the moonlight in particular acquires narrative weight by enabling the sextant’s healing. The world’s rules (labyrinth as dream repository, relic as vessel of sorrow) are implied through action rather than dumped. Still, the setting rarely constrains choice; it frames and enhances theme more than it forces tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.5)
    The “alchemical orchard greenhouse” and mirror orchard are vividly evoked—glass dulled by neglect, fruit like “captured dawns,” etched bark, and singing water all create a strong atmosphere. Details are integrated with action (lyrics on roots, the stream singing along), not just static description. The setting mostly frames and echoes the inner journey rather than constraining choices; Elara rarely has to adapt tactics to environmental limits. Nonetheless, the recurring greenhouse/orchard imagery charges the opening and closing nicely.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.5)
    The city, neon, and “unassuming bookstore” frame a pleasantly atmospheric urban-fantasy setting, and the secret library’s deeper chamber adds a sense of descent into hidden knowledge. However, sensory detail leans generic and mostly visual, rarely filtered through Elara’s specific biases beyond broad mood. The environment doesn’t meaningfully constrain her choices or tactics; it’s a backdrop rather than an active pressure. The final image is not distinctly charged by any concrete environmental detail.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.5)
    The overgrown courtyard and secret tea house are vividly rendered with concrete sensory detail (damp earth, fading blooms, warm chamomile), and they’re clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The setting isn’t just postcard description; it meaningfully mirrors the themes of decay and renewal and provides the canvas for her actions. However, the environment rarely constrains or complicates her choices—it supports mood and theme more than it pressures behavior. Strong atmosphere, just shy of using setting as a full dramatic partner.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and memorable—the “frozen library above the clouds,” crystalline shelves, and “quartz hush” all establish a strong, coherent atmosphere filtered through Elara’s work. Environmental details like the cold air, misting breath, and gloves are concrete and tied to her task, though they rarely constrain choice in a way that alters tactics. The world’s rules (slides, lantern, frequencies) feel consistent and learned through action rather than exposition dumps, giving the space a lived-in, tactile quality without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    The pirate market beneath a rotting pier is vividly evoked with salt, decay, vendors, and shadows, and it sustains a consistent atmosphere. Details are filtered through Lila’s familiarity, which avoids a pure tourist catalog. That said, the environment rarely constrains her tactics in a concrete way; it serves more as mood than as an active obstacle or resource. The recurring watch fob charges the final image more than the physical setting does.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lavender bluff, sentient forests, and aurora are vividly rendered with multi-sensory detail (scent, temperature, light), and the convergence of the aurora in the clearing ties setting directly to the climactic revelation. The environment feels coherent and specific rather than generic “fantasy forest.” However, beyond guiding her to the clearing and visually charging the final image, the setting rarely constrains her options or actions. It’s strong atmosphere with one meaningful structural function, not yet a full tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vivid and sensorial, with the crystals, dripping water, and lantern light all integrated into Elara’s perception and emotional state. The cave’s metaphoric evolution from sanctuary to prison to womb nicely mirrors her internal arc. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, it meaningfully charges the final image (prismatic shadows, womb-like shelter, lock placed beside the painting). The specificity and tonal fit are strong enough to feel publishable at a good market.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    The greenhouse city, toxic sky, and undercity are vivid and specific, and they’re tightly integrated with the central problem of a dried oasis and artificial systems. Environmental details (domes, recycled air, decaying plants, rusting metal) track with action and mood rather than reading as postcard description. The world’s rules around scarcity and toxicity are consistent enough and clearly inform Elara’s stakes. While the setting contributes thematically and atmospherically more than as a tactical obstacle, it solidly charges the story’s choices and final hope.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Whispering Bluff above the clouds, the inner-lit iceberg, and the parting clouds/sunbeam create a strong, coherent atmospheric frame. Description skews visual but is concrete and purposeful, with the environment echoing the story’s concern with altitude, thin air, and fragile wonder. However, the setting rarely constrains choice or shapes tactics; it’s more altar than obstacle. The final image—clouds closing again as she descends—does gain thematic charge from the established locale, lifting the category.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    The desert rose farm and glass dome are vividly sketched and thematically apt, with resilience and fragility mirrored in the roses and the “sanctuary” feel of the dome. Setting is integrated into Elara’s perceptions (touching petals, shimmering dome) rather than tacked-on description. However, the environment rarely constrains her options; the same conflict could largely occur in any enclosed garden without changing tactics. The dome and roses do charge the final image, but more situational pressure from the setting would deepen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    The courtyard at dawn, jasmine scent, and waking city hum create a vivid, atmospheric frame that feels lived-in rather than generic. The mailbox and bench ground the scene spatially and emotionally, and the environmental calm contrasts nicely with the inner and historical turbulence around the letter. However, the setting rarely constrains options or shapes tactics; it mostly serves tone and mood rather than active pressure. The locket-mailbox pairing edges toward micro-setting by charging the final image, which helps lift the score.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    The sunken laboratory is vividly evoked—the dripping water, moss, crumbling walls, glowing journal—and atmosphere is consistently rich and purposeful. Environmental details mirror theme (forgotten wisdom, decay vs. resurrection) and the lab actively responds to her actions when the walls shift and passages open. However, the “sunken” and underwater aspects do little to constrain concrete choices (no pressure from depth, oxygen, or structural danger), so the setting is more thematically than tactically loaded. Still, it’s a strong, coherent backdrop that feels specific rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.0)
    The salt crystal growing chamber, with its “gleaming silence” and pulsing crystals, is vivid, sensorial, and integrated into the premise as an amplifier of gravity pockets. The environment mirrors and enhances the story’s mood and concept rather than sitting as generic backdrop. The wildflowers and coffee act almost as micro-settings/objects within that space, helping to anchor Eli’s body and attention. Still, the chamber doesn’t quite constrain tactics or force hard choices; it charges the atmosphere more than it actively pressures the action, which keeps this shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.5)
    The nocturnal haven and brook are vividly rendered with multisensory detail, and the natural environment is well integrated into Elara’s process (aligning with the brook’s rhythm, the flow pausing at the climax). The crane’s wing as a recurring object meaningfully charges several images and the final reminder of fragility. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain her choices, it consistently underpins tone and theme. Overall, atmosphere is a clear strength of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rooftop garden and meteor shower are vivid and integrated, giving the story a specific, atmospheric locus rather than a generic “city rooftop.” Details like the herbs, brick chimney, and wrought-iron railing feel lived-in and suit Clara’s sensibility. The setting lightly charges theme (old buildings, stars, vertical distance from the city) and supports Elias’s talk about architecture. However, the environment doesn’t significantly constrain choices or tactics; it’s evocative backdrop more than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “velvet garden at twilight,” jasmine scent, glowing orchid, and still fountain create a strong, coherent atmosphere that frames the entire piece. The garden and its objects are not just décor; they’re reweighted as an archive-space, and the final return to the garden with the shell silent charges the setting with new meaning. However, the environment rarely constrains concrete choices beyond mood and symbolism. The specificity is good but leans more lyrical than tactically functional.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.0)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, and stalactites are vividly rendered and woven into action (drips syncing with her heartbeat, pausing during the erasure, resuming at the end), giving the environment a subtle, living presence. The rose thorn and scroll function almost as micro-setting, constraining her possible actions to this ritual of unmaking. While the sanctuary doesn’t sharply constrain options, it does strongly charge the final image and mood. The sensory detail stays purposeful rather than touristic, supporting both tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    The “serpentine nexus under starlight” and the chamber of liquid starlight are vivid, and details like pulsing ground and whispering shell create a unified, atmospheric space. Setting is consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility and supports the tone well. However, the environment rarely constrains her choices beyond a basic threshold moment at the archway; it’s more stage-set than active pressure. The seashell as a recurring object does help charge the final image, nudging the score up.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Arctic, the glacier-carved, candle-lit shrine, and the “borrowed starlight” atmosphere are vivid and specific, with the ice walls humming nicely tying setting to the supernatural. The melted snow globe functions as a recurring object that meaningfully charges the final image. However, the environment mostly frames mood; it rarely constrains options or alters tactics beyond providing a ritual space. Strong atmosphere and specificity, just shy of using setting as an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.5)
    The parapet after rain, jasmine scent, and fireflies are vivid and coherent, creating a strong atmosphere that suits the meditative mode. The environment is filtered through Elara’s sensibility (e.g., fireflies as moon-path followers), which keeps description from feeling generic. Still, the setting mostly decorates rather than constrains choice; it charges the mood more than the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.5)
    The orchard bubble against the wasteland, the still air, and the returning dust storms are vivid and integral to mood and stakes. Setting elements meaningfully constrain events: the orchard’s protection, the hum in the bark, and the storms’ return all shape what’s possible and what is lost. Still, sensory texture leans heavily visual and conceptual; we could use more tactile/embodied interaction with the environment under pressure. The world’s rules feel consistent for this length, with the stillpoint and its shield taught economically.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.0)
    The “stormlit observatory above clouds” and cobalt glass portico create a strong, coherent atmosphere, with storm and height reinforcing Elias’s isolation and liminal role. Environmental details (lightning, trembling observatory, pulsing glass) are vivid and tied to emotional beats. That said, the setting rarely constrains tactics or forces specific choices; it’s more mood than machinery. The final dawn image does pay off the sky and weather motifs in a satisfying way.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “feral loft beneath the dunes” with wind whispering through cracked beams is vivid and tonally apt, and the object micro-setting (jars, music box, glass shard) is tightly woven into action. The shard pressed to his ear at the end meaningfully charges the final image and situates closure in a tactile object. Sensory detail is selective and consistent, with wind and light modulating atmosphere rather than static backdrop. The physical environment barely constrains options, though, so it functions more as mood than as a structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.5)
    The drift-ice marina and lighthouse are vividly rendered with specific atmospheric details (brine, cracking ice, mist, sunset-to-moonlight transition). The environment participates in mood and escalation (the ominous vibration, ice cracking, the figure emerging from the mist) though it rarely constrains tactics beyond vantage and isolation. Sensory detail is mostly visual and auditory but feels purposeful rather than ornamental. The marina’s eerie, liminal quality supports the story’s mystical tone effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.3)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, moonlight, and magnetic viaduct are vivid and recur in meaningful ways, especially the viaduct as a charged final image. The atmosphere is consistent and evocative, with details like “air crackled with restrained wildness” supporting tone. Still, the environment rarely constrains choice or tactics; it feels more like a beautiful backdrop than an active pressure on Elara’s decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    The subway maintenance tunnel is vividly rendered with concrete sensory cues (rust, damp earth, dim light) that establish an atmospheric, haunted space. The lantern’s glow interacting with walls and shadows grounds the environment and supports the mood. While the setting does supply hidden compartments and a false wall, it mostly functions as evocative backdrop rather than an active constraint on her choices. Still, the spatial and tonal coherence are strong and comfortably above typical submission quality.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    The antique music box repair shop is vividly realized through smell, objects, and spatial detail, and it meaningfully mirrors the themes of repair, abandonment, and second chances. The clockwork heart, the shelves of silent boxes, and the cracked floral box all work as concrete, specific images filtered through Elias’s reflections. The environment supports tone and theme but does not strongly constrain choices beyond providing a metaphorically loaded backdrop. Still, the setting is integrated with the story’s concept rather than feeling like a generic stage.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop floating on an acid sea is vivid, sensorial, and integrated, not just a backdrop: the corrosive sea’s fumes, the bobbing structure, and the mechanical hum all inflect mood and texture. The setting does modestly participate in the climax when the acid sea stills at the bell’s ring, tying environment into the story’s conceptual stakes. Details generally feel filtered through Lira’s maker’s perspective, emphasizing tools, mechanisms, and hybrid tech. While the world’s physical constraints don’t sharply alter her tactical options, the workshop-as-microcosm motif effectively supports the theme of evolution and awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.2)
    The social network archive, with forgotten corners and metadata, offers a conceptually apt setting that matches the themes of memory and erasure. However, the environment is mostly abstract and visual—“vast digital expanse”—without much sensory texture or lived-in detail, and it rarely constrains action beyond providing or denying access. The old terminal and patch function more as plot tools than as fully charged setting elements. Atmosphere is serviceable but not vividly immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse orchard above a frozen sea, the vintage mirror shop, and the ice floes create a strong, atmospheric sense of place, with good sensory cues (salt, apple blossoms, aged wood, dust). Setting operates mainly as mood and symbol rather than as a constraint on choices; aside from being the place where things happen, the environment doesn’t significantly alter tactics or limit options. Still, the recurring lighthouse/orchard/ice imagery charges the final beacon image nicely.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    The drift-ice marina, abandoned boats, and northern lights are vividly rendered and thematically aligned with impermanence and fragile beauty. Environmental details like the creaking piers and “ice whispering” are well integrated into Elara’s perceptions rather than pasted on. While the setting doesn’t materially constrain tactical choices, it decisively charges the final image of her on the dock under the lights, parasol raised. The piece gains much of its mood and resonance from this place; tightening its causal pressure would be the next step to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vineyard and amber pavilion are vividly rendered and recur in ways that mirror her emotional state (rows of vines that “lean toward another, yet none ever touched” being the clearest and best instance). Setting is consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, so atmosphere and theme are well integrated rather than pasted on. The environment, however, rarely constrains her choices; it frames reflection rather than forcing tactics. Still, as a charged metaphorical field for a quiet, interior story, it’s strong and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    The murmuring pavilion, dunes, and kinetic parapet are vividly and consistently rendered, with a coherent atmospheric lexicon (“whisperfield calm,” “silken walls,” “pulsing stones”). These details feel filtered through Elara’s vocation and reverence, not like a tourist catalog, and they support tone well. The parapet’s energy and the pavilion’s voices lightly constrain action (kneeling, touching, listening) but rarely exert hard pressure on choices. Still, for this length, the integration of setting with mood and ritual is strong and immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lavender field and rusted factory ruins are vividly rendered and anchored early, with sensory detail (scent of lavender, golden dusk, creeping vines) that clearly colors Elara’s perception. The environment mirrors the thematic tension between decay and healing without feeling purely symbolic, and the shift in how the vines are seen by dusk modulates the atmosphere effectively. However, the setting rarely constrains action or choice; it’s a resonant backdrop more than an active pressure. The final image of the lavender “whispering its approval” uses setting well to charge the closing mood.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    The “shadowed library at dawn” is vivid and tonally aligned with the themes of decay and residual hope, and details like dust, tall windows, and the defunct chandelier integrate well with action. The setting is clearly filtered through Elias’s scholarly sensibility and mirrors the “mausoleum of forgotten texts” he inhabits internally. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain his choices, it meaningfully charges the final image of him leaving with the crystal. Overall, atmosphere and specificity serve the story without bogging it down.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    The fog sculpture garden is vivid and decisively functional: fog, metal, stone, and pond all shape his movement, perception, and tactics. Sculptures aren’t mere decor; they become directional cues and emotional mirrors (archway as childhood, rods as regrets), and the pond enables the final ritual with chalk. Weather and atmosphere (fog thickening and lifting) modulate orientation and mood in step with his search. The garden feels specific, lived-in, and thematically charged without tipping into over-labeled symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “lunar observatory above the clouds” is vivid, with thin air, altitude, and distance from earthly chaos creating a strong atmosphere of rarefied stillness. Setting details like the observatory’s shaking foundations, the eastern-wall clock, and the dawn light below the clouds are well integrated with the thematic arc of constancy vs. change. The environment charges the premise more than it constrains concrete choices—Elara rarely has to navigate physical limits imposed by the place. Still, the observatory’s changeless isolation reweights the final hum of “a new kind of constancy” effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    The “radiant haven above the clouds” and the “scent of hope” form a consistent, gently uncanny atmosphere, and sensory details (lavender, eucalyptus, glowing air) are vivid and integrated into Elara’s work. The vinyl fragment is an especially strong concrete anchor that recurs and charges the final image. However, the haven’s fantastical nature doesn’t really constrain choices; it’s more backdrop than active environment. Strong atmosphere, modest functional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    The nocturnal observatory, floating isle, and edge precipice are vivid and specific enough to anchor atmosphere and spatial logic. The floating isle and its edge meaningfully host the noon-shadow void, so environment is not purely ornamental. That said, the setting rarely constrains tactics or choices beyond “go to the edge at noon,” and sensory detail beyond the visual is sparse. The world’s rules (tethers, awakenings) are sketched more than lived-in, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    The hedge maze and secret garden are vividly rendered with selective, sensory detail (ivy and hawthorn, jasmine, glowing flowers, whispering trees) that supports the piece’s tone. The environment lightly constrains action—the maze “tests” her resolve and the fountain is the sole site of power and sacrifice. The recurring tooth-as-object and its final transformation into a star nicely charge the closing image. At an elite level, one more moment where the environment actively alters her options (rather than atmospherically reflecting them) would deepen its functional role.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.5)
    The serpentine grotto, mist, luminescent moss, and echoes of the sea are vivid and sensorially grounded, giving the piece a strong, cohesive atmosphere. Details like the mist “wrapping” her and the serpentine walls feel purposeful and in character with Lira’s meditative focus. The sea glass functions as a micro-setting object, charging the final image when it amplifies the moonlight. However, the environment mostly decorates rather than constrains choices; it shapes mood more than tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned data center turned moss garden is vivid, tactile, and thematically charged, from moss on servers to mineral streaks from icicles. Setting details arrive through Elara’s sensibility (“nature’s embroidery”) and evolve with the emotional beats, culminating in the amber sunset that fuses environment with her pendant and healing. The space doesn’t physically constrain action, but it powerfully shapes what’s possible emotionally—silence, protection, and then a shared hush. The final image of them sitting amid the whispering moss gives the environment decisive closing weight.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “feral nexus in mist,” the heavy air, and especially the tree hung with glowing shells are vividly rendered and tightly thematized with memory and hope. The environment actively shapes experience: the mist conceals and then reveals a path, and the nexus palpably “responds” to the shell’s light, guiding her deeper. The recurring seashell motif functions as a micro-setting object that directly charges the final image when she places it on the tree. A touch more concrete, non-mystical sensory detail could have grounded the lyricism further, but the atmosphere is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    The verdant arbor, workshop curiosities, and harvest moon are vividly and consistently rendered, giving the piece a strong, coherent atmosphere. Details like the glowing liquids, parchment scraps, and the pulsing vine tendril are concrete and integrated into the ritual action. The environment lightly shapes the magic (moonlight, dawn, vines), though it rarely constrains choice in a way that alters tactics. Overall, setting is a clear strength, even if not fully weaponized against the character.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    The withered orchard in a subarctic crater is vivid, specific, and tonally aligned with the ritual’s austerity; details like frost-kissed ground and ghostly moonlight are evocative and well-filtered through Elara’s work. The environment subtly mirrors the stakes (withering vs. safekept starlight) and the final image of the glowing plate transforming the orchard’s atmosphere lands strongly. That said, the setting rarely constrains tactics or presents practical obstacles; it’s more atmospheric than structurally necessary. Still, for a lyric-leaning piece, the integration of setting and mood is a clear strength.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.5)
    The marble cavern with veins of silver and gold, reflective stone, and twilight seepage is vivid and thematically apt, tying directly into reflection angles and the echo-harvest concept. Setting details are sensibly filtered through Elias’s occupational focus on mechanisms and light. The environment meaningfully participates in the breakthrough at dusk and charges the final hum-filled, shimmering image. It’s evocative and integrated, though the cavern doesn’t much constrain his options beyond providing the reflective lab.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bronze grotto, starlight, damp earth, and metallic tang are vivid and consistent, with the lamp and ceiling constellations effectively integrated into action and mood. The environment mirrors inner states (thawing earth as awakening, starlight pulsing with her breathing) and contributes strongly to the atmosphere. While the setting doesn’t tightly constrain physical options, it does charge the final image with a convincing, specific ambiance. This is high-level atmospheric work, slightly shy of top-tier because it shapes tone more than concrete choice.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.0)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft, tools, and kettle create a vivid, coherent micro-world filtered through Elara’s perception. Details like the diffused skylight, the metal bucket, and the “hauntingly practical” arrangement of tools effectively mirror her emotional state without feeling like a tourist catalog. The setting recurs and modulates through the piece, culminating in the final “rust-hued” light that charges the ending image. It rarely constrains concrete options, which keeps it just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.5)
    The kinetic lagoon above the clouds and the halted carousel are vivid, tonally apt images that anchor a distinctive atmosphere. Setting details (mud, currents, clouds parting, moon) are filtered through Mara’s priorities and mirror her inner fragmentation without becoming over-explained. The lagoon and elevation subtly charge the closure image but rarely constrain tactics or choices beyond serving as a landscape of ruins. As a result, the setting is memorable and thematically consonant but not yet fully weaponized against the character.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    The abandoned spaceport is concretely sketched—cracked tiles, torn banners, broken vents—and the sense of vacancy after the carnival supports the elegiac tone. Environmental details like airflow, vents, mirrors, and speakers are integrated into Eli’s tactics, not just described. However, the setting rarely constrains his options or imposes real risk; it behaves almost entirely as pliable canvas for his experiment. The sextant as object-set piece meaningfully charges the final image but doesn’t fully transform his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sanctuary, forecourt, crystals, and clocks are sensuously rendered and strongly integrated into mood and theme; details like the translucent stones after rain and the frozen clock face feel lived-in and specific. The environment subtly mirrors Elara’s internal state—the “glacial hush” as both comfort and cage—and the recurring sites (forecourt, largest clock) return charged at the end. However, setting rarely constrains action or tactics beyond atmosphere; she could make the same decision in a differently-described quiet workshop. Rich, purposeful description earns a high score, but it stops short of being structurally indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    The twilight barge canal is vividly evoked—the abandoned, rotting barges, damp earth, and hum of distant machinery create a strong atmosphere. Detail is generally purposeful, mirroring the theme of faded systems and buried truths. The sundial and canal together lightly charge the final image, but the environment doesn’t significantly constrain her tactics or force distinct choices. As a result, setting is atmospherically strong yet more scenic than structurally integral.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dock, snow, fog, and harbor are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Elara’s contemplative gaze, producing a convincing atmosphere. The fulgurite glass and the rope’s knot patterns act as micro-settings/objects that recur and charge the final image. However, the environment is more backdrop and mood than a functional constraint on choice—weather and location don’t significantly alter tactics. Despite that, the sensory layering is above-average and tonally cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    The shadowed autumn garden is vividly rendered—crisp air, fallen leaves, dappling light, woodsmoke—and consistently filters through the traveler’s perceptions. The setting resonates with the emotional state (“lonesome splendor”) and concept of explained absences, and the closing image of stars as “tiny obituaries” elegantly extends space into the thematic frame. While the garden doesn’t materially constrain physical choices, it clearly charges the mood and final image. The specificity and integration are very strong, just shy of using environment as an active tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The suspended palace, stalactites, and luminescent fungi create a vivid, atmospheric setting that feels genuinely otherworldly. Details are selective and purposeful, especially in the descent to the blue-lit cavern and the black stone pedestal. However, the environment rarely constrains Kael’s options or tactics; the palace’s suspension is evocative but not dramatized as a physical pressure on his choices. The setting strongly enriches tone and mood, but stops short of being structurally indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    The volcanic beach, black sand, dunes, and obsidian lagoon are vividly and economically rendered, with details like “kelp drifting in the lagoon’s depths” and the “migration of clouds” doing strong atmospheric work. Setting is filtered through Elara’s concerns (sterile sand, reflective lagoon) and entwined with the thematic act of grafting life into barrenness. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain options, it clearly charges the central action and the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    The city of dried fountains, stalled clock tower, mossed basins, and whispering cobblestones produces a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels particular to this story. Setting is not just decorative: the dead fountains and frozen clock materially embody the “stuck” state the plot seeks to change, and the final reanimation of water charges the ending image. Environmental details are well-filtered through Elara’s sensibility and maintain a consistent, slightly numinous tone. A touch more tactile or sensory variety under peak beats (beyond the visual and conceptual) could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    The nebula garden and its bioluminescent blooms are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s perception. Setting details (falling petals, liquid-silver light) are integrated with action and the final image, giving the environment a real presence rather than a backdrop. The garden supplies the key resource for solving the problem (non-burning light), and its “troubling serenity” aligns with the story’s meditative pressure. Still, the environment rarely constrains choice or movement, keeping this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ancient greenhouse, dusk light, butterflies, stone, and glass panes are all vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The environment mirrors and deepens the theme: butterflies outside vs. ribbon pattern vs. carved stone, and the final image of panes reflecting stars reinforces a quiet, cosmic scale to her insight. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain her physical options, it does meaningfully charge her realizations and the ending mood. A slightly stronger sense of the greenhouse as a practical workspace (tools, physical constraints) could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.5)
    The obsidian ridge, the whispering sea, and the mechanical interior of the clock tower are vividly rendered and tonally cohesive with the story’s meditative mood. The pendulum bob and the tower function as a micro-setting that mirrors and charges the thematic concern with balance and time. However, the environment rarely constrains or enables specific choices; it is more metaphorical stage than active pressure. Strong atmosphere, but one step short of using setting as a true dramatic lever.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.0)
    The cemetery, cobalt silo, and star-lit atmosphere are vividly and economically rendered, with sensory detail (“damp earth and forgotten stories”) tied to Elias’s sensibility. The recurring objects (silo, stars, sovereign case) do charge the final image somewhat, though they rarely constrain choice. Overall the setting feels specific and tonal rather than tactically consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vividly sketched and recur meaningfully, with the spire’s glow and the thawing world charging the final image. Environmental details (crisp air, scent of pine, reflective surfaces) support the contemplative, liminal mood and mirror the story’s concern with stasis vs. change. That said, the setting doesn’t truly constrain action or force specific choices; it’s more an evocative backdrop than an active pressure. For elite publication, the world would need to do more than mirror theme—it would need to shape tactics or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    The attic room, misted windows, manuscripts, and the glowing shortwave radio create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that is strongly filtered through Clara’s sensibility (“ember alcove in mist”). Environmental detail is selective and supports the tone of hushed, haunted work. The radio glow and the mist both subtly mirror the intrusion of story back into a silenced world and charge the final sense of the room as a “threshold.” The setting doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but it meaningfully frames and deepens the central moments.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    The gallery, porcelain mask, rocking chair, and ash are all vividly, coherently rendered and recur in a way that charges the atmosphere. Details are well-filtered through Elara’s sensibility—she notices fragility, brokenness, and light on jagged edges—which supports tone and theme. The mask and chair in particular evolve from mere objects to witnesses/participants in the ritual and final image. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain choices, it meaningfully frames and deepens the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sewer and sunken city ruins are vividly and coherently rendered—the rot, damp stone, flooded streets, and “sedimentary layers” give a clear sense of place and history. Details are usually filtered through Kael’s priorities as a scavenger-philosopher, which adds some specificity. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics in a way that tightens decisions; the collapse is reported, not experienced, so physical stakes remain abstract. The cog functions as a recurring object with some charge but doesn’t fully anchor the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    The velvet library with stained glass and autumn light is vivid, sensorial, and consistently threaded through the piece, establishing both physical and emotional atmosphere. The recurring object-as-setting, the zither rosette, is well integrated and meaningfully charges the final image as a “beacon of hope.” The environment doesn’t heavily constrain choices, but it does thematically mirror neglect versus revival, and its transformation from mausoleum to cathedral of sound is central to the story’s effect. Detail remains selective and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    The rusted greenhouse and forgotten botanical gardens are vividly sketched and tonally aligned with themes of neglect and regeneration. Details like twisted iron, rust “like scars,” and overgrown vines create a strong atmosphere without bogging the scene down. The environment influences symbolism more than concrete options; very little in the setting materially constrains her tactics beyond being an evocative ruin. The final image of the transformed greenhouse does reweight the earlier decay, which helps the category.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lightning collection tower, nectar dusk sky, and subterranean chamber are vividly sketched and consistent, giving a coherent soft-sf atmosphere. The lacquer box and orb function as charged objects, and the tower’s transformation from relic to reawakened structure enriches the final image. Setting, however, rarely constrains tactics or complicates action; the descent is atmospherically cold and dark but not dangerous. The world’s rules (drone hive, lightning harvesting) are sketched efficiently but could more strongly influence immediate choices.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.5)
    The bay, dawn light, and streetlights “daydreaming” create a strong, unified atmosphere that matches the interior hush and reverence. Details like the quiet waters, whispering winds, and later the watching houses are well-filtered through Elias’s sensibility. The environment supports tone and theme but doesn’t significantly constrain choice or action—it could almost be any quiet liminal place. Still, the setting is vivid, consistent, and meaningfully echoed in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    The underwater city garden is evocative—the coral arches, seaweed, and crumbling fountains create a strong mood that fits the still, contemplative tone. The setting enhances Liora’s isolation and timelessness, and the buried ampoule in the final image works as a quiet, resonant touch. However, the environment mostly functions atmospherically rather than as a constraint on choices or tactics. The underwater specifics rarely alter what the characters can do beyond providing a dreamlike backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    The infinite staircase, with its sideways-into-eternity steps and chalked equations, is vivid and thematically charged, and the rule that she cannot retrace her steps concretely shapes the plot when the die falls. Environmental details like pulsing walls and humming theorems are filtered through her obsessions and mood, reinforcing the atmosphere of “boundless confinement.” The setting evolves slightly (the geometry shifting, narrowing then expanding) in response to her progress, which adds a subtle sense of test and pressure. It’s rich and purposeful, though not quite exploiting all possible tactile or constraint-driven opportunities.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rooftop greenhouse and smog-choked city are vividly drawn, with strong sensory contrast when the smog lifts to reveal a crisp, jasmine-scented night. Setting is filtered through Elara’s artistic, nocturnal gaze, and the moonlit glasshouse nicely mirrors the theme of fragile, enclosed memory. The environment doesn’t significantly constrain her choices—it mainly frames and amplifies the mood and magic rather than forcing tactics. Still, the greenhouse and moonlight meaningfully charge the final image enough for a solid score.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    The grotto city behind a waterfall with bioluminescent fungi is vividly evoked and tonally integrated with the story’s damp, enclosed mood. Setting details like mist, roar of the falls, and stone arches recur and charge key images, especially the final moment with the emerald lens reflecting cascading water. The environment, however, functions more as atmosphere than as a constraint on choices—Verdania could, in practice, be swapped for another enclosed refuge with minor alterations. Still, the specificity is strong enough to feel memorable and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and sensorial—the smell of “salt and decay,” the rocky spine at low tide, and the tomb-like lighthouse all build a strong, unified atmosphere. Details are filtered through Elias’s perspective as a mechanic (gears, mechanisms) in a way that feels motivated. The environment plays some role in the story’s logic—the tide exposes the stone, and the lighthouse’s machinery becomes the final image once reversed. Still, the setting mostly frames mood rather than tightly constraining tactics or choices, which keeps it just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned carnival funhouse is vividly evoked—warped mirrors, creaking floors, spinning clocks—and these features mirror and externalize Clara’s psychic state as she progresses inward. Recurring elements like the lingering luminance and shattered mirrors evolve with the arc, especially as the luminance intensifies and then dissipates at the climax. Setting is mostly atmospheric rather than constraining concrete choices, but it does provide a clear sense of spatial and emotional deepening. The final contrast between the fading funhouse and the sunlight outside gives the environment a satisfying role in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    The floating orchard on driftwood in the blue hour is vivid, specific, and consistently woven through action (swaying with waves, leaves whispering, sound echoing across water). The environment mirrors and amplifies the mood of fragile, suspended harmony, and the tools (driftwood, seashell xylophone) feel organically of this place. However, the setting rarely constrains choices; it frames and colors rather than forcing tactics. Still, the atmosphere is rich and memorable, clearly above-average.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    The city on gargantuan turtles, cracked shells as cobblestones, and the spiral tunnel with glowing symbols all feel vivid and integrated rather than postcard-like. Setting actively shapes the plot: the crack in the shell, the hidden tunnel, and the later mission to map the turtles’ interiors depend on this environment. The recurring objects (spiral shells, whistle) are embedded in the physical world and charged with history. A slightly broader sensory range beyond visual and abstract “dread” could deepen immersion even further.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    The abandoned, ivy-swallowed station and the rosebush provide a strong, atmospheric frame, with recurring images (rose, mirror, archive) echoing the themes of decay and buried truth. Details like the cracked mirror and rusted tracks feel purposeful rather than touristic. The setting, however, rarely constrains choices or tactics; it mainly supports mood and symbolism. Still, the final image of the bare rosebush nicely charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lagoon and submerged pavilion are vividly realized through concrete, sensory detail—“boots sinking into the damp sand,” “stone arches half-buried in silt,” “pillars bore carvings of hands reaching upward.” The environment shapes action (wading, wrestling up the journal, working in water) and culminates in the starry mosaic, which charges the final sense of connection and rekindled dreams. Detail is selective and thematically tuned rather than touristic. This is a strong, atmospheric setting that meaningfully supports the story without quite turning environment into an active constraint at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and specific: bioluminescent algae, crumbling stone, sunken city, and shifting library walls create a strong atmosphere. Details are generally filtered through Elara’s purpose—shelves, margins, foundations, map—rather than feeling like a tourist catalog. The library and blackout environment meaningfully enable the discovery (hidden passages, isolation, absence of light as condition for revelation). However, those environmental constraints rarely force difficult tactical choices; they support tone more than genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.3)
    The floating island tea garden, mist, dreamstones, and glass basilica are vivid and sensorially specific without devolving into a tourist catalog. The basilica especially functions as more than décor: its humming, light, and stored dreams constrain where Kael must go to confront truth and charge the epiphany image. Environmental detail generally tracks his priorities (craft bench early, basilica later) and mirrors his internal state with some subtlety. The tea garden itself is more atmospheric than functional, but this doesn’t damage clarity or tone.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    The floating observatory and geode-lined walls are vivid, specific, and tonally integrated, with the geode in particular becoming a charged object that anchors the final image. Sensory detail (“scent of ash and char,” “electromagnetic fields that hummed,” “miniature universe of quartz and amethyst”) is purposeful and filtered through Zara’s concerns. The environment supports theme more than it constrains action, but the metaphor of a space “suspended between earth and sky” effectively mirrors her liminal state. This is strong atmospheric work, if not yet fully weaponized as a source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    The observatory is vividly and coherently rendered, with tactile elements like “cracked stained-glass windows,” “ancient astrolabes,” and a “labyrinth of forgotten relics” that are used as waypoints rather than static décor. Setting and tools (tower, vault, star charts) directly shape the search pattern for the chip pieces and support the star-trail motif. Sensory range leans heavily visual; smell and temperature appear but could do more work under pressure. The environment doesn’t significantly constrain his choices or impose cost, which limits the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt terrace, forgotten shore, driftwood carvings, and sensory details (“scent of salt and decay,” “fractured tiles”) are vivid, thematically aligned, and consistently filtered through Elias’s state. Environment is not just backdrop: the descent, the carvings, and especially the clock-shaped driftwood physically scaffold his reckoning and the key memory. The recurring terrace image at the end reweights earlier description to mirror his fractured soul. This is rich, economical setting work that serves mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    The storm-worn parapet, mist, and cold air create a strong, unified atmosphere that matches the emotional temperature of the scene. Environmental detail is selective and purposeful (e.g., mist parting to reveal Kael, the lantern light on the drawer pull) and the weather feels present rather than decorative. However, the setting rarely constrains choices or tactics; it’s evocative more than operative. This keeps it from feeling fully integrated into the stakes rather than mainly tonal.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coastal launch is sensorially grounded (salt, seaweed, utility poles, dawn light) and feels lived-in rather than postcard-generic. Setting details are filtered through Mara’s navigator mindset, especially the utility poles as improvised wayfinding and the launch as a threshold space. The environment supports theme and choice—she can only take this particular kind of risk because this liminal shoreline exists—but it rarely constrains her options in a hard way. Still, the final horizon-and-water image is strongly charged by the established space.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    The underground bioluminescent lake is vivid, sensorially specific, and integrated with action—the glow, fish, and carved symbols all mediate his descent and realization. The environment is not merely decorative; it pulls him in, visually echoes the “galaxy” / labyrinth of choices, and charges the final image as he leaves with its glow in his eyes. World rules (bioluminescence, carvings, repository of stories) are consistent at this scale. A bit more tactile or auditory texture under stress could push it higher, but it already reads as a strong, purposeful setting.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    The orchard under permanent moonlight, star-like fruit, and the spice-thick air create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that clearly situates the action. Sensory detail—especially smell and light—is purposeful, tying into Elara’s magic and the tone. However, the environment mostly supports mood rather than constraining tactics or choices beyond guiding her via scent. It’s strong, polished scene-setting, but the world’s rules and the “permanent moonlight” don’t materially affect the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    The midnight glade above the clouds and crystalline canopy are vividly realized and tonally consistent, and the environment feels integrated rather than merely decorative. The dolls’ saucer functions as a micro-setting object that structures perception and charges the final image. Atmosphere (“choking beauty,” humming porcelain, pulsing glade) strongly mirrors her emotional state without slipping into confusion. The setting could constrain her options more directly, but at this length its symbolic and emotional work is robust.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.0)
    The recycled spaceship and the scarred golden dimension are evoked with a few vivid, selective details (patched hull, humming engines, ruins of a once-great civilization), anchoring place and tone. Kwan Yin’s Tear and the ship’s core function as micro-setting elements, especially during the portal-opening sequence. Still, environment seldom constrains tactics or meaningfully alters what she can do; it mostly provides an atmospheric backdrop and symbolic reinforcement. The setting is solid, but not yet fully leveraged as pressure or choice architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    The black sand beach, sulfurous air, and looming volcano are vivid and tonally apt, with the hidden cove and natural archway elegantly staging the climactic vision. Setting is filtered plausibly through Elara’s sensibility and returns meaningfully in the last image (bugs joining stars over beach and volcano). The environment subtly guides choice—the volcano pilgrimage versus shoreline detour—without ever becoming a mere postcard. It falls just shy of the very top tier because the physical constraints of place don’t significantly complicate tactics or deepen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fort at twilight, the failed enchanted lanterns, and the half-painted sundial create a persuasive, atmospheric space that feels specific to this world. Setting details are generally filtered through Elara’s professional eye (the courtyard, her post, the sundial’s markings), which sharpens POV. Crucially, the sundial and blackout are not just décor—they’re functional mechanisms that guide discovery and constrain tactics. A slightly broader sensory range or more tactile engagement with the space under peak tension could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tidal bluff, aurora, and eel-filled water are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through Kael’s pattern-obsessed gaze, giving the world a tactile, numinous feel. Setting isn’t mere backdrop: the aurora pauses and then surges, the bluff trembles, and the environment visibly responds to his actions, charging the ritual and the final image. The recurrence of auroral “borrowed dawn” light and the tidal edge as liminal space underpins the story’s atmosphere and thematic concerns. A slightly stronger sense of physical risk from the bluff or sea could have pushed the setting into even more active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    The observatory above the clouds, the stormlight on the glass dome, and the darkroom timer create a strong, atmospheric frame that feels specific rather than generic. Weather and architecture mirror and slightly pressure Elara’s choices—storm as goad, isolation as crucible—but they rarely constrain concrete tactics beyond tone. Details are filtered through Elara’s sensibility in a mostly disciplined way, avoiding tourist-list description. The closing image of the storm as audience and the observatory as “stage” effectively charges the setting in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.0)
    The glass atrium, brook, and prismatic light are vividly rendered and give the piece a strong visual atmosphere aligned with its cerebral tone. The sundial and needle card are anchored spatially, and the setting remains coherent throughout. However, the environment rarely constrains action or choice; it decorates the debate rather than pressing on it. The setting’s recurrence at the end is thematic rather than tactical, which limits its narrative power.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.5)
    The city of decay, the “rusted library beneath the stars,” and the prison library are sensorially and tonally strong, with dust, sagging shelves, and iron gates all well chosen and filtered through Elias’s sensibility. Setting consistently mirrors theme—the derelict library becomes the physical site of “blooming resistance” and the glowing final image works nicely. Still, the environment rarely constrains action or tactics; it’s a charged backdrop more than an active pressure. The coffee tin and rooftop are evocative but not leveraged to force specific decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.0)
    The tidal arbor, floating islands, compass-studded trunk, and archive chamber produce a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s strongly filtered through Elara’s attention. Setting elements recur meaningfully: the arbor’s heart houses the reel, and at the end the arbor “sighs” and the compasses and horizon help charge the final image. The emphasis is mostly visual, but the selectivity and integration with theme offset that.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.0)
    The island, ridge in bloom, and monsoon season are vividly sketched with consistent atmospheric tone. Details like blooms breathing with Elara and the Grove of Echoes give a clear, if somewhat familiar, fantasy texture. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or introduces tangible risk; it mostly decorates the quest rather than shaping it. The final image of the tree in the rain is effective but could be more deeply tied to earlier environmental specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    The islet, cottage, cove, post-rain air, and tides are vividly drawn and strongly filtered through Elias’s sensibility. Environment isn’t just backdrop: the rocks, hidden cove, and rising tide actively shape his path and the ritual dissolution of the letters. The recurring sea/tide imagery culminates in the ocean absorbing sorrow, charging the final understanding. A touch less atmospheric redundancy could sharpen impact, but the setting work is publication-ready.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.6)
    Atmospheric details like "brackish water" and "skeletal frame" effectively establish the mood, but the setting remains a static backdrop. The environment does not exert active pressure or force trade-offs in the protagonist's physical actions.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is legible but relies on generic fantasy imagery ("bioluminescent moss," "silence hummed"). Descriptions are ornamental rather than constraining choice; the environment yields convenient clues without resisting the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "winterglass conservatory" offers a distinct visual anchor, and the image of plants "clinging to glass" effectively mirrors the characters' state. However, the atmosphere relies heavily on standard descriptors ("muted grays," "frosted ferns") rather than specific, tactile interaction with the environment to drive the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=3.2)
    The physical rules of the setting are contradictory, causing severe disorientation. Elias's breath fogs glass (implying a dry, air-filled space), yet he later "dives" into murk and algae waterfalls to retrieve items (implying total submersion). This incoherence between a dry habitat and a flooded ruin breaks immersion and obscures the constraints of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is functional and clear, with the arbor and ridge providing a stable backdrop. However, descriptions lean on generic atmospheric clichés ("wind whispered secrets," "ghost through the night") rather than specific, sensory details that constrain the characters' actions or reflect the grit of the sanctions.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.8)
    Descriptions are heavy with purple prose ("skeletal ribcage," "bled into hues") and rely on abstract adjectives rather than grounding, specific details. While the setting is visually described, it functions only as a container for the quest items, lacking distinct physical constraints that shape the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.3)
    Descriptions rely on abstract intensifiers ("ancient," "otherworldly," "ethereal") rather than specific, grounding sensory details. The concept of "hyperbolic geometry" is stated as a label but not visually realized beyond generic "warping."

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.8)
    Atmosphere relies heavily on weary clichés ("creaked like an old man’s bones," "fluttering like ghosts") that render the setting generic. The "dusty corner" and "rotted floor" lack the sensory specificity required to ground the reader in a unique physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, offering vivid and specific imagery ("skeletal remains," "warped and cracked"). The sunken orchard environment meaningfully constrains the atmosphere and provides the necessary materials (shipwrecks) for the protagonist's goal.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.2)
    Setting details are generic ("bathed in moonlight," "cold stone," "glowing faintly") and serve as passive backdrop rather than constraining action. The "emerald station" provides no specific physical obstacles or resources that shape the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=3.4)
    Major verisimilitude failure: glassblowing requires an industrial furnace/heat source, which is implausible in an abandoned, unpowered control room without explanation. Sensory details are generic ("fire's kiss," "dust-laden") rather than specific.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting consists of generic atmospheric descriptors ("iron beams," "dusty table," "room filled with mirrors") that do not constrain action or provide specific sensory grounding. The "rusted library" is a backdrop rather than an interactive environment; the geography is vague, functioning like a video game level (find item -> open door -> win) rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.1)
    Atmospheric descriptions ("weathered stones," "howling winds") establish a consistent mood but remain generic to the fantasy genre. The setting functions as a backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint; the oracle interacts with the "hush" rather than the physical reality of the fort.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting relies on standard atmospheric tropes ("eerily still," "pale blue light," "cobblestones") without tactile specificity. While the violin is a clear image, the environment dissolves into generic abstraction ("surreal glow") during the climax rather than constraining action.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting relies heavily on pathetic fallacy ("crystals whispered approval," "stories of trust broken"), doing the emotional work for the characters. While the sensory details (petrichor, hum) are present, the environment feels ornamental rather than a source of pressure or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting consists of generic signifiers ("lush greenery," "twisting paths") rather than specific, tactile details that constrain the character's choices. The "measurable luck" world-building element is not integrated into the physical environment or atmosphere, leaving the setting feeling like a standard backdrop rather than an active force.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is functional but relies on generic sci-fi tropes like "gleaming surfaces" and "holographic displays." While the "hush of beating wings" attempts atmosphere, the environment acts largely as wallpaper rather than a source of constraints or resources that shape the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is established but relies on generic Gothic signifiers ("flickering lanterns," "wreckage") without specific sensory grounding. The physics of the flooded pit are loosely handled and do not constrain the character's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.7)
    The mountain station provides a functional atmospheric backdrop, and the botanical illustration serves effectively as a grounding micro-setting. However, the sensory details often lean into abstraction ("scent of ozone," "creak of aging beams") rather than specific, lived-in interaction. The "auroral sorrow" descriptor feels imposed rather than evoked by the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on "abandoned place" starter-pack tropes (damp earth, rusted metal, flickering flashlight) rather than specific, singular details. While functional for orientation, the environment acts as a passive backdrop rather than a pressure cooker that constrains the protagonist's tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy tropes ("ancient tomes," "twisted roots," "obsidian") and abstract sensory details ("scent of... forgotten memories") that fail to ground the reader. Spatial logic is fuzzy; the refuge is described as being "outside" and visible, yet requires a map and a journey through catacombs to reach, creating orientation confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is rendered through abstract, purple phrasing ("whispers of ancient stories," "hush of dreaming roots") rather than concrete, grounding detail. The environment feels like a generic backdrop for the lesson rather than a physical space that pressures the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=3.8)

The setting does not pressure the protagonist or influence the plot beyond providing a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=3.0)
    The setting suffers from "white-room syndrome," defined by abstract concepts ("vast and enigmatic," "unraveled stillness") rather than sensory particulars. The environment feels like a metaphorical construct that does not constrain the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting offers a cohesive atmospheric aesthetic ("glass spire," "frozen lake"), but the imagery leans heavily on generic fantasy tropes. The environment functions as a backdrop for the mood rather than a source of friction or constraint that forces specific tactical choices from the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting opens with generic sensory markers ("scent of wet asphalt," "ribbon of light") that fail to establish a specific, lived-in atmosphere. While the "fractals" concept is visual, the environment remains abstract and does not constrain the character’s choices or tactics. The "labyrinth" feels like a metaphorical white room rather than a physical space with texture and resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting consists of generic atmosphere ("flickering torches," "stone walls") that does not constrain action. The "rustle of turning seasons" is a repeated poetic phrase rather than a concrete environmental pressure that affects the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.2)
    The terra-cotta grotto is visualized with solid sensory detail that grounds the abstract premise ("whispering shadows," "shifting patterns"). The environment functionally constrains the protagonist’s actions through the mandatory interaction with the wall patterns and mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.4)
    The imagery of the sunken greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is evocative and distinct, anchoring the scene well. However, the spatial logic of shipwrecks surrounding a greenhouse in a rainforest remains slightly opaque without cues regarding water levels or geography. The setting establishes mood effectively but operates more as a backdrop than a constraint on action.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.7)

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is visually ornamental ("crystalline," "shimmering," "prism-like") but lacks tactile physics that constrain action. The environment functions as a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker for the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.2)
    The rooftop canal system offers a specific, interesting visual, but the "Heart of Cadence" dissolves into generic fantasy tropes (golden light, still pool). The setting serves as a backdrop rather than a source of constraints or resources that shape the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting consists of generic fantasy tropes ("otherworldly light," "vast underground cavern") that serve as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint. The "mosaic stepping stone" appears conveniently when needed rather than being an integrated part of a hostile or complex environment.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.5)
    Atmosphere relies heavily on the repeated "sapphire hush" phrase and generic descriptors ("aged carpet," "metallic veins") rather than specific, grounded details. The spatial geography between the pipe chases and the library aisles is vague, missing an opportunity to use the setting to constrain movement.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on pathetic fallacy, with the storm perfectly mirroring internal turbulence in a cliché manner ("kissed by the rain," "sanctuary," "cage"). While the nursery is physically present, the sensory details are generic and do not constrain the character's choices or utilize the specific tools and logistics of the trade. The environment functions as a backdrop for reflection rather than a source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting consists of standard post-apocalyptic tropes ("bioluminescent algae," "sunken ruin") used as a static backdrop. The specific physical constraints of the tidal island do not pressure the protagonist's choices or tactics.

    The setting consists of generic high-fantasy tropes ("shimmering," "ancient melodies") that provide a backdrop but fail to constrain choice or offer tactile specificity. The "musical" aspect is described with adjectives rather than sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is established with functional but standard sensory details ("scent of salt and petrichor," "timbers splintered"). While the atmosphere is coherent, the environment serves as a passive backdrop rather than an active force that constrains tactics or creates obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.3)
    The setting consists of generic fantasy tropes ("whispering forests," "rolling hills," "shimmering like starlight") without specific, grounding textures. The "fortress of unspoken truths" remains an abstract concept rather than a vivid, inhabited space.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.8)

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=3.2)
    The "prismatic escondite" acts as a vague, colorful backdrop rather than a specific place with physical constraints that shape the action. Descriptors like "infinite hues" and "fractured light" provide visual noise but fail to ground the scene in a tactile, navigable reality. The setting does not pressure the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is anchored with functional sensory details (formaldehyde, marble) that establish a clear location. However, the environment operates largely as a backdrop rather than a constraint; the specific tools and atmosphere do not pressure the characters' tactics beyond the presence of the ink pot.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting of the mountaintop bonsai labyrinth is evocative, with sensory details like the "scent of pine" and "moss-covered ground" effectively grounding the atmosphere. However, the juxtaposition of the "fluorescent lamp" and the natural setting feels underdeveloped as a source of friction or meaning. While the atmosphere is strong, the setting acts largely as a backdrop rather than a constraint that forces specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on generic descriptors ("towering labyrinth," "rusted frames") and list-like details ("watch," "photograph"). While the environment provides a mood, it fails to constrain the protagonist’s choices or force tactical trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting relies on generic "abandoned" tropes (dust, moss, creaking boards, howling wind) rather than specific, choice-constraining details. The logic of a "half-finished" cello producing perfect, resonant music breaks physical credibility within the established reality.

The underwater environment feels like a backdrop rather than a physical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.6)
    Atmospheric details like the "jagged reef" and "scuffed door" work well to ground the opening. However, key elements like the "lattice sustaining impossibilities" remain abstract labels rather than concrete, sensory realities that constrain the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.4)
    The setting relies on gothic clichés ("shrouded aisles," "twisted like the arms of a mourner") and abstract modifiers ("alchemical") without concrete grounding or sensory specificity. The environment functions as a static, atmospheric backdrop rather than a constraint that forces tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.8)

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.0)
    The visual concept of painting on fog is distinct, but the "orchard" setting is largely nominal, described with generic markers like "crumbling walls" and "twisted trees." The "knowledge network" functions as a convenient black box rather than a tangible, grounded part of the world.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.2)

    While the greenhouse setting is established with some sensory detail ("damp earth and jasmine"), the descriptions often lean on generic atmospheric markers ("shifting shadows," "labyrinth of glass"). The "warping" effect feels like forced atmosphere rather than organic perception.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the "gargantuan shell" is a central image, the description remains abstract ("muted tones," "ancient walls") and offers no physical constraints to the character. The setting functions as a passive, helpful backdrop rather than a tangible environment that shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting is descriptive but relies on standard high-fantasy adjectives ("shimmering," "crystalline," "luminous") that create a decorative backdrop rather than a constraining environment.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is atmospheric but described in vague, repetitive terms ("fractured hush," "prism," "light"). The "butterfly effect" reference implies a speculative genre context that clashes with the intimate, dream-like tone of the rest of the piece. The environment functions as a "deus ex machina" to deliver the epiphany rather than a place offering resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=2.4)
    The setting collapses under basic scientific illiteracy; deep-sea environments do not admit "sunrise" to the bottom, nor can a pressurized facility survive "cracked" domes or sustain "fireflies" (insects) in the deep ocean. These contradictions transform the "research facility" into an incoherent dreamscape that violates the genre's contract.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=3.2)
    The "sea-foam" descriptor clashes with the dry, crystalline geode setting, creating a confused aesthetic that feels decorative rather than grounded. The environment is treated as a source of "shimmering" visuals but fails to constrain action or impact the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the "tidal arcade" is named, the specific sensory details ("hum of daily life," "eclectic mix") feel generic and interchangeable with any city square.

The altitude gauge is a strong prop candidate, but its physicality is subsumed by heavy-handed symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting is described with competent but standard fantasy imagery ("twisted like a serpent," "moss-covered stones"). The "climate shifts" element is mentioned as a backdrop but does not pressure the character or alter the physics of the scene. The "hidden chamber" lacks specific texture, relying on generic signifiers like a pedestal and a mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.8)

Sensory details like "sunlight fractured" are pleasant but ornamental; the environment does not constrain Elara’s choices or force a trade-off. The "echoing terrace" is a stage set rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting relies on generic signifiers ("ancient terrace," "blooming jasmine," "flickering like distant stars") without specific, tactile grounding. The environment feels like a stage backdrop rather than a pressure cooker influencing the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.8)
    The salt flat is visualized with some competency ("cracked mirror," "almost liquid"), but the description relies heavily on generic wasteland tropes. The setting serves as a passive backdrop rather than an active pressure on the protagonist's choices or movement.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting uses generic fantasy markers (crystals, starlight, snow) and abstract personification ("whisper secrets") rather than concrete, tactile details. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the mood rather than a source of constraints or resources for the action.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting description leans heavily on clichés ("silent sentinel," "whispers of forgotten conversations") that create a generic atmosphere rather than a specific, lived-in space. While the dome provides a backdrop, it does not constrain the character’s movement or choices; he could be in any quiet room and the scene would play out identically.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is a generic "verdant grotto" that fails to constrain action; the environment is treated as a backdrop for contemplation rather than a physical space affecting the work. Phrases like "blushing stillness" attempt atmosphere but read as forced synesthesia without sensory grounding. The location offers no resources or obstacles that shape the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=4.2)

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=3.5)
    Descriptions rely on generic adjectives ("ancient," "intricate," "otherworldly") rather than concrete sensory details that constrain action. The "ethereal grit" descriptor is a contradictory abstraction that fails to ground the scene physically.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=3.0)

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "ruined orchard" and "fog" establish a consistent, if familiar, atmospheric baseline that anchors the mood. However, descriptions rely on stock imagery ("gnarled trees," "shimmer of frost") rather than specific, tactile details that constrain the protagonist's options. The environment serves as a static backdrop for the magical elements rather than an active force pressing on the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.8)
    The juxtaposition of the lush orchard within the cathedral rafters is a vivid, grounding image that anchors the piece effectively. While the visual description is strong, the setting primarily functions as an atmospheric backdrop rather than a source of physical resistance or constraint on the protagonist's movements.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.8)
    The "astral orchard" provides vivid visual imagery, but the setting largely serves as a passive backdrop for internal monologue. The sudden inclusion of a "crystalline... bathroom" to satisfy a prompt constraint feels jarring and disconnects from the established atmospheric logic.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the labyrinthine library is established, descriptions lean on generic fantasy adjectives ("shadowed depths," "ancient volumes," "twisting corridors"). The setting shifts mechanically to provide obstacles but lacks a distinct, lived-in atmosphere or sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting relies on generic "spooky carnival" tropes ("rusted hull," "shattered mirrors," "scent of decay") without specific, tactile grounding. While the fog and ship are established, they serve as a static backdrop rather than an environmental pressure that constrains choice. The sensory details are frequent but stock, lacking a distinct POV filter.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is established but relies on steampunk/fantasy clichés ("gears and springs," "brass lamp," "ticking symphony") rather than specific, lived-in sensory details. The environment does not constrain the protagonist or offer resistance; instead, the room "felt alive" and yields its secrets immediately to her touch. The atmosphere is told via abstraction ("testament to centuries") rather than evoked.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting relies on generic high-fantasy descriptors ("shimmered," "crystalline," "pulsed") rather than tactile, grounding details. While the "crack patterns in ice" offer a specific visual, the environment largely functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure. The "harmonic" nature of the caves is asserted more than it is felt through sensory evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.1)
    The pavilion anchors the scene functionally, but descriptions rely on generic ruin tropes ("dust and neglect," "cracked but functional") rather than specific, lived-in details. The setting constrains the tool use (telescope) but does not otherwise pressure the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.2)

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=4.4)
    The setting uses "ethereal" descriptors ("vaulting hush," "thousand hues") that remain abstract and ornamental rather than constraining choice. The environment facilitates the solution too easily, lacking the resistance needed to generate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is described with heavy, generic adjectives ("kaleidoscopic," "bioluminescent," "surreal") rather than specific, grounded interaction. The environment functions as a backdrop for puzzles rather than a pressure cooker that constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy signifiers ("ancient trees," "starlight," "encroaching darkness") rather than specific, sensory grounding. The "ashen charcoal sanctuary" is an evocative name, but the environment lacks tactile presence or spatial clarity beyond the abstract threshold. The "white room" effect undermines the stakes, as the sanctuary feels like a backdrop rather than a lived-in place worth saving.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting alternates between a bioluminescent farm and a surreal dimension, but the descriptions rely on generic abstractions ("rivers of memory," "equations that shimmered") rather than sensory particulars that ground the reader. The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting relies on generic atmospheric filters ("sepia," "golden shadows," "aged paper") rather than concrete, specific details that ground the scene. The transition to the bridge is abrupt and lacks sensory logic, functioning only as a stage for the exposition. The description feels like a stock backdrop for a "mystery" mood rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.5)
    Visual details like the "bioluminescent vines" and "nightshade" create a distinct atmosphere, though the description leans toward the generic. The phrase "factually mystical light" is semantically jarring and disrupts the immersive quality of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is rendered through abstractions ("smelled of... forgotten promises") and generic markers ("manila folders," "dusty window") rather than specific, sensory grounding. The transformation of the room into a "sanctuary" at the end is asserted rather than earned through atmospheric shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=3.1)
    The setting is rendered with purple abstractions ("auric," "heavens had spilled their secrets") rather than grounding sensory details. The environment does not meaningfully constrain the character; the water merely "laps" or "resists" in a pathetic fallacy. The physics of the space—specifically the puddle reflections revealing a submerged path—are nonsensical.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is established with high-density description ("radiant," "luminescent," "ethereal"), but relies heavily on generic fantasy adjectives. While the environment reacts to the character (moss glowing, prism spinning), it functions more as a light show than a pressure cooker that constrains choice. The "vested hush" is inserted as a static descriptive label.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.5)
    The "ashen skyborne arbor" is a evocative concept, but the setting remains static and does not constrain the character's choices or tactics. Sensory details lean on generic adjectives ("ancient," "forgotten," "dim") rather than specific, grounded interactions with the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy staples ("crumbling stone walls," "bioluminescent fungi," "ancient city") that fail to constrain the protagonist's choices. The anthropomorphic elements ("leaves... urging him forward") lower the stakes by making the environment compliant rather than indifferent or obstructive.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the foundry provides a functional backdrop, descriptions often lean on clichés ("pale moonlight," "gaping mouth," "ancient oak"). The transition to the magical furnace unmoors the physical grounding established in the opening, turning the setting into a generic screen for visions.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy descriptors ("jagged rock," "shadowy," "whispering secrets") that do not constrain the characters' choices. The "hidden sunrise" framing is confusingly sequenced (appearing alongside "Tonight") and functions as a passive backdrop rather than an active environmental pressure. The sensory details are abstract ("luminous ache") rather than concrete and grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting uses generic, high-fantasy descriptors ("ethereal light," "pulsing like a living thing") that fail to ground the scene in sensory specificity. While the location is clear, the environment functions as a "pathetic fallacy" mirror that reflects the character's emotions rather than a concrete place offering constraints or resources. The ultraviolet aspect is repetitive description rather than a physical reality affecting vision or heat.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting relies on a catalog of fantasy tropes (burnt sage, copper, spires, ivy) that function as ornamental backdrops rather than constraining forces. While the "suspended platform" concept is visual, it does not affect Lila's movement or choices; the environment is a passive container for the action.

The "empathy virus" background adds flavor but remains mostly expository.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "opal dock" and "nautical twilight" provide a functional atmospheric anchor, though the setting functions more as a backdrop than a constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=4.1)
    The "spatially gifted" attribute is asserted but never used to navigate the "maze-like" farm; the setting remains atmospheric wallpaper rather than a source of physical constraints or tactical resources.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is vivid but relies on ornamental adjectives ("frost-kissed," "cobalt") and standard fantasy tropes rather than specific, grounded details.

    Atmospheric details like "ozone" and "cracked domes" establish a functional mood, though the transition to the spectral landscape feels abrupt. The setting serves as a backdrop rather than a source of constraint or friction for the protagonist’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting consists of generic descriptors ("soft, golden light," "jagged peak") that lack sensory specificity or atmospheric pressure. The integration of specific prompt objects (glass flake, scaffold structure) feels pasted onto a stock background rather than organically woven into the world.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting is established with standard "ruin" tropes (ivy, rust) but lacks specific sensory details that constrain the character's movement or choices. The "territorial markers" are mentioned as clues but never visualized or used mechanically in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.2)
    Setting details are generic ("intricate machinery," "vast dome") and do not constrain action or choice; the environment functions as a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "swirling orchard vortex" with the scent of "fruit and decay" is a creative, specific image that grounds the fantasy element. However, surrounding details drift into generic abstractions ("ancient power," "otherworldly glow," "erratic energy") that dilute the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy adjectives ("otherworldly," "ethereal," "ancient") rather than concrete, sensory particulars. While the "cobalt glade" provides a visual anchor, the maze and pedestal feel like standard video-game props rather than a lived-in environment that constrains the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "catacomb orchard" concept is evocative, effectively grounding the surrealism with specific details like roots snaking between bones. However, atmosphere occasionally drifts into generic fantasy tropes ("glow of half-lit corridors") rather than maintaining the unique grimness of the opening image.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.6)
    The quarry office setting is distinct in concept but rendered through standard atmospheric tropes ("faint hum of machinery," "dust and diesel"). The environment functions as a backdrop rather than a constraint; the setting details do not force specific tactics or shape the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.1)
    The "magnetic arbor" is described through generic abstractions ("shimmering," "unseen energies") rather than concrete, constraining details. The setting functions as a backdrop rather than an active force shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "tidal atrium" is described with pleasant but standard fantasy imagery ("bioluminescent runes," "shimmered like the ocean"). The specific "titan-gear" descriptor clashes with the soft, nature-magic aesthetic of the bamboo creel and tidal pool, creating a disconnect in world-building logic.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy descriptors ("luminous walls," "veins of quartz") rather than grounded sensory details relevant to a bunker inspection. The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is atmospheric but rendered with heavy clichés ("silent sentinel," "cathedral of decay") that dull its specificity. The "gleezing" typo in the opening sentence disrupts immersion immediately, and the environment serves as a passive backdrop rather than forcing constraints on the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.1)
    Descriptions are competent but rely on fantasy stock imagery ("ethereal light," "impenetrable fog," "old parchment"). The setting feels like a static stage set rather than a pressure cooker. Specific sensory details are often clichés ("parting... like a curtain").

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is established with adjectival density ("velvet," "brass," "ice crystal") but lacks spatial coherence or sensory immediacy beyond the visual. The "velvet observatory" feels like a stage set decorated with prompt words rather than a lived-in environment that pressures the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting consists of generic high-fantasy descriptors ("shimmering," "crystalline," "ethereal") that fail to constrain action or ground the scene physically. The "skyborne grotto" is a passive backdrop rather than an active force shaping the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is a generic &quot;white room&quot; filled with ethereal stock imagery (&quot;luminous lake,&quot; &quot;soft light&quot;) rather than specific, grounded details. The prompt-mandated &quot;vineyard hush&quot; is pasted into the opening and closing sentences as an ornamental phrase without integrating into the sensory reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=3.5)
    Setting details are generic ("white walls," "wooden floors") and rely on sensory clichés like "scent of salt" and "whisper of truth." The lighthouse serves as a passive backdrop rather than a constraining environment that shapes the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established, but the "sycamore hush" phrasing conflicts with the "obsidian" and "floating rock" imagery, creating a jarring inconsistency. The environment functions as a passive stage rather than constraining the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.0)
    Setting description relies on high-fantasy abstractions ("whispers of ages," "walls seemed to breathe," "endless echoes") rather than grounding sensory details. The "towers of bone" are atmospheric but function as a generic backdrop rather than a specific constraint on action or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy abstractions ("ethereal glow," "sterile precision") rather than tactile, choice-constraining details. The "icebound spire" functions as a generic dungeon backdrop rather than a specific place with distinct physics or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the "meteor hush" and lantern imagery set a tone, the spatial logic of a "sunken ship" accessible via a hatch in "shallow waves" is tenuous. The environment describes a generic magical space ("vast" underwater library) rather than a tangible, sensory-rich setting that pressures the character.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting relies on repetitive descriptors ("ambered" appears five times) rather than sensory specificity. While the visual of the observatory is established, the environment feels like a static stage set with props rather than a lived-in space that pressures the character. The "static bursts" remain abstract concepts rather than tangible atmospheric elements.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sensory details like "cold marble" and "shards of light" establish a consistent melancholic mood, though the setting functions largely as a static backdrop. The "ancient observatory" is a standard fantasy locale that does not constrain the action or force specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is functionally established with standard fantasy descriptors ("sapphire," "crystalline," "pale blue") but lacks tactile specificity or grit. The environment serves as a convenient resource dispenser (alloy materials, dripping rhythm) rather than a source of constraint or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.1)
    While atmospheric terms ("glassy surface," "hush") appear, the physical reality is broken; photographs buried in "damp earth" for decades would be destroyed, not legible clues. This logic break undermines the setting's credibility, and the town feels like a static stage set rather than a lived-in environment.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting consists of high-fantasy adjectives ("kaleidoscopic," "dew-kissed") rather than specific, grounding details that constrain the protagonist. The environment serves as a passive, decorative backdrop rather than a source of pressure or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on atmospheric abstractions ("ethereal glow," "unseen rhythms") rather than concrete sensory specifics that constrain the character's movement. While the "nocturnal arbor" is established, it functions as a static backdrop rather than a physical environment that pressures the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=3.9)
    The setting is a generic "white room" fantasy ("floating rock," "void") that serves as a passive backdrop rather than constraining the protagonist's tactics. The environment lacks sensory specificity, functioning more as a stage set for the metaphorical conflict than a lived-in reality.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is described with abstract, purple phrases ("storm-born silence," "hush of a possibility") rather than concrete, grounding detail. The "haven" remains vague—it is unclear if this is a commercial facility or a fantasy garden—and the "brook" functions more as a plot device than a tangible place.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting relies on abstract descriptors ("walls whispering secrets") rather than concrete sensory details that constrain the character. The tunnel feels metaphorical, clashing with the physical specificity of the leaf blower, and the "household" remains a vague concept rather than a place.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.0)
    Descriptions rely on generic fantasy shorthand ("shards of obsidian," "eternal mist," "alien and familiar") rather than specific, sensory grounding. The setting functions as a backdrop but does not strictly constrain the character’s physical movement or tactical options until the final choice is presented abstractly.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting ("ember nexus") is established with generic descriptors ("scent of ash," "crumbling ruins") that lack specific sensory texture or constraints. While the environment is functional as a backdrop, it does not pressure the character's choices or offer unique resources. The atmosphere leans on stock fantasy phrases ("air hung heavy," "dying light") rather than distinct, lived-in detail.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is established with functional, albeit standard, atmospheric descriptors ("crumbling radio towers," "skeletal fingers"). While the imagery anchors the scene, it leans heavily on generic "ruined fantasy" tropes rather than specific, lived-in details that constrain the character's choices. The environment feels like a backdrop rather than an active pressure on the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=3.4)
    The setting consists of generic fantasy abstractions ("spectral grotto," "otherworldly glow") that fail to constrain action or provide tactile grounding. The environment is treated as a backdrop for visual effects rather than a physical space with rules.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting relies on abstract descriptors ("impossible angles," "fractured light") rather than concrete, grounding sensory details. The "optical illusion" nature is told through adjectives rather than shown through specific spatial distortions that force the character to adapt her physical movements.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "benthic city" offers vivid visual markers like "bioluminescent streets" and "inverted stalagmites," anchoring the reader effectively. However, the setting primarily functions as a static backdrop for exposition rather than a source of constraints that force specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on generic atmospheric tropes ("mist-clad," "twilight," "marble archway") rather than specific, grounding details. While spatial movement is legible, the environment provides only mood, not constraint; the mist thickens but does not impede choice.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting relies on generic descriptors ("murky darkness," "silt and secrets") rather than distinct, tactile grounding. The environmental details, such as the "crashing hush," act as oxymoronic labels that obscure rather than clarify the atmospheric pressure. The facility feels like a standard trope backdrop rather than a specific, lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is atmospheric but generic ("forgotten relic," "blanket of snow," "aged wood"). While visually established, the observatory and its specific properties do not constrain the protagonist's tactics or force a unique interaction beyond providing a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting relies on standard fantasy tropes ("jagged teeth," "luminescent moss," "towers of bone") that serve as a passive backdrop. The environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices or offer specific, tactile resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy tropes ("glowing mushrooms," "moss-covered stone") without specific, constraining details that affect tactics. The "underground garden" functions as a passive backdrop rather than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting is established with vivid, if slightly derivative, imagery ("obsidian statues," "tarnished wonder"). The spatial relationship between the sky-bridge and the orchard is clear, though the world operates on convenient magical logic rather than tactile constraints. The "living statues" provide a functional backdrop but lack specific, terrifying detail.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is atmospheric but generic ("disputed territory," "encroaching dusk"), functioning as a backdrop rather than a constraint. The "cobalt arcade" is mentioned repeatedly as a framing device but does not interact with the protagonist's choices or provide resources that shape the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting relies on generic atmospheric phrases ("forgotten valley," "weathered by time," "tapestry of forgotten dreams") rather than specific, sensory grounding. The spatial logic of a verdant oasis inside a train compartment is asserted but not made visceral or plausible within the world's rules.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the "scientific poetry" concept is promising, the execution relies on generic library clichés ("dusty window," "scent of ink and paper"). The geometry is described as visual shapes rather than a tangible interaction with the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.4)
    The setting relies heavily on "purple" adjectives ("whispering," "improbable," "luminous") rather than concrete, sensory grounding that shapes choices. While the "weathered pier" and "damp sand" offer brief tactile moments, the "whispering archipelago" behaves more like a magical prop than a real place with constraints and physics.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is a generic fantasy ether described through purple prose ("hush of cosmic possibility," "shadows seemed to breathe") rather than distinct, sensory particulars. While the "Obsidian Vault" is a central object, the environment feels like a backdrop of vague nouns rather than a tangible place that pressures the character.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting offers vivid, atmospheric imagery ("glass walls fogged," "caps glowed faintly"), but the spatial logic of a "sunken" greenhouse surrounded by shipwrecks is surreal to the point of confusion. While the atmosphere is established, the environment feels more like a static stage set than a lived-in space that exerts pressure on the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is established but relies heavily on "magical library" clichés (dancing dust motes, cracked spines, smell of old paper) that render the environment generic. While the library is described as "alive," it functions as a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker that forces choices or limits resources. Sensory details are present but mostly visual and standard for the genre.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting is rendered through generic, high-level adjectives ("verdant," "rich," "blooming") that fail to ground the reader in a specific physical reality. The spatial logic of an orchard growing on a "parapet" (a low wall) is confusing and unexplored, serving as a backdrop rather than a constraint on the action.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is established with sensory language ("soft glow," "stained glass"), but the description is repetitive ("prism sanctuary" appears three times) and largely ornamental. The environment provides atmosphere but does not constrain the protagonist’s tactics or force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=2.6)
    The setting consists of contradictory descriptors ("rain-scoured fresco vault") that break verisimilitude, as frescoes would not survive such exposure. The environment functions as a generic backdrop that yields instantly to the protagonist's desires rather than a tactile space offering resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting lacks physical credibility; paper journals in a saltwater wreck would be mush, not "brittle" and legible, and "damp" understates total submersion. The environment functions as a stage set rather than a marine reality, breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy tropes ("misty courtyard," "shimmering air") without concrete grounding or sensory specificity. While the "flower press bolt plate" is a distinct object, its interaction with the environment is vague ("conduit") rather than tactile or mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is functionally clear but generic, relying on standard fantasy tropes (ice, clocks, stained glass) without specific sensory grounding. While the "scattered light" is mentioned frequently, it functions more as a magical plot device than an atmospheric element that constrains the character. The environment offers no resistance to the protagonist's journey.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the gondola setting is distinct, the physics are distracting; a "string" breaking typically results in a fall, not motionlessness, creating a logic gap in the opening image. The phrase "dusty starlight" is repeated three times in a short span, losing its evocative power and becoming a static artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "tree trunk library" is a distinct central image, but the surrounding "condemned building" remains vague and generic. Atmospheric descriptions rely on standard phrasing ("air hung heavy," "seep into the very bones") rather than specific, sensory grounding. The setting functions as a container for the puzzle but lacks dynamic interaction until the scripted collapse at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting consists of standard genre markers ("brass hull," "amber twilight") without specific, tactile grounding that constrains action. The "hopscotch board" is an intriguing object but functions only as a magical device, not a lived-in part of the environment. Orientation is clear, but the space feels like a stage set rather than a pressurized vessel.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting relies heavily on fantasy clichés ("time seemed to stand still," "language older than the stars") without tactile grounding. The "frozen" aspect is purely visual; the cold never affects Elara’s dexterity or choices, failing to act as a constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting (orchard planet, floating arches) is visually distinct but functions largely as backdrop rather than a constraint on action. Sensory details are present ("scent of blooming fruit trees") but often lean into generic fantasy aesthetics rather than specific, lived-in texture that shapes choices.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is rendered through a dense layer of adjectives ("bruised sky," "violet and ash") rather than concrete interaction. The "pane of hush" is treated as an abstract phrase rather than a physical or sensory reality that constrains the character. The lighthouse serves as a generic backdrop; its specific geography or mechanics do not influence the scene's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and integral, with the "fractured spine" of the labyrinth and the "metallic eyes" of the birds grounding the scene. The contrast between the mechanical threats and the rotting orchard is well-rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.0)
    Sensory details are generic ("golden hue," "cool air," "swirled and danced") and serve primarily as set-dressing for metaphors rather than grounding the scene. The physical setting does not constrain the character or force interaction beyond passive observation.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "glass orchard" offers vivid, albeit standard, fantasy imagery ("books that seemed to grow like fruit"), and the physical constraints of the glass tiers provide some grounding. However, the setting operates largely as a backdrop for the protagonist's competence rather than a source of genuine pressure; the "fragmentation" is described but does not meaningfully impede her ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.2)
    The juxtaposition of the coral icebound pavilion against the desert is visually distinct, but environmental logic falters. The presence of "tidal pool formations" with "algae" in a desert, justified only by recent rain, breaks verisimilitude—tides and algae growth require oceans and time, not transient storm puddles.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.0)
    Atmosphere leans on "purple" descriptors ("hush of borrowed starlight") rather than specific, grounding details. The juxtaposition of "cobblestones/old town" with "grain elevators" creates a jarring, incoherent geography that confuses the setting's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.3)
    The setting functions as generic atmospheric filler ("shadows danced like ancient spirits") rather than a source of constraint or tactical pressure. The environment does not shape the protagonist's choices or the mechanics of the repair.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=3.9)
    Setting relies on generic fantasy abstractions ("ancient secrets," "ethereal light") rather than specific, tactile constraints. The gravity inversion acts as a passive conveyor belt rather than a physical challenge that forces the protagonist to adapt tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.3)
    The setting is established with heavy adjectival description ("intensely quiet," "whispered secrets") but serves only as a static backdrop. The environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices or provide resources that alter her tactics, resulting in a low sense of place-based pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.1)
    The "magnetic nexus" functions as a generic magic system without specific sensory grounding beyond standard tropes like "humming" and "pulsing." The setting describes the light but does not constrain the character's choices or provide a tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.3)
    The setting is established but relies on generic atmospheric descriptors ("shadowed workshop," "dim light") rather than specific, tactile details that constrain choice. The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than an active pressure on the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is described with generic fantasy adjectives ("mysterious," "ancient") rather than interaction or constraint that shapes the plot. Sensory details are often filtered through clunky exposition ("olfactorily sensitive") rather than immediate experience. The environment functions as a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting contains imaginative elements like gravity inversion and floating arches, but they function as wallpaper rather than physical constraints; Elara simply "remains steady" when gravity inverts, ignoring the physics of the premise. Descriptive language relies on generic intensifiers ("mysterious," "shimmering," "ancient") rather than specific, grounded sensory details that shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.6)
    The container labyrinth is the strongest element, providing a physical rationale (wind tunnel) for the crash. However, descriptors often lean into standard post-apocalyptic tropes ("ghostly maze," "rusted edges"), and the "silent town" feels like a static backdrop rather than a source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.0)
    The ice cavern is rendered with vivid, sensory-rich detail ("stalactites hung like sharpened teeth," "mosaic of fractured ice"). The setting anchors the scene effectively, though it functions largely as a static backdrop for the ritual rather than an environment that forces specific tactical adjustments.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy descriptors ("jagged walls," "amber glow") that do not pressure the character's choices. The forced inclusion of "avalanchingly quiet" creates awkward phrasing that disrupts the atmospheric consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=4.4)
    Atmospheric descriptions are present but rely on generic markers ("ink bottles," "strange artifacts") and abstract adjectives ("lucid turbulence") that do not constrain action. The specific potential of the "letterpress" setting is ignored; the tools and environment do not shape the protagonist's tactics or the solution.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway provides a vivid, if somewhat standard, fantasy backdrop that anchors the scene well. The "fade" and atmospheric details are consistent, though the setting acts more as a mood board than a source of constraints or tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.5)
    The quartz arbor is visually distinct, but the setting largely functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of pressure. The mist operates via pathetic fallacy (clearing exactly when the epiphany hits) rather than causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting relies on stock fantasy imagery ("liquid gold," "dappled light") rather than specific, sensory constraints that shape the action. While the bamboo forest is established, it functions more as a backdrop than an active environment; the "singing trees" and "backward streams" are cataloged rather than experienced as tactile hurdles.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.3)
    The setting details ("jagged teeth," "liquid light") lean on clichés and stock fantasy imagery. While the "ripe fruit and molten metal" smell is specific, the "treacherous" mines are generic and do not offer specific physical constraints or tools that shape the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.0)
    Setting details are generic ("rust and old grease," "lush, alien forest") and do not constrain the character or shape tactics. The environment serves as a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker for the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting consists of generic lighthouse tropes (jagged cliffs, crashing waves) without specific, lived-in detail. The "hidden compartment" functions as a video-game mechanic rather than an integrated part of the environment, and the "haunted" aspect is reduced to a vague chill.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting consists of generic fantasy markers ("emerald lighthouse," "swirling light") without tactile specificity. The inclusion of "total internal reflection" creates a jarring register clash against the high-fantasy backdrop, appearing as technobabble rather than a constrained physical rule.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is established with vivid, if slightly generic, fantasy imagery ("cloud-kissed," "amber and gold"). While atmospheric, the environment functions more as a static backdrop than a pressure cooker that constrains choices. The specific mechanics of "tracking sun trails" remain vague and do not impact the scene's physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.0)
    Sensory details rely on generic fantasy tropes ("moonlight," "silver," "shadow") without specific, grounding texture or constraints. The setting functions as a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker that shapes Elias's tactical choices. The description is functional but lacks the specificity required to immerse the reader or impact the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=4.6)
    Setting details rely on high-fantasy abstractions ("woven dawns," "endless night") rather than grounded, tactile specificity that constrains action. The "mirror world" lacks distinct physical rules or sensory contrast to the primary world, functioning merely as a magical repository for the solution. The environment does not pressure the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=3.1)
    The setting is constructed from generic tropes ("ancient tomes," "forgotten manuscripts") and opens with a distinct cliché ("neon lights flickered like restless fireflies"). The descriptions are ornamental rather than constraining, failing to shape the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting relies on generic "ruined beauty" tropes ("damp earth," "crumbling statues," "tangled vines") without distinct, unexpected specificity. While the tea house provides a spatial anchor, the environment functions as a passive backdrop that whispers approval rather than a force that constrains or pressures the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is atmospheric and visually consistent ("crystalline shelves," "mist"), establishing a clear mood. However, the environment functions primarily as a backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure that forces specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "pirate market" is rendered with standard genre furniture ("shadows and whispers," "salt and decay") that provides backdrop but fails to constrain choices. While functional, the setting lacks the specific, gritty pressure required to force the protagonist into difficult tactical trade-offs. The environment feels like a stage set rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting details (lavender bluff, aurora) are vivid but often lean into purple prose ("terrestrially cosmic spectacle") rather than grounding the scene in tactile reality. While the sensory shift (taste) is a nice touch, the environment functions mostly as a static backdrop for the conversation rather than a pressure cooker that forces choices.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting consists of generic fantasy markers ("amethyst and quartz," "prismatic shadows") that function as wallpaper rather than constraints. The environment does not pressure the character's choices or restrict her movement in a way that generates narrative friction. Sensory details are visual and clichéd ("dimly lit recesses") rather than tactile or immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting contains functional genre markers (glass domes, toxic sky) but lacks idiosyncratic texture or sensory specificity. Descriptions often rely on adjective-noun pairs ("sprawling greenhouse city," "shredded treasure map") that signal the aesthetic without grounding it in the character’s immediate tactile experience. The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a pressure cooker for the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.6)
    The setting is established with high-fantasy abstractions ("earth kissed the heavens," "cerulean expanse") rather than tactile, grounding details. While the location is clear, it does not exert pressure on the protagonist or constrain her choices. The environment feels like a painted backdrop rather than a physical space to be navigated.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is established with visual cues ("glass-domed sanctuary," "vibrant blooms"), but the environment fails to constrain the action or provide tools for the resolution. The "shifting magnetic fields" are described visually ("shimmered") but do not mechanically pressure the scene beyond serving as a mood backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is established with vivid but generic descriptors ("hues of gold and amber," "scent of blooming jasmine") that feel like a standard set-piece rather than a specific, lived-in environment. While the dawn atmosphere is consistent, the physical space does not constrain Clara’s choices or generate pressure. The "sandstorm calm" descriptor at the end clashes tonally with the established gentle, floral atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=3.1)
    The setting consists of generic atmospheric tropes ("damp, moss-covered," "shadows danced," "scent of decay") that lack specific, tactile grounding. The environment is a passive backdrop that exerts no pressure on the character's choices; the "sunken" aspect is mentioned but barely interacts with the physical action beyond dripping water.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is described with generic sensory adjectives ("gleaming," "shimmering," "ethereal") rather than specific, tactile details that constrain the character's movement or choices. While the salt chamber is visually established, it functions as a static backdrop ("white room") rather than an active environmental pressure or resource. The "quiet energy" remains abstract atmosphere rather than a felt presence.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy staples ("moss-covered stone," "gurgle of water," "damp earth") that provide atmosphere but do not constrain the character’s choices. The environment serves as a passive backdrop rather than an active force that pressures the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=4.4)
    The setting relies on "magic city" clichés ("rooftops whispered secrets," "paint the sky") rather than specific, grounded details. The meteor shower provides atmospheric decoration but does not constrain the characters' choices or affect the scene's pacing. The environment feels like a backdrop rather than an active force shaping the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting is constructed from generic, high-calorie adjectives ("velvet," "radiant," "deep violet") rather than specific, grounded sensory details that constrain choice. The sudden introduction of technical jargon ("resonance structures") clashes jarringly with the established floral fantasy aesthetic, breaking immersion. The environment feels like a static backdrop rather than a pressure-cooker for the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting leans on "purple" descriptors ("hushed embrace," "pearl twilight") that create a static backdrop rather than interacting with the action. While the stalactites provide a rhythm, the environment functions largely as atmospheric ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.0)
    Setting descriptions are generic and abstract ("ancient secrets," "liquid starlight," "shimmering archway") rather than concrete. The environment functions as a passive backdrop, offering no constraints or tools that shape the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting relies on generic atmospheric descriptors ("dancing shadows," "crystalline walls") that provide a backdrop but do not constrain action. The cold is mentioned but never felt as a pressure that affects the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.3)
    Sensory details like "damp stone" and "jasmine" are vivid but decorative, establishing atmosphere without constraining action. The setting serves as a passive backdrop for contemplation rather than an active force pressuring the character.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is functional, utilizing standard wasteland tropes (gnarled trees, radioactive dust) without subverting them or adding specific, sensory texture. While the contrast between the stillness and the storm is noted, the environment feels like a generic backdrop rather than a pressure-cooker forcing specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.2)
    Atmosphere is asserted rather than evoked; phrases like "room filled with a gritty whimsy" tell the reader what to feel instead of using sensory details to create the mood. The setting descriptions are generic ("shimmering faintly," "unnatural fury") and fail to constrain the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the "feral loft" is an evocative concept, the setting remains largely decorative and does not constrain the character's choices. Phrases like "golden sands" and "pale light" rely on generic atmospheric shorthand rather than specific, grounded detail that affects the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.3)
    The setting is atmospheric but generic ("ancient secrets," "surreal landscape"), offering little specific constraint on the action. The "drift-ice" is mentioned as background noise but does not physically impede movement or shape the tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.1)
    The setting is a collection of prompt words ("basalt sanctuary," "frozen lake") that never gain sensory specificity or constrain action. Physical logic is strained—an iron structure "glistening with residual moisture" from rain sits beside a lake that has been frozen for weeks. The environment functions as a backdrop for abstract musing rather than a tangible place.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting relies on generic descriptors ("dimly lit," "scent of rust") and lacks tactile specificity. The inclusion of an Underground Railroad lantern as a primary tool for a modern safety inspection breaks verisimilitude; it feels like a forced prompt insertion rather than a plausible tool choice. The tunnel functions as a container for clues rather than a pressuring environment.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sensory details ("scent of aged wood and oil") establish a functional atmosphere, though the setting remains a backdrop rather than a constraint on action. The environment fits the tone but does not force the protagonist into specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.1)
    The atmospheric details of the acid sea and workshop are vivid and ground the scene visually ("glass windows fogged," "clanking metal"). However, the setting remains a backdrop; the "acid sea" poses no immediate threat that constrains Lira's choices, and the "cart glider" aspect suggests a verticality that is never utilized.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting suffers from "white-room syndrome," described with vague phrases like "vast digital expanse" and "forgotten corners." There is little sensory grounding beyond visual descriptors; the environment does not constrain the character's movement or choices in a tactile way.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the "lighthouse orchard" concept is visually distinct, the setting functions merely as a static backdrop rather than a constraint. The "vintage store" appears conveniently to house the required plot devices without grounding in the world's logic or economy.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting uses standard descriptors ("jagged shards," "skeletons") and relies on pathetic fallacy ("ice seemed to whisper") that distances the reader. The environment serves as a static backdrop for reflection rather than a pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is functional but generic ("golden hues," "autumn landscape"), serving as a static backdrop rather than a source of pressure. While the pavilion provides a location for reflection, the environment does not force choices or obstruct the protagonist's goal. Specifics like the "cool night air" are mentioned but ignored in terms of physical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting relies on abstract compound nouns ("whisperfield," "murmuring pavilion") that act as placeholders rather than sensory constraints. The environment feels weightless and does not offer physical resistance to the character's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the setting is established, descriptions rely heavily on clichés ("hub of industry," "golden light of dusk") and pathetic fallacy ("lavender field whispered its approval"). The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure. The sensory details are generic and do not filter through a specific character bias or urgent need.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.7)
    The atmosphere is consistent but relies on generic library imagery ("dust and shadow," "worn oak") that does not constrain action. The setting serves as a passive backdrop rather than an active force that pressures the protagonist's choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=5.4)
    The fog sculpture garden is atmospheric, but the details often feel generic (loops, spirals) or heavy-handed in their symbolism. The prompt element "videotapes" is inserted into the opening sentence without spatial logic—why are there unwatched tapes in a sculpture garden?—disrupting the setting's coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is functional but relies on generic descriptors ("stars burned with an intensity," "cold stone floor") rather than specific, textured details that constrain choice. The "changelessly constant" atmosphere is told rather than felt through interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is abstract and adjective-heavy ("radiant haven," "soft, eternal glow") rather than grounded in sensory particulars that constrain the characters. The "scent of hope" is treated as a literal air freshener scent, which breaks immersion and reads as forced sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting contains functional fantasy staples (floating isle, observatory) but relies on generic descriptors ("hummed with quiet energy," "swirling void") that fail to constrain the protagonist's choices. The environment feels like a static backdrop rather than a pressurized container that forces specific tactical adaptations.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting consists of generic fantasy placeholders ("ancient oak," "glowing flowers") that lack sensory specificity or distinct atmosphere. The maze is described as defying logic but fails to exert spatial or psychological pressure on the protagonist's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting is atmospheric but generic ("mist clung... like a whisper"), serving as a mood backdrop rather than a source of constraints. The repetition of "serpentine" and reliance on abstract sensory details ("energy of memories") prevents the environment from feeling lived-in or tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting concept—a moss-overrun data center—is distinct and provides good textural contrast. Specific details like the "mineral streaks" and "cracked windows" ground the scene. However, the description occasionally drifts into purple prose ("nature reclaiming its throne") which distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.5)
    The "feral nexus" is a generic atmospheric backdrop that fails to constrain the protagonist; she moves through it without tactical difficulty. Sensory details are standard ("swirling hush," "cool surface") and do not sharpen the stakes. The setting serves as a passive container for the theme rather than an active force.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is established but relies heavily on generic fantasy adjectives ("verdant," "golden," "ancient") rather than specific, grounded detail. The environment acts as a passive backdrop for the light show rather than constraining choices or pressuring the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.2)
    Setting details are atmospheric but generic ("frost-kissed," "ghostly moon") and do not constrain the protagonist's actions; the environment serves as a passive backdrop rather than an active pressure on the ritual; "flash-paper" implications are ignored in favor of static patience.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting leans heavily on high-fantasy abstractions ("shimmered with ancient veins," "whispered through the air") rather than concrete, grounding details. While the marble reflections are functionally tied to the solution, the environment lacks grit and fails to exert pressure on the protagonist; it serves merely as an atmospheric backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.3)
    The "bronze grotto" provides a distinct, atmospheric backdrop that anchors the scene well. However, the sensory details often lean into abstraction ("metallic tang" is good; "shingled hush" as a physical presence is vague), creating a stage-set feeling rather than a lived-in world.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "rain-beaded skylight" anchors the physical space adequately, but atmospheric descriptors like "rust-hued peace" are abstract and confusing. The setting functions more as a backdrop than a source of constraint or pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting provides a surreal aesthetic ("kinetic lagoon"), but the specific artifacts Mara collects (rusted locket, shattered mirror, journal) are generic clichés of the genre. The atmosphere is established but does not constrain the protagonist's actions or force unique tactical adjustments.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is established but described through generic ruins tropes ("cracked tiles," "dust") and metaphors ("maze of intentions") rather than specific, sensory grounding. The space feels like a stage set for the protagonist's monologue rather than a physical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established with consistent atmospheric details ("crystal whispering forecourt," "glacial hush"), but the description often relies on abstract adjectives rather than concrete, interactive details that constrain the character’s choices. The environment provides a backdrop for reflection but does not exert physical pressure on the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting relies on atmospheric clichés ("world seemed to hold its breath," "damp earth," "shadow of its former self") rather than specific, sensory grounding. While the location is established, it functions as a passive backdrop that offers no physical resistance or distinct texture to the scene. The description of "intricate patterns" and "rotting" wood remains generic, failing to create the specific "twilight" atmosphere requested beyond broad adjectives.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.4)
    The setting is atmospheric but functions as a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker. While the "golden dock" and "fulgurite glass" are vivid visual cues, they do not constrain Elara's choices or force tactical adjustments. The sensory details ("crystalline blanket," "oceanic hush") lean toward generic descriptors rather than specific, lived-in perception.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "shadowed garden" and "autumn leaves" provide a coherent atmosphere but rely on generic literary signifiers ("golden patches," "whispered conversations") rather than specific, tactile grounding. The setting functions as a static backdrop for the mood rather than an active force that constrains the characters' choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "suspended palace" and "black stone" offer some visual grounding, but the description leans on genre tropes ("luminescent fungi," "gears and pistons"). The setting provides atmosphere but rarely constrains the character's choices or tactics in a specific way.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is atmospheric ("obsidian lagoon," "black sand") but functions as a static backdrop for the ritual rather than a source of pressure or interaction. The description leans toward generic fantasy tropes ("quiet village nestled between") rather than specific, lived-in detail.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.3)
    The setting relies on standard fable tropes ("forgotten fountains," "whispering cobblestones," "frozen clock") rather than specific, lived-in detail. While the atmosphere is consistent, the environment functions merely as a static backdrop for the item hunt rather than a source of pressure or constraint. The "city" feels like a generic concept rather than a specific place.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=3.6)
    The setting relies on generic "ethereal" descriptors ("swirled like whispers," "liquid silver") rather than concrete, constraining details that shape the action. The environment functions as a mood board rather than a physical space with rules and obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.2)
    The greenhouse setting is vivid but leans into "purple" ornamentation ("glass panes humming," "symphony of color") rather than constraining action. While the atmosphere is consistent, the details often feel like set dressing for the theme rather than a tangible environment Elara must navigate.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the "obsidian ridge" provides a visual bookend, the setting functions primarily as a static backdrop rather than a force that constrains choices. Sensory details often tilt toward the abstract ("whispered secrets," "burning in his mind") rather than concrete, grounding particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.8)
    Setting details are overly ornate ("velveteen gloom," "cobalt silo") and prioritize decorative adjectives over grounding the reader in a tangible space. The artifact's description remains abstract ("chart emotions rather than places"), preventing the reader from visualizing the core puzzle.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting consists of standard fantasy tropes (obsidian spire, frozen lake) that provide atmosphere but do not constrain choice or shape tactics. Sensory details are present ("scent of pine," "shimmering") but generic, failing to ground the magical realism in a specific, lived-in reality.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "ember alcove" provides a coherent aesthetic, but the descriptions rely on stock atmospheric tropes ("muffling mist," "scent of aged paper") rather than specific, tactile grounding. The "story famine" is a high-concept backdrop that feels disconnected from the immediate physical reality of the room.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting consists of generic descriptors ("dimly lit," "polished marble," "velvet pouch") that fail to create a specific, pressure-filled atmosphere or constrain the protagonist's choices. The environment serves as a passive backdrop for philosophical musing rather than an active force in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=3.9)
    Sensory details are largely generic ("scent of decay," "damp stone," "dim light") and fail to create a distinct atmospheric signature. The phrase "sedimentary layers" is used awkwardly, seemingly to satisfy a prompt requirement, and conflicts with the physical logic of walking through a sewer or ruin.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting consists of generic atmospheric nouns ("velvet," "stained glass," "parchment") that create a static backdrop rather than pressuring choices. While visually consistent, the library functions as a "white room" with furniture; the spatial geography never constrains the action. The environment is described in lists rather than filtered through the protagonist’s urgent sensory bias.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.4)
    The setting relies on standard "ruined garden" tropes (twisted iron, rust, dead tree) without specific, grounding details that constrain the action. The greenhouse provides atmosphere but does not force unique tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.2)
    Setting descriptions rely on stock phrases ("silent sentinel," "relic of a bygone era") and generic adjectives rather than specific, tangible details that constrain action. The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of pressure or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the "orris root shard" is specific, the surrounding environment ("quiet bay," "broken seashell") consists largely of generic imagery that fails to constrain choice. The personification of streetlights feels ornamental rather than a grounded element of the POV's perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is established with generic descriptors ("murky depths," "tangled seaweed") that do not constrain the characters' choices. The environment functions as a static backdrop rather than an active force pressuring the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.0)
    While the visual of the staircase is established, the narrative immediately undermines immersion by explicitly labeling it a metaphor ("more than a setting; it was a metaphor for her life"). This didactic intrusion distances the reader and turns the environment into a symbolic backdrop rather than a tangible, pressure-filled space. The spatial rules ("sideways into eternity") remain vague and do not constrain action specifically.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting is functional and establishes the contrast between the greenhouse and the city, but relies heavily on standard descriptors ("smog-choked," "oasis," "silvery light"). The environment provides atmosphere but does not meaningfully constrain Elara's choices or force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.0)
    Verdania is sketched with standard fantasy tropes (bioluminescent fungi, waterfalls) that serve as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure. The environment does not affect Elara's tactical choices; she could perform the same actions in any kitchen. The description is visual but lacks the sensory specificity to ground the reader in the grotto's damp reality.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory details are vivid ("scent of salt and decay," "slow exhale of low tide") and establish a strong, cohesive mood. However, the setting acts primarily as a backdrop until the climax, rather than providing obstacles that force specific tactical choices or physical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=3.1)
    The setting consists of generic tropes (warped mirrors, ticking clocks) without specific, tactile grounding or atmospheric pressure. "Lingering luminance" functions as a repeated tag rather than a sensory reality that constrains the protagonist's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.6)
    The imagery is distinct ("gnarled branches," "driftwood"), but the setting functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint or resource. Descriptors tilt toward cliché ("hues of indigo," "seamless blend") rather than specific, lived-in texture that pressures the character.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=5.5)
    The concept of the turtle city is established, but the description leans on generic fantasy tropes ("eerie, golden light," "polished obsidian") without specific, grounding sensory details. The environment serves as a passive backdrop rather than a source of physical pressure or constraint that forces tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting anchors the scene but relies on generic ruin imagery ("swallowed by ivy," "rusted with neglect") rather than specific, sensory details that constrain the character. The environment feels like a passive backdrop rather than an active force pressuring the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is legible, but the description leans heavily on abstract atmospherics ("scent of brine and decay," "place where dreams were said to drown") rather than granular, tactile specificity. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the character's epiphany rather than a source of constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting suffers from the logic gap mentioned in Q2; the "sunken city" and "forgotten library" contradict the protagonist's active employment there without explanation. Environmental details are generic tropes (bioluminescent algae, crumbling stone) that provide atmosphere but do not constrain tactics. The "mechanism" logic—ink on paper activating physical architecture—breaks verisimilitude.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the "glass basilica" offers a strong visual anchor, the "paradoxical motion" of the island is stated rather than dramatized, leaving it confusing. Descriptions often lean into purple prose ("mist clung... like a lover’s whisper") rather than grounded sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the observatory is described with vivid adjectives, the setting remains ornamental and does not constrain the protagonist's actions or choices. The "circuit breakers" act as a passive background detail rather than a ticking clock or pressure mechanism. The environment feels like a backdrop rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.1)
    Setting details are largely generic ("dust and old parchment," "cracked stained-glass") and serve as backdrop rather than constraint. Specific astronomy terms are used loosely (Lyra is a constellation, not a "rising star"), and the "type foundry" jargon clashes with the vague fantasy atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is atmospheric but leans on generic "brooding" tropes (shimmering terrace, driftwood shore). The specific details of the driftwood (face, reaching hand, clock) feel like staged props for symbolic convenience rather than organic elements of a beach environment.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is established, but the description leans heavily on purple prose ("mist that clung... like forgotten secrets") and redundant adjective stacking ("storm-worn windblown"). The atmosphere is generic mood rather than a specific, pressure-exerting environment.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting anchors the scene but relies on generic sensory details ("scent of salt and seaweed," "pink and orange") and pathetic fallacy ("waves lapped merrily"). While the utility poles serve a metaphorical function, the environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices or force tactical adaptation on the page. The "dim light of dawn" functions as a standard atmospheric trope rather than a specific, pressure-inducing condition.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is described with generic fantasy tropes ("hues of blue and green") and lacks tactile grounding until the swim. The forced insertion of "delicately robust" creates an oxymoron that distracts rather than adds specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting is vividly described with high-fantasy tropes ("shimmered like captured stars"), but the details are largely ornamental. The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure that shapes the protagonist's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is rendered through abstract adjectival phrases ("weight of forgotten dreams," "pulsed with a choking beauty") rather than concrete, sensory grounding. The "glade above clouds" feels like a generic white room populated by symbolic props.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting consists of generic sci-fi/fantasy tropes ("recycled metals," "soft, golden light") lacking specific, tactile grounding. The environment does not constrain the character; instead, the gravity shifts conveniently to assist her progress.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.4)
    The setting is rendered through generic, adjectival descriptions ("timeless dance," "quiet embrace," "veil of smoke") that lack sensory specificity or grit. While the black sand and volcano are present, they function as a painted backdrop rather than a pressure cooker that constrains action. The environment offers no resistance to the character's movement.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is a functional but generic fantasy backdrop ("luminous fort," "enchanted lanterns") that serves as a container for the action rather than a source of pressure. The environment does not meaningfully constrain the protagonist's choices; the blackout is merely a plot trigger, not a tactile obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.2)
    Setting details are vivid but generic ("kissed by the faint glow," "jagged edges"), creating a standard fantasy backdrop that does not constrain the protagonist's choices. The environment serves as a passive canvas for the ritual rather than an active pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the "stormlit observatory" is vivid, the setting functions largely as pathetic fallacy ("clouds themselves seemed to conspire") rather than a concrete environment. The bus timetable provides a moment of specificity, but the "map of scars" metaphor overwrites the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is vivid but largely ornamental, providing "fractured rainbows" and "prismatic light" that decorate the scene without constraining action. The environment does not force trade-offs or shape the tactical flow of the debate beyond providing the sundial prop.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=2.8)
    Setting details are generic ("dust and time," "crumbling spines") and spatially incoherent due to the unexplained transition between abandonment and institutional use. The environment serves as a passive backdrop for the theme rather than a constraint that forces specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.6)
    The "tidal arbor" is an evocative concept, but the description leans on generic adjectives ("ethereal," "gnarled," "golden hues"). The setting functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on abstract, high-fantasy descriptors ("shimmered with the promise of life," "radiant glory") rather than concrete sensory grounding. The "Grove of Echoes" and the ridge are generic locations that lack specific, constraining details to ground the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting provides atmospheric visuals ("damp earth," "weathered cottage") but remains a generic backdrop that does not constrain the protagonist's choices. The mention of "the severance" fails the Orientation Test, introducing a major world-building element that is neither explained nor utilized.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Greenhouse operates as micro-setting: broken glass, brackish soil, damp air constrain movement and echo collapse physics she studies. Sensory hierarchy favors tactile cold and visual shimmer, matching her researcher gaze. Spatial choreography is minimal yet clean—kneel, stand, watch—no impossible shifts. The butterfly wing dust is handled, not catalogued, so object-as-setting qualifies and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Canyon is not postcard backdrop: frost patterns literally guide her path, bioluminescent grotto provides night-level visibility for kiln discovery, scorch marks echo earlier ambush. Spatial choreography clean: campfire → canyon floor → hidden grotto, distances tracked via ledger clues. Sensory selection favors touch/vision (icy ridges, glass shards) aligned with glass-artist POV. Micro-setting (ledger strip) constrains next move and charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    Winterglass panes shimmer like frozen waterfalls—image simultaneously anchors atmosphere and becomes the literal canvas for the heat-map colors. Conservatory’s vegetal life pressing against translucent glass mirrors Elara’s silent search, constraining her to read emotion through temperature rather than vibration. Micro-setting (tuning fork case, stone bench) handled in motion; no static catalogue. Final image of colors blooming on glass recharges the opening description—setting becomes the medium of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    Underwater library is rendered through seaweed-green book pulp, coral-encrusted statue, collapsed beam—selective, tactile, lived-in. Lantern light refracts off cracked glass, giving micro-setting an active role in discovery beats. Environment does not physically constrain choices (no failing air pocket, no structural collapse) so stays shy of 9+ gate. Nevertheless, atmosphere is coherent, idiosyncratic, and charges the final luminous image.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Terra-cotta arbor, cracked tiles, moonlight, and lantern glow are vivid and filtered through Mara’s covert attention. The ridge and wind are repeatedly invoked yet never constrain movement or supply tangible obstacles; the arbor functions mainly as symbolic backdrop rather than active environment. Micro-setting succeeds: the silver bell’s chill weight and clear tone are tactile and auditory anchors. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the gathering.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.3)
    The viaduct’s iron ribs, scented wisteria, and “skeletal ribcage” metaphor are viscerally selective and mirror Elara’s exposed-nerve mood. Micro-setting works: the pendant’s hollow and the alcove statue physically constrain the final placement, charging the image. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible moves. Economy is strong; every descriptor either guides her knee or frames the light beam. Could reach 9+ if the setting later constrained her tactics (e.g., rusted ladder snaps, forcing a renunciation), but it remains atmospheric rather than instrumental.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is the star: the breathing vines, scent-loaded air, and warping hedges constrain her path and mood. Hyperbolic geometry is named, not diagrammed, yet the spatial distortion is felt through her quaking legs. The living bridge garden is more than postcard—it actively swallows the fragment and re-spits her changed.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    The warped greenhouse glass and shipwreck ribs act as active crucible: proximity dictates she must climb/press/crawl to harvest absences. Micro-setting objects—tool belt, forge, hearing aid—constrain tactics: she can’t sprint away; she must kneel, palm, and carry fragile voids. Final image of beams as “monuments” recharges initial wreckage with new meaning, satisfying 9+ gate. Sensory triage under auroral light narrows to color-sound translation, keeping description urgent, not touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Micro-setting (clock-tower parapet, frozen gears) constrains the final choice; ivy in the bouquet literally offers egress route.

Environment charges closure: moonlight + jar glow fuse into sacred glow that reweights prior “illuminated moments” motif.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    The control-room micro-setting is woven through action: cracked consoles guide her choice to repurpose abandonment into creation, and the blown glass literally uses the room’s dust as nucleation points. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—she notices machinery silence and cold air because they mirror internal thaw. The bookmark’s leather grain and the sphere’s translucence charge the final image when the bookmark is imprisoned inside glass. One minor slip: “dust-laden screens” is repeated in adjacent sentences; scrub would nudge this to 8.9.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rusted library is sketched with selective sensory strokes—iron groan, starlight through gaps, dust smudges—never catalogued. The seashell and cast act as micro-settings that constrain choice: only their physical surfaces yield the code. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible object leaps. Setting charges the final image: starlight on broken glass fuses external ruin with internal release, passing the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Storm-tossed ridge fort, flaking booklet, and tapering starlight are vividly sketched through sensory selectivity (“weathered stones absorbing the fury,” “pages crackling like dried leaves”). Description is woven into action (oracle opens the booklet, walks to the edge) so setting never stalls momentum. The fort functions as micro-setting—its ambered hush is the container that absorbs silence—charging the final image. While no prop physically constrains choice, the booklet’s self-turning pages give a subtle fantastic edge that reweights the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    The courtyard is sketched with brisk, cold precision—“pale blue light,” “cobblestones,” “spectrum of colors” refracted by ice violin—sensory triangulation that mirrors Unit-7’s machine perception. Micro-setting (transparent violin) literally charges the final image, passing 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is flawless; no body or object drifts. One minor lapse: “twilight” is declared twice without deepening time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Crystal forecourt is more than postcard: its glow and resonant hush directly mirror the ambiguously clear theme and supply the literal light for Kian’s lens moment, charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Garden maze, weathered hands, cracked marbles, and shifting light act as micro-settings that constrain motion and focus attention; the maze literally funnels Elias to center for final poise. Selective sensory layering—tactile vine grit, glass glow, dusk chill—mirrors internal stance without catalogue. Spatial choreography holds: marbles travel from vine pocket → workbench → maze heart. Atmosphere evolves from stubborn labor to luminous acceptance, charging the resonant final image. Tool/object integration passes 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.0)
    Metallic scar, twilight sky, and magnetic nexus are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara’s mechanic eye; wing-creature luminescence mirrors rising/falling tension. Micro-setting (nexus) constrains every tactical move and charges the final image. Spatial choreography tight; no geography drift. Weather/environment limited to twilight and creature glow, but both serve tone.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    Flooded pit, lantern-light, silt-slick paper, and ankle-deep water are filtered through Clara’s musician senses—she notices “unstruck chords” and reads stains as notation. The opera-house shell functions as both macro-setting and micro-tool: the water itself becomes ink, the decaying program becomes score—environment literally composes. Spatial choreography stays clean: she never teleports, the ghost remains stage-left, distance is maintained. The missing 0.1 to reach 8.0 is the absence of a tactile obstacle (cold, submerged cables, rotted music stand) that could have constrained her humming or footing, which would have charged the final image with bodily risk.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mountain station is sketched with spare, selective detail—metal frame memory, ozone scent, wind gusts—that mirror internal sway. The botanical illustration functions as micro-setting: its ink texture, veins, and smudge constrain every beat; her finger on the paper is the final image. Environment never over-described; each sensory note feeds POV bias and accumulates toward closure. Meets 9+ gate: recurring object charges the last image with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    Tunnel atmosphere is economically seeded (“damp earth,” “rusted metal,” “spectral shadows”) and filtered through Mara’s explorer gaze. The beaded valve wheel earns micro-setting status: tactile specificity (“cool and smooth”) and later causal use. Spatial choreography stays clean—no floating bodies or impossible moves. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure, mirroring escalation. Environment does not quite charge the final image (light burst is generic), so 9-bar gate not cleared.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    The overgrown library is no backdrop: vines “embracing ancient tomes” smother choice, the obsidian refuge literally absorbs light, and the origami swan’s folds constrain navigation; these micro-settings charge the final image when Lira realizes she is “the silence.” Sensory selection is POV-specific—Lira notices “damp earth and forgotten memories,” not tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean across the catacomb walk; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sage Ridge is sketched with selective sensory strokes—grass “glow faintly,” air “whispers”—that texture the eclipse tension without tourist clutter. The meadow operates as micro-setting: its dimmed light enables the curl’s glow beat, so environment directly charges the climax. Spatial choreography stays clean in a two-body scene. Idiom stays unobtrusive, meeting 600-word economy.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “bronze quiet” is a sharp sensory signature; metal library, scorched paper, and dragon threads are tactile and specific. The silo constrains the action—ritual must occur on its stone altar—so environment shapes tactics, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. Weather is absent, but not missed; the micro-setting of frayed tapestry fibers against metal walls charges the final golden light image.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.8)
    Kitchen shells, refrigerator hum, and lighthouse fog are sketched with selective sensory detail; environment never constrains choice or charges the ending. Micro-setting (microdot on fingertip) is momentarily tactile but drifts into metaphor without return. Place is atmospheric, not instrumental.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dimensional anchor is rendered through selective, sensory silence—sound as presence—which stays coherent and thematic. Spatial choreography is fuzzy (walls “shifting” but no anchors for scale or movement) and the palette’s void lacks tactile handling. Still, the silence-as-setting constrains the priest’s only tool (questions) and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for micro-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, and nautilus shell form a micro-setting triad that constrains the only possible action: interior inscription culminating in the harp. Sensory selection stays tight to POV priorities—smooth cool shell, breath fogging glass—and the mirrored horizon physically charges the final image. No orientation debt; spatial choreography is immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.1)
    Glowing viaduct and rain-soaked asphalt supply tactile, selective sensory layering; body-as-setting (boots on slick surface) constrains first move. Tablet’s glow mirrored in viaduct light creates micro-setting feedback that charges final image. Spatial choreography across fractal shards is impressionistic but trackable; no impossible positions. Environment never actively threatens or resource-shapes tactics, capping at low-7.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.1)
    The cavern functions as micro-setting: its vibrations replace sound for Elara, constraining her discovery path. Torches, stone walls, and the half-finished drum are tactile, lived-in, and return in the final image. Seasonal “rustle” is repeated twice; it mirrors internal thaw but never alters tactics—decorative, not causal. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no impossible object moves.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stone bench, barred gate, spiral staircase—each object is tactile and steers movement; the tube’s worn surface mirrors Elias’s own eroded solitude. Industrial wasteland is sketched with swift, selective strokes (“rusted factories and abandoned warehouses”) that conserve word-count yet constrain infiltration tactics. Weather motif marries internal state: dusk air “heavy with damp earth” prefaces the unnatural storm reveal, charging the final courtyard image. No symbolic overreach; detail stays subordinate to choice.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    City-alley shop, fogged greenhouse, and sterile hospital are sketched with scent-first economy; each locale is filtered through Elias’s jasmine-rain trauma, so setting doubles as emotional micro-climate. The ultraviolet vial and extinct-plant jars are concrete props that constrain vision and memory, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across the dream-shifts; no floating rooms. Selective sensory hierarchy (scent > sight) keeps exposition lean, though “crystal shadows” flirts with poetic overload once or twice.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Terra-cotta grotto is not backdrop but tool: its shifting patterns guide Elias’s fingers and literally reveal the map/mirror; the cracked walls echo the frayed rope fibers, charging the final image. Starlight through cracks narrows sensory field to what constrains choice—sight and touch—while smell/taste are credibly omitted under calm focus. Spatial choreography tracks rope-coil, alcove approach, mirror placement without drift. Micro-setting (rope as prison relic) functions as mobile environment that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Greenhouse glass, shipwreck ribs, and ash under fingernails deliver sensory economy; the fractured glass catching light reappears at closure to mirror the repaired sonic “glass,” qualifying as environment charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    Grotto acts as micro-setting: mineral tang and static-charged air guide Elara’s sensing method and timing of the dissolve. Amber light evolves from mere color to emotional filter at closure, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no prop drift.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.2)
    Salt-pine breeze and open-roof library are sketched with quick sensory strokes; details are filtered through Elara’s seaside habits. Setting never constrains her choices; the library could be any quiet place. Stars provide mood but do not charge the final image beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    The crystalline orchard is not backdrop; its refracted light and shifting arbor patterns mirror Lira’s emotional refraction, guiding her choices—she sculpts what literally glows, and the crater’s edge physically limits how far she can wander before needing community. Tool detail (marsh-reeds) is handled tactilely: reeds split, twist, scar her fingers, constraining what forms she can attempt. Spatial choreography stays coherent: arbor base → alley wall → her own sculpture; no impossible jumps. The final image of the arbor with Echo’s tag recharges the setting, making the orchard itself the recognition she sought—environment actively participates in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rooftop canal, slick ledge, and glowing gate provide tactile anchors; the pool’s mirror-still surface charges the final image. Selective sensory triage—visual, kinaesthetic, thermal—keeps momentum. Micro-setting (pendant against sternum) constrains the step onto the ledge, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cavern orchard is sketched with economical, sensual strokes—shimmering fruit, twisting roots, pale moon-fissure—and the glass eyes glint with shifting color, giving the milieu a memorable glow. Spatial anchors hold; the stepping-stone mosaic is revisited with purpose. Yet the setting never actively resists or endangers Elara; it decorates rather than constrains. High-band gate missed because no environmental detail shapes her final tactic or charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sapphire hush and pipe-chase acoustics are sensuous, selective, and POV-tinted; the library’s dark geometry guides the crawl-path and is revisited at the finale, lending micro-setting charge; however, no object or spatial constraint actively shapes the final decision—proximity remains atmospheric rather than tactical, so 9+ gate fails.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mossy trellis functions as micro-setting: first barrier, then gateway, finally tactile prop she leans against while soaked—literally supports her transformed stance. Rain’s scent and drumbeat narrow perception in real time, guiding her hand motions. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The trellis + storm together constrain the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    Island geography is sketched sparsely but functionally: tidal cove, ruin, cottage edge—each serves as access point for next beat. Salt-damp air, bioluminescent algae, and seaweed cloak ground the world in sensory bias of a painter’s eye. The amber brooch re-appears at desk in closing image, charging the final canvas with prior heat—meets 9+ gate. No spatial drift or white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    Cave as micro-setting constrains every beat: crystals sing when touched, walls shift, pearl pulses—environment actively rewrites her body. Sensory hierarchy follows Elara’s shrinking/merging perception: sound first, then light, then loss of proprioception. Spatial choreography stays coherent through the dissolve. Final image of “bright darkness” is charged by the cave’s own luminescence, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ivory Harbor’s half-buried hull, petrichor, and pooled-water glyphs constrain deciphering choices and charge the final image. The valve’s brass coolness and the carved wood fragment act as micro-settings that funnel attention. Weather residue affects footing and visibility, integrating with action rather than pausing it.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.1)
    Micro-setting triumph: the phantom punch is a tactile tool whose shifting symbols constrain every onward step; the starlit vault’s mist curls round ankles like a living thing, turning weather into antagonist. The brass coldness returns in the final breath, charging the exit image. Few broad landscapes are needed—this is a story of palm, metal, and breath—so economy wins over panoramic excess.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.1)
    Eldermere’s shore, migratory whales, and the ivy-choked tower are sketched with selective, sensory strokes; the tile’s warmth and the tower’s stone pedestal constrain her handling choices. Spatial choreography stays clean as she climbs; whale breaches and star wheel are synchronized to mirror interior shift, charging the final image without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prismatic escondite is rendered through kinetic, sensory filters (“light fractured,” “crystalline ledge,” “colors twisted into chaotic patterns”) that evolve with the action. Micro-setting—the fragment warming in his palm—grounds one pivotal beat. While the world rules remain impressionistic, the environment actively resists and responds to Elyr’s manipulation, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prep-room is vividly sketched—formaldehyde, wax, marble table—yet every detail is filtered through Clara’s con-artist-warped lens, so the room feels alive. The ink pot functions as micro-setting: its cracked porcelain and impossible ripple constrain her to keep holding it, guiding the pivotal choice. Spatial choreography is tight; no floating bodies. Funeral-home tech never exceeds Clara’s believable notice. Setting does not charge the final image (pot is set down, room left), so falls short of 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.9)
    The bonsai labyrinth is evoked with tactile economy—moss underfoot, rustling approval—and the fluorescent lamp’s flicker becomes a micro-setting that guides her timing. Spatial choreography stays clean; the forest never blocks or aids her in a way that alters tactics, so the setting enriches texture more than it constrains choice, keeping the score just sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Port-container maze is vividly evoked through rust, crane-hum, salt air; spatial choreography stays consistent as the wanderer moves. Sensory hierarchy reflects the POV—sound of lullabies on wind, feel of frayed labels—though tactile interaction with containers is brief. Tide rhythm supplies live environmental pressure, revealed objects (mudflat watch, letter) integrate with action. Setting never constrains a final tactical choice, so capped below 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Observatory cracks, cliff salt, and cello wood are not backdrop but pressure sources: the half-finished cello literally provides the resonance that triggers the shift. Shell-glow and tilting room charge the final image; environment forces the stance crystallization. Sensory hierarchy is POV-tight—Mara notices moss streaks because they map time, not scenery. Spatial choreography survives the single-scene tilt with no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.7)
    The raft city’s “jigsaw puzzle of dreams and desperation” is vivid, tactile, and filtered through Lira’s priorities. Festival-night color dynamics directly charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays coherent; barges, lanterns, distances track. A few carnival clichés (“whispered promises,” “stars twinkled”) dull specificity but not enough to cap.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    Regolith crunch, visor fog, drone hover, and low-g choreography are woven through action, not catalogued. Summit slope, module contour, and shifting light angles track cleanly and constrain camera placement and departure timing. The sand grain serves as micro-setting that charges the final image. One minus: lunar night chemistry that reveals text at sunrise is asserted without prior world-rule seeding, slightly denting credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mist-coated depot is filtered through Elara’s non-visual priorities—oil scent, chain groan, water-refraction cues—so setting is simultaneously macro (rail depot) and micro (her bench, the liquid mosaic). Spatial choreography is clean: traveler enters, relinquishes drone, departs; no floating props. Weather (mist, anchor splash) affects timing and mood but never blocks action. The glass-water installation is the star: it literally guides her patching decisions and returns in the final image, constraining her choice to stay.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.8)
    Environment is vividly selective: rusted outpost, frost-bitten boards, ice fissure, each filtered through Elara’s cartographer gaze. The lake’s micro-topography—thinner ice, sub-surface vibration, central mist—directly shapes her path and furnishes the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays crisp; only the phrasebook’s physical handling is under-instrumentalized.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    Selective sensory strokes (“faint scent of pine,” “whispers of the past”) paint the ghost town effectively; the archway and cobblestones function as micro-settings that channel sound and footfall. Spatial tracking stays clear, but the environment never actively resists or endangers Elias—its role is atmospheric mirror, not tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    Deep-sea temple is atmospherically rich, lightless and pressurized; carvings, crystals, and “gathered hush” give sensory hierarchy. Spatial choreography stays consistent as walls shift. Environment directly enables the memory-trip, satisfying 9+ gate. However, the oxygen timer—crucial to early specificity—is abandoned once visions begin, blunting environmental constraint at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Copper-lit ore veins and salt-rotted stone create tactile prison atmosphere; the lattice functions as micro-setting that guides descent and final refusal. Reef and lighthouse remain backdrop—never actively constrain escape—so environment stops short of charging the ultimate image.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.9)
    The alchemical greenhouse is rendered with tactile specificity—“petrified blossoms,” “glass walls like a second skin,” “branches twisted like the arms of a mourner”—and filters every detail through the ghost’s bereaved attention. Temperature contrast (warm sanctuary vs. winter-cracked fields) externalizes her liminal state, while the single anchor tree functions as micro-setting that literally roots her haunting. The final image of bead-light illuminating her path uses the environment to charge the closing beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    Red canyon walls, petrichor of “earth and time,” and the shifting illustrations on the metal plate are all tactile, POV-filtered, and finally constrain her last stitch—the glowing walls literally limit further passage. Spatial choreography is maintained through sleepwalking overlaps; no impossible positions. The micro-setting (plate as compass) charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.1)
    Catacomb orchard is vivid, selective, and tactile: roots “snaked between ancient bones like veins,” boots sink, slab edges are finger-smooth. The setting actively guides Elara’s route and supplies the sundial seat that unlocks the tomb, satisfying 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy skews visual; smell/taste of earth or rot is missing, but economy favors the image that charges closure. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the slab maneuver.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Golden arcade’s pillars, dew-muted chalk, and watermark envelope are selective, sensory, and filtered through Lyra’s decoder gaze. The clipboard micro-setting functions as tool-shield, constraining her stance at the mailbox. Dawn light evolves from “soft ethereal glow” to “full light,” mirroring knowledge shift without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clean; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cobalt glass dome, velvet cushion, silver-gold threads, eternal candle flame—each returns to constrain action: dome reflects twilight so Elara sees approaching Lira; flame anchors the gateway; threads become the map that reweights stakes. Autumn wind is sensory but doesn’t affect choices; still, the observatory’s micro-objects function as setting. Spatial choreography clean: door, window, cushion, candle stay tracked. Final image recharges the dome at dawn, now reframed as cosmic crossroads. Meets 9+ gate: observatory tools charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mangrove is sensually alive—“roots twisted like ancient fingers,” “air hummed”—and moonlight as liquid silver keeps returning to charge images. Micro-setting works: the gargoyle shard and condensation-window are tactile, handled twice each, and constrain action (she presses, reads, breaks seal). Spatial track is clean: deeper roots → clearing → hut → grove → exit. No object teleports; weather (moonlight) is repeatedly exploited for visibility and symbol. Detail never stalls momentum; each noun is re-used to anchor next move.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sensory triage is POV-driven—jasmine and damp earth cut through translator’s hyper-attuned nose; generators hum beyond ruined glass—details selected for conflict-zone ear. Micro-setting of the child’s cast and coral fragment function as geography: ridges provide literal cipher surface, glow gives low-light visibility for her task. Spatial choreography is clean—coral on table, cast in hand, doors at her back, step into night—no impossible drift. Environment does not physically constrain, so 9-gate unmet, but atmosphere charges the final threshold image.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    Fog operates as both atmosphere and active canvas; its shifting density literally enables the climax when Lira paints on mist. Ruined orchard is sketched with spare, POV-filtered cues—crumbling arch, damp earth—rather than catalog. Stone table and film warmth anchor tactile discovery. Final image of illuminated fog reweights the setting from dead space to living screen, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sound-wave garden is not backdrop but instrument: frequencies awaken the mural, metallic flowers supply the hum that she conducts, the etched nickel vibrates in her palm—each constrains her tactics and charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays crisp; no floating white-room moments. Micro-setting (coin, wall, her body as antenna) functions as extension of garden, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Greenhouse is densely sensed (hum of trapped insects, jasmine on coat, fogging panes) and supplies spatial hooks for stealth. Details are filtered through Elias’s goal—scanning for codes—so description stays in motion. Condensation on glass later mirrors tactical uncertainty, a subtle atmospheric echo. Setting never constrains choice (e.g., alarmed greenhouse door, territorial beetles) so it remains illustrative rather than instrumental, capping short of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.9)
    The gargantuan shell is vividly tactile—cool alcove, curved echo, wind-borne acoustics—and these sensory details guide her movement deeper inside. Selective focus keeps the postcard’s frayed edge and translucent wear in view, letting the object evolve from talisman to memory. Spatial choreography stays clean as she sits, sings, stands; no floating rooms. Environment does not constrain a final choice, so the 9+ gate fails, but the atmosphere is integral to the lyric texture.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    milky-blue walls and glass petals are vivid, selective, and consistently filtered through Elara’s caretaker gaze. The Vessel of Echoes and cracked bamboo tube act as micro-settings that constrain the final ritual—she must cradle one, release the other. Spatial choreography inside the museum is lightly sketched but sufficient for a lone actor. Cloud-density shift nicely mirrors internal thinning of breath, anchoring stakes in body.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Archive acts as micro-setting: dust, narrow beams, labyrinthine shelves constrain her movement and mirror internal maze. Glass inkwell evolves from myth prop to charged tool that reweights the final image. Sensory economy favors tactile (spines, glass) and auditory (hum) over visual clutter. Spatial choreography clean: she approaches inkwell, dips, writes; Kael placement clear in closing.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    The amphitheater’s stone “expanding and contracting as if alive” is used to cue Elias’s pacing and synchronize with his pulse, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment-as-constraint. Sensory hierarchy stays locked to his machinist gaze—brass links, damp stone, fissure light—never sliding into tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is crisp: chain uncoils, steps measured, dust-sketch centered. The volcano never quite threatens action, so the setting charges the image more than it narrows战术 options.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.5)
    Attic atmosphere is vivid—must, crumbling paper, shaft of skylight light—and the dust motes evolve from random to patterned, charging the final image. Sensory layering is selective (sight, sound of cooing, tactile meteorite weight), filtered through Elara’s obsessive attention. Spatial choreography is stable; the meteorite’s velvet pouch and marginal-message slips are re-used anchors. The bookshop beyond the attic is only gestured at, but within the micro-setting the objects constrain her mapping ritual, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    The terrace’s pane-by-pane refraction acts as both environment and instrument: it constrains her footing and filters memory, literally bending light to force the buried scene to surface. Glass groan, color wash, and mirror-images are tactically used rather than catalogued. Micro-setting (logbook pages, prism edges) is handled in motion and re-enters the final image as the abandoned object. Spatial choreography is flawless; weather/light rules are internally consistent and tied to emotional tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.0)
    Glass viewport, bioluminescent lantern, cracked dome, sunrise shaft—each filters perception and constrains exits. Lantern dims as pressure rises; viewport glass fogs then fractures, guiding final urgency. Underwater city never becomes tourist list; details stay tethered to Elara’s tactile use. Meets micro-setting gate; final image charged by fractured light.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    The geode-cave is not backdrop but instrument: its refracting walls and crater glass literally enable the transliteration spell; the place supplies the only tool and mirror. Sensory triangulation—violet/gold light, humming energy, smooth crystalline floor—anchors every attempt. Spatial choreography stays crisp as seeds move from pile to glass to palm. The micro-setting (the glass surface) functions as the story’s engine and final charged image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Glass ceiling, skylight, and star-beam are selective, never over-catalogued; the bishop piece itself becomes micro-setting that constrains every diagonal move. Sensory hierarchy tilts to visual, justified by celestial spectacle, yet tactile detail (“its jagged shape contrasting with the smooth squares”) roots action in hand. Spatial choreography is flawless; crowd vectors and pigeon scatter track cleanly across the board. Environment supplies both resource (starlight) and social stage, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    Garden’s midnight-silver petals function as micro-setting that constrains visibility and hides the ink ritual; tool (moonstone dust) and body (bare feet anchored) complete the triad. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but the selective lens (glow, dew, obsidian) mirrors internal state without cataloging. Spatial choreography holds: vial → palm → forearm → sentinel edge remains trackable. Environment supplies both resource (ink) and risk (exposure), charging the final image; meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mist-lit glass, rippled pond, and color-split dawn are sensuous, selective, and filtered through Elias’s glass-maker gaze; the prism-atrium reappears at the end, giving the micro-setting closure charge. Orientation is swift; Pearl Bay anchors by line 3, no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.7)
    The porcelain box operates as micro-setting: its cracks constrain Elias’s grip and mirror his skin, charging the final image. Moonlit ridge supplies immediate spatial edge—drop-off, silver light, boulder—but does not alter tactics beyond mood. Sensory triage is POV-true: smoke memory narrows attention to porcelain texture and lunar glow. Environment neither complicates nor resourcefully enables the closure act, so the 9+ gate is missed, yet the selective detail is vivid and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.3)
    The grotto is not backdrop but active antagonist: each wave deletes her equation, forcing real-time revision. Salient sensory triangulation—wet stone under bare feet, gauge needle trembling, seaweed elasticity—anchors POV bias. Micro-setting success: the gauge-as-altimeter becomes the story’s compass, constraining her final stance. Spatial choreography stays clean in a single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Micro-setting dominates: the ivy, cracked wall, and blackened hearth are tactile and constrain movement. Humidity and moss narrow her sensory field under the Accumulative lens. The film strip’s physical handling (slipping, catching light) satisfies the 9+ gate. Climate-shift is mentioned but never affects tactics; still, the ivy’s “breathing” and the fireplace ash charge the closure image, so no cap applied.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prism parapet and wet glass act as micro-setting: light refraction literally enables the mirage brushstrokes, constraining how Elara paints. Echoing terrace supplies acoustic feedback for the lullabies, while spring rain’s spectrum sets the color palette. Spatial choreography holds as Elara steps back from the parapet after the final bell. The setting charges the final image—prism shimmer fused with her wavering pulse—meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    The terrace functions as micro-setting: its sacred history is invoked to justify the leaders’ pause, and the dawn-light return charges the final image. Jasmine scent and flickering campfires are selective, not tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is clean—descent, camp, return. The clipboard as dark reflective surface mirrors the “flawed beauty” motif, satisfying the 9+ gate for an object that constrains/charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.1)
    Salt flat is vividly textured—mirror crust, shifting surface, damp pocket revealed—and directly guides the final choice: only that patch can incubate the egg. Thunder lull supplies a temporal constraint that sharpens the moment. POV-filtered sensory hierarchy is strong (visual, haptic, auditory). Micro-setting (egg, cloak, boots) interacts with terrain at every step. No contradiction or spatial drift. Environment does not merely backdrop but enables the closure image, meeting 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Silver courtyard, prism sanctuary, and falling snow are not backdrop: the lattice threads are literally woven from memories, so setting becomes the tool that must be manipulated; the crystalline walls refract starlight onto the final dance, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography stays clean—door, lattice, chamber track without drift. Sensory economy is tight—cold breath, hum of threads, swirl of voices—never catalogued. Environment plus body (poetic motion) together satisfy the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    Radar dome as micro-setting constrains acoustics and optics—every footstep echoes, cracked windows color dawn light—charging the final image of Elias exiting into “cool morning air.” Campfire stick is handled in multiple beats, its worn grooves anchoring memory and catalyzing epiphany. Spatial choreography is stable; dome’s stage remnants provide literal platform for new show. Sensory economy favors sound and touch, narrowing perception to Elias’s immediate goal without tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.1)
    Grotto is sensory, selective, and immediately filters through Elara’s esoteric realism; dappled light, moss, vine, and wing glint are woven through action rather than catalogued. Micro-setting (the spiral itself) becomes the decisive “place” that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible positions or floating props.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Glacial walls, aurora pulses, pine-frost scent—details filter through Elara’s artisan eye and kinesthetic rope work. The ceremonial rope operates as micro-setting that constrains every finger placement, then charges the final glow. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible shifts. Environment never stalls momentum; each sensory pick advances the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vine-draped bunker functions as micro-setting: its wafer-locked door, shifting wall-patterns, and storm-beaten roof constrain tempo and attention. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (botanist precision on vines, engineer eye on fractals) and integrates with action rather than pausing for postcards. The forest outside stays generic, but the bunker itself is irreplaceable to the closure image—its light-dappled corridors collapse into the seal’s dissolution—meeting the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    Palace and observatory are sketched with tourist landmarks (“towering ziggurats,” “dimly lit halls”) rather than sensory particulars that guide Kael’s choices. The celestial-schematic floor is the one micro-setting that works—it orients him toward the compartment—but it isn’t re-visited or charged at the end. Descriptions stay visual-only and do not complicate action, so atmosphere serves backdrop more than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    Soundless sanctuary is evoked through absence—no echo, no water splash—creating a liminal micro-setting that constrains choice (words carry extra weight). Velvet texture on the music box and the broken pin give tactile anchors; the marble fountain supplies spatial footing. Sensory economy is strong, but wider cosmology (“shifting realities”) is asserted not shown, keeping atmosphere intimate rather than world-scale. Final image of the broken pin held between them recharges the object’s meaning without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    The fog is not backdrop but antagonist: it presses windows, thins under sextant sight, guides her boot-crunch timing. Micro-setting triumph: the cracked prism’s “swirling patterns of light” function as mutable terrain she must navigate. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s lens—polished-glass scent, frost-sound underfoot—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless; lanterns, sextant, and body positions track without drift. Final image of lush orchard revealed through the sight qualifies as environment charging the closure, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orchard-as-ecosystem is tactile: roots “entwined with ancient stones” forces Elara to climb and reach; the glowing flowers provide the only light at climax, charging the image. Cathedral decay is filtered through maternal urgency—she notices crumbling stairs only as footholds. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: scent of bloom first, visual fragments second. Micro-setting (ribbon on belt) constrains the compass move, passing 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.3)
    Astral orchard is rendered through starlight petals, whisper gravity, and mirrored bathroom—each detail constrains Elara’s movement and attention. The cameo itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Selective sensorium (hum resonating in ribs, faint warmth in palm) stays tied to POV priorities. Spatial choreography is ghost-light but tracked; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mountain-bookstore is vivid (“shelves shifting imperceptibly,” “books that snapped like jaws”) and constrains movement, supplying traps and resources. Garden’s temporal glow feeds the final image. Selective sensory triangulation (moss-leather spines, ticking petals) keeps economy. Spatial choreography clean; no geography drift. Environment mirrors internal state (labyrinth = puzzle mindset) without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Salt-rot mirrors internal decay; mirrors, rust, fog keep sensory triangulation tight; "rusted hull groaning under the weight of forgotten dreams" is a perfect POV-filtered phrase. Setting never constrains a tactical choice—she could read diaries anywhere—so 9-band gate stays closed. Spatial choreography clean; time tracked by card-glow beats. Strong atmospheric specificity, but environment doesn’t charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mechanism room is vividly tactile—brass lamp glow, frayed fibers, gear-click rhythm—and the ceremonial rope functions as micro-setting that literally constrains the final action. Spatial choreography is immaculate: seal, rope, and door remain in consistent relation. While the wider university is a placeholder, the clock-tower interior charges the closure image sufficiently for the 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Caves, ice veins, and seed are vividly lit (“gently luminous glow,” “shimmering petals”) and filter through Lira’s map-keeper gaze. Spatial choreography stays clean; distance and motion track. The caves’ hum evolves from warning to lullaby, mirroring conflict arc. However, environment never materially blocks or enables a choice; it’s backdrop, not crucible—hence 9-band gate fails.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.0)
    The pavilion’s glass walls, spiral staircase, cracked telescope, and star-map floor actively constrain motion and supply tools for every beat. Micro-setting (the prism pedestal) charges the final image when light patterns re-inscribe the walls. Sensory balance favors visual and haptic detail filtered through Elara’s custodian bias. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms or white-space syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stormlit observatory, crystal stones, brass caliper, and solid fog wall are specific, sensory, and bias-filtered. Micro-settings (calipers, stones under palm) constrain measurement tactics and later perception. Spatial choreography holds across monuments; no impossible moves. Final dawn light recharges “stormlit” motif, crystallizing vigilance. No environment-forced adaptation beyond revelation; hence not quite 9.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting is more mood-board than constraint: vines "shimmer," fountain "stands," walls "bloom," but none of these features resists or enables Lira’s moves. The kerosene rag becomes the de-facto micro-setting that travels with her, yet it never malfunctions, runs short, or threatens her fingers—hence no tactical squeeze. Spatial geography inside the courtyard stays impressionistic; crowd distance and exit vectors are absent. The fortress is vivid wallpaper, not a lever that shapes tactics or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Grotto as micro-setting is star-lit ceiling, moss stone, tidal pool—selective, tactile, and filters through Elara’s chronicler gaze. Jade cicada serves as portable setting-cum-tool, its carvings literally shifting to constrain her final stance. No spatial drift; celestial tapestry returns in last line, charging the RR. Meets 9+ gate but cap at 8.8 because cicada, not geology, drives the decisive image.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.1)
    The xenial trellis is more poetic postcard than obstacle course; its vines are “fragile,” “swaying,” but never snag, snap, or force a detour, so the environment constrains choice only nominally. Cloud-thin air, narrow bunker windows, and gravity inversion are evoked with selective sensory strokes, giving atmosphere without clutter. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible positions. For 9+ I needed the trellis or doll to actively limit a move at climax; instead the path feels conveniently accommodating, so cap holds at 8.1.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    The drifting prism terrace is more than scenery: its sonic geography literally steers the gondola and filters Mira’s recovery. Selective sensory focus—light fracturing into “thousand hues,” jasmine scent at the floating garden—keeps description economical and tethered to Elias’s POV bias toward hush. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating-room syndrome. The micro-setting (storm-glass vial) doubles as setting-as-tool, constraining every course correction.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Kaleidoscopic waterfall and pulsing fruit compress color and time into a single perceptual field; the flake’s glow becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography clean—“stepped behind the veil”—no impossible moves. Sensory selection skews visual; other senses only gestured. Setting constraints (time, color, flake resonance) directly shape unlock sequence and ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ashen charcoal sanctuary is more than backdrop: its starlit remnants dictate Lira’s lateral movement, supply the visual mirror for her glittering scars, and frame the final image. The doorknocker ring evolves from heirloom to spent tool—its cracked dullness is the closure’s visual cost. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Meets 9+ gate: environment charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bioluminescent farm is sketched with selective sensory detail (air shimmer, fungal glow) that filters through Elara’s goggles. The parallel dimension is rendered in postcard lists (“towers of time, rivers of memory”) but the final image returns to the bolt-gleam on the farm, giving the micro-object setting payoff. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single transition. Environment does not constrain tactics, so capped below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sepia room anchors immediately; golden shadows, paper scent, and brass glint are selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography stays clean as Eleanor crosses to the gramophone. The bridge vision is sketched with just enough sensory cue (wood planks, sky hues) to function as alternate setting without over-extension.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    The greenhouse is not backdrop but instrument: bioluminescent vines teach the marionette patterns, constrain Alaric’s reading of reality, and supply the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—gravel crunch, gauntlet clang, ink seepage—each tactile beat maps onto the next without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    The file room is rendered through tactile micro-details—sagging shelves, manila scent, frayed folder edges—each filtering Elara’s archivist eye. Spatial choreography is tight: button corner → desk → magnifying glass → letter spill, all tracked without drift. Light from the dusty window physically charges the button scratches, letting setting constrain discovery rather than decorate. The foster-care archives as “sanctuary of unknown histories” reweights at closure, meeting the 9+ gate for environment charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lagoon surface, submerged door, and archival dust are selectively textured; starlight-on-water returns in the final image, reweighting the stakes. The micro-setting of the brass key in Mara’s wet palm constrains her grip and signals defiance under pressure. No sensory checklist; each detail is filtered through Mara’s goal-directed attention, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.9)
    “Radiant grotto” is vividly particular—luminous moss, rotating prism, dew as diamonds—filtering through a lone musician’s hush. Sensory hierarchy narrows to breath-mist-sound, matching the hush mandate. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt. Micro-setting (the prism) actively refracts climax light, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.1)
    The arbor’s ash-grey hush is filtered through Elara’s seed-sorting fingertips—wood scent, leaf whisper, fire-shadow—so environment and body are one micro-setting. The moonstone’s glow finally charges the monument circle, satisfying the 9+ gate, though spatial choreography beyond her lap remains sketchy.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Selective sensory detail (humid greenhouse air, bioluminescent fungi, brass chill of compass) is filtered through tinkerer’s tool-centric eye. The greenhouse and cavern function as micro-settings that constrain movement and supply the map, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays crisp; no world-rule inconsistencies. Weather (rain → stop) mirrors mood shift without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    Foundry is sketched with wet iron, cold mouth, moonlit glaze—selective, tactile, and filtered through Elara’s alchemical eye. Weather stays active: rain stops only after she steps out, cueing internal shift. Spatial choreography is clean—coin warms, furnace breathes, floor steadies underfoot—no floating props. Senses skew visual/thermal; a sniff of scorched oil or ringing anvil could have raised this to 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.1)
    Echo Gorge is more acoustic than visual; the acoustic lens narrows perception to whispers and footfalls, making setting a tool that shapes tactics—sound guides her pursuit. The harp’s misaligned strings serve as portable micro-setting; their vibration alters what can be confessed. “Luminous ache” risks poetic overlap yet stays consistent, and the gorge never dissolves into white-room. Spatial choreography is clean—she descends, confronts, collects, exits—objects track, no phantom props.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>7.6</question><comment>Dominant stake—extract confession without re-traumatising—signals early. Mid-scene tightening occurs when the father’s memory visualises; Elara must decide to keep playing (risk merging with his grief) or stop—she plays, foreclosing detachment. Cost is emotional, not physical, but legible: her own chest “aches” and the gorge ends up laughing, not her. Escalation is single-wave, not reversed, yet sufficient for flash length.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.1)
    Ultraviolet forest is not postcard scenery: the glowing roots literally guide her footing, and the humming bark pulses against her spine, constraining every step. Micro-setting succeeds: the pewter strap acts as portable setting/object that charges the final image when it sinks. Sensory hierarchy stays biased to her enhanced proprioception, filtering noise into relevant tactical data.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rooftop market is sketched with copper/sage scent and rope choreography; spatial planes stay consistent as Lila descends. Lens fragment functions as micro-setting—its pulsing light literally illuminates the hidden doorway, constraining her next move. Weather and city spires are filtered through her lighthouse nostalgia, never tourist catalog. Final image of dawn on spires mirrors internal reconfiguration, satisfying 9+ gate. Minor slip: tower interior sketched in two lines, less tactile than market.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    Micro-setting dominates: the brass barrel and the cracked clock become the tactile environment that constrains choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys Marcus’s technician eye—dust thickness, brass tarnish, gear fit—rather than tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: counter ascent, tile lift, barrel insertion. Final image (ticking clock in healed ceiling) recharges the “cracks” motif, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glass orchard library is vividly particular: crystalline spires, brass letterpress gears, frost runes that “pulse faintly with an otherworldly light.” These sensory details are filtered through Elara’s professional eye and directly enable discovery. The floating/cloud-sea physics are asserted, not tested, but the setting still constrains her descent and reconfigures the library’s meaning at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Baroque asteroid is rendered through kinetic sensory filters (“gilded spires,” “torrents of luminescence”) that pressure action. Micro-setting succeeds: the shard’s facets literally constrain the ritual by refracting storm-light onto mirrors. Spatial choreography clean; mirrors and cloth positions track intact. Slight over-painting in third paragraph slows momentum a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.5)
    The resonance-chamber oak workshop and the red-dust gear cavern are vividly sketched with sonic/olfactory detail. The chip’s stolen-dawn shimmer and the river’s secret-hum are selective, not tourist-catalog. Setting never physically constrains Elias’s choices—no gear blocks him, no chamber layout forces tactic—so it decorates rather than charges the closure. Meets 9+ gate for environment richness but lacks final-image constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.7)
    Factory rubble, moss-eaten door, and bioluminescent water are sketched with sharp, smell-forward filters that mirror Elara’s vocation. Setting never blocks or enables a concrete choice—it is spectacle, not crucible—so it falls short of the 9+ gate that demands environmental constraint on the final image. Spatial clarity is good; no geography drift. Sensory hierarchy is biased toward petrichor, reinforcing character, but other senses are lightly treated.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.1)
    Storm-arch, chamber, and slide function as micro-setting; the wind’s cessation cues the hidden passage, literally altering her available moves. Salt scent and stone carvings are filtered through sculptor’s tactile bias; the final pedestal reprises the slide’s pattern, linking body-tool-environment. Weather shift from chaos to hush operates as causal gate, not backdrop; could edge higher if slide’s glass edges physically cut or constrain her grip under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara’s painter-eye: “amber pavilion,” “shards of color,” “etched glass…whispered secrets.” Spatial choreography is ghosted but not violated; the cathedral’s scale is evoked more than walked. Weather shift from “last snow” to spring is tracked and mirrored in internal thaw. The environment does not constrain tactical choice, so the 9+ gate is missed, but the atmosphere is texturally rich and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.0)
    Zeppelin library and obsidian lagoon are sharply imaged, each filtered through Elara’s archivist gaze. Micro-setting works: diary as handled object focuses beats; lagoon surface mirrors sky, charging final image. Selective sensory economy—dawn hush, sand sink, engine hum—grounds transitions. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible moves. Environment does not constrain tactics (she could leave at any time), so gate to 9+ unmet; 8.0 is ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.1)
    Paper-Lantern Cove is rendered through motion—sand half-burying the bottle, crumbling facades that “shift,” lanterns floating above water. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Elara notices tactile warmth, then shifting light, then distant laughter. The environment directly enables the conceiving act: the empty cobblestones become the canvas on which she projects the new city. Final image of lanterns persisting after departure charges the scene with residual cost, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.3)
    The rooftop orchard is more than postcard glamour: the humming fruit and etched oak bark actively constrain interpretation and supply the final ritual stage. Micro-setting extends to the warm shaving in her palm—object-as-setting that channels the dead language. Spatial choreography is immaculate; she never floats in a white room. The harbor silence acts as environmental metronome, tightening the perceptual field to the garden’s edge. All sensory picks (velvet air, gnarled bark) are filtered through her scribe’s bias toward texture and inscription.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.1)
    Icebound atrium and starlight spires are vividly sketched, but the spatial choreography is fuzzy: the archway’s distance, the vortex’s physical edge, and Elara’s body position blur during the threshold moment. Sensory hierarchy is present yet tilted to the decorative rather than the tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    The belfry, rope, and shifting air pressure are tactile constraints that decide when and why Elias acts. Selective sensory filtering—frayed fibers, warmth in hemp, stilling wind—mirrors interior calm and charges the final resonance. Micro-setting qualifies and passes the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Station and void are sketched with selective, sensory strokes; lantern as micro-setting constrains her hand and final image. “Skeletal frame etched against the infinite void” gives primal elegance without clutter. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single corridor-to-deck move.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    The skeletal greenhouse, cracked cottage, and hidden well are tactile, lived-in, and directly enable the ritual beats. Sensory hierarchy skews visual but stays selective; wind and temperature guide attention under drought urgency. Micro-setting (box as cooling shade) constrains Elias’s pacing and ultimately carries the final image. Environment could tighten one more non-visual sense at climax to reach 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.1)
    Emerald silo, weathered metal, whispering pines give quick, efficient anchoring. The body-as-setting appears when Elara touches the fragment and the silo hums through her, a tactile micro-setting that constrains her next move. Garage-sale montage is sketched, not choreographed; spatial clarity weakens amid the crowd. Final image of the urn on her desk re-uses the object as micro-setting, but the chamber description is generic “ancient artifacts,” lacking sensory specificity that would charge the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lagoon, wet earth, salt, and damp sand are selective, sensory, and filtered through the poet’s bias; the kite frame later becomes micro-setting that guides her fingers and choices. Spatial choreography is clean—footprints, tide line, water’s edge track logically. Weather is causal: dawn light and post-rain stillness enable reflection and the eventual wind pick-up for launch. No object or setting constrains the final image beyond the kite itself, capping entry to the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    Temple orchard, living stone pillars, and copper-wrapped oak arches are vividly particularized, constrain Elias’s movements, and mirror the closing labyrinth image. Sensory detail is selective (visual haptics of wire hum) rather than encyclopedic. The pillars’ interior carvings supply micro-setting that charges the final image when they “glow,” meeting the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.1)
    Tower, path, and amber function as micro-settings that physically constrain ascent and final placement; rain-glazed stone and wet-earth scent are filtered through Elara’s academic gaze. Spatial choreography is exact—footprints deepen, ledge meeting is mid-ascent, summit chamber centered—no floating white-room. Spring decay/renewal paradox mirrors theme without overt symbolism; the environment is tactile, lived-in, and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory triage favors scent and color; jetty’s decay vs. bloom is vivid, selective. “Narrow vastness” re-appears as charged micro-setting in final image. Environment does not constrain tactics, so capped below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Scrapyard textures—“rusted sheets of steel and shattered glass,” “metallic tang of corrosion”—are selective and filtered through Elias’s nose. The factory interior narrows to the workbench, phonograph, and shifting symbols, guiding the final perceptual flip. Micro-setting (the leaf) charges closure by re-veining light. While environment never actively blocks or wounds the protagonist, it constrains attention and thus meets the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Icebound spire is vividly etched—“crystalline peaks shimmering with star fragments”—and the chessboard chamber constrains the climax, meeting the 9+ gate. Sensory selection skews visual, but cold’s bite is felt through breath and footfall. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography floats. Selective detail keeps momentum; no exposition dumps stall the ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    The whispering gallery is sketched through acoustic immediacy—“echoes linger… weight of forgotten conversations”—and the floor-pattern walk turns setting into active grammar. Sensory economy is POV-tilted: Elara notices tactile grooves, not frescoes, fitting her haptic historian bent. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies track around the board and etched floor without drift. The board itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for object-use, but broader environmental constraint on choice remains light, capping at 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.0)
    The mountain bookstore is sketched with selective, POV-filtered detail—groaning shelves, stained-glass light—functioning as a mind-maze that externalizes memory. Micro-setting of the circular clearing at the end literally reconfigures space in tandem with the interior shift, passing the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy favors shifting light and touch, mirroring Elara’s mercury-glass fluidity. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.1)
    “Time-frozen village,” “woven hush,” and platinum labyrinth are sketched with selective, mood-aligned detail; sensory focus stays tight to Elara’s tactile attention (wooden chess piece, metallic shimmer). Setting quietly directs choice: tapestry border must be studied at entrance, labyrinth walls physically reflect/refract her image, cueing self-examination. Micro-object—chess piece—returns in final beat as talisman, satisfying 9+ gate. Thunder lull as environmental clock is named but never concretely presses action; thus environment aids tone more than tactic constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is not backdrop but pressure engine: bone towers swallow sound, mist thickens as she speaks, spire glow only when verbal shards accumulate. Tactile handling of stone and swirling vapor constrain pacing and posture. Final image of parted mist revealing a solitary path is micro-setting that crystallizes the reconfigured stake. One minor cadence of “towers of bone… canyon of endless echoes” edges toward template, not enough to ding.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Workshop is rendered through smell of oil, ticking clockwork, tilting floor plates that force Elara to widen her stance—environment literally changes her posture. Acid sea is not backdrop but timekeeper: its hiss grows from ambience to hull-battering threat, guiding pacing. Statue as micro-setting constrains the climax: only its exact surface pattern unlocks memory; the pockmarks’ glow supplies final image. Consistent proper-noun economy: ‘gears-and-cogs workshop’ and ‘acid sea’ reused, never renamed.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cave pool as “inverted chandelier” mirrors canvas and final painting, constraining her decision to paint; this micro-setting charges the closure image. Sensory selection remains painterly—visual luster, mineral drip—filtered through Elara’s professional eye. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drift. Weather is absent, but rock and tide are consistent; world rules are learned through action, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lighthouse, dawn-cool air, and jasmine scent are vividly filtered through Elias’s bodily attention; stones, spiral stairs, and beam rhythm ground every move. The garden-at-night scent is over-declared yet never affects physical possibility (no allergy, no disorientation), so it decorates rather than constrains. Micro-setting of cork-in-pocket returns but never alters tactical choice—no screw, no seal, no risk. Still, sensory hierarchy stays tight and POV-colored; spatial choreography clean.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.8)
    Wind-scoured cliff, rusted walls, and moonlit bronze give tactile grit; the station’s ruined hydraulics could have constrained build tactics but remain backdrop. Micro-setting (censer foot in palm) charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate, yet spatial choreography never complicates action—tools and bodies stay loosely placed.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hanging orchard is evoked with selective, truffle-scented detail—twisted branches, damp air, storm-scarred bark—and the glass eye’s micro-setting (soil, sunbeam, color shift) constrains the ritual moment. Spatial choreography is clean across ravine ascent and village; weather mirror (predawn calm vs. earlier storms) subtly reweights the final grace. No orientation debt; environment charges the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.1)
    Opal dock, mist, lantern posts, boot print, and lighthouse beam are tactically woven through action rather than listed; each new detail is noticed because Elias searches, satisfying economy. Micro-setting of the dock planks constrains his movement and literally supports the evidence beats. Nautical twilight is named early and returns in the final sweep of light, charging the last image. No credibility slips; spatial choreography clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “blooming cavern” is tactile: bioluminescent moss scent, damp earth, silver-leafed trees. The shop’s “faded parchment and crumbling atlases” is lived-in shorthand that quickly signals vocation. Spatial choreography is flawless—ants → crack → passage → archway → violet sky—without floating bodies. The creek’s rising and ebbing tracks the emotional cadence, tightening then releasing pressure, and charges the final image of receding waters.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sensory triangulation—ember glow against twilight, metallic scent, pulsing crystal walls—anchors the ridge/grotto environment; the grotto’s temperature and pulse physically restrict her pace, so the setting alters tactics; fireflies and starlight reappear at closure to reweight stakes, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    The shell-as-micro-setting constrains every tactical move: its spiral grooves dictate where Kael places his fingers, its glow governs the tempo of chant. Twilight ember nexus acts as pressure chamber: sky color shift mirrors internal stakes, forcing the experiment now, not later. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly—no impossible positions as the two circle the expanding spiral. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Elara notices shell temperature, light refraction, Kael’s breathing, all filtered through an alchemist’s tool-centric gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mountain cabin, birch scroll, and star-strewn dream-sky are rendered with selective, sense-driven detail; the scroll evolves from brittle artifact to glowing map, constraining her choice to take flight. Spatial choreography stays coherent as she lifts off and looks back at the “tiny speck” cabin, anchoring the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Fog, brass gears, and the midwife screw function as micro-setting that constrain tactile choice; the shop’s drip cadence literally times Elara’s breath. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered—no smell, so touch and hearing sharpen—and the worn threads of the screw mirror her own eroded certainties. Spatial choreography is immaculate: bench, window, fogged glass track across beats. The screw’s final placement beside the repaired clock charges the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    The platform-as-micro-setting constrains every motion: sway synchronizes with heartbeat, abyss below prevents retreat, steam mingles with storm mist to charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—obsidian glint, bitter tea, rain’s single tap—never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: quill tracked in hand, tea set remains centered, body kneels then stands. Environment mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism—storm ceases because she stops feeding it, not because weather obeys theme.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sheet music archive functions as micro-setting: the shelves’ “whispered secrets” guide her attention to the bottle and later echo back as glowing notes, constraining her ritual. Orchard outside is sketched through sensory economy—held-breath air, rustle of soon-lost leaves—mirroring internal stakes without cataloguing. Spatial choreography is clean: corner-lamp → shelf → outside grove, no impossible moves. The perfume bottle itself acts as portable setting that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.6)
    Library corridors, mural stone, pages that rearrange under fingertips—each tactile detail is filtered through the witness’s hieratic attention, turning setting into cognitive instrument. The softcover dictionary operates as micro-setting that constrains every beat; its final fusion with the mural directly charges the resonant image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    The station, body, and key act as interlocking micro-settings: the brass clock face glints, the stone floor receives the key’s clink, the whistle’s sound collar the silence. Selective sensory hierarchy—visual glint, auditory clink, haptic worn edges—mirrors Elias’s narrowing attention under pressure. Spatial choreography is clean: key slips → kneel → slot found → compartment opens → horizon viewed. Weather shift (mist clearing) is causal, not decorative, forcing the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.9)
    Farm is evocatively lit and anchored early; the glowing mushrooms constrain visibility and supply the final charged object. Spatial choreography stays legible as Elara tracks footprints; no impossible positions. Yet the setting never actively obstructs or enables her choices—she could reach the same clearing in daylight—so environment informs mood more than tactics, capping entry to 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rainwashed stone, mica lantern light, and scent of old books are selective and POV-filtered; the lantern’s refracted pattern literally charges the final image. Spatial choreography is stable—aisles, window, table—without white-room drift. Weather stays external ornament; it never constrains choice or resource. Micro-setting (notebook, lantern pane) does the heavy lifting, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is more than postcard: condensation, rust streaks, and the dangling receiver constrain Eli’s movements and mirror his corrosion. The glass disc functions as micro-setting—its grooves, weight, and rising temperature literally narrow his options. Subway tunnel details (grates, vibration, distance of trains) are filtered through Eli’s tunnel-ear; no static catalog. Final image of first light through grates recharges the motif of emergence without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.9)
    Ivy, damp wood, and frozen clock hands are sharply sensory and filter through Elara’s disaster-scarred gaze. The station’s spatial logic is clean: debris pile, corner glow, retreating vines track cleanly across beats. Environment does not constrain her choices—she could leave at any point—so the setting beautifies rather than pressures. Still, the final image of overcast sky outside the re-decayed station supplies a resonant, mirrored mood that reconfigures her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    The gravitational anomaly is more light show than constraint—no spatial or tactical friction beyond “float.” Yet the pen-as-micro-setting fills the gap: its warming nib and inkless flow literally enable the final inscription, tethering the closure image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“crunched on cracked earth”). For 9+ gate, I need environment to shape tactics; here the anomaly allows rather than limits, so capped just below.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.1)
    Harbor is sketched with selective sensory strokes—moonlit shimmer, refracted prisms—filtered through Elara’s perception, never touristic. The camera’s brass body functions as micro-setting that constrains the final beat: its impossible click anchors the magical turn. Spatial choreography is minimal yet coherent; no floating objects. Weather and light evolve with the emotional cadence, supporting the accumulative design without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    Archive is sketched in atmospheric strokes (echoing stone, dust, dim light) that stay consistent. Sensory range is narrow—mostly visual—but selective enough to avoid clutter. The vandalized portrait and tapestry serve as micro-settings that focus attention; they do not physically constrain choice, so the 9-gate is missed. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms or impossible moves.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>6.2</question><comment>Dominant stake—“rescue a forgotten promise”—is signaled early and reiterated, but the promise’s content remains abstract until the scroll. Escalation is accumulative: each artwork adds a layer of meaning rather than narrows physical options. No credible loss (time, tool, risk of capture) is shown; pressure is intellectual, not visceral. The final scroll revelation reweights meaning, satisfying the 8.2+ gate for thematic cost, yet the absence of felt price keeps it mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sound-wave garden and auric lagoon are atmospherically rich; selective sensory detail (hum, glow, ripple) mirrors internal state without checklist overload. Micro-setting—the stone perch—literally supports the pivotal beat, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography clean; no prop drift. World rules remain poetic-consistent; “liquid memory” accepted as taught metaphor. Stakes would lose shimmer if setting swapped—setting is integral to texture and closure.

    Container geometry is sketched in motion—“corridors shifting,” “wall stacked impossibly high”—and directly blocks/permits progress, satisfying 9+ gate. Salt-rust air and flickering fluorescents filter through Eli’s maintenance gaze, grounding POV. Spatial choreography holds: map is wedged, key is pocketed, lock is proffered; no impossible placements. Storm’s magnetic pulse remains atmospheric rather than tactile; a missed chance to jar tools or scramble gait-rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cobalt dock planks, rain-slick and mirroring night sky, double as physical stage and metaphoric threshold; the dental mirror micro-setting literally reframes the setting inside the stranger’s eye. Weather and surface condition guide footing, pace, and risk of slipping—quiet tactile constraints. Guardian’s body is barely sketched yet present in “stepped back,” “tilted mirror,” enough to track spatially. Final image of stars in mirror fuses setting and interior state, meeting 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cobalt library and mist are anchored early; magnetic grotto returns twice, starlight charging the final image. Sensory triad (sight/sound/breath) is selective, filtered through Elias’s hush-obsessed attention. Micro-setting—chessboard abandoned mid-game—mirrors internal stall, constraining choice. Environment never actively obstructs or resource-strips, so stakes remain atmospheric rather than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sublittoral fringe is vividly filtered through Elara’s labor-hardened body; sand, silt, and emerald shafts are tactile and bias-driven. The disappearing island’s spatial logic is intentionally dreamlike but tracked cleanly: shore appears, heart pulses, island recedes. Scrimshaw functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Setting never constrains a tactical choice, capping entry to 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Farmhouse/turbine shadow is immediate, tactile, and filters every beat: blades “slice” air that Elara feels as surveillance. The dried bouquet and whittled shavings act as micro-setting that constrain choice—she hides them, then positions them on the sill. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over visual catalog. Wind-turbine scale could use one more lived detail (oil smell, low-frequency thrum) to reach 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.9)
    “Cobalt atrium,” “humming quartz,” and ice shards suspended “as if held by invisible hands” are vivid, sensory, and thematically integral. The frozen lake micro-setting re-sets physical possibility, allowing the levitation image that charges closure; however, the atrium’s internal layout stays vague, keeping the score shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.1)
    G courtyard is economically evoked—“shards of colored glass glinted like captured rainbows” gives instant visual bias filtered through Elias’s grayscale eye. Heat of furnace, cool shadow, and the metallic reed’s hum supply non-visual senses, matching POV priorities. Micro-setting (reed, palette, plant pots) repeatedly constrains action—Elias paints, barters, and performs with them. Spatial choreography stays clean; no floating bodies or impossible object leaps. The final image of monochrome canvas glowing under moonlit shards is charged and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lab’s “cluttered shelves” and the carbide lamp’s “clouded but luminous” surface supply tactile specificity; the micro-setting of the lens-as-prism constrains the sound-translating action. Golden shadows and obsolete hums create a consistent tone that mirrors Elara’s quiet quest. However, spatial choreography is static—no body movement alters the room or the device—and the industrial ruins outside remain a postcard backdrop rather than a pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.0)
    Observatory glass, brass telescope, and vellum stencil are knotted to her attention and choices; the telescope becomes the literal pivot on which she steadies herself for the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory economy is good—star-filtered light, silver dust, scent of blooms—though “curtains of intention” remain conceptually fuzzy and never acquire tactile resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rain-beaded skylight loft is anchored early and returns in the final image, its inherited mystery charging the closure. The measuring tape micro-setting constrains choice when Elara literally lays it across spreadsheets to quantify stolen millions. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (“rain tapped like distant Morse”) and tracks cleanly across the night.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Bronze prism pagoda functions as micro-setting: its shifting light constrains attention and ultimately reconfigures meaning. Archive is evoked through selective, sense-driven detail—“shadows danced across crumbling stone tablets”—rather than tourist list. Spatial choreography is clean; single POV filters perception, e.g., atoms of nostalgia “swirl around her like a living mist.” The pagoda’s amber-indigo refraction charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    Library-above-clouds is atmospherically rich, but the micro-setting that matters is the murky vial: its difference from glowing jars constrains Elara’s search and charges the final sculpture. Sensory selection stays biased to her dusk POV; spatial track clean. The vial’s tactile coldness and weight could have been exploited one beat earlier to hit 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    Misty cedar workshop and starlight filter through Elara’s handler gaze; the micro-setting of her cupped hands and re-ordered tools anchors the final image. Sensory selection is biased toward her vocation—earth, cedar, nocturnal hum—so environment doubles as emotional barometer without tourist cataloging. Could reach 9 if weather or spatial access had constrained her final gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    Frosted hourglass functions as micro-setting: it constrains every move (she carries it, it glows, it twin-merges) and supplies the final image. Visual and tactile detail are selective—ivy hum, meteor hush, crystal heartbeat—creating an oneiric consistency. Spatial choreography is clean down spiral stairs into cavern. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and light under urgency, supporting the dream-logic tone without exposition dump; environment literally channels her into the tunnel, so setting shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.9)
    Projection booth doubles as micro-setting: the dusty reels and cracked window filter moonlight onto the strip, constraining her ritual and later charging the final image. Sensory economy is strong—one beam, one hum, one strip—each detail re-used, none touristy. The palace’s grandeur is sketched quickly, then abandoned; the booth alone is lived-in and choice-shaping.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elaris and the stone archway function as micro-setting: the carved celestial symbols physically glow and shift, constraining Lira’s ritual and charging the final image. Aurora is rendered through sound (“symphony of light and sound”) and temperature (“cold stone,” “breath visible”), anchoring her body. Selective sensory hierarchy—only starlight, brass cold, aurora song—keeps density high without tourist catalog. The environment evolves across the single scene, mirroring her internal crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Glowing sand, floating orbs, and the silver wave charm deliver sensory specificity and constrain choice (she must clasp the charm to descend). The dune-as-character actively guides her feet and hums, integrating setting with beat-level action. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. The archive’s dying light mirrors the stakes, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mechanical rainforest is lived-in: uphill streams, cog-leaves, heartbeat-synced blooms all filter through Eamon’s body and attention. The small gear functions as micro-setting that finally slots into the dormant machine, charging the last image. Spatial choreography clean across translocations; no floating rooms.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.1)
    Salt-air dusk, scarred hull, mist-cloaked ridge—details are selective, sensory, and filtered through Mara’s fatigue. The ridgeway functions as micro-setting: its serpentine climb narrows her perceptual field, making the final cliff-edge stance legible. “Shoreline lullaby” diction is sustained without purple drift; sound and scent are balanced. One minor slip: “ancient trees” leans generic, but the grove is quickly abandoned for tactile sand and stream-song, keeping atmosphere alive.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cobalt light, snow blanket, yellowed keys, rusted bolt—details are selective, sensory, and filtered through Elias’s hush-biased attention. The fortress functions less as architecture than mood engine: corridors absorb sound, piano bench forces posture. Spatial choreography is crisp: staircase ascent → hidden door → pedestal. Environment never physically constrains choice, so misses 9+ gate, but charges the final image with color temperature that mirrors the frostbitten hope.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.0)
    Temple library is evocatively dusty-beamed, but detail stays pictorial; no shelf layout or access issue ever constrains choice. Ink pellet could serve as micro-setting but is only handled once; rune carved on spines never interacts with space or time. Ambient stones “hum” is generic; no sensory evolution under pressure, so environment never charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    The station is sketched with salty economy—“weathered metal frame,” “hummed with automated systems”—and the atlas page’s frayed edge is tactile enough to serve as micro-setting. Spatial choreography is flawless; the page is handled, flipped, spread on the floor, constraining her posture and attention. The vanished coastline is never physically entered, but its absence is made present through the watermark symbol that steers the final reconfiguration. One hairline slip: “periodically eternal” is asserted rather than grounded in sensory evidence of that cyclicality.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)
    Spaceport repair bay’s rusted hulks, fractured skylights, and half-buried stone circle are tactile, specific, and filter through Lira’s stargazer bias—she notices light angles, star-slit vistas, concrete chill on soles. Opera glasses function as micro-setting proxy: brass tarnish, grandmother aura, literal lens that refracts both vision and meaning. Environment actively constrains the ending: the hum emanates from the embedded circle, forcing her stance shift; the broken roof lets actual stars in, tying macro to micro. Sensory economy is tight—no tourist catalog, only the creaking bay and pulsing stones needed.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    Steam, bubbling, and amber-gold light are filtered through Mara’s urgency; the springs function as rebirth crucible rather than postcard. Spatial choreography stays clean across the guard confrontation. The kite-tail script gains micro-setting status by guiding the final act, satisfying the 9+ gate. Some sensory phrasing drifts toward template (“light like molten lava”), keeping it sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.1)
    Arboretum-as-micro-setting constrains the final choice: the secluded bench is discovered only because the paths “wind like veins,” letting her pivot from peril to art without leaving the scene. Salt-wind jasmine and “waves crashed against the rocks” are filtered through trauma-narrowed attention—smell and sound override visual catalog. Spatial track is immaculate: photo at cliff-edge, loose stone, sketchpad on bench—no floating props. Environment mirrors internal shift without emblematic over-signing.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse–library fusion is not backdrop but tool: the groaning walls narrow escape routes, the unseen lantern above becomes the object of re-oriented desire, salt-smell and paper-dust constrict breathing and hence attention. Spatial choreography is flawless—cards scatter, box stays, body ascends. Micro-setting ( Tower card) directly enables the final reconfiguration. Sensory economy obeys Elara’s painterly eye without tourist excess. Easily passes 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.0)
    Desert wind-carved topography is used as emotional seismograph (“world had paused to catch its breath”). The hummingbird drone and vial function as micro-setting objects that constrain tactics (tracking, final acceptance). Light-after-eclipse re-illuminates both sand and grief, charging the closing image. Spatial tracking stays clean throughout the single-scene move.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cryogenic library is economically evoked through frosted glass and humming terminal; snow-muffled acoustics mirror the “dizzying quiet” motif. Setting constrains action only by cold, but cold never endangers or slows Elara’s dexterity, so stakes remain cosmetic. No object or body-detail recurs to charge the final image; the letter is discarded rather than repurposed. Still, sensory selection stays tight to POV priorities—archivist notices data layers, not décor.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    Glass dome, desert waste, and living soil are filtered through Elara’s touch-POV, constraining her range of movement and anchoring the pacifist ethic. The engraved scrap re-enters to stabilize trellises, a micro-setting object that literally holds the garden up—meets 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy is tactile-first, obeying her “senselessly perceptive” frame. Spatial choreography clean; no static cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    The garden is rendered through selective synaesthesia—silence that “carries whispers,” soil that vibrates—so the setting itself is the antagonistic pressure. Spatial choreography is minimalist yet clean: pool edge → walking → goddess apparition → pool return, props tracked. The rail spike’s final glow proves the micro-setting object can charge the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3 even at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.1)
    Brass, cloud-gap, and echoing glass are filtered through Eleanor’s journalistic gaze, supplying tactile specificity that steers attention. The misaligned telescope array mirrors internal dissonance without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (rosewood nib, journal) doubles as decision tool, satisfying the 9+ gate. Only minor drift: “dusty star charts” is generic amid otherwise sharp selects.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.1)
    Laboratory, amber, and tattoo gun are rendered through sensory selectivity (“golden glow a stark contrast to the metallic sheen”) and constrain the final choice: the amber’s glow foreshadows the eventual stillness, the tattoos are the medium of penance. Spatial choreography is minimal but coherent; no white-room syndrome. The “folding time” rule is taught early and stays consistent. Environment does not charge the final image as strongly as the internal shift, so 9-band not quite reached.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mist, tiles, mandala-sand function as micro-setting that constrains perception and choice; flake-as-tool literally rewrites the pattern and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy (coolness against skin, emergent hush) is filtered through Elara’s artistic bias. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drift. Reaches 9-band gate: environment guides final stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.3)
    The skeletal minaret, ash-dust, and chipped tesserae create a tactile micro-setting that constrains Elara’s reclamation project; the mosaic literally guides her fingers. Sensory hierarchy is narrow—visual dust, acrid smell—mirroring her obsessive focus. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel, brush, stand, step back. The “shattered sky” is atmospheric but static; it never affects options, capping the score below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    The orchard-garden-fountain micro-complex is tactile and specific: cracked dry basin, moss, night-bloom scent; these details constrain where Mara can stand and where the fracture shimmers. Sensory layering is synesthetic yet filtered through her theatrical ghost-perception. The tarot coin functions as mobile setting-as-prop, its color shifts altering ambient light. Spatial choreography stays clean; no floating bodies. The hedge maze never tightens physically around the choice, so environment stops just short of dictating tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    Studio geography is sparse yet sufficient: LEDs, mirrors, geode on table—objects constrain camera angles and bodily movement. Light itself becomes micro-setting; its behavior (refraction, long-exposure trails) is specified beat-to-beat. The “ethereal hum” risks cliché, but tactile handling of tools keeps it lived-in. Final image re-uses environment to charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cave is more than backdrop: salt-thick air and bioluminescent algae narrow perception and guide her deeper. The elm fossil functions as micro-setting—its warmth and rotation constrain her attention and literally steer her body to the hidden chamber. Spatial choreography is clean; the pedestal’s presence is pre-shadowed by the fossil’s hum. Environment passes the 9+ gate by charging the final image, though the broader “after-hibernation” world rule is only asserted, not tested through tactile limits.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    The amber warehouse beneath the cliffs is more than postcard: its shelving geometry dictates the button-sorting choreography, and the sunlight filtering through dust becomes the echo’s first visible medium. The bone button’s tactile specificity (carved symbols matching jar markings) constrains the final unlock choice, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean as Elara moves from shelf to bench to threshold without drift. Sensory selection skews visual, but the haptic click of button against glass compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mist and snow function as both obstacle and cipher medium; setting directs footfall and decoding tactics. “Silver hush” and tilt of earth create sensory hierarchy tuned to spy wariness. Spatial choreography is tight; no impossible geography. Final dawn image re-charges earlier silver palette; however, the Bluff itself remains largely postcard, not agentive, preventing 9-band payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    Fog, river, ticking gutters supply textured micro-setting that filters POV attention. Selective sensory hierarchy (sound of gutters as clock) integrates with stakes. Environment never actively obstructs or enables choice, so caps below 9. Spatial choreography clean; no world-rule drift.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lantern glass functions as micro-setting—its shifting etchings literally redraw the visible world each beat, constraining where Elara steps and what she sees. Scorched wasteland and crumbling hive feel lived-in: clay dust sticks to sweat, smoke flattens against horizon, giving a tactile clock. Spatial choreography is flawless—glass, sun, hive shadows track without drift. Environment charges the final image: the once-faded glass now glows, so the setting itself is re-priced.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Moonlit harbor, fire-escape ledge, and the “old rosebush” are sketched with cinematic economy; selective lantern gleams on water mirror internal flickers without over-signalling. Spatial choreography is clean—third-floor descent to pier reads effortlessly. The lockmaster’s tooth and the lantern handle serve as micro-setting objects that finally interlock, earning the 9-quick test. Dock geography stays stable; weather merely decorates rather than constrains, capping just below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Tidal library above clouds is more than postcard: its shifting shelves physically redirect Elena’s path, forcing her to decode hum-directions—choice-constraining environment. Brass sundial serves as micro-setting/tool hybrid, its atomic reflection aligning with carvings to unlock door—specific tactile interaction. Sensory triage favors scent of parchment and metallic tang, both filtered through scholar’s priorities. Setting charges the final image: shelves rearrange to acknowledge orb-merged Elena, proving the environment registers her new state. Spatial choreography clean; no floating rooms or impossible geography.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    Micro-setting dominates: the spiral, the marble petal curve, the pond-surface that receives the final offering. Each detail is filtered through Elara’s synesthetic attention; the glass tower’s mirrored skin is introduced early enough to become the inevitable receptor. The environment literally constrains the only possible climax—only that groove can receive the nest—so the 9+ gate is met.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    The radio station is evoked through tactile micro-setting—vintage mics, tangled wires, concrete floor boots—each detail filtering Elara’s prioritization of obsolete tech as weapon. Charts re-enter as handled objects that guide calibration, not backdrop. The final “ethereal glow” mirrors her fragile win without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography survives the single-room motion; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    Micro-setting dominance: the compass needle, stone arch symbols, and contracting chamber walls function as the immediate environment that constrains every move. Sensory triage matches panic—air “thick,” shoulders “brush” stone—then widens to aurora glow once threat flips to wonder. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible body positions. For 9+ gate, the chamber reconfiguration directly charges the final image, but the city-scale geography remains impressionistic; hence 8.0, not 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mist, gravel breath, and charcoal dust are selective, tactile, and POV-filtered; the quarry’s jagged edges literally guide her retreat and later soften under her drawing, satisfying the 9+ constraint that environment constrains choice. Spatial choreography is flawless—boots crunch, distance to silhouette measured by heartbeat—while sensory hierarchy narrows to pallid light and frayed silk under stress. No occupational overload, yet the smith-forged lance inherits credible weight.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Weather station is evoked through cracked glass domes, ozone scent, and the atmospheric map glowing underfoot—each detail double-duties as plot device. Spatial choreography stays clean as Elara moves from corridor to map-floor. The station’s broken instruments mirror her internal disrepair without overt symbolism. Micro-setting (copper nail, map groove) directly constrains the climax, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mountain pullout and clearing are sketched with selective sensory strokes—golden light, cool breeze, overgrown structure—filtered through the fiddler’s attention. Spatial choreography stays clean; the glass flake’s shifting images tether description to action. Environment never actively constrains choice (no weather, altitude, or tool failure), so the setting decorates rather than pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ivy-choked circus train is tactile and specific—peeling paint, tattered costumes, territorial chalk remnants—each detail Filtering through Elias’s calm attention. Spatial choreography is clean: we track his body through four cars without drift. The foreign bills function as micro-setting, their colors reframing the dusk light in the final image, charging the closing reconfiguration. Environment never blocks or enables a tactical choice, so the 9+ gate is missed by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.3)
    Observatory dome, telescope hum, and star rhythms are vividly filtered through Elara’s chronicler gaze; environment steers attention and pacing. The daylily telegram functions as micro-setting, handled twice and mirrored in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across adjusting lenses and note-scribbling. Sensory selection narrows under urgency, though some phrases (“river of light,” “midnight solace”) drift toward soft abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    The swirling orchard vortex is not backdrop—it narrows her path, dictates the surrender rhythm, and ultimately houses the plant that rewrites the rules. Micro-setting triumph: the seed’s pulse against palm becomes the axis of choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis—scent of rot then crisp air mirrors internal thaw. One minor over-tell: “otherworldly glow” could be shown through Eira’s retina rather than adjective.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)
    Setting is atmospheric engine: shifting hedges narrow path choice, silver light from clipping literally guides feet. Micro-setting qualifies—hedge leaves “etched with forgotten tales” become readable surface that re-orients Elara. Cobalt hue and dusk timing filter every visual; spatial choreography (“thorns catching on her cloak”) keeps bodies tactile. Final image of glade re-balanced is inseparable from closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Catacomb orchard is not backdrop—root-etched tarot pattern physically blocks her shovel, turning geography into antagonist. Half-lit glow tracks psychic descent; light refusal mirrors her refusal to exit. Sensory triage (earth/decay/roots) stays selective and POV-filtered. The burned card functions as micro-setting that charges closure when held up like a shield, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Quarry-as-scar and trailer micro-setting constrain mood and supply the mirror-image for emotional void. Speaker cloth functions as portable setting-chunk whose texture returns in closure. Selective sensory economy (dust/diesel vs. smoke-filled venues) keeps density high. Environment is not just backdrop but metric for internal absence, passing 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Magnetic arbor is sketched with selective sensory strokes—shimmering air, humming field—that integrate into action (seed pulses in sync). The floating sanctuary never constrains a tactical choice, but the micro-setting of the study desk and pot anchors the crucial plant/vision beat. Enough specificity for 7+; lacks a final image where environment charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    Tidal atrium breathes, constraining movement and attention; bioluminescent runes act as live data Elara must read while kneeling, fusing setting with task. Bamboo creel doubles as micro-setting/tool, its worn strands grounding history in hand. Wintersun palette (pale, silvery, chill) saturates every beat, never declutches into tourist list. Spatial choreography clean; no props teleport. Sensory economy favors haptic/visual urgency befitting a librarian’s gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.1)
    Crystal-cave interior is vividly selective—“veins of quartz that pulsed faintly”—and the pedestal crown’s refracted colors charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. The caves function as micro-setting that literally guides choice: the pearl brightens only as she advances, so environment steers agency. Meeting the 9+ gate: the crown’s light mosaic is inseparable from the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    The station’s ivy-choked aperture literally frames beams of light that guide her gaze to the graffiti; the accordion’s worn leather is handled twice, its patched geography mirroring her own scar tissue. Spatial choreography is flawless: bench → wall → ivy portal, all tracked without drift. The micro-setting of the bellows interior finally constrains the climax—only when she unfolds her self-map does the external decay become sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.1)
    The glowing library is rendered through kinetic sense—electric parchment tang, shelves that pulse and shift—so space breathes with immediacy rather than backdrop tourism. Micro-setting works: the watch’s warmth and the desk’s golden pool physically anchor her choices; the mist curtain parts only when she commits to entry. Spatial choreography is flawless: distance tracked from arch to desk to exit without drift. The environment does not merely mood-board; it supplies the cipher’s propagation medium, charging the final image when the parchment itself begins to glow.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.0)
    The velvet observatory is more than wallpaper: its balcony grants the only line-of-sight to the prowling scouts, forcing the violin to be played aloud, hence the stakes. Midsummer heat and nightshade scent steep the tension, while the crystalline violin’s transparency lets starlight refract onto the agents—an environmental cue that guides Elara’s timing. The setting’s sensory hierarchy (scent → sound → light) tightens the beat sequence, earning its closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    “Skyborne grotto,” crystalline walls, and aurora provide a sensory micro-setting that charges the final image; however, spatial choreography is minimal—bodies remain kneel/stand binaries without tactile movement through space. Light and silence are re-filtered through Elara’s attention, achieving POV-biased selection. No props beyond the emerald are handled, so world density is narrow but sufficient for 700-word scope. Setting functions atmospherically rather than tactically; it mirrors mood but never blocks or enables a specific physical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.2)
    “Umbral grotto above the clouds” and “vineyard hush” are evocative yet abstract; no tactile detail of altitude—cold stone, thin air—reaches the body. Spatial tracking is clean (oak → underbrush → shell → lake), but the environment never constrains choice; altitude is ornamental. The hairpin functions as micro-setting and recurs, satisfying the 9+ gate, yet its metallic weight, temperature, or balance in the hand is never supplied, so it charges the final image only symbolically.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lighthouse, dawn, salt air, and chimes are sketched with economy; the hollow shard serves as micro-setting that ultimately charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is flawless—balcony → interior → departure tracked without drift. Weather (breeze) is causal, literally sounding the code Elias needs. No occupational detail required; the moral-consult job is metaphor, not tech manual. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Elias notices what aids his task, filters out tourist clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.9)
    Floating obsidian platform, magnetic grotto hum, starlight on water—each sensory layer is filtered through Elara’s researcher gaze and used as amplifier for thought. The grotto’s magnetic pulse is returned at the end as the silence that follows confession, turning setting into moral resonance. Spatial choreography is clean; the two stone throws track across the water and across beats. The environment is not just backdrop; it supplies the literal medium that “amplifies” her withheld truth, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    Bone towers, breathing walls, and dust that ‘settles into clarity’ are filtered through Kael’s harmonic perception; the canyon functions as both macro-setting and micro-instrument that teaches stillness. The arrowhead-as-compass turn is charged by the flock’s final pattern, satisfying the 9+ gate that setting/object must constrain choice.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Icebound spire, breath-crystals, and shifting luminous walls are vividly selective; the keystone’s impossible geometry is sketched through Eli’s fingertips, not exposition. Spatial choreography is clean—footsteps, harness anchor, mist step—each detail constrains the next move. The micro-setting (harness, keystone, mist) literally enables the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate. Only the “automation age” above the clouds is asserted, never shown, keeping the world-rule surface thin.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Harbor air, lantern glare, and water-lit sand are sketched with selective sensory economy. The sunken-library micro-setting functions as charged object: dry pages undersea pressure Elias’s vow, passing the 9+ gate. Spatial logic keeps the library dream-plausible; no impossible geography. Idiom stays restrained; “meteor hush” risks poetic abstraction but recurs enough to earn a cadence slot.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ambered observatory is sketched with spare, sensorially filtered strokes—“rusted metal,” “static bursts,” “shimmering liquid”—that double as mood mirror; the distillation apparatus becomes micro-setting constraining every turn. Spatial choreography is tight; no tourism listings. 9+ gate missed only because the apparatus never malfunctions or limits her arm-span—tool fails to charge final image.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    Observatory is sketched with selective sensory strokes—creaking dome, starlight shards, rune-lit platform—each detail filtered through Elara’s mournful attention and used to enable the ritual. The atlas page itself becomes micro-setting, its monsters given tactile weight as they lift and dissolve. Space stays coherent: railing, platform, parchment tracked without drift. While no environmental detail later constrains tactics, the final image of etched names in air is charged by the setting’s prior silence, meeting the 9+ gate for micro-setting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sapphire viaduct crystalline arches, dew intervals, brittle alloy—details are selective and filtered through Eliard’s amateur-mage perception. The setting constrains the final image: the bell must hang from the lowest arch where droplets fall, linking micro-setting to closure. No orientation drift; locale and time signalled within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.9)
    The reservoir’s mirror-surface and star-pricked ridgeway are sensuously anchored, filtering through Elias’s warden gaze—he notices damp earth, crickets, label edges. Micro-setting works: the sapphire label’s texture alters his grip and later the town’s gaze. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Environment never actively constrains choices, so the 9+ gate fails, but atmosphere braids tightly with emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory selection is biased to Elara’s seeker-eye; orchard geography stays coherent and the micro-setting (roots of ancient tree) literally delivers the crystal. Kaleidoscopic waterfall stays backdrop—never constrains choice—so gate for 9+ fails. Still, concise, POV-filtered detail keeps momentum and atmosphere alive.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The nocturnal arbor above clouds is a striking micro-setting rendered through kinetic POV filters—branches twist “like silent guardians,” clouds shift into thought-mirrors—so environment literally re-configures the seeker’s options. Spatial choreography is airy yet coherent: higher climb, buckle clink, descent through parting clouds. Sensory economy favors visual metaphor but justifies itself by the POV’s pattern-seeking gaze. The buckle, as handled object, constrains the final gesture and charges the dawn image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.9)
    Floating rock dojo is not postcard scenery; void glimpse during duel constrains stance (one mis-step = plummet) and charges final image. Micro-setting works: glass jar’s cool surface becomes tactile pivot moment. Sensory hierarchy follows Kael’s narrowed crisis perception—amber fluid, gleam, shatter sound—then void silence after. Lost 0.9 only because spatial choreography of sword duel vs. brain telekinesis stays vague; bodies drift un-tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.9)
    Moonlit brook, richest soil, storm-born silence—selective sensory triad anchors mood without checklist overload. The haven remains a bit generic (“space for innovation”)—no tactile fixtures, lock-puzzles, or scent of cedar to make the soil feel lived-in. Final chamber uses minimalist “artifacts” line, leaving the image charged but spatially blank; still, weather and water guide the key-drop choice, satisfying micro-setting rule.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tunnel is not backdrop but instrument: its walls modulate sound, amplify off-key wind, and finally warm the echoes—environment directly constrains tactics and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Eli notices handle warmth, vibration, dust motes—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: center-stage pull cord, swirling fragments, exit step. Micro-setting (handle) doubles as charged object, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.0)
    Frozen garden functions as micro-setting: cold constrains breath/pulse, mist re-shapes spatial footing, ice-encrusted foliage whispers alien syntax. Pendant serves as tactile object-anchor, warming in synchrony with heartbeat, charging final refusal image. Sensory selection obeys POV—Elara notices temperature, light refraction, cryptic plant murmurs—never tourist catalog. One spatial continuity slip: “distance” between Elara and keeper never tracked after approach, but mist reshaping silhouette sustains atmospheric coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.9)
    “Ember nexus at twilight” is atmospherically vivid and stays present through scent, glow, and trembling ground; the setting’s heat-light is used as tactile resource for the final transformation. Spatial grounding is thin—ruins, scattered ashes, and the sapling occupy an otherwise white stage—but the crozier-as-seed micro-setting charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate. Selective sensory layering (ash, frost memory, crackling air) keeps description economical. Overall, environment serves tone more than tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    The gorge-borne city is sketched in three cinematic strokes—crumbling towers, moonlit gorge, leaning shadows—then threaded through action: towers hum, shadows shift, gorge shimmers under shard-light. Micro-setting rules: the tower’s rusted frame dictates where Elara can stand and offers conductive metal for the shard’s discharge. Sensory hierarchy favors sight over other senses, but selection is POV-appropriate for a sky-high technician. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    “Spectral grotto under starlight” is atmospherically vivid and the shifting wall glyphs provide tactile interaction, letting setting guide Mara’s decoding action. Spatial anchoring drifts once inside the rift—kaleidoscope imagery is generic and ungrounded in bodily position, creating momentary white-room. The hourglass functions as micro-setting and its final charged state re-weights the closure, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.3)
    The gallery is not backdrop but reactive instrument: walls melt into color-rivers that tangle her feet, forcing a mid-weave pivot. Micro-setting (sinew thread) charges the final image—tangled mess = visible cost. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she spots “fractured light” first, tactile thread last. One hedge: “unreal space” is repeated descriptor without fresh angle on third mention, a small drag.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    Bioluminescent streets, inverted stalagmite towers, and hovering moon-shard ships are sketched with sensory economy, then filtered through Elara’s professional eye (“holographic star charts that shimmered like captured constellations”). The harbor’s anchor chain evolves from prop to talisman, constraining her final ritual and charging the closing image. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single harbor location. One nit: “edge geometry” is named but never given a tactile mechanic; it remains a label rather than an environmental constraint that shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mist, twilight, and atrium are filtered through Elara’s bodily progress; pulses and crevice-handling make the space tactile. The hearing-aid itself acts as micro-setting that constrains every routing choice; its final silence cues the exit. Sensory selection favors haptics and sound; no visual catalog. Final image of warm photograph in satchel reweights the atrium as sanctuary, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.1)
    The facility breathes with tidal lungs, silt crusting every surface; the headlamp’s dying cone narrows perception to immediate bulkheads, turning architecture into active antagonist. Micro-setting is met: the fleck’s glow and the liminal cable-threads physically constrain Elena’s final stance. One orientation wobble—vault spatial layout is skipped—but water levels are tracked cleanly. Sensory hierarchy stays tight to her claustrophobic filter.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    Frost-domed observatory, humming shard, ink galaxies—selective sensory triad that constrains possible actions (cold limits stamina, shard mediates data). Snow’s acoustic hush mirrors isolation; dome glass refracts first dawn onto shard, charging final image. Spatial track clean. Missing micro-setting gate: no tool or body part directly alters tactics; caps Q3 at 8.8, but still strong.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    The flawed diamond functions as micro-setting: its facets catch moss-glow, its inner light surges under Lira’s touch, and its shattering delivers the final image. “Towers of bone” and “luminescent moss” are filtered through Lira’s storyteller eye, never drifting into catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless—tunnel mouth → echo chamber → precipice return—every detail tethered to her goal. The canyon’s echo texture literally constrains how she must listen and sing, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Underground garden is sensuously etched—moss scent, ozone crackle, reflective pool that shows the cryptid’s face instead of hers. Micro-setting object arrowhead constrains final choice by its hum syncing heartbeat. Spatial choreography clean: arrowhead found, pocketed, pool approached, walls seal. Weather/earthquake effect is plot device but accepted as taught. Idiom consistent; no anachronism. Detail selectively woven through action rather than catalogued.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    The violin, body, and shell function as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice; the orchard’s tarnished hues return brightened in the final image. Sensory selection is urgent—cool shell against skin, soil tremor underfoot—never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible statue positions.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cobalt arcade clock frozen “at the same time for years” functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—time restarts only when the storm is released, giving the place an on-page causal role. Sensory layering (flickering neon, cool glass, encroaching dusk) is selective and POV-filtered rather than tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography across the border crevice is clean; one minor over-exoticism in “tempest trapped in amber” but it recurs with payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.3)
    Selective sensory triangulation—rusted iron taste, chime pitch, halo warmth—keeps exposition lean and stakes tactile. The circus-train micro-setting (single carriage compartment turned greenhouse) literally constrains his path and supplies the carousel needing repair, so 9+ gate is met. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Occasional soft filler (“labyrinthine corridors”) is venial at this word count.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The library’s scent-shift and shelf-bending supply real-time feedback that constrains her next stacking move, satisfying the 9+ gate. Selective sensory triage—ink → lavender, moonlight on emerald threads—mirrors her narrowing attention. Spatial choreography stays clean: spiral, fractal, Möbius strip are sequentially tracked. Could use one tactile detail of book weight or dust to ground the final fold, but the setting actively enables the hyperbolic trigger rather than decorating it.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.0)
    Archipelago functions as micro-setting: tide, pier, and salt-breeze constrain vantage points and camera placement; sunrise light is literal tool that alters pigment behavior. Selective sensory economy (damp sand, salt, pulsing gold) mirrors Elara’s narrowing attention; no postcard catalog. Final image of glowing palette on lap charges the closure, meeting 9+ gate requirement, though spatial choreography of tripod-to-palette shuffle could be one beat sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.9)
    Atmosphere is the story’s strength: damp earth, breathing shadows, star-whispers create a textured, liminal micro-world. The ribbon-bound lock of hair operates as micro-setting—handled, glowing, guiding—so passes the 9+ gate by charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean; vault interior is sketched via sensory echo rather than white-room. Occasional perfume-level phrasing (“scent of forgotten ages”) is tolerated because environment continually guides Elara’s gaze and footfalls.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    The greenhouse–shipwreck ellipse is vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara’s folklorist eye: “whispered tales,” “scent of salt and decay.” Spatial choreography is clean—kneeling, crouching, stepping outside—and the weathered glass constrains visibility, sharpening threat. The locket micro-setting serves as the tactile pivot; its rusted symbols charge the closure. One minor slip: “skeletal remains” drifts toward cliché, but the overall density and specificity earn the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.1)
    The library is not backdrop but tool: shelves groan, air smells of ‘aged paper and damp wood’, and these textures feed Elara’s tactile ritual of brewing oolong. Spatial choreography is clean—desk, shard-mirror, parchment, cup—no floating objects. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the tea-leaf-strewn parchment constrains her annotation technique and charges the final portal image. Light through cracked windows evolves with afternoon, tracking real time.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“scent of blooming flora,” “steady rhythm a lullaby”). The waterfall, parapet, and soil serve as emotional mirrors rather than tactical constraints, so while vivid, they never endanger or limit Elara’s actions—keeping the score below the 9+ gate. Spatial anchoring is clean and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prism sanctuary, stained glass starlight, and the fraying net create a tactile micro-setting that constrains gesture and focus. The net’s fibers, salt scent, and needle glint are filtered through restorer’s gaze, guiding every tactical motion. Final image of loosened threads refracts earlier color into lighter silence—setting charges closure without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rain-scoured vault is not backdrop; its scoured layers cue Elara’s tree-ring mindset and justify her micro-excavation tactics. The henge’s misalignment is spatially tracked across two time-stamped video frames, then confirmed by shovel in same coordinates—tight choreography. Fresco glow revival in final line acts as micro-setting mirror of her internal re-enlightenment, charging closure. Environment thus constrains method and final image, meeting 9+ gate, but diction occasionally drifts to tour-guide cadence (“masterpiece of endurance”) which blurs POV filter.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Damp plank, luminous ink, silt halo around the wooden box—tactile particulars arrive only when they shape Elara’s next move. The snow-globe micro-setting doubles as environmental constraint: it can be shattered, must be cradled with two hands, and its intact fragility incites the theme of release. Spatial choreography is clean across the swim-in/swim-out single scene; no impossible prop jumps. The globe’s glass charges the final image as both setting and tool, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.1)
    The mist-courtyard above clouds is anchored by line 3 and continuously filters perception—“air shimmered with distant lightning” keeps spatial limits alive. The bolt plate serves as micro-setting: its etched patterns pulse, guiding her tuning and later encoding. Weather and altitude affect action—storm mist limits visibility and times the encoding window—so environment constrains tactics and charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.1)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.0)
    The brass telescope and gondola floor function as micro-setting: their shifting states (slack cables → restored string) track plot beat and mirror her loosening grip on purely empirical reality. Cloud descriptions are selective, filtered through meteorologist’s emotional taxonomy; “dusty starlight” motif returns to charge final image. Could edge higher if environment physically constrained her leap mechanics, but atmospheric pressure is atmospherics only.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    The hollowed oak functions as micro-setting: its carved shelves and shifting patterns physically guide her fingers to the safe, so environment constrains choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—texture of bark, weight of book—never tourist catalog. Condemned-building hush returns in final line, recharging the opening image; this satisfies the 9+ gate. One whiff of plaster crack repeats without evolution, a minor missed opportunity, but the tree-as-library remains specific and causally active throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.8)
    Brass hull, amber twilight, starling murmurations, and the crystalline orbs are all sensory, selective, and filtered through Elara’s cartographer gaze. The hopscotch board as micro-setting constrains every beat—she kneels, traces, mutters—until it literally beams direction; airship ribs and engine hum remain tactiley present. Final image of murmurations forming a compass rose reweights the setting itself into a living map. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 30.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.9)
    The frozen library is anchored early with multi-sensory cues (scent of parchment, frost on windows) and the micro-setting of the ink vial and ticking clock constrain her tactile attention. Spatial choreography stays coherent; the hall’s mirror geometry is sketched lightly but enough to orient. No environmental detail charges the final image, so the 9+ gate is missed by a whisker.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.1)
    Floating rock arches, bronze butterfly bell, dawn orchard air—each is tactile, not tourism. The bell’s star-etched wings are re-handled during restoration and echo in the nebula’s “waterfall of stars,” giving the final image its glow. Spatial choreography stays crisp: no teleporting tools. Environment does not constrain tactics (arches are scenic, not obstacle), so 9-gate missed.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lighthouse, dusk light, salt air, and stone floor are filtered through Elara’s tactile ritual; the beam’s stutter directly alters her urgency. Micro-setting (porcelain shard biting skin) constrains the act. Final image of the blade-like beam recharges earlier bruised sky, meeting 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.5)
    Cliff-salt wind and mechanical-bird whir anchor early; the nut’s “offhandedly exact” lines give tactile specificity. Final bud emerging through poisoned soil reweights the setting into hopeful frailty—meets 9+ quick test. Sparse but selective; economy favors momentum over breadth.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ravine is environment-as-crucible: foam patterns narrow her options, rock footing forces crouch→insight. Micro-setting object—chrysalis—constrains grip and metaphor. Sensory hierarchy obeys chemist’s eye: river foam ≈ polymer chains. Final image recharges same twilight ravine, now reweighted. Meets 9+ gate: setting charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    Glass orchard library is perpetual micro-setting: shelves end mid-air, books hover, clouds swirl beneath feet. These concrete oddities guide tactics—Elara must climb, balance, cut. Sensory triage is POV-filtered: ink scent > visual shimmer > hush of shifting glass. No exposition dump; world rules are learned kinesthetically. Cloud-sea and crystalline branches return in the final image, recharging the closure. Could edge higher if environment physically resisted the incision or levied tactile cost.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Desert-after-rain scent, frozen coral corridors, and the pulsating shard form a tightly filtered sensory arc. Tidal-pool method is taught early and guides locating the pavilion, constraining next move. Micro-setting (coral wall etchings) physically interacted with, altering Elara’s emotional state. Final image of melting walls ties environment to internal thaw, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Anchor triad is clear by line 3; starlit cobblestones, brass weight, and oil-scented air are selective and POV-filtered. The clock tower doubles as micro-setting that constrains her climb and later frames the communal resonance. Sensory economy is strong; the only drag is one tourist-catalog line (“its intricate face gleaming”) that could compress.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    Canyon is sketched with selective lunar detail; the mirror’s jagged edge and moon-glitter serve as micro-setting that ultimately charges the final image. Weather and terrain stay consistent, but no environmental feature ever blocks or enables a specific action—description is atmospheric rather than tactical. Sensory hierarchy favors visual gloss; a single tactile moment (fingers on shard) keeps it above generic.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    Grotto is not postcard filler: serpentine walls guide turns, mist thickens breath-logic, inverted gravity re-maps spatial agency; the manuscript and crystal act as micro-setting that constraint choices and literally charge the final pedestal moment, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.1)
    Alder grove is rendered through filtered light, root-cradled hedgehog, tactile bark—selective, urgent, never catalogued. Micro-setting of the cracked sculpture becomes the crucible: every chisel stroke is filtered through grain and fracture, anchoring action. Porcelain insulator’s cool smoothness contrasts the weathered wood, recharging the tactile palette at closure. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies, tools, hedgehog, and light remain trackable across the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    Magnetic nexus is not mere backdrop; its hum and twilight palette narrow perception to breath-level immediacy, mirroring the “silence translation” method. Basalt stone acts as micro-setting: its dent constrains her thumb, its weight anchors her stance during the knight-sacrifice beat. Sensory hierarchy favors tactile & auditory over visual, reflecting a tutor attuned to texture and timing. World rule—“nexus amplifies thought”—is learned through action, not exposition, and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.1)
    Micro-setting succeeds: the diary-as-tool constrains every motion; its gleam and click charge the final image. Selective detail—“worn wooden stool,” “soft chime”—anchors without clutter. Atmospheric shadows mirror internal deepening, yet never stall choreography. Fireworks outside evolve causally from hush to crescendo, tightening temporal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    Treetop village, garden perch, and corpse-flower sprout are vividly filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias; the “wildflower hush” recurs and charges the final quiet image. Spatial choreography is stable; no object teleporting. Micro-setting (the sprout) constrains her attention and choices, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    Breath and scent shrink distance; floating arches, emerald-lit tunnel, and star-fruit each earn tactile handling. Moss-veined hull doubles as camouflage, constraining flight-path. The orchard river operates as both highway and metronome—its surface “deliberate ripples” direct final approach, thereby charging closure. Micro-setting (arrow) also guides choices, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    Container labyrinth is tactile and constrains movement; salt-metal scent, jagged skyline, and flashlight streaks anchor POV bias; spatial choreography is clean as Elara kneels inside the wreck—final image of moonlit shadows reweights the maze as monument to foresight’s limits.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ice cavern is more than postcard: shifting aurora colors actively supply the magic conduit; fractured ice floor crunches underfoot, constraining movement. Prism-song bells and amber sheet act as micro-setting objects that must be handled exactly; their tactile handling is on-page. Final image reweights the cavern itself—“walls softening”—so environment charges closure. Selective, sense-driven detail never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The canyon hush is atmospherically vivid, its “avalanchingly quiet” density teaching the accumulative pattern early; driftwood and alcove scale are micro-settings that constrain path. Thunder rumbles exteriorize pressure without ever breaking the POV-filtered silence, a nice sensory inversion. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Environment enters the final image as charged price—the colored sky replaces the canyon—so the 9+ gate is met.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.9)
    Workshop is sketched with selective sensory economy—ink smell, metal type trays, open ceiling—each detail filtered through Elias’s tactile craft. The halo fragment functions as micro-setting: its glow and pulse constrain distance, force retreat, then acceptance. Stars fading supplies a living clock that dovetails with internal dimming at closure. Spatial choreography stays coherent; bodies/props never teleport. Environment never over-described; every noun earns its keep by mirroring or pressuring the empathy experiment.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    The ridgeway’s aurora is not backdrop but instrument: its light catches the pendant’s wings, guides her feet, and finally frames the scholar’s cottage, so environment directly charges the last image. Micro-setting succeeds; the body-as-setting (heartbeat syncing with relic) tightens the final beat. Specificity is selective, never touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Quartz arbor’s diffuse glow and muting mist are not backdrop but tools that amplify her ritual; the prism’s facets act as micro-setting that charges the final image. Frost on a car window is recalled as an emotional Rosetta stone—an elegant, POV-specific filter. Spatial choreography is immaculate: hands hover, prism turns, rainbows pool at her feet. The arbor’s hush literally thickens, forcing her attention inward—setting-as-constraint that satisfies the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.1)
    Bamboo-filtered light, singing trees, and backward streams create a consistent lyric world; the amber bead serves as micro-setting that charges the final bridge image. Spatial track stays clean across the orchard trek. Environment never actively constrains choice, capping at 8.1.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating rock arches and fruit-metal air are vivid and specific; they create an off-world texture without catalogue overload. Spatial choreography stays clean across the descent, and the forge smells anchor POV bias. None of these details actively constrain Eli’s choices or charge the final image, so the 9+ gate is missed.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Repair-bay rust/grease and the forest’s “symphony of whispers” are sharply filtered through Elara’s sensory-map-maker gaze. The green shard’s pulse acts as micro-setting that guides choice and charges the final orb image. Spatial track stays clean across the two-shard structure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    The lantern room, cliff, and sea glass are filtered through Elias’s mariner gaze; sensory hierarchy favors touch and sight—oil crates, wick scent, stone stack under bare fingers. Spatial choreography is flawless; stones are re-stacked, compartment clicked, glass pocketed—each object state tracked. Environment directly shapes tactics: darkness forces tactile code-reading, stone order unlocks wall. The lighthouse as micro-setting constrains the final image—beam cutting dawn—so 9+ gate is met.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lantern room, wick, and sea-fog work as micro-settings that constrain every move; star-canvas and green beam evolve with the beat, feeding the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean as the Herald leans, grips, steers.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.0)
    Floating tea house, plateau, cloud-kissed beams, jasmine air—selective sensory triangulation grounds each beat. The blue morpho wing functions as micro-setting: its shifting colors cast literal light that halts the room, constraining attention and enabling Kael’s approach. Props (tea cup, window) are handled, not listed; spatial choreography is clean. Final image reuses the wing’s muted iridescence to mirror the woman’s acceptance, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    Storm-lit tower, cracked window, moonlit brass shards—each sensory pick is filtered through Elias’s custodial eye and guides tactile action; the mending sextant literally reconfigures the maze’s atmosphere, satisfying the micro-setting gate for 9-band candidacy even at compressed length.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.5)
    Alchemical greenhouse, mica portal, and glowing fruit create tactile specificity; micro-setting (mica shard) constrains every crossing. Endless night vs. captured-dawn fruit provides stark visual polarity. Spatial tracking clean—no impossible moves. Setting feeds texture more than tactical choice, capping at 8.8 per 9+ gate; still, sensory hierarchy stays tight to POV wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.7)
    Neon city outside, dust-heavy shelves inside, and the blank book as micro-setting are sketched with economy; sensory hierarchy reflects Elara’s quiet attention. The library constrains pace and access, but no environmental detail actively shapes the final tactic—she simply receives the blank book. Still, the atmosphere coheres and mirrors her inner shift.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Palace courtyard breathes through touch and smell—damp earth, crumbling statues—each detail filtered by Elara’s gardener eye. Micro-setting (plaque, tea-house table, ivy patch) constrains every dig and plant; the stone’s inscription directly guides her final lavender placement. Spatial choreography is clean: bread → table → crumbs brushed off → trowel work → lantern light. Weather and season (“sun dipped,” “birds flown south”) affect mood and tempo. Final image (golden glow on bread) recharges earlier sensory motifs, qualifying for 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Crystalline shelves, quartz hush, and frost-bitten air are woven through action (breath mist, refracted prisms) and directly shape the lantern’s fragility; the cold justifies gloves, pace, and reverence. Micro-setting—the velvet casing and the measuring device—constrains every touch. Final image of lantern-light bridging abyss is charged by the frozen void it crosses. No orientation drift; anchor clear at line 6.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rotting-pier market is sketched with salt-and-decay odor, hushed acoustics, and proximate bodies; spatial choreography stays clean as Lila threads booths and confronts the necklace man. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but the watch fob itself functions as micro-setting: its engraved design is finger-traced, matched, and finally clenched, charging the dawn-image. Weather or tide never intrude, yet the pier’s physical jeopardy (planks, darkness) is implied rather than leveraged for choice—hence no 9-level constraint. Still, the environment supplies both texture and the heirloom prop that anchors closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.

    Lavender scent, aurora ribbons, and ring etchings are vividly filtered through Elara’s attention. Environment subtly guides her steps toward the clearing, satisfying micro-setting. Final image of converging aurora recharges the opening vista. However, the forest’s sentience is only declared, never demonstrated through tactile interaction, capping immersion at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.7)
    Crystal cave is more than backdrop: prismatic shadows dance in sync with her brush-strokes, turning geology into silent chorus that mirrors inner shift. Micro-setting success—the lock’s jagged edges pressed into palm—grounds abstraction in tactile risk. Spatial choreography stays clean; lantern and crystals track consistently across the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Glass-domed, toxic-skied Verdania is sketched with selective strokes—artificial light, recycled air—that mirror theme of artifice vs. truth. Undercity’s decay scent and damp walls narrow perception during crisis, guiding Elara’s urgency. Zinc plate’s faint hum and gilded leaves act as micro-setting tools that constrain action and charge closure. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Environment, body, and tool jointly shape the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.9)
    Whispering Bluff above clouds is atmospherically vivid—thin air, stone table hewn from native rock, glistening ice—but spatial choreography is vague; we never know where bells hang relative to precipice. The iceberg fragment as micro-setting charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate, yet environment never constrains a visible tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    Glass dome, pulsing wood, and roses are sketched with quick sensory hits; the dome’s magnetic shimmer is used to cue action, but no environmental detail actually constrains or charges the final image. Micro-setting (her glowing hands) is more active than the farm itself. Still, the dome stays coherent and atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dawn courtyard anchors quickly and keeps returning to jasmine scent and cobblestones, grounding every beat. The mailbox is micro-setting as charged object, its lock literally constraining the final move. Spatial choreography stays crisp: bench → mailbox → shadowed doorway → wall. Light and scent evolve with the emotional cadence, adding texture without checklist overload.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sunken laboratory constrains every move—water drip metronome, moss-covered walls guiding fingertips to dice, pedestal height forcing bodily dance. Hangman’s dice evolve from talisman to kinetic partner, their worn edges fitting finger pads mid-gesture; this micro-setting charges the final awakening. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: smell of decay narrows to touch of dice, then widens to shifting walls. Spatial choreography tracked cleanly across chamber shift.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    The salt-crystal walls aren’t mere wallpaper—they amplify the gravity pockets that make memory-visible, directly enabling the climax. Tactile specificity (lamp-wick, crunch of salt under shoes) is filtered through a lantern-lighter’s occupational gaze, lending micro-setting authority. Spatial choreography stays crisp in a single-room scene. Final image of crystals “returned to their silent watch” crystallizes the Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.0)
    The brook, mossy stone, and vibrating paper wing supply micro-setting that constrains her breathing rhythm and thus the ritual; moonlit water becomes a metronome she must match. Sensory economy is high—one scent, one sound, one glint—integrated into action rather than catalogue. The haven’s quiet is not just backdrop but the raw material she weaponizes.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rooftop garden, iron railing, meteor shower, and antique seal are vivid, selective, and filtered through Clara’s horticultural eye. Details compress to sound + scent + kinesthetic (“hand tightening around the seal”) that guide her shift in attention. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. The setting constrains the final choice—she must literally cross the threshold of her neighbor’s door—meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.9)
    Garden, orchid, shell, and twilight star are filtered through Elara’s attention and return in the final image; the dimming orchid literalizes the reconfiguration. Spatial grounding is maintained with tactile detail (moss, petals, hum), and the environment’s fading light quietly forces the moment toward dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.1)
    Marble sanctuary, aurora light, and stalactite metronome are sensory-filtered through Elara’s bias toward texture and drip-rhythm. The rose thorn functions as micro-setting that literally constrains the final action. Spatial choreography is minimalist but stable; no impossible moves. Economy is good—three anchors reused (marble, thorn, drip). The environment does not actively block or supply resources beyond atmosphere, so it stays just below the 8-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    “Serpentine nexus under starlight” is a macro-setting; its topology never constrains movement or resource. Micro-setting rescue arrives via the seashell: its warming guides her stop and kneel, altering tactics. Sensory economy favors sound and touch—echoed song, “pulse of the cosmos”—but visual domain dominates. The final image reuses the ambient hum, recharging the nexus as emotional backdrop; meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.7)
    Arctic night, ice shrine, melted globe—vivid, selective, POV-filtered. Shrine constrains the ritual; globe micro-setting charges final image. Sensory balance narrows to candle flicker and cracked glass under pressure. Early anchors skim, but spatial choreography holds.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is micro-scaled to parapet, night air, and jasmine scent; rain-washed stone and firefly light are filtered through Elara’s net-mender eye for “threads.” Bamboo whisk acts as portable setting-chunk: its cool smoothness grounds reflection and returns in the final image. Spatial choreography is stable—no impossible moves. Environment does not actively constrain a choice, so 9+ gate not met, but sensory selection is character-specific and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Micro-setting triumph: the orchard’s bubble of motionless air becomes a tactile constraint—no wind, no dust, just humming bark. The flawed diamond is handled in three beats, its crack widening under pressure, charging the final image. Ash-soil boots and radioactive horizon ground the macro-wasteland without exposition dump. Spatial choreography is flawless; the diamond’s position tracks from pocket → stone → earth.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Observatory is vivid—cobalt portico shimmer, antenna jury-rig, storm-lit peak—details filter through Elias’s tuner-vision. Weather and altitude remain present, narrowing to his hand on cool glass at climax. Mountain geography is stable; no spatial contradictions. Environment constrains final image: the portico’s etched symbols and parted clouds refract the new dawn, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.9)
    The loft’s cracked beams and sand-filtered light are filtered through Elias’s prizing attention; the music box serves as micro-setting that finally constrains choice when it refuses capture. Sensory selection favors sound over visual catalog, mirroring his vocation. The dunes outside evolve from burial site to launch horizon, charging the final image with forward motion.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drift-ice marina is not postcard; the cracking ice becomes the antagonist’s instrument and later the gauge of her victory. The key’s warming surface and the lantern’s hidden compartment are micro-settings that constrain her options. Final image of moonlit ice recharges the opening sunset, re-weighting the same landscape from promise to perpetual burden.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct form a tight micro-setting triad that constrains movement (ice dictates pace, viaduct’s iron pull becomes tactile anchor). Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—“air crackled with restrained wildness” frames Elara’s alert cartographer bias. Spatial choreography stays clean: steps across ice, fingers on glistening beams, final stance above the lake. Iron beams’ residual moisture and moonlit reflections recur to re-weight the final image—viaduct as literal bridge and metaphorical connector—satisfying the 9+ gate. One minor lapse: “basalt sanctuary” is never exploited geologically; the rock type could have sharpened footing or tool use but remains scenic.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lantern recurs twice with escalating charge (light flickers at discovery, brightens at exit), satisfying the 9+ gate for an object that constrains final image. Tunnel geography is tracked cleanly—footfalls, fissure, false wall, chamber—and the drought aftermath is evoked through rust scent and damp earth without checklist excess. Spatial choreography survives the single-scene constraint; no impossible object jumps.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Shop air (oil/wood), half-repaired music boxes, brass gears—details filter through Elias’s pastoral eye, each item a parable of restoration. Spatial choreography clean: counter → workshop → shelves → exit. Environment constrains choice: the boxes literalize “second opinion,” forcing Elias to confront abandonment. Final image of ticking heart in vibrant hush reuses shop’s sensory palette, now charged.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    The social-network archive is more than wallpaper: its forgotten corners, metadata, and security lockouts directly constrain her moves and supply the Limbo folder. Sensory selection skews visual-digital—timestamps, IDs, headset HUD—mirroring her technician gaze. The frayed patch provides tactile counter-texture and re-appears in the exit image, passing the 9+ gate for object-as-setting. Could have used one auditory or thermal detail to widen the bandwidth, hence shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.3)
    “Lighthouse orchard” and “ice floes” are compressed into one glance yet recur to constrain the final beacon-image. Salt-apple scent, creaking boards, and opaque mirror glass give tactile triangulation. Setting is the chargable object that powers the climax; meets 9+ micro-setting gate.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.0)
    Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but pressure engine: creaking piers force slow tread, shards mirror broken teeth, aurora final image. Parasol lace graduates from heirloom prop to color-catcher, constraining her choice to stay exposed. Cold narrows perception to breath, crunch, thermos steam—every detail filtered through Elara’s grief taxonomy. Spatial choreography clean: dock-shelter-dock loop tracked without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.5)
    Amber pavilion, autumn vineyard rows, and the burned-edge letter supply selective sensory texture. Light and leaf-rustle mirror internal state without over symbolism; the pavilion’s glow subtly nudges her toward reflection. Spatial choreography stays stable as she moves from bench to edge and back. Environment does not constrain tactical choice, so the 9+ gate isn’t met, but the micro-setting (letter fragment) reappears in the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.1)
    Silken pavilion, breathing stones, and sand underfoot are viscerally layered; the kinetic parapet reappears with charged glow, satisfying the 9+ gate by constraining the final ritual beat. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s walker priorities—she notices pulse, grain, whisper cadence. World-rule (“conjured clearings”) is learned through action, not exposition. Minor over-branding: “whisperfield calm” is repeated thrice, risking incantatory stall, but cadence supports tone.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.3)
    The lavender–factory dyad is sensuously specific: scent of lavender vs. rusted iron, golden dusk vs. black-and-white photos, vines “cradling” frames. These details are filtered through Elara’s archivist eye—she notices patina, arcs, contrasts—and the setting quietly guides her ritual: the blooms supply both balm and working surface. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating anchors. Because the environment’s embrace literally charges the final image, the 9+ gate is met.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    The library’s dust, tall windows, and suspended hush are filtered through Elias’s lonely attunement; the micro-setting doubles as the crystal cupped in his palms, a “tool” that literally constrains every action. Sensory economy is strong—sound (echoes), touch (worn oak), sight (first light) braid into mood without checklist drift. Spatial choreography is invisible (no body movement beyond standing), but acceptable for single-POV stillness. Final image recharges the hush: the whisper of hope exits the same acoustic space it entered, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    The fog sculpture garden is not backdrop but perceptual filter: visibility shrinks, metal softens, memory leaks. Each sculpture is re-seen through Elias’s sieve-mind, turning rusty archway into childhood doorway—a micro-setting that constrains his next angle of approach. The pond’s stillness is the final mirror that returns the hum; environment literally provides the resonating surface. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible body shifts. Meets 9+ gate: the garden’s silence is the resonating chamber that produces the closing sound.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    The lunar observatory is more than postcard: altitude thinness affects Elara’s steadiness during the quake, and the eastern-wall clock’s placement orients her nightly workbench. Micro-setting works—the clock housing itself becomes the terrain she disassembles, screw by screw. Tool-as-setting qualifies: her precision screwdrivers and lens cloths are handled in tactile beats that constrain pace. Final image reweights the place: dawn light on a humming, no-longer-silent observatory charges the earlier “changeless” premise.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    “Radiant haven above the clouds” is sketched with lavender-eucalyptus scent and soft glow, but remains a postcard backdrop; it neither obstructs nor enables any choice. Micro-setting objects—vinyl fragment, harp, photograph—do receive tactile attention and the vinyl refracts light at the final image, giving a modest charge. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. World rules are consistent but thin; no constraint shapes tactics, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    Floating-isle tether strain and the workshop’s half-built automaton anchor spatial choices; the key’s brass grooves and copper plate etch act as micro-setting that constrains every runic stroke. Atmospheric density is selective, never stalls motion.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Selective sensory economy: jasmine, gravel crunch, mirror-dark water. The tooth-as-micro-setting constrains two beats (satchel weight, fountain glow) and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate; spatial choreography is clean. Hedge maze geography stays vague, but that serves the disorientation pattern rather than harms clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.1)
    Serpentine walls and luminous moss are never tourist scenery; they channel moonlight onto the glass, literally supplying the final beam that reconfigures the stake. Mist functions as both cocoon and amplifier, constraining visibility so the glass’s first glow becomes the only available light source, charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    The abandoned server racks and mineral veils are filtered through Elara’s pattern-seeking gaze; environment literally supplies the parchment on which she drafts new meaning. Micro-setting—the amber pendant—constrains her stance at the entrance beat and charges the final image when its glow merges with sunset. Spatial choreography is clean: Kai keeps respectful distance, notebook offered not thrust. Sensory economy favors touch and filtered light over panoramic catalog, keeping momentum alive.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mist, shell, and tree are economically re-used; the shell’s glow literally cuts the fog and guides her steps, satisfying micro-setting constraint. Sensory triage narrows to touch and hearing under rising pressure. Spatial track is clean—no impossible moves. The tree’s glowing shells charge the final image, earning the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.7)
    Verdant arbor is sketched with selective sensory strokes—dew like stars, vine light spreading like liquid gold—each image charging the final glowing orbs. Micro-setting (workbench, tendril) constrains action: her fingers must trace it to unlock songs. Spatial choreography holds; no floating bodies. One forced seasonal cliché (“first light of dawn breaking”) keeps it from 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    The withered orchard crater is tactile from the first sentence—frost, twisted twigs, shattered glass—each object later handled, not merely observed. Spatial choreography is flawless: items are picked, arrayed, sealed, and re-lit, all tracked without drift. Micro-setting (illustration plate as work-surface) constrains every gesture and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Weather stays subarctic, breath-visible, anchoring temporal continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marble walls, silver veins and reflected dusk angles are returned to in every beat, guiding hand-placement and emotional register; the cavern itself becomes the tool that constrains the repair. Sensory hierarchy is locksmith-centric: gleam, click, hum dominate; temperature and smell are rationed. Space stays coherent in single-scene crouch; no geography drift. At closure the living marble “breathes,” charging the final image—meets 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.1)
    Bronze grotto operates as micro-setting: walls gleam, star-slits pulse with breath, lamp warmth counters the metallic chill—details constrain her choice to stay seated and re-weave. The kerosene burner evolves from prop to talisman, its flame sharpening at the exact moment she pivots inward, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies never ghost.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rain-beaded skylight and ash blank are handled tactilely; the loft’s drip rhythm and steam light actively narrow Elara’s attention, constraining her timing (“while the kettle boils”). Micro-setting succeeds, but wider geography (city, season) is absent—acceptable at this length. No environment details distort closure, so no cap applied.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    The kinetic lagoon above clouds is never generic; its water-currents “danced to rhythms no one could hear” and the soft mud at the edge literally guides Mara’s boot placement. The camera wheel’s cracked lens gleam is reused as a compass-hum, satisfying micro-setting use. Spatial choreography is pristine; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dust-filtered dawn light, broken-window geometry, and brass gleam are selective and POV-filtered. Spaceport remains a postcard until Eli manipulates vents/mirrors; then the terminal becomes tactile—those micro-settings constrain how he can “resurrect” the space. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Environment does not charge the final image (no broken mirror shard or vent left as relic), so misses 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sanctuary’s glacial hush and dew-charged crystals are not backdrop but tactical: the silence presses inward, the whispering stones externalize buried longing, and the blank clockface literally constrains her next action. Sensory economy is disciplined—petrichor nostalgia is the only smell, yet it reappears to trigger memory and is reweighted when the scent of rain fills the air at closure. Spatial choreography is clean: fountain edge to blank clock to forecourt return tracks without drift. The environment passes the 9+ gate by charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    Damp-earth air, star-mirror water, moss-erased barge names—environmental details are selective, sensory, and filtered through Elara’s legend-seeker gaze. The canal evolves from decay to “alive with possibility,” mirroring internal shift without emblematic overstatement. Micro-setting (the rotting barge hull) literally constrains her salvaging motion and supplies the chest; the sundial operates as charged tool-as-setting. No physics or idiom errors; spatial choreography is clean. Meets the 9-band gate by charging the final image, but lacks the razor-edge constraint that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Garden is not backdrop but active filter: falling light narrows visual field, crunching leaves mark the traveler's intrusion, bench placement dictates the forced physical intimacy that pressures confession. Autumn air and woodsmoke scent are returned to in the final line, recharging the "lonesome splendor" motif. Spatial choreography is flawless—distance between bench and trees stays constant, thread hand-off is tactile. Micro-setting (the two carpet threads) functions as portable geography that constrains the closing gesture; meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.7)
    The suspended palace, blue-lit cavern, and fungal glow are vividly sketched and filtered through Kael’s worn senses. Selective detail—“crystalline spires glinting faintly,” “scent of damp stone”—anchors mood without catalogue. The machine fragments remain undescribed; their materiality never constrains assembly or final image, so the payoff is under-charged. Still, environment and tool together create a consistent, atmospheric pressure that supports the thematic contrast of organic vs. mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.3)
    Black sand, obsidian lagoon, kelp-drift, and migrating clouds are filtered through Elara’s professional gaze; the sand’s sterility directly thwarts her goal, so environment constrains tactics. Sensory hierarchy adheres to her firefighter habit—texture over color, weight over sound—anchoring without catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    The city of forgotten fountains functions as micro-setting that literally constrains final action: only when the last shard is inserted at the largest fountain does water return. Sensory selection is POV-driven—Elara notices cracked basins, moss, frozen clock hands—rather than tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography is immaculate across the breadcrumb trail. One minor gap: we never get tactile lived-in detail of how she navigates the ruins (boots on cobblestones, breath in cold air), keeping it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    Nebula garden is evoked with selective, synaesthetic sensory layering; the bioluminescent petals and liquid-silver spill constrain Elara’s tactile route and supply the final image. Micro-setting (the gear’s teeth, the haptic bloom-glow) functions as geography, guiding her hand and charging the last beat. Spatial choreography stays clean in a single continuous scene; no floating-room syndrome or white-room gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.1)
    Greenhouse glass, fern scent, and butterfly wing-thrum are filtered through a stone-carver’s attention to texture and fracture; environment guides her tactile choices. Micro-setting rule met: the woven ribbon becomes a handheld “site” whose frayed threads mirror marble veins, constraining the final design. Spatial choreography clean—bench, chisel, stone, door tracked without drift. Dusk light shift is used to mark the cadence turn rather than decorative palette. Lacks 9+ only because no environmental detail physically impedes or wounds her; pressure is atmospheric, not instrumental.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.1)
    Tidal obsidian ridge and brass constellated bob return as charged micro-setting: ridge moon-glimmer echoes in the final “searing reverie,” bob’s paused swing becomes the literal and metaphorical pivot. Selective sensory detail (whispering sea, echoing footfalls, brass etched star-maps) filters through Elias’s precision-biased attention. Spatial choreography inside tower is cleanly tracked; weather/environment affect mood more than action but matches the lyrical mode. Tool-as-setting (rake handle) constrains choice when Elias carves, repaying early setup. Could reach 8.5+ if environment forced a tactical constraint mid-scene rather than serving primarily atmospheric mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.9)
    Velveteen gloom, damp-earth scent, and the cobalt silo’s grain-dust ghostliness are selectively vivid. The silo-as-sanctuary never constrains action or charges the final image, so the 9+ gate is missed, but atmosphere is tonally coherent and POV-filtered throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.9)
    Obsidian spire, frozen lake, and kingfisher-blue ribbon form a tight micro-setting palette that reappears in the final image, charging the closure. Sensory range is narrow (mostly visual cold/light) but selective, matching the POV’s cartographic gaze. The lake thaws in the written vision, so environment directly constrains and then releases possibility, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    “Ember alcove in mist” functions as micro-setting: the glowing radio dial literally charges the final image and constrains transcription tempo. Sensory hierarchy obeys Clara’s copyist eye—parchment, ink, dial light—integrated into action. Spatial choreography is clean; no drift in prop states. Weather (mist) mirrors internal veil but stops short of altering choice.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.9)
    Gallery is sketched via selective detail—dim sconces, marble echo, rocking-chair creak—filtered through Elara’s vigil. The mask’s jagged edges and the ash’s drift constrain her final gesture, passing the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains stable; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sewer stench, damp stone, grating light, and silted streets are filtered through Kael’s salvage priorities—smell and touch dominate vision. The chronometer cog operates as micro-setting: its weight and temperature guide hand movements and pacing. Spatial choreography stays clean across single transition (sewer → ruins). Final ruin gloom externalizes his reclaimed uncertainty, qualifying for 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    Velvet library, stained-glass autumn light, rosette glint are selective, sensory, and filter through Elara’s musical attention. Space actively guides ritual: central table becomes altar, acoustics reshape atmosphere. Micro-setting (rosette) constrains tactic—she circles the hum around it. Spatial choreography tight; no floating props or anchor drift.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rusted greenhouse is not backdrop; its twisted frame and scent of rain constrain Elara’s pacing, supply pruning tools, and absorb starlight that literally feeds the plant. Micro-setting (terra-cotta pot, cracked soil) doubles as crucible for her fingers and memories. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel → plant → sit → prune → stand → pluck. Final image of “glowing orbs” reuses the setting’s metallic gleam, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.1)
    “Nectar dusk” and “lacquer box” give tactile specificity; the tower’s dormant hum is a nice micro-pressure. Spatial choreography is flawless: stool → pile → hidden panel → spiral → pedestal, each step tracks. Sensory hierarchy narrows to cold, glow, hum under crisis, matching Elara’s narrowed attention. The orb as micro-setting charges the final image—its blue pulse is the literal new light dawning—meeting the 9+ gate; only brevity keeps it just shy of 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bay’s dawn light and scattered detritus are filtered through Elias’s selective attention, supplying tactile anchors (rusted key, broken shell) that double as micro-setting. Spatial choreography is clean; objects are picked up, arranged, and re-seen without drift. While the environment does not actively constrain choice, the final image of “houses whispering” is charged by the orris-root glow, meeting the 9+ gate for setting-to-image linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    The garden functions as both macro-setting and micro-tool: crumbling fountains and thin-glass ampoule alike constrain action. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Liora perceives thought, not touch; Elara notices fragility under flashlight glare. Spatial choreography is clean; distance from statue to exit tracks. Final image—empty ampoule buried in silt—recharges the motif of fragility and stillness, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Infinite staircase functions as micro-setting: its refusal to let Elara descend after the die-loss directly constrains her next move, re-pricing perpetual motion. Sensory triage is POV-filtered—fading chalk, scuffed stone, distant thunder—never touristy. Spatial choreography is clean: die tumbles down, walls pulse, geometry shifts in real time. Final image charges earlier motif: “the walls whispered her name” fuses setting with earned acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rooftop greenhouse functions as micro-setting: humidity-fogged glass, stool, indigo ink pot—each object is handled and constrains posture/tool choice. Smog/jasmine toggle is sensory and mirrors internal shift. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. The moon is used, not just viewed, charging final canvas glow. Could use one more tactile interaction (floorboards, vent) to hit 9.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Damp air, moss arches, bioluminescent fungi, and perpetual roar are woven into every beat; the waterfall mist even clings like “a second layer of dread,” charging Elara’s skin. Spatial choreography is clean—workshop to square to altar—no floating bodies. The emerald lens’s micro-setting functions as both tool and mirror; its cracked surface refracts lantern light onto the bread, directly shaping the moment of communal thaw. Environment, body, and artifact all constrain choice and energize closure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    Salt-decay scent, rusted gears, and counter-clockwise motion create a tactile micro-setting that charges the final image; the lighthouse becomes a reversed clock, embodying the concept. Spatial choreography is clean—Elias kneels, traces, stands—though the island’s external geography is skimmed. Environment constrains choice: only at low tide can the stone be reached, tying time to terrain.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    The funhouse supplies spatial pressure—warped mirrors, spinning-clock room—that physically distorts Clara’s perceptions and forces stances; environment is handled, not just toured. Sensory detail is selective (creaking floors, glinting clasp, dust motes in stray light) and filtered through Clara’s dread. Micro-setting qualifies: the opera-clasp prop is tactile, re-handled, and its final dormancy visually signals cost. Atmosphere supports theme without overwriting; no logistics contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating orchard is tactile—gnarled branches creak like cellos, driftwood gives under bare feet—and the micro-setting (driftwood xylophone) literally constrains the final gesture. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a tide prophet notices salt-hum, wind direction, resonant wood. Spatial choreography is immaculate across the swaying deck.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Macro-setting (turtle-backed city) is filtered through Elara’s cartographer eye: cracked shell cobbles, sun angles that cast pattern-shadows. Micro-settings—tunnel spirals, golden chamber—constrain movement and force her reed-whistle key. The living shell at climax is an object-as-setting that reconfigures stakes. Sensory economy is tight; dread tone is carried by light descriptors (“sunwashed dread”) rather than adjective stacks. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible body or prop positions.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.1)
    Ivy-choked station is vividly sketched with selective sensory detail; the cracked mirror and damp air constrain movement and echo theme. Spatial choreography is coherent across the basement descent. However, no environmental detail actively alters tactics or charges the final image; the setting remains backdrop rather than crucible. The rosebush reprise is ornamental, not choice-forcing.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.1)
    Submerged pavilion is tactile—silt sucking at arches, hand-carvings reaching upward—and the inkwell functions as micro-setting that constrains the only on-page ritual. Sensory hierarchy follows Elias’s surveyor gaze: he notes stone fit before brine scent, a believable professional filter. Spatial choreography is clean across the wade, bend, mortar seal, and return trek; no impossible positions. The star-mosaic’s glow is the single overt symbol, but it is prepared by the earlier “grasping” carvings, so the final image charges rather than decorates.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Micro-setting is the stamp and algae-lit shelves; both constrain movement and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—indexer’s fingers on spines, ink smell submerged under water-rot. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we track her single lantern circle. Environment evolves: blackout deepens, walls pivot. One slight over-telling—“reclaimed stillness” repeated three times—prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Floating island tea garden is sketched with scent and motion (“mist clung…like a lover’s whisper”) and seeds the paradoxical descent/ascent rule early. Dreamstone and glass basilica are tactiley handled. Micro-setting of the origami crane on the altar serves as the charged final object. Environment does not physically constrain tactics, so caps at 7.8; still, enough specificity to feel lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Observatory and crystal interiors supply vivid, selective sensory detail; the ash scent anchors the opening beat and the geode’s “trapped light” returns to charge the ending. Spatial grounding is secure; electromagnetic suspension rule is learned through action. Environment does not constrain a visible tactical choice, so 9+ gate fails. Overall, atmosphere is the story’s strongest suit.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Observatory delivers tactile specificity: cracked stained-glass, dust-and-parchment air, spiral staircase that presses history downward. Star charts and astrolabes are noticed through Kael’s pilot-eye bias. Setting constrains movement (narrow alcove, corroded vault) and supplies the pedestal props. “Brilliant dimness” is repeated without evolving; still, the stones feel lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cobalt tiles, salt-rot hush, and splintered clock-driftwood are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elias’s guilt; the terrace’s mirror-fracture and the shore’s carved wood literally guide his attention and final gesture, satisfying the 9+ constraint that setting constrain choice, though spatial anchors (distance, tide line) could be tracked more cleanly across the descent.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.9)
    Parapet, mist, storm, lantern, and brass pull create a tight micro-setting that constrains movement and staging; the wind literally forces them to lean in, shaping dialogue rhythm. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over vista, matching negotiation focus. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no impossible positions. Environment does not charge the final image as strongly as the object does, keeping it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sensory selection is POV-driven: salt air and “worn surface” of brass echo her erosion; utility poles’ “predictable spacing” becomes a tactile lifeline. Micro-setting (kayak hull “scarred”) doubles as character mirror. Environment guides choice—poles let her triangulate when stars fail—fulfilling the 9+ gate. Only the horizon’s “promise” flirts with cliché, preventing the final 0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lake functions as micro-setting: its glow enables the dive and later colors the empathic re-framing; environment literally lights the final image. Sensory triage is POV-true—Elias notices cold skin, warm water, blue-green flares—never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography tracks single body, single object; no impossible positions. Bioluminescence rules stay consistent—fish swirl, ball glows, walls show carvings—no late resets. “Delicately robust” is shown via ecosystem surviving in darkness, not declared.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.9)
    Orchard steeped in synesthetic moonlight provides evocative visual-aural layers (“fruit shimmered like captured stars”). However, scent—the only sense tied to agency—functions as ambient perfume rather than specific obstacle or resource; we never learn how saffron/cardamom alter breath, visibility, or predator tracking. Spatial choreography is dream-logic; no object or terrain feature constrains her conjuring stance. Final image of glowing hands reuses light motif but environment itself does not reweight stakes; thus falls short of 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    “Midnight glade above clouds” is atmospherically vivid—crystalline leaves, moon-filtered light—yet functions mostly as postcard beauty rather than tactical constraint. Micro-setting substitute: the cracked saucer works better, guiding her hand and final stance. Sensory breadth (visual, haptic) is balanced, but no environmental obstacle alters her tactics; setting never pushes back. Early anchor arrives just past the 120-word margin, triggering a −0.3 carry-over from Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.0)
    Ship interior is sketched with salvage-metal texture and engine hum; the new world gets golden light and living soil, enough to distinguish moods. Micro-setting works: the tear-as-object functions as steering key, so it earns the 9+ gate for Q3. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Sensory palette is safe—visual dominant, faint hum—never constrains a tactical choice, so it stays solid rather than vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Black sand, sulfur air, and tide-pool crabs are filtered through Elara’s barefoot attention; each sensory pick serves mood rather than catalog. The cove archway is introduced late yet immediately constrains the final image, qualifying as micro-setting that charges closure. Spatial choreography remains clean across the single continuous walk. Volcano and celestial alignment stay backdrop-only, but the beach itself becomes the crucible; no caps triggered, and the 9-gate (environment charging closure) is met.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    The fort is sketched with selective sensory hits—“dying torches,” “faint shimmer of stars”—that serve Elara’s narrowed vigilance. The sundial functions as micro-setting: its unnatural angles guide her fingers and hide the compartment, so environment directly shapes choice. Spatial choreography stays clean through the Thorne confrontation. Luminous twilight never presses tactically after the opening, preventing higher-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    “Tidal bluff” is handled as tool and hazard: Kael crouches, balances, scatters dust onto exact ledges; geography limits pace and placement. Aurora is not backdrop but spectral metronome—color shifts cue each escalation, climaxing in the kaleidoscope that re-patterns the rocks. Eels surface only where reflux and reflection allow, making waterline proximity a live constraint. Because environment dictates method and final image, the 9-band gate is met.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stormlit observatory is more than postcard: glass dome refracts lightning onto the protagonist’s shadow, turning architecture into mirror of internal exposure. Darkroom timer and timetable shrink space to tactile objects that constrain pacing—timer governs silence, timetable embodies abandoned routes. Sensory economy favors sound (clicks, thunder) and filtered light, mirroring narrowed perception under pressure. Setting charges the final image: writing begins as dome flashes, fusing place to decision.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Glass atrium and brook are vividly anchored early; light fracturing across stone keeps the space alive. Micro-setting works: the needle card glints under specific light, letting the object act as pocket-sized terrain. Spatial choreography stays clean; bodies and props never drift.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.0)
    The rusted library under stars is kept tactile: creaking gate, sagging shelves, rooftop scar-map view. Selective sensory economy—dust smell, dented tin, moonlit paint—mirrors the patched-coat aesthetic. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating bodies. For 9+ the setting would need to actively constrain a final choice; instead it serves as canvas rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.1)
    “Tidal arbor above the clouds” is sketched with selective sensory strokes; floating islands and flickering compasses create texture without catalog. The piano bench, broken clock, and projector function as micro-settings that constrain touch and memory. Final beam of sunlight on the keys charges the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ridge is sketched with lyrical strokes (“blooms opening and closing as if in rhythm with her heartbeat”) that supply texture but never constrain physical choice or become a tool she must exploit. Spatial choreography is fuzzy: the climb, distance, and village commons are asserted, not mapped, so the environment never endangers or enables. Weather’s only function is postponed arrival, so it tightens nothing on the page. The knowledge fruit seed itself becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image, just meeting the 9+ gate, but the ridge remains picturesque backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.9)
    Islet, cottage, cove, tide-washed sand are sketched with salt-air specificity; weathered lace and half-submerged chest supply tactile micro-setting. Environment steers choice: slick rocks slow him, hidden cove reveals letters, rising tide literally erases regret—setting constrains and enables. Sensory hierarchy favors damp earth, salt, spinning needle—details filtered through bonsai-trained attention to minute change. Final image recharges the same shoreline, now re-colored by release, satisfying the 9+ micro-setting gate.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and charges the narrative: shattered glass, brackish soil, and collapsed tables shape Elara’s movements and experiments. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—chill, dampness, iridescence—filtered through her scientific yet poetic perception. The environment mirrors neutron-star decay while enabling the dust’s catalytic role. Crucially, the setting directly charges the final image: the butterfly emerges from ruin, not restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    The canyon setting is vividly rendered (“quiet canyon under stars,” “bioluminescent moss”) and functions as micro-setting: frost preserves traces, rocks guide navigation, grotto hides truth. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara’s artisan POV. Yet the environment doesn’t *constrain* choice—it enables it without resistance, missing the 9+ gate. Still, the final image of stars reflecting in glass ties setting to theme with resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    The winterglass conservatory functions as a charged micro-setting: its frosted panes, damp earth, and clinging plants mirror Elara’s internal state while enabling her work. The tuning fork and heat-mapping device are tactile extensions of this environment. Crucially, the setting constrains choice—she can only “hear” through bone conduction and thermal visualization—and directly charges the final image when dawn light filters through the same glass that once symbolized isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    The underwater library is vividly rendered through selective, POV-filtered detail (“shelves warped by time,” “waterfall of algae”), and crucially constrains choice: fragments are hidden in environment-specific loci. The lantern, lens, and seaweed-green book function as micro-settings that directly enable plot progression. Most impressively, the setting charges the final image—the water parting to reveal stars—making the environment indispensable to closure. Sensory balance favors touch and sight appropriately for an undertaker navigating darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    The terra-cotta arbor anchors spatial choreography and evolves from shelter to symbolic beacon, directly shaping the climax. Sensory detail is selective—cracked tiles, moonlight, lantern glow—and filtered through Mara’s urgency. The bell functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (she clutches it when revealed) and charging the final image. However, the environment doesn’t actively foreclose options; it supports rather than pressures, missing the 9+ gate for constraint-driven setting.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    The viaduct functions as micro-setting: its iron beams, blossoms, and hidden compartment directly enable discovery and ritual. Sensory detail is selective—wisteria’s scent shifts to damp stone—and filtered through Elara’s spiritual longing. The jade pendant and twilight light charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate: setting constrains choice (kneeling, placing pendant) and reweights meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    The living bridge garden functions as micro-setting: roots “whisper,” vines “breathe,” and hedges warp space, directly shaping Elara’s navigation and emotional state. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—damp earth, blooming flowers, iridescent glow—filtered through her obsession. The garden evolves post-revelation (“brighter, more alive”), charging the final image. However, hyperbolic geometry is asserted rather than shown constraining movement, missing a 9+ gate opportunity to tie spatial logic to thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    The abandoned carnival setting is vividly rendered (“rusted Ferris wheel creaked like an old man’s bones,” “faded banners fluttering like ghosts”) and functions as micro-setting: the redemption booth hides the vault, the piano bench holds the key, and labyrinthine paths enable evasion. Spatial choreography is coherent, and sensory detail (scent of earth in the vault) serves urgency. Yet the environment doesn’t actively constrain the climax—the wall’s collapse is announced but not felt as a physical pressure during the escape, missing a 9+ opportunity to have debris or dust directly impede movement.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse, shipwrecks, ashen forge, and aurora form a cohesive micro-setting that actively constrains and charges every action. Sensory detail is selective and synesthetic—lavender hums, indigo rumbles—and filtered through Elara’s hearing aid. The environment evolves causally: the aurora intensifies as she approaches the forge, then fades post-revelation. Crucially, the setting directly enables the climax—the forge imprints memory only because it exists within this liminal ruin.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    The emerald station and clock tower are vividly rendered with selective, mood-charged detail (“frozen at the hour of twilight,” “ethereal patterns on the walls”). Moonlight functions as micro-setting, constraining perception and symbolizing guidance. However, the environment doesn’t actively pressure choices beyond atmosphere—the ivy’s “way out” is floral, not architectural—missing the 9+ gate requiring setting to constrain a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    The abandoned control room functions effectively as micro-setting: its stillness contrasts Elara’s active creation, and its relics contextualize her mission. Sensory details (dust-laden screens, cool air, molten glass) are selective and POV-filtered. However, the setting doesn’t *constrain* choices—it’s atmospheric but passive. The crucible and blowpipe are handled tactilely, yet the environment itself doesn’t alter tactics or impose limits, missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rusted library functions as micro-setting: its decay mirrors Elara’s fractured identity, and its spatial logic (shelves → hidden door → mirror room) guides her progression. The seashell and cast act as tactile anchors that constrain perception and action. However, the setting doesn’t actively pressure choices—it enables revelation without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting functions as active micro-setting: the storm-tossed ridge fort absorbs narratives, its stones and tapestry shaping the oracle’s craft. Weather and dimming sky pressure decisions (“when only one star remained”). The “ambered hush” evolves from atmosphere to living presence, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    The frozen courtyard functions as micro-setting: its stillness pressures Unit-7’s introspection, and the ice violin—born of this environment—constrains the climax. Sensory detail is selective (pale blue light, refracted twilight) and filtered through the robot’s perception. The setting charges the final image: the unchanged courtyard now “filled with the faint echo,” proving environment shapes meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    The crystal whispering forecourt is vividly rendered with petrichor, dampness, and humming glow that shape mood and perception. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: crystals “whisper approval” as trust thaws, linking environment to emotional shift. The projector lens and concert ticket function as micro-settings that constrain interpretation and enable the climactic offering. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    The garden maze functions as both setting and micro-setting—it constrains choice (paths echo thought), supplies the marbles, and charges the final image with rainbows and rustling gratitude. Sensory detail is selective (glow, rustle, sunlight) and filtered through Elias’s tactile expertise. The vine-dresser’s familiarity grounds attention, avoiding tourist cataloging. Only minor deduction: the “sprawling estate” remains vague, but the maze’s intimacy compensates fully within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    The xenobiology station and twilight alien landscape are vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail—the bioluminescent creatures, metallic scar imagery, and observation windows all reflect Elara’s isolation and ambition. The magnetic nexus functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice: its lever must be manipulated, its overload threatens collapse. Sensory hierarchy shifts appropriately under stress (focus narrows to alarms, tremors, flickering projections). The setting charges the final image: the softened glow of the nexus contrasts with the creatures’ luminescence, embodying tempered discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    The flooded opera house lit by flickering lanterns is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting: water depth affects movement, lantern light shapes perception, and decay provides the medium (water-stained paper) for revelation. Sensory detail is selective—focus on touch (silt, disintegrating paper), sound (hush, hum), and sight (shadows, stains)—filtered through Clara’s musician POV. The setting constrains choice (she must interpret stains, not read intact notation) and charges the final image: ruins feel “alive again” through lingering resonance. However, it doesn’t actively foreclose options beyond atmosphere, missing the 9+ gate for environmental constraint on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mountain weather station isn’t just backdrop—it’s a liminal crucible where thin air and creaking beams mirror Elara’s cognitive fragility. Crucially, the botanical illustration functions as micro-setting: its smudging directly enables the thematic pivot. Sensory detail (ozone, pine, ink) is selective and POV-filtered, never decorative. However, the station itself doesn’t actively constrain choices beyond mood, preventing a 9+ score despite strong atmospheric integration.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tunnel setting is vividly rendered through damp earth, rusted metal, broken glass, and cold stone—sensory details that reflect Mara’s unease and the site’s decay. The beaded valve wheel functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice: it must be turned to resolve the haunting. However, the chamber at the tunnel’s heart arrives without spatial buildup; its sudden appearance (“At the tunnel’s heart, she found it”) lacks transitional choreography. Still, the environment charges the final image through tactile continuity (grime → glow → release).

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    The overgrown library and obsidian refuge function as charged micro-settings that constrain and reflect Lira’s psyche. Vines “embracing” tomes and roots like “grasping hands” are tactile and purposeful. The river’s “regenerative silence” ties environment to theme without overt symbolism. However, the refuge’s interior lacks sensory specificity beyond “cool and still,” slightly weakening its payoff despite strong closure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sage Ridge functions effectively as micro-setting—the glowing grass, dreaming roots, and eclipse-lit meadow create a tactile, mythic atmosphere filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, especially the visual dimming and hush. However, the setting doesn’t actively constrain choices; it decorates rather than pressures. The curl and eclipse serve as environmental proxies but don’t impose physical or tactical limits.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    The reclaimed silo library functions effectively as micro-setting: its “bronze quiet” and “stories walls have heard” directly echo the theme and constrain the action (hidden compartment, stone altar). Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric—metal walls, charred pages, golden light—filtered through Elara’s obsessive focus. The setting evolves meaningfully: from tomb of silence to humming vessel of rebirth, charging the final image. It meets the 9+ gate by constraining choice (ritual location) and reweighting the ending’s resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Chinatown kitchen is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (clatter, hum, dim light), and the microdot specs function as a charged micro-setting. However, the lighthouse remains a postcard image—never constraining choice or altering tactics. The setting supports tone but doesn’t pressure decisions; final image borrows atmosphere without causal integration.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dimensional anchor functions effectively as micro-setting: its “muffled clarity” and resonant silence directly shape the priest’s tactics and charge the final image. The palette and black color act as object-as-setting, constraining choice by demanding non-visual engagement with void. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“silence wasn’t empty but resonant”), though spatial choreography remains vague. Lacks a decisive environmental constraint that forces a physical trade-off, capping 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glass spire and frozen lake are not mere backdrop—they function as micro-setting: the reflective surfaces (spire glass, lake ice) mirror the story’s core concept and constrain perception, while the nautilus shell becomes a tactile tool that channels memory into action. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (cool shell, fogged glass, golden dawn light), filtered through the protagonist’s liminal consciousness. However, the setting doesn’t *alter tactics* beyond mood; the spire could be any isolated tower without structural consequence. Still, the recurring mirror motif charges the final image powerfully, narrowly missing the 9+ gate due to lack of tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glowing viaduct after rain functions as a potent micro-setting: its slick surface, luminescence, and fractal branching directly shape Elara’s movement and perception. Sensory details (wet asphalt, hum of traffic) ground the surreal premise in tactile reality. Crucially, the viaduct constrains choice—it splits only when Elara acts—and charges the final image when it “was whole once more.” The recurring object (tablet) and environment merge to reconfigure meaning at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate, though the city backdrop remains generic.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    The drum maker’s cavern functions as micro-setting: stone walls hum, torchlight flickers, tools constrain action. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and vibration over sound, aligning with POV. Final image of drumstick tap charges closure—soundless yet resonant. Only slight deduction: “faint rustle of turning seasons” outside lacks causal pressure on choices, functioning more as atmospheric bookend than lived constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    The courtyard, industrial wasteland, and tower are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (damp earth, rusted factories, hum beyond the gate). The setting guides choice—Elias times his entry based on guard patterns—but the environment doesn’t actively constrain him beyond mild obstacles. The carrier pigeon tube functions as micro-setting, charging the final image, yet the “rogue quarantine zone” feels generically dystopian rather than uniquely textured.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lantern shop, greenhouse, and hospital are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail filtered through Elias’s POV (e.g., “jasmine and rain” as ghostly scent). The recurring “crystal shadows” and vial’s ultraviolet glow charge the final image. However, the greenhouse functions more as backdrop than active constraint—its extinct blooms don’t alter tactics, missing a 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.3)
    The terra-cotta grotto functions as micro-setting: its shifting patterns directly constrain Elias’s choices (guiding him to the alcove) and charge the closure (mirror’s visions emerge from wall motifs). Starlight-filtered textures and rope-on-dust tactility ground perception in POV bias. Crucially, the setting evolves—patterns pulse, still, and reveal—mirroring Elias’s internal cadence without overt symbolism. This environment is irreplaceable; a generic cave would collapse the story’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting: its fractured glass, ash-laden soil, and creaking wrecks directly shape Elara’s choices and sensory experience. The environment constrains her initial silence and later amplifies her music’s resonance. Final image—the bowl left in ash—charges the setting with legacy. Only minor deduction: shipwrecks remain atmospheric rather than tactically active beyond ambient sound.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    The amber grotto functions as micro-setting: its mineral-scented air and static-charged stones directly enable Elara’s method and constrain her ritual (velvet pouch protection, focused dissolution). Sensory hierarchy reflects her priorities—damp earth vs. metallic minerals mirrors her balance of empathy and detachment. Final image (“amber light warmer”) charges closure by reweighting the grotto’s atmosphere through Elara’s earned poise. Deduction: spatial choreography lacks granularity (e.g., stalactite proximity), but selective detail serves theme over geography.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.9)
    The “breezy library under stars” is vividly rendered and recurs meaningfully, functioning as micro-setting that frames both solitude and connection. Salt-and-pine air, open roof, and starlight create atmospheric continuity. Yet the setting doesn’t constrain choice—Elara could’ve read the letter anywhere; the library is mood, not mechanism. Strong sensory specificity avoids white-room syndrome but stops short of 9+ because environment doesn’t alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.0)
    The crystalline orchard and shimmering crater aren’t backdrop—they actively shape perception and choice. Light refracting through prism-like trees mirrors the shifting patterns of the obsidian arbor, which in turn reflects Lira’s evolving understanding of kinship. The setting charges the final image: as the arbor’s patterns shift, so does Lira’s sense of place. Every sensory detail (violet-gold sky, fragile reeds, obsidian’s pulse) serves character and theme without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rooftop canal system acts as micro-setting that actively guides choice—the currents bend to Mara’s will, towers form a labyrinth, and the water urges her forward. The pendant (tool/object-as-setting) constrains and enables movement, culminating in its use at the gate. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (glinting waters, earthy air), evolving causally with the plot. Final image of starlit canals charges closure by echoing the opening with transformed meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cavern orchard is vividly rendered—not as backdrop but as active micro-setting. Stalactite drips nourish luminous fruit; moonlight filters through fissures; roots cradle secrets. Crucially, the setting constrains choice: the oldest tree hides the eyes, the unmarked stone radiates warmth only near a specific tree, and the workshop enables magical experimentation. The final image—orchard glowing brighter—charges closure by reflecting Elara’s internal shift. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara’s conjurer POV.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “shadowed library at dawn” functions as micro-setting: pipes guide movement, carpet muffles sound, and sapphire hush modulates tone. Sensory detail is selective (metallic veins, pitted tape, aged carpet) and filtered through the dweller’s tactile focus. The environment constrains choice (navigating pipe chases) and charges the final image—morning light replacing shadows mirrors internal shift. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout descent.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mossy trellis functions as micro-setting: it shifts from barrier to gateway, directly shaping Mara’s movement and emotional pivot. Rain, wet earth, and greenhouse roof are tactile and purposeful, filtered through her professional attention. However, while atmosphere mirrors internal state effectively, the linden leaf—not the environment—carries the decisive charge at closure, preventing full 9+ integration of setting as constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tidal island isn’t backdrop but active archive: tides carve the archway, rain guides the path, salt and algae scent the air—all constrain Elara’s movement and perception. The crumbling cottage and sunken ruin reflect her fractured psyche while enabling discovery. Crucially, the amber brooch—a micro-setting—charges the final image, lying witness on her desk as she paints with new purpose. Vivid sensory hierarchy (damp earth, briny depths, warm amber) serves urgency without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    The musical crystal cave functions as a dynamic micro-setting: its singing crystals constrain perception (melodies shift unpredictably), supply the cave pearl, and directly enable Elara’s transformation. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—iridescence, hum, overlapping shadows—and evolves causally (walls “shift,” song becomes “chorus of possibility”). The setting charges the final image: Elara carries “bright darkness” that “illuminated without blinding,” tying environment to theme. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ivory Harbor after rain isn’t backdrop—it pressures every move: damp sand slows steps, spray clings to the cloak, cliffs constrain search zones. The trumpet valve functions as micro-setting, its brass coolness and hum shaping Elara’s choices. Final image of wreckage as “promise of renewal” charges the environment with transformed meaning. Sensory hierarchy (salt, petrichor, ocean roar) filters through Elara’s archivist focus without tourist excess.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mist-shrouded woods, starlit vault, and shimmering fortress create a tactile, atmospheric setting filtered through Elara’s professional attention to paths and symbols. The phantom punch functions as micro-setting—it constrains choice (only she can open the gate) and charges the final image. However, the environment doesn’t actively obstruct or enable tactics beyond passive guidance (arrows appear conveniently), missing the 9+ gate for causal constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eldermere’s shore, cottage, and tower are rendered with tactile specificity—ivy-choked stairs, warm tile, starlit whales—that serve atmosphere and theme. The tower functions as micro-setting: its pedestal enables the climax, and celestial alignment shapes the outcome. However, the environment doesn’t *constrain* choice (she could’ve stayed home), missing the 9+ gate. Still, sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prismatic escondite functions as both setting and micro-setting: its fracturing hues and dancing shadows directly mirror and amplify Elyr’s internal state, culminating in the realm’s shudder when he touches the fragment. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—light “fractured into infinite hues,” storm energy “crackling”—filtered through Elyr’s dimensional awareness. However, while atmosphere charges the climax, the setting doesn’t actively constrain Elyr’s choices; it reacts rather than resists or enables in a tactically meaningful way. Thus, it falls just short of the 9+ gate requiring environmental constraint on agency.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    The funeral home prep room functions as micro-setting: cold marble, formaldehyde, flickering lights—all constrain Clara’s physical and emotional state. The ink pot, though anomalous, is tactilely rendered and reappears with reweighted meaning. Sensory detail is selective (smell of wax, cool porcelain) and filtered through Clara’s anxiety. The environment charges the final image: rebirth emerging from a space of deathly vitality.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bonsai labyrinth is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (pine scent, moss ground, fluorescent flicker), filtered through Elara’s professional attention. The setting functions as micro-setting: it amplifies the hum and guides her movement, directly enabling her method. However, it doesn’t *constrain* a key choice—she moves freely—so it falls just short of the 9-band gate requiring environmental pressure on decision.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    The shipping container labyrinth functions as both setting and micro-setting: its spatial logic dictates movement, concealment, and discovery (e.g., mudflats at low tide yield relics). Sensory detail is vivid and selective (salt-laden air, rusted frames, cranes’ groans), filtered through the protagonist’s attention. Crucially, the environment constrains choice (tides dictate rhythm) and charges the final image (moonlight on containers during epiphany). No white-room syndrome; geography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    The abandoned observatory functions as both setting and micro-setting: its decay mirrors Mara’s internal state, and the half-finished cello directly enables the climax. Sensory details (salty wind, dust, unpolished wood) are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding tourist cataloging. The seashell’s glow and the cello’s resonance charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate—though the cliff’s danger is noted but never constrains choice, slightly limiting environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    Luminara’s raft-city setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (“amber and gold,” “patchwork of barges”) and functions as micro-setting: spatial choreography (marketplace, Vorin’s barge, festival grounds) guides action. The foundation stone chip and graffiti constrain choices and charge the final image. No white-room syndrome; environment actively shapes tactics and stakes. However, “perpetual carnival” remains atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    The moonlit summit functions as micro-setting: its silence, regolith crunch, and approaching dawn directly pressure Elara’s choices (e.g., working faster as light nears). Sensory detail is selective and profession-filtered—she notices module corrosion, not generic stars. However, the environment doesn’t *constrain* her final act; she could photograph anywhere. The hourglass grain, not the lunar terrain, charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.3)
    The mist-coated rail depot, water features, and oil-iron atmosphere are not backdrop but active constraints: Elara reads machinery through refracted light, making environment integral to method. The hummingbird drone and workbench function as micro-settings that shape action. Every detail serves tone or tactic—spatial choreography is precise, and sensory hierarchy reflects Elara’s blindness. The setting charges the final image: mist curls around her like witness, affirming sanctuary amid chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    The frozen lake and rusted outpost aren’t backdrop—they constrain and catalyze. The thin ice forces Elara to kneel, touch, and follow vibration; the condensation pattern on glass directly seeds the real-world mist. The phrasebook functions as micro-setting, its dog-eared “source” page enabling the final act of writing. Sensory detail is selective (crunching frost, pale sun, glove brushing ice) and filtered through a cartographer’s bias—mapping veins onto condensation.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail—pine scent, cobblestone echoes, glinting tuning fork—that filters through Elias’s perception. The ancient archway functions as micro-setting: it anchors the ritual and reappears sharpened at the end, charging closure. Vines retreating and cracks “mending” sonically show environmental evolution tied to action. Yet the archway doesn’t constrain choices—it’s symbolic, not tactical—preventing a 9+ despite strong atmospheric control.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    The underwater temple functions effectively as micro-setting, with carvings and crystals constraining Maya’s actions and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective—glow, stone, breath—and filtered through her biologist POV. However, spatial choreography lacks specificity; we never feel the crush of confinement or navigate real obstacles. The environment mirrors theme but doesn’t actively pressure tactics beyond vague “shifting walls.”

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lighthouse prison functions as both setting and micro-setting: its corridors echo stories, its copperlight chamber reveals truth, and the narrow door’s scuffs guide discovery. The reef, stone walls, and ore veins are tactile and recurring, not decorative. Crucially, the lattice—a salvaged object—constrains choice (it grounds him, hums with possibility) and charges the final image (he carries it out). However, the setting doesn’t actively *alter* tactics beyond mood; it reflects more than pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.1)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is masterfully rendered—not just backdrop but active constraint and emotional mirror. Petrified blossoms, winter-cracked fields, and glass walls “clinging like a second skin” filter every perception. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: the bead’s light illuminating her path reconfigures the space from cage to liminal passage, fulfilling the 9+ gate by constraining and transforming meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    The red canyon labyrinth functions as both setting and micro-setting—the stone absorbs stories, directly enabling Elara’s sewing action. Sensory detail is vivid (“scent of earth and time,” “glowing walls”) and filtered through her poetic perception. The environment constrains and charges the final image: the canyon exhales only after she embeds narratives, making place active, not decorative. Minor deduction for slight overreliance on visual metaphor at expense of tactile or auditory specificity in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.1)
    The catacomb orchard functions as a micro-setting that actively guides Elara—the roots “shift, as if guiding her”—and culminates in the tomb entrance hidden beneath ivy. The sundial base constrains the climax: only its “perfect fit” opens the chamber. Sensory detail is selective (golden hue at dusk, smooth stones) and filtered through Elara’s reverence. The environment charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    The golden arcade functions effectively as micro-setting: its dawn light, mosaics, and chalk drawings create a tactile, era-colliding atmosphere that shapes Lyra’s perception. The ebony clipboard and chalk marks are woven into action, not just backdrop. Crucially, the setting charges the final image—dew-muted chalk underscores ephemerality versus permanence. However, the environment doesn’t constrain choices (e.g., she accesses the mailbox unimpeded), missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt observatory isn’t backdrop—it’s active setting. Its glass dome reflects twilight, its stained-glass window filters Lira’s arrival, and its status as a “nexus of adjacent possibilities” directly enables the climax. The eternal candle’s steady glow becomes a tactical anchor; the autumn wind outside contrasts the “echoed silence” within, charging atmosphere with thematic weight. Every sensory detail serves pressure or perception, never stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mangrove labyrinth functions as a charged micro-setting: roots shift to guide, moonlight pools as liquid silver, and the hut’s fogged glass becomes a canvas for revelation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—humming air, prickling skin, warm shard—filtered through Elara’s mediumship. The environment directly constrains choice (only moonlight activates the shard) and charges the final image (letter in heart, spirits’ songs trailing). No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mist-clad atrium functions as a micro-setting that charges atmosphere but doesn’t constrain choice—the glass doors, marble table, and coral fragment are evocative yet passive. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (damp earth, jasmine, condensation), filtered through Elara’s translator POV. However, the setting never actively shapes tactics or forecloses options; it remains a lyrical backdrop rather than a crucible. Thus, it falls just short of the 9+ gate requiring environmental constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.1)
    The ruined orchard district isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choice (fog obscures/reveals paths) and supplies key resources (fresco, film, network). The recurring object-as-setting (film) constrains tactics and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid but selective, filtered through Lira’s artistic POV. Fog functions as both atmosphere and canvas, fulfilling the 9+ gate by shaping the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.3)
    The sound wave garden isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and catalyst. Metallic flowers hum frequencies that shift the mural; spatial choreography (kneeling, stepping back, closing eyes) aligns with acoustic logic. The hobo nickel’s glow and the wall’s resonance are tactile extensions of setting. Final image charges closure: sound waves become stories, proving environment directly enables the protagonist’s transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse functions as micro-setting: glass panes fog, shadows shift, insects hum—all heighten tension and mirror Elias’s paranoia. The gourd seed is handled concretely, not just described. Sensory detail is selective (jasmine, damp earth) and filtered through Elias’s urgency. However, the setting doesn’t *constrain* a key choice—the loose panel is a test, not a tactical limitation—preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    The gargantuan shell functions as both setting and character, its spirals mirroring the poet’s psyche and physically shaping her sanctuary. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—cool walls, echoing wind, frayed postcard edges—filtered through the poet’s longing. Crucially, the shell constrains and enables: it cradles her thoughts, carries her voice, and ultimately “exhales” in acknowledgment, charging the final image. The galaxy postcard serves as micro-setting, its translucence marking time and effort, directly contributing to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.3)
    The opal library, glass orchids, and museum of extinct feelings are not backdrop but active constraints: the luminous floor guides movement, the clouds signal isolation, and the Vessel’s physicality demands handling. Crucially, the wind chime’s cracked tube—a micro-setting—directly charges the climax when it shatters, reconfiguring the space’s acoustics and meaning. Sensory detail is selective (milky blue walls, chiming petals) and filtered through Elara’s caretaker POV. The setting earns its lyricism by shaping tactics and final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    The extinct language archive functions as micro-setting: dust motes, glass inkwell, and labyrinthine shelves constrain choice (Elara navigates physically and morally) and charge closure (voices harmonize as she writes). Sensory detail is selective—sunlight beams, parchment texture—and filtered through Elara’s linguist POV. However, the setting doesn’t actively alter tactics beyond mood; it reflects rather than pressures her decisions. Still, the inkwell’s shimmering response ties environment to emotional climax.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    The volcanic amphitheater isn’t backdrop—it breathes, glows, and contracts, directly shaping Elias’s perception and urgency. The surveyor’s chain functions as micro-setting: its inscribed poem guides his design, and its brass links catch light “deliberately,” charging the final image. Sensory detail (damp stone, faint glow, chain’s glint) is selective, POV-filtered through a machinist’s tactile attention. The setting constrains choice (only here can the chain’s code be read) and reweights meaning at closure—the cracks become “beauty in imperfection.”

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.3)
    The attic functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: its skylight dictates the dust’s visibility, its books supply message paper, and its isolation permits Elara’s fragile reinventions. The meteorite chip and dust motes are tactile, recurring objects that charge the final image—Elara’s palm holding the chip as motes swirl above. Sensory detail is selective (musty air, coos, crumbling pages) and filtered through Elara’s melancholic attention. Crucially, the setting directly shapes tactics (pigeon routes, note-writing) and culminates in the closure’s physical tableau.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    The drifting prism terrace is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting: its shifting prisms trigger memory and catalyze insight, directly shaping the climax. Sensory detail is selective—fractured light, groaning glass, thick hush—and filtered through Elara’s quest. However, the setting doesn’t *constrain* choice (she could intuit anywhere); it amplifies rather than pressures. Still, the terrace charges the final image when she abandons the logbook there, fulfilling the 9+ gate condition.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.3)
    The underwater facility isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains: cracked domes signal impending collapse, corridors shape Elara’s purposeful movement, and the viewport becomes a stage for communion. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: sunrise through fissures merges oceanic and celestial light, validating her astrological lens. Every sensory detail (algae, rust, bioluminescence) filters through her professional gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    The iridescent cave functions as micro-setting: its shimmering walls mirror internal states without overt symbolism, and the crater glass—a tool embedded in environment—constrains Lira’s method. Sensory detail is selective (violet-gold hum, smooth seed) and filtered through her profession. The geode’s “cheerful gloom” evolves from shadow to embrace, charging the final image. However, the setting doesn’t actively pressure choices beyond mood—it enables rather than compels.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal arcade under stars functions as micro-setting: glass ceiling enables the climactic starlight beam that charges the bishop’s shadow. Sensory detail is selective (balloon drift, pigeon coos) and filtered through Elias’s attention. However, the setting doesn’t constrain choices—it decorates them. The bishop, not the arcade, drives closure, capping Q3 just below 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.3)
    The twilight garden functions as micro-setting: its obsidian flowers, dew, and spatial voids directly enable Lira’s method and final act. Moonstone dust mixes with dew from petals; constellations are traced on earth; the garden “conspires” and “exhales”—all constraining and charging choices. Sensory detail is selective (cool air, glowing speck, whispering petals) and filtered through Lira’s tide-dancer perception. The setting culminates in the final image, making it indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)

Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment evolves with the rising sun. The setting doesn’t merely backdrop but actively shapes perception and theme, fulfilling the 9+ gate except for lacking a tangible constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    The moonlit ridge, charred oak, and celestial bodies create a vivid, selective atmosphere that mirrors Elias’s internal state without overt symbolism. The cracked porcelain box acts as micro-setting, constraining choice (he must open it, interpret it, leave it). Sensory detail is purposeful—silver glow, jagged edges, indeterminate feather color—and filtered through Elias’s trauma-informed perception. However, the environment doesn’t actively pressure tactics beyond mood; it reflects more than shapes.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tide-polished grotto functions as micro-setting: its tidal rhythm directly pressures Elara’s actions, forcing adaptation. The balloonist’s gauge and seaweed/shells are tactile extensions of environment that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“air thick with anticipation,” “sunlight filtering through water”). The setting constrains choice and crystallizes theme—exactly what 9+ demands.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ivy-veiled passage functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and guides: ivy “watches,” walls “breathe,” and spatial narrowing pressures her forward. Humidity, ash, and moss are tactile and POV-filtered, never catalogued. The climate-shift context subtly informs decay without exposition. Final chamber’s smooth walls contrast prior texture, charging the closure—environment directly shapes the thematic pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.0)
    The echoing terrace, prism parapet, and post-rain light are not backdrop but active agents: the wet glass fractures sunlight into the spectrum Elara manipulates, and the bells impose a temporal boundary. The setting constrains her method and charges the climax—the parapet is both stage and tool. Every atmospheric detail serves the central conceit, avoiding generic spring clichés through precise optical and acoustic specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ancient terrace functions as a potent micro-setting: its ritual significance constrains Elara’s descent and frames the final image, while the ebony clipboard acts as a tactile extension of environment. Sensory detail (jasmine, flickering fires, midsummer stars) is selective and POV-filtered, evolving from atmospheric backdrop to charged witness at closure. The celestial dance subtly mirrors narrative rhythm without overt symbolism. This integration earns high marks, though weather/time don’t materially alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    The salt flat functions as micro-setting: its crystalline surface resists Elara’s steps, its damp depression enables incubation, and its shifting texture mirrors moral unease. Sensory detail is selective (arid wind, iridescent egg, distant thunder) and filtered through Elara’s purposeful gaze. The environment directly constrains choice—only this hidden wet spot permits release—and charges the final image when rain washes salt away. Deducted 0.1 for slight overreliance on visual shimmer at the expense of tactile or auditory immersion during key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    The silver courtyard, snow, and prism sanctuary form a micro-setting that actively pressures choice: cold sharpens breath and focus, starlight refracts meaning, and the lattice of threads demands tactile engagement. The environment evolves—from sealed opacity to glowing openness—and charges the final image as snowflakes carry echoes outward. However, while vivid, the setting doesn’t *constrain* Elara’s tactics beyond mood; she could untangle threads anywhere. Thus, it falls just short of the 9+ gate requiring environmental constraint on action.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    The decommissioned radar dome functions effectively as micro-setting: its silence mirrors Elias’s turmoil, warped stage enables his pivot, and cracked windows frame dawn’s arrival. Sensory detail is selective (echoes, dim light, worn wood) and filtered through his calligrapher’s attention to texture. Yet the dome never actively constrains choice—it’s atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical resource, missing the 9+ gate for environmental agency.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    The grotto functions as a micro-setting that actively shapes ritual: moss-covered stone, vines, and filtered light constrain and enable Elara’s constructions. Sensory detail is selective (iridescent moth wing, rustling air) and filtered through her esoteric realism. The setting charges the final image—the spiral glimmers as the sun dips—and evolves with emotional tone. Crucially, the environment constrains choice (only natural ephemera available) and directly fuels the closure’s resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    The icebound sanctum, aurora, and ceremonial rope function as micro-settings that charge the final image—the rope glows, the aurora flares—but they don’t actively constrain choices (e.g., cold doesn’t impede dexterity). Sensory detail is vivid (“scent of pine and frost”) and filtered through Elara’s craft-focused POV. However, the setting remains atmospheric rather than tactical; no spatial or environmental pressure alters her method. The aurora’s responsiveness borders on sentient convenience, slightly weakening verisimilitude.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting: the bunker’s “precisely playful architecture” mirrors Foresight’s mind, vines conceal, storm pressures timing. The wafer seal and shifting wall patterns tie environment to cognition. Crucially, the forest-storm-bunker triad charges the final image—the dissolution of the seal occurs amid ethereal grit, binding closure to place. No white-room syndrome; spatial logic holds.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    The reimagined Babylonian palace provides vivid sensory texture—stone carvings, ziggurats, marble schematics—but functions as backdrop, not crucible. No spatial constraint shapes Kael’s choices; he moves freely from courtyard to observatory without friction. The tile and stars are noted, but the setting doesn’t alter tactics or impose limits. Final image uses stars effectively, but environment doesn’t *constrain* the climax, missing 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.9)
    The “soundless sanctuary” establishes atmosphere effectively, and the music box serves as micro-setting, but neither constrains action meaningfully. The still fountain and velvet textures are decorative rather than tactical—Elara could deliver her speech anywhere. Sensory detail skews visual; silence is asserted but not experienced through embodied perception (e.g., muffled footsteps, tinnitus). The setting doesn’t evolve causally with the conflict, missing the 9+ gate for environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ruined orchard, frost, and fog aren’t backdrop—they constrain perception and symbolize Elara’s internal barrier; the workshop’s damp wood and lantern light ground her process. Crucially, the fog actively presses against windows like a “living thing,” then thins only when Elara acts, making environment a causal agent. The sextant and glass function as micro-settings that charge the final image: boundaries dissolve because the setting responds to synchronized breath.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cathedral-orchard setting is masterfully specific and active: roots entwine stone, fruit weighs branches, light filters through stained glass—all shaping mood and possibility. Crucially, the orchard supplies the soil for petals to bloom and becomes the site of transformation; the rafters aren’t backdrop but scaffold for renewal. Final image charges the setting with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    The astral orchard is lushly specific—iridescent petals, whisper-gravity, humming blossoms—and functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Yet it never constrains choice; Elara moves freely, unimpeded by environment. The bathroom’s thought-reflecting mirrors are inventive but feel tacked on rather than integrated into spatial logic. Still, sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mountain-bookstore setting is vividly rendered and actively resists intrusion (shifting shelves, snapping books), directly shaping Elara’s path.

Yet the environment doesn’t *constrain* the final choice—the guardian appears ex nihilo without spatial or ecological logic.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned carnival ship is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail—rusted hull, shattered mirrors, fog—that mirrors Elara’s psychological state without overt symbolism. The emerald swatch card functions as micro-setting, constraining choice by guiding her path and dissolving at the threshold, directly charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the labyrinthine interior. The setting actively pressures decisions (e.g., fog limiting visibility, decay dictating pace), fulfilling the 9+ gate condition.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    The clock tower mechanism room functions as a dynamic micro-setting: gears mirror Elara’s thoughts, the rope is tactilely described, and the hidden door emerges organically from the environment. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (brass lamp glow, frayed fibers, humming rope), and the space actively constrains and enables action. The final image—chimes “richer than ever”—charges the setting with thematic resonance, fulfilling the 9+ gate condition.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    The harmonic caves are not just backdrop but active participants—their hum, luminosity, and ice veins directly enable Lira’s method and shape her path.

Spatial choreography is precise, and sensory details (sound, light, texture) are filtered through Lira’s purpose. The setting constrains and charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glass humming pavilion functions as micro-setting: its hum signals function, dust conveys time, and walls project the prism’s light—directly charging the climax. Sensory detail is selective (translucent walls dulled by dust, cracked telescope lens) and filtered through Elara’s custodial gaze. However, the setting doesn’t *constrain* choices—it enables them (telescope access, pedestal placement)—missing the 9+ gate. Still, atmosphere is immersive and purposeful, never static.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stormlit observatory, crystalline forecourt, and solidified fog are rendered with lush specificity and function as active micro-settings: the stones whisper, the fog ripples with memory, shadows warp meaningfully. These elements charge the final image—dawn light replacing storm—and constrain Elara’s method (measuring shadows post-rain). Sensory detail is filtered through her professional attention, avoiding tourist cataloging. Yet no single environmental feature forces a tactical shift or irreversible choice, capping full 9+ eligibility per gate rules.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “blooming fortress” and kerosene rag knot function as micro-settings that constrain and charge choices—the vines frame resilience, the knot enables fire-spinning. Sensory detail is selective (flickering shadows, muted petals) and filtered through Lira’s artisan POV. However, the environment doesn’t actively pressure decisions beyond mood; it reflects rather than forces. Final image gains resonance from the mosaic’s glow, satisfying the 9+ gate narrowly.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ancient grotto under stars functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: its silence permits Elara’s expanded perception, while starlight patterns catalyze the cicada’s transformation. Sensory detail is purposeful—moss-covered stone, cool jade, pulsing stars—and filtered through Elara’s tidal-pool chronicler POV. The environment directly charges closure: walls “whisper encouragement,” and exiting under winking stars ties spatial choreography to thematic resolution. No white-room syndrome; every detail serves texture or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    The xenial trellis and bunker contrast tactilely: narrow windows vs. swaying vines, thick walls vs. crisp air. Crucially, the porcelain doll functions as micro-setting—it constrains Elara’s choices (carried during practice climbs) and charges the closure when it “sprouts” mid-inversion. Sensory detail favors touch and breath over visual cliché, aligning with POV urgency. However, “xenial trellis above the clouds” leans ornamental; its mechanics remain vague, limiting tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    The drifting prism terrace is vividly rendered—not as backdrop but as active crucible where light, silence, and floating platforms shape the characters’ emotional journey. The storm glass functions as micro-setting, constraining Elias’s navigation choices and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective (jasmine scent, indigo vial shift) and filtered through professional attention. The environment directly enables the thematic resolution, satisfying the 9+ gate despite minor abstraction in “vaulting hush.”

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall and pulsing fruit create a vivid, sensory-rich micro-setting that actively guides Lira’s path (e.g., colors intensify to beckon her). Bioluminescent vines and crystalline ground aren’t mere backdrop—they enable visibility and signal magic’s presence. However, the environment doesn’t *constrain* choice; Lira moves freely without spatial or tactical pressure from terrain. Final image charges theme but setting doesn’t alter tactics beyond passive signaling.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “ashen charcoal sanctuary” and starlight create a vivid, tactile micro-setting that mirrors Lira’s liminal role. Crucially, the setting constrains choice: the thinning threshold forces action, and the sanctuary’s fragility raises stakes. Sensory detail is selective (glimmering scars, humming ring) and integrated into action. However, environmental evolution post-climax is minimal—the starlight “returns” but doesn’t actively reshape tactics, slightly limiting 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm functions as micro-setting: its glow intensifies around the bolt, enabling the portal, and returns charged in the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“air shimmered,” “ethereal light”), avoiding white-room syndrome. The bolt and mushrooms constrain choice—only here can translation occur. Final image ties setting to theme, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sepia reading room is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (scent of aged paper, golden shadows) that reflects Eleanor’s interiority. The gramophone functions as micro-setting, constraining choice through its mechanical use and charging the final image. However, the bridge setting appears only in vision without spatial choreography or tactile interaction, limiting its pressure. The environment supports theme but doesn’t actively narrow options beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.3)
    The greenhouse functions as micro-setting: bioluminescent vines constrain choice by revealing patterns only when Alaric removes his gauntlet, and nightshade blooms charge the final image. Sensory details (hum of energies, gravel crunch) are filtered through Alaric’s trauma, avoiding tourist cataloging. The setting evolves causally—vines shift with his heartbeat—and directly enables the climax. Environment irreplaceably shapes tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    The foster care file room functions as a potent micro-setting: its dust, sagging shelves, and manila folders constrain Elara’s actions and charge the final image (“dust… seemed to shimmer”). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—smell of “old paper,” tactile frayed edges—and filtered through Elara’s archivist POV. The setting evolves tonally with her perception, fulfilling the 9+ gate by constraining choice (dust analysis method) and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.9)
    The auric lagoon is vividly rendered with emerald-gold starlight and tactile water, grounding the scene early. However, it functions mostly as backdrop; the algae-encrusted door appears conveniently without prior spatial logic. The keyhole’s alignment with starlight is poetic but doesn’t constrain Mara’s actions—it simply works. Setting charges atmosphere but not tactics; no environmental resistance alters her choices beyond mild “resistance” metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.1)
    The radiant grotto is not backdrop but active participant: luminescent moss pulses, mist swirls responsively, and the prism atrium rotates to focus energy on the saxophonist. Sensory detail is vivid yet selective—dewdrops, breath, silk-like notes—and filtered through the musician’s perception. Crucially, the setting constrains and enables: the “vested hush” amplifies sound, making music the only viable weapon. Final image (moss flickering in gratitude) charges closure with reciprocity.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly rendered with sensory specificity—scent of ancient wood, perpetual gray ash-sky, falling leaves—and functions as micro-setting that shapes Elara’s actions. The environment constrains perception (dim light) and supplies resources (seeds, leaves), directly enabling her monuments and decoding practice. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: the unchanged sky contrasts her internal shift, deepening thematic resonance. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the compass rose, greenhouse, and subterranean chamber each constrain or charge choice. The bioluminescent cavern and rustling leaves aren’t backdrop—they guide action and mirror thematic tension. Crucially, the greenhouse transforms perceptibly by story’s end, reflecting the protagonist’s inner shift. This environmental reciprocity charges the final image and satisfies the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rain-washed foundry functions as micro-setting: its cold iron and echoes shape Elara’s solitude and ritual. Sensory detail (damp metal, herbs, glistening walls) is selective and POV-filtered. Crucially, the furnace constrains choice—it’s the threshold she must cross—and the final moonlit exit charges closure. Only minor deduction: weather shifts (rain to clear sky) lack causal tie to action.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Echo Gorge is vividly rendered as a sentient labyrinth where time bends and whispers carry weight, directly shaping tactics—Elara navigates by sound and sorrow. The harp and crocodile’s tooth function as micro-settings that constrain and charge action. The “hidden sunrise” evolves from atmospheric detail to thematic fulcrum, culminating in golden light that validates Elara’s work. Deduction: spatial choreography lacks granularity—distances, obstacles, and verticality remain impressionistic, weakening tactile immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ultraviolet forest is not backdrop but active micro-setting: its pulsing bark, shimmering stream, and intensifying light directly shape Elara’s proprioceptive navigation and thematic realization. The environment constrains and charges every beat, culminating in the mask’s submersion—a physical act enabled by the stream’s presence. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through trauma-honed perception, avoiding tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.1)
    The alchemist’s market functions as micro-setting: ropes, tapestries, and suspended platforms directly enable Lila’s descent and spatial navigation. The lens fragment—treated as an extension of setting—constrains perception and charges the final image. Sensory specificity (copper, burnt sage, charred map edges) filters through Lila’s professional bias. Crucially, the ruined tower’s ivy-hidden door is revealed only because the fragment pulses—environment and object fuse to shape choice.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned ticket office functions as micro-setting that pressures choice: its decay invites exploration, its ceiling hides the clock, and its flickering lights signal supernatural thresholds. Sensory details (sawdust, popcorn, brass tarnish) are selective and POV-filtered through Marcus’s technician gaze. The mainspring barrel and dust patterns constrain action meaningfully. However, the environment doesn’t *force* a trade-off—Marcus could leave unscathed, slightly weakening 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.3)
    The glass orchard library and swirling clouds aren’t backdrop—they constrain and charge every choice. The frost patterns guide discovery; the bottle emerges from architectural rupture; the clouds cradle her fall and speak truths. Crucially, the setting culminates in the living library, its pulsing walls mirroring the whisper’s light—environment directly shapes closure. Sensory detail is selective (shimmering panes, rustling awakenings) and filtered through Elara’s craft.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.3)
    The baroque asteroid isn’t backdrop—it’s active pressure: obsidian canals, gilded spires, and light storms constrain access and enable the ritual. The crystal shard (micro-setting) charges the climax by refracting storm-light into visions. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (“torrents of luminescence,” “tiny rainbows”), filtered through Elara’s poetic bias. The Hall of Reflections’ covered mirrors directly shape her method, making setting inseparable from tactic and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    The resonance chamber workshop and Covenant of Rust aren’t backdrop—they constrain choice. The box must be worked on-site; rust recedes only when balance is restored. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias’s craft: he notices ticking gears, iron scent, red dust—not generic “mood.” Final image of dawn melody ties setting to closure. Only minor deduction: river’s “whispered warnings” lack tactile consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is vividly rendered through selective, character-filtered detail: rust, petrichor, glowing lagoon. The subterranean lagoon charges the final image and constrains choice (the compass sinks; she doesn’t retrieve it). However, the factory basement and tunnel remain somewhat generic, functioning more as atmospheric conduits than lived-in spaces with tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    The storm-tossed archway functions effectively as micro-setting: it thresholds known/unknown, channels wind/salt as sensory pressure, and houses the hidden passage. The lantern slide doubles as tool and recurring object, constraining navigation once GPS fails and charging the final image when paired with its twin. Weather and stone textures are selective and POV-filtered (“scent of salt and storm,” “weathered by centuries”). However, the chamber’s sudden appearance lacks spatial foreshadowing, slightly weakening environmental causality.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is vividly rendered—the amber pavilion, cathedral’s etched glass, melting snow—but only the postcards and cathedral windows actively shape meaning. The amber pavilion frames the story yet exerts no pressure on choices; it’s atmospheric bookending, not a constraining environment. The cathedral’s light does charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate partially, but the pavilion remains decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.1)
    The floating library and obsidian lagoon are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (shadow “like a dark whisper,” lagoon as “mirror of the sky”). However, the setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint—the zeppelin enables arrival but doesn’t shape tactics, and the lagoon’s properties remain mystical, not mechanistic. The diary and debris are handled, but the environment doesn’t force meaningful choices.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.6)
    Paper-Lantern Cove functions as micro-setting: its decay mirrors thematic stakes, and its transformation charges the ending. Sensory detail is selective (gravel crunch, amber warmth, lantern glow) and filtered through Elara’s alchemical gaze. The cove constrains choice—it must be reimagined, not restored—and directly fuels the climax. However, spatial choreography lacks granularity beyond “shore” and “center.”

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.3)
    The skyscraper orchard constrains choice—it’s Elara’s only sanctuary and archive—and charges the final image: golden light on soil where emotions are rooted. Sensory specificity (“fruit that hummed,” “wax cylinder warm to the touch”) filters through her oath-scribe priorities. The foghorn’s silence alters perception, narrowing focus to the garden’s response. Setting functions as micro-setting: every tree, stone, and symbol directly enables decipherment.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    The icebound atrium functions as micro-setting: its frozen archway constrains access to the vortex, and starlight enables symbol activation. Post-transition, the wild landscape charges the closure by embodying restored balance. Sensory detail is selective (crackling ice, glowing feather) and filtered through Elara’s urgency. The acorn cap—a tool-as-setting—directly enables the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sanctuary functions as both macro- and micro-setting: its altitude, solitude, and ancient tower shape Elias’s access to wind patterns and spiritual insight. Crucially, the bell rope—a tool-as-setting—constrains choice (he must climb, touch, pull) and charges the final image (now “a testament to the power of listening”). Sensory detail is selective (frayed rope, warmth, hum) and filtered through Elias’s professional curiosity. However, the setting doesn’t actively oppose or complicate—it enables—limiting its pressure role just enough to miss the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    The station functions as a potent micro-setting: its humming machinery, skeletal frame, and observation deck directly enable Lira’s discovery and contemplation. The yellow lantern glass acts as a constrained tool that charges the final image. Descriptions are vivid yet economical (“primal elegance,” “stains of countless spills”), filtered through Lira’s awe. However, the setting doesn’t actively pressure choices—it facilitates rather than obstructs, missing the 9+ gate requiring constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned beekeeping oasis functions as a potent micro-setting: its skeletal gardens, broken greenhouse, and hidden well directly supply symbols, water, and spatial logic for the ritual. The stained glass box—a recurring object—constrains choice (he must carry it, study it, use it in the ritual) and charges the final image as it shimmers in moonlight. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., “faint hum of bees long gone”), avoiding tourist cataloging. Yet the wasteland remains slightly generic; more tactile specificity in decay could push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    The emerald silo functions as a potent micro-setting: its weathered metal, shadows, and hidden chamber directly constrain and enable action (e.g., housing the core, concealing the temporal weaver). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“whispering pines,” “crackled with energy”), avoiding white-room syndrome. However, the garage sale and town remain lightly sketched; only the silo and urn fragment achieve full environmental integration with the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt lagoon after rain functions as micro-setting: its reflective surface mirrors thematic concerns, while damp sand and salt-laced air constrain tactile choices (tracing, kneeling, repairing). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—wet earth, iridescent feather, frayed string—all serving atmosphere and action. Crucially, the lagoon charges the final image: the kite ascends *against* its cobalt backdrop, making beauty visible through contrast. No white-room syndrome; every detail serves texture or tension.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    The temple orchard—with living stone pillars and copper-guided oaks—is vividly specific and functions as micro-setting: it supplies tools (wire, diary), constrains action (branch-wrapping), and charges the final image (glowing carvings, whispering leaves). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias’s botanical focus. However, the setting doesn’t actively pressure choices beyond enabling them; it’s more collaborator than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “rainwashed tower in spring” functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its fusion architecture demands interpretation, its path channels pilgrimage, its summit chamber forces confrontation. Sensory details (“wet stone and blooming flowers,” “bronze quiet”) are selective, POV-filtered, and tonally resonant. The amber and footprints integrate setting with action. Only minor deduction: “overgrown sculpture path” lacks tactile specificity beyond visual cue.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is vividly rendered—the blooming jetty, gloom-hill, salt-and-decay air—and filtered through the coachman’s perception. The jetty functions as micro-setting: its graying wood and wildflowers directly inform his action (fertilizing). However, while atmosphere is strong, the environment doesn’t actively constrain choices; it reflects rather than pressures. The “after the reef died” backdrop adds poignancy but doesn’t alter tactics, limiting Q3’s reach into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rustveil’s scrapyard setting isn’t backdrop—it’s active texture: corroded metal, burning wire, skeletal ruins shape perception and movement. The phonograph factory’s dust and hum constrain action and charge the revelation. Crucially, the wax leaf functions as micro-setting, its changing state directly altering the final image. Sensory hierarchy aligns with Elias’s bloodhound POV—smell first, then sound, then light—lending authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    The time dilation observation deck functions effectively as micro-setting: its neglected metallic surfaces, gilded compass rose, and echoed silence directly charge the final image and constrain Elara’s ritual. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—she notices patina, hum, pulsing voids—not tourist cataloging. The setting evolves subtly (dawn light re-gilding the compass), and the “temporally stretched expanse” informs perception without exposition. However, the environment doesn’t actively *constrain* a tactical choice beyond providing a sketching surface, missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    The icebound spire is vividly rendered with sensory specificity—crystalline peaks, echoing footsteps, shifting walls—and functions as micro-setting that pressures choice (labyrinth navigation, chess trial). The environment directly enables the climax and charges the final image: Kael atop the restored spire, wind in his cloak. Ice-carved corridors and obsidian pieces reflect internal stakes without overt symbolism. However, the setting doesn’t constrain tactics beyond generic obstacle-course logic; its magic remains decorative rather than rule-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    The whispering gallery functions as a potent micro-setting: its acoustics, etched floor, and central chessboard directly shape character choices and thematic resonance. The missing pawns and walking patterns aren’t backdrop—they’re active constraints that enable the ritual of unbinding. Sensory detail is selective (echoes, grooves, harmonious whispers) and filtered through Elara’s longing for authenticity. However, the setting doesn’t *foreclose* options—it invites—so it charges but doesn’t constrain the final image enough for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    The labyrinthine bookstore functions as both macro-setting and micro-setting, its shifting shelves responding to Elara’s inner state and constraining her navigation until the final circular clearing—a spatial manifestation of wholeness. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (stained-glass light, groaning shelves, warm stone), filtered through Elara’s perception. However, the mountain-scale premise remains ornamental; the setting’s vastness doesn’t meaningfully alter tactics beyond atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    The platinum labyrinth and tapestry act as micro-settings that constrain choice—Elara must decode threads to proceed—and charge the final image (glowing thread as revelation). Sensory detail is selective: cobblestones, worn chess piece, pale sky—all filtered through Elara’s anxious perception. The “time-frozen” atmosphere mirrors her stasis without overt symbolism. Only minor deduction: “woven hush” risks abstraction but is grounded in echoing footsteps and thunder.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    The towers of bone, canyon of echoes, and pale spire form a mythic micro-setting that actively constrains and charges every beat—the bone towers absorb sound, the echoes fragment truth, the spire refracts soul. These elements aren’t backdrop; they’re causal agents that shape Lira’s method (poetry to combat silence) and outcome (refraction into healing). The final image—mist parting to reveal a path—is directly enabled by the setting’s logic. Only narrowly misses 9+ due to slight overreliance on visual metaphor without tactile or olfactory grounding in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting: the acid sea pressures urgency, the groaning gears mirror emotional tension, and the workshop’s decay reflects thematic stakes. Crucially, the environment charges the final image—Elara finds home in a scarred sanctuary. Sensory detail (oil, rust, hissing sea) is selective and POV-filtered, though the “centuries-old statue” lacks tactile specificity during key interaction beats.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    The coastal cave network is rendered with precise, selective detail (stalactites like chandeliers, mineral-rich drips) that filters through Elara’s painterly perception. The pool’s mirror effect directly charges the final image by enabling her reflection and artistic epiphany. However, the setting doesn’t actively constrain choices—the boulder blockage is circumvented without consequence, and the oasis serves more as backdrop than crucible. Still, the micro-setting of the painted seashell and easel grounds her craft in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt lighthouse, dawn light, and garden scent are economically rendered and POV-filtered (Elias notices jasmine because it contrasts the heat wave). The vial cork functions as micro-setting—its vibrations constrain choice (he follows the scent) and charge the final image (clutched in his pocket as he returns). Weather and time pressure decisions: cool air enables movement after oppressive heat. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography from tower to shore to grove is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    The starlit signal station functions as micro-setting: its ruined hydraulics force Mara’s ingenuity, and its cliffside perch mirrors her liminal role. The censer foot and beacon are tactile extensions of place, not mere props. Sensory detail is selective—wind, bronze patina, hum of machinery—and filtered through Mara’s urgency. Crucially, the setting constrains choice (scavenging ruins) and charges the final image (beacon shining against vast loss).

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    The hanging orchard isn’t backdrop—it constrains choice (damp soil for truffles, ravine isolation) and charges closure (its “fractured grace” mirrors Elias’s psyche; void after removal, calm after return). Storm-battered setting informs character’s caution and relic’s concealment. Sensory detail is selective (damp air, golden sunbeam, earthy truffle scent) and filtered through Elias’s professional attention. Just shy of 9+ because the ravine doesn’t actively alter tactics beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    The opal dock, mist, and nautical twilight form a cohesive micro-setting that mirrors Elias’s liminal state. Sensory detail is selective (cold wood, salt-and-Edelweiss scent) and filtered through his obsessive attention to gaps. The setting constrains choice: mist limits visibility, forcing reliance on touch and memory; the dock’s linear structure funnels his investigation toward the journal. However, the environment doesn’t actively pressure tactics beyond mood—it charges the closure image without altering physical options.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is vividly rendered—the cobblestone city, bioluminescent cavern, violet-sky realm—and filtered through Elias’s cartographic sensibility. The blooming cavern charges the archway encounter, and the creek’s rise creates mild environmental tension. Crucially, the matrix chip (micro-setting) constrains choice by triggering the ants’ path. Final image ties shop’s maps to renewed purpose, fulfilling the 9+ gate condition.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting functions as active pressure: the ember grotto’s pulsing walls, metallic air, and crystalline tunnels mirror/internalize the queen’s emotional and thematic arc. The cobalt grotto above clouds isn’t just backdrop—it isolates her, heightens stakes, and its “lacy menace” evolves from atmosphere to active antagonist. However, the environment doesn’t *constrain* a tactical choice (e.g., no physical barrier forces a decision), missing the 9+ gate. Still, sensory detail is vivid, selective, and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ember nexus is richly evoked through synesthetic twilight hues and pulsing rhythm, functioning as micro-setting that charges the final image. The nautilus shell—a tactile, recurring object—constrains nothing but deeply colors perception and ritual. Spatial choreography is clear: hands clutch, fingers brush, glow envelops. Yet the setting never actively pressures choice—it enables wonder without obstacle, missing a 9+ gate by lacking constraint on tactics despite vivid specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mountain ranger cabin functions as micro-setting: pine-scented walls, creaking floor, and window overlooking clouds create tactile immediacy that grounds Elara’s dissociation. The birch bark scroll—a recurring object—constrains choice (she must interpret it) and charges the final image (glowing sentence). Sensory detail narrows appropriately under stress (e.g., frayed edges, faint glow), then expands in the star-strewn expanse. The environment doesn’t just mirror—it enables the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    The water clock shop functions as a potent micro-setting: brass gears, fogged windows, and the drip of repaired time create a sanctuary where silence speaks. Crucially, the birthing clamp screw—a tactile object—constrains choice (Elara’s decision to engage Mira) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: Elara notices texture, sound, warmth—not scent—aligning with her disability. The morning fog evolves causally, lifting as understanding dawns, avoiding static backdrop syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.3)
    The floating rock tea ceremony platform functions as a charged micro-setting that constrains choice—its suspension above an abyss literalizes Elara’s emotional liminality. The crow quill’s physical behavior (crystallizing under stress) directly alters tactics, forcing her to regulate breath to maintain tool functionality. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: mist, rain, steam, and obsidian sheen filter through her rune-scholar POV without tourist cataloging. The setting evolves causally with the storm and recedes with it, culminating in a cleansed world that mirrors her internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sheet music archive and doomed orchard function as micro-settings that constrain and charge choice: the archive houses memory, the orchard embodies loss. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—aged paper, flickering lamp, blooming ghost-scent—all filtered through Elara’s grief. The perfume bottle acts as object-as-setting, its physical presence guiding the climax. Final image of trees standing taller after forgiveness directly ties environment to emotional transformation, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ancient temple library functions as a dynamic micro-setting: walls shift, air shimmers, and the mural pulses, directly enabling the witness’s realizations. The softcover dictionary—a recurring object—constrains choice by offering context-shifting definitions that guide action. Sensory detail (dust in light, humming shelves) is vivid and filtered through the witness’s purpose. Final image charges closure: dictionary merges with mural, completing spiral arbitration.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting functions as micro-setting: the hydraulic clock, stone floor, mist, and peaks aren’t backdrop but active constraints shaping Elias’s attention and choices. The “fjord quiet” and “razor edges” of gears merge environment with theme. Brass gleam, worn key, and parchment texture are selectively rendered through Elias’s professional bias. However, the station’s function (“measure the horizon’s curve”) remains abstractly stated rather than tactically integrated into his final insight, slightly limiting 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.1)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is not backdrop but active micro-setting: its glow intensifies with narrative pressure, its labyrinthine rows shape navigation, and its “deep blue” clearing hosts the climax. Crucially, the environment charges the final image—the farm “shifts,” light brightens, air warms—as Elara accepts the mushroom, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Sensory detail (damp soil, humming fungi, cold breath) is selective, POV-filtered, and woven into movement. Spatial choreography remains precise throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rainwashed library functions as a micro-setting that charges every beat: damp stone, old-book scent, distorting windows, and echoing aisles shape Elara’s perception and movement. The candle lantern—a tool—is handled repeatedly, its mica pane refracting light into “intricate patterns,” directly constraining how she sees truth. Weather (drizzle), season (midsummer), and architecture cohere into a tactile sanctuary that mirrors internal stakes. Final image ties environment to closure: the glowing pane becomes a canvas for future stories.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    The subway utility tunnel functions as a micro-setting that actively pressures choice—its dampness, rust, and hum mirror Eli’s emotional state and constrain his actions (e.g., the booth as sole refuge). The glass harmonica disc, treated as a tool-object, charges the final image when it hums in his hand during the climactic call. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (slick walls, muted thud of the disc), avoiding tourist cataloging. The environment doesn’t just reflect theme—it enables the turn: without this tunnel’s liminal acoustics, the melody couldn’t bridge time.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    The blooming jetty at twilight is vividly rendered with sensory specificity—weathered planks, jasmine scent, golden light—and evolves subtly as twilight deepens. Crucially, the setting functions as micro-setting: it constrains Elara’s work (outdoors, fading light) and charges the final image (“last light faded”). The jetty is not just backdrop but a symbolic witness that accrues emotional weight. However, it never actively pressures a tactical choice beyond mood; its role remains atmospheric rather than instrumental.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.1)
    The ivy-choked station isn’t backdrop—it’s a micro-setting that constrains and mirrors: its decay reflects Elara’s isolation, its transformation enacts her internal shift. The moon rock and clock are tactile anchors handled with purpose. Sensory detail (damp wood, cool stone) is selective, POV-filtered, and woven into action. The environment directly charges the final image: overgrowth recedes as connection blooms, then returns as she departs renewed.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ultrasonic forest functions as a micro-setting that actively shapes perception and movement—its hum guides Elara, its silence marks transformation. The platinum ring and liquid-silence pool are purposeful, recurring objects that charge the climax. Sensory detail is vivid and non-visual, filtered through touch and vibration, aligning with POV. The setting constrains nothing physically but deeply informs emotional and thematic stakes, satisfying the 9+ gate via charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    The gravitational anomaly functions as micro-setting: its warped physics enable time-fragment immersion and constrain Elara’s actions (floating, perceiving temporal shards). The pen—a recurring object—charges the final image when it glows then cools, signaling completion. Sensory detail is selective (crunching earth, humming void), filtered through Elara’s professional perception, though the anomaly’s rules remain vague.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    The luminous harbor functions as micro-setting: its stillness pressures Elara’s solitude, and moonlight refracting through the camera lens directly enables the climax. Sensory detail is selective (silver light, humming brass, vibrating air) and filtered through Elara’s perception, avoiding tourist cataloging. However, the environment doesn’t constrain a choice—it reflects rather than shapes action—preventing 9+ despite vivid atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    The archive functions effectively as micro-setting: corridors, chambers, dust, stone floors ground the search. Sensory detail is selective (frayed tapestry, slashed canvas, ethereal glow) and filtered through the arsonist’s reverence. However, the environment never constrains choice—it supplies clues passively rather than imposing obstacles. The final chamber’s “ethereal glow” feels decorative, not causal, missing the 9+ gate requiring setting to charge the ending image through constraint or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sound wave garden and auric lagoon are richly rendered with synesthetic specificity (“petal hummed melodies,” “liquid memory”), and the setting actively shapes the climax—the lagoon responds to Elara’s drumming, enabling her breakthrough. However, while atmosphere is immersive, the environment doesn’t *constrain* choice in a way that would push this into the 9-band; it facilitates rather than pressures. Still, the recurring sensory logic supports theme and closure without static description.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.1)
    The shipping container labyrinth isn’t backdrop—it actively resists Eli’s progress, groaning and shifting, making spatial navigation a core tension. The geomagnetic storm pulses through metal walls, altering perception and raising stakes. Crucially, the setting constrains choice: only someone who reads walks and listens to echoes could navigate this maze. The final image—stepping into otherworldly light—is charged by the very environment that once embodied isolation.

    The cobalt dock, rain-slick planks, and twilight create vivid, selective atmosphere filtered through the guardian’s perception. The dental mirror functions as micro-setting—it constrains how truth is revealed and directly charges the closure when the stranger sees stars in its reflection. Weather and spatial choreography (dock edge, dangling feet) are tactile and purposeful. Deduction only because the cobalt hue, while evocative, doesn’t actively constrain choices beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt library and magnetic grotto are vividly rendered with sensory specificity and consistent atmosphere. However, neither setting constrains choice nor alters tactics—Elias moves through them as backdrops, not crucibles. The grotto inspires but doesn’t impede or enable; it’s a mood amplifier, not a micro-setting that charges the final image through interaction. Descriptions are lush but inert narratively.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sublittoral fringe functions as micro-setting: its wet sand, emerald shafts, and silt directly shape action (wading, rowing, island emergence). Sensory detail is vivid yet selective—salt scent, cool scrimshaw—and filtered through Elara’s laborer POV (“hauling crates,” “unloading without spilling seawater”). The disappearing island charges the climax by existing only for “the right heart,” constraining access. Final image ties setting to theme: water reclaims sand just as Elara integrates sea and self.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    The farmhouse and turbines function as micro-setting: the shadowed interior resists artificial cheer, while turbine hum mirrors the mandate’s relentless pressure. Sensory detail is selective (brittle bouquet, knife on wood, pale sun on blades) and filtered through Elara’s grief. The setting constrains choice—she retreats here to whittle truth—and charges closure: the heart placed beside flowers gains resonance from spatial context. No white-room syndrome; geography remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the humming quartz colonnade and frozen lake constrain and catalyze the poet’s act—touching quartz triggers dissolution, ice shards reflect cobalt light during recitation. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (crunching boots, cobalt glow, suspended ice), filtered through poetic perception. However, the environment doesn’t *foreclose* options—it enables transcendence without resistance, missing a 9+ gate where setting imposes meaningful constraint. Final image charges closure, but spatial choreography lacks tactile negotiation beyond initial approach.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.3)
    The courtyard functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: glass shards reflect light Elias can’t see but feels; plants are lexicon, not decoration; the bench holds the reed tongue like an offering. Sensory hierarchy privileges touch and sound over sight, aligning with POV. The recurring concertina and glass vessels charge the final image—Elias’s monochrome canvas “holding the courtyard’s soul.” Every detail serves texture, pressure, or closure; no white-room syndrome or tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    The laboratory functions as a potent micro-setting—shelves of lost sounds, golden shadows, clutter—that constrains and enables Elara’s work. The carbide lamp lens, a tactile object-as-setting, directly charges the climax. Sensory detail is selective (whispers, hums, laughter) and filtered through Elara’s auditory focus. The final image (“buzzed with the energy of renewal”) reweights the space from sanctuary to catalyst, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory functions as a potent micro-setting: its star-filtered glass, disused telescope, and “timeless” aura directly charge Elara’s actions (e.g., choosing stillness, leaving origami). The “genuinely artificial” walls enable the climactic glow, constraining reality just enough to make the magical moment feel organic. Sensory details (scent of blooms, brass polish) are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft functions as micro-setting: its verticality, glass, and inherited artifacts constrain action and charge the final image. The measuring tape and onyx cards are tactile extensions of environment. Rain’s Morse-like rhythm mirrors Elara’s decoding impulse. Crucially, the loft’s sanctuary status intensifies the intrusion of Mira’s knock—space shapes narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    The archive functions as a dynamic micro-setting—the shifting layout and worn tiles directly constrain Elara’s discovery and charge the climax. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (saffron veil against muted stone, prismatic light). However, while vivid, the setting doesn’t *force* a tactical shift beyond observation; it enables rather than pressures, missing the 9+ gate requiring constraint of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    The blooming library is evocatively rendered with synesthetic detail (“shimmered like captured sunsets,” “scent of aged paper”), and the river stone functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—it grounds Elara and enables the metamorphosis. However, the setting never actively pressures tactics; it remains atmospheric rather than instrumental. Final image charges the blooms (“glowing brighter”), satisfying the 9+ gate narrowly, but spatial choreography lacks tactile navigation beyond passive observation.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    The misty workshop under stars is vividly rendered with cedar, earth, and starlight, functioning as a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail aligns with Elara’s reflective state, though it rarely constrains her choices—she moves freely without spatial or environmental resistance. The setting’s atmospheric consistency supports tone but doesn’t actively pressure decisions; its power is evocative, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    The quiet tower at dawn and the frosted hourglass function as micro-settings that charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate threshold partially. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (fogged glass, ivy’s hum), and the cavern’s glowing crystals pulse with thematic resonance. However, the basement tunnel lacks tactile specificity—it reads more as metaphor than navigable space, slightly weakening spatial choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    The projection booth functions as a potent micro-setting: dust, moonlight, and outdated equipment aren’t backdrop but active constraints that shape Elara’s tactile engagement. The film strip itself acts as object-as-setting, charging the final image when tucked into her bag. Sensory detail is selective (worn railing, hushed thunder hum) and filtered through Elara’s psychometric attention. The theater’s “humming walls” at the end reconfigure the space from relic to living archive, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.1)
    The aurora-lit archway functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—its symbols shift in response to Lira’s ritual, making it an active threshold rather than backdrop. The astrolabe constrains choice: its needle guides her attention to falling stars, shaping her method. Sensory detail is selective (cold brass, emerald-violet aurora, hum of silver thread) and filtered through Lira’s cosmic sensitivity. The setting evolves causally (archway glows brighter as ritual intensifies), fulfilling the 9+ gate by constraining tactics and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glowing dune functions as micro-setting: its luminescence, warmth, and sentient pull directly enable and pressure Mara’s descent. The chess clock and charm are tactile, recurring objects that charge the final image—their physical states evolve (frozen → ticking, inert → warm). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (sand “sinking,” air “charged”). Yet the dune’s rules feel decorative; its “bloom” doesn’t constrain choice beyond aesthetic guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.1)
    The mechanical rainforest is not backdrop but active micro-setting: cogs-as-leaves, heartbeat-synced flowers, and uphill streams directly shape Eamon’s perception and choices. The small gear functions as object-as-setting, constraining the climax when it slots into the machine. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—wind’s melody triggers the turning point—and the final image (light revealing “the universe itself”) reweights every prior detail. Vivid, tactile, and thematically charged without over-description.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    The veiled ridgeway, twilight, and mist are vividly rendered and filtered through Mara’s perception, avoiding tourist cataloguing. The ticket punch and ferry function as micro-settings that constrain choice—the punch enables the climax. However, the environment doesn’t actively shape tactics beyond mood; it reflects rather than pressures. Lacks the causal environmental constraint needed for 9+ despite strong atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt fortress and snow establish tone immediately; the piano bench bolt functions as micro-setting that constrains ritual and charges the ending. Sensory detail (yellowed keys, rusted bolt, eerie cobalt light) is selective and purposeful. The chamber’s carvings deepen atmosphere without stalling momentum. Only minor deduction: the fortress’s physical layout remains slightly abstract beyond key nodes.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ancient temple library functions as micro-setting: its crumbling tomes and whispering scrolls enable Elara’s method and pressure her choices. Dust, stone, and ink are tactile and recurring, culminating in the pellet clattering on the floor—a charged final image. Sensory detail is selective (beams of light, humming stones) and filtered through Elara’s reverence. Only narrowly misses 9+ because the setting doesn’t actively constrain a pivotal choice beyond providing books.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sea level monitoring station functions effectively as micro-setting, its automated hum and metal floor grounding Elara’s actions. The torn atlas page and rising seas charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate condition. Sensory detail is selective (pale sun, rough paper, smudged ink) and filtered through Elara’s professional gaze. However, the station itself doesn’t constrain a choice—it’s backdrop rather than crucible—limiting full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned spaceport is economically rendered through selective, character-filtered detail: rusted hulks, cracked concrete, fractured skylights. The amber “margin of daylight” evolves into actual dusk, tightening time meaningfully. Crucially, the setting charges the final image—stars visible through broken skylights reframe ruin as possibility. However, the environment doesn’t *constrain* choice (e.g., debris blocking paths); it reflects rather than pressures, capping Q3 just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    The volcanic hot springs function as micro-setting: steam “like ghosts,” bubbling heat contrasting cool caves, and earth’s fire meeting water all charge the ritual. The environment directly enables the unsealing—its liminal energy syncs with the embryo’s pulse. Final image of the kite fluttering in wind ties setting to theme. However, while vivid, the setting doesn’t *constrain* choice beyond mood—it supports but doesn’t force tactics, missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    The arboretum functions as both setting and micro-setting—the cliff edge directly pressures Zara’s choice, and jasmine/salt wind contrast inner/outer states without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is coherent: paths, bench, cliff all track cleanly. However, the setting doesn’t *constrain* tactics beyond the initial slip—it enables reflection but doesn’t force a trade-off. Vivid sensory detail serves atmosphere more than causality, missing the 9+ gate for environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.1)
    The forgotten library inside a lighthouse is not backdrop but active crucible: salt-laced air, groaning shelves, creaking walls, and the unreachable lantern room all shape Elara’s perception and choices. The tarot box and cards function as micro-setting—handled, scattered, reassembled—and directly charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (paper, salt, splintered wood) and filtered through Elara’s artistic sensibility. Crucially, the setting constrains her initial paralysis and later enables her ascent, fulfilling the 9+ gate by altering tactics and framing closure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    The wind-carved encampment and desert light establish atmosphere early and consistently, filtered through Elara’s tracker POV (“muted colors of the desert,” “wind-sculpted sand”). The hummingbird drone functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (she follows its path) and charging the final image (returns to wrist as symbol of earned trust). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though celestial diagrams feel slightly generic. Final horizon glow ties setting to theme without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “echoing library under snow” functions as a potent micro-setting: its cold, silence, and cryogenic archives directly constrain mood, pace, and emotional register. Frosted glass, icy walls, and muffled footsteps are tactile and purposeful. The setting charges the final image—Elara stepping into snow-covered night—as the library “judges” her, making environment inseparable from thematic weight. However, it never actively blocks or enables a tactical choice; it atmospherically pressures but doesn’t alter options.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glass-domed desert rose farm functions as both setting and micro-setting, constraining choices (sanctuary vs. exposure) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—the scent of blooms contrasts the wasteland, reinforcing theme. The airship scrap reappears meaningfully, its engraved “quiet” tying object to ethos. However, spatial choreography lacks granularity; we never feel the dome’s physical limits during threat.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “sound wave garden” functions as a micro-setting that actively shapes tactics—Kael navigates via its shifting vibrations—and the rail spike constrains choice by serving as a key only revealed through embodied interaction. Sensory detail is selective (silence with voice, feral lullaby) and POV-filtered; the shimmering pool, moonlight, and erratic stars cohere spatially and tonally. The setting charges the final image: the spike’s glow tethers the echo, making environment inseparable from closure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (glass dome, brass telescopes, echoing halls) and filters through Eleanor’s professional attention. The setting constrains choice by housing the misaligned telescopes, which catalyze her investigation. Yet it doesn’t actively pressure tactics—the clouds and height are atmospheric, not functional—and the final image uses the dome symbolically without spatial choreography affecting outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    The laboratory functions as a potent micro-setting: glass chambers, humming machines, and the amber constrain Elara’s reality and charge the ending. The “folding time” isn’t just backdrop—it informs the story’s rhythm and the logic of the letters’ discovery. Every detail serves atmosphere or theme, with no white-room vagueness. The amber’s glow intensifying at peace directly ties environment to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    The whispering grotto functions as a micro-setting that actively pressures choice—the mist thickens in response to the tile flake, the tiles fall silent, and spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. Sensory detail is selective (coolness of the flake, curling sand lines) and filtered through Elara’s perception. The setting charges the final image: the lifted mist mirrors Elara’s clarified purpose. However, the environment doesn’t constrain tactics beyond mood—it enables revelation more than resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ancient plaza and shattered sky are economically rendered with tactile specificity (acrid tang, ash-clung dust) that filters through Elara’s POV. The mosaic functions as micro-setting: its chipped tesserae constrain her attention and charge the final image. Weather/sky evolves subtly to mirror emotional shift (“soften[ed]”). Yet the minaret remains ornamental—seen but not interacted with—and spatial choreography lacks precise grounding (e.g., plaza size, proximity of ruins), limiting environmental pressure on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mystic orchard garden is not backdrop but active crucible: the dry fountain, whispering trees, and hedge maze constrain and enable Mara’s ritual. Sensory detail is filtered through her synesthesia, making description inseparable from perception. The setting evolves causally—shadows deepen, flowers bloom brighter—as emotional stakes shift, culminating in a final image where dawn light recharges the space with hope, directly shaping closure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.0)
    The light painting studio functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: adjustable LEDs, mirrors, long-exposure cameras shape Elara’s tactics. The muscovite geode sliver—handled repeatedly—charges the final image, its fractal shimmer echoing mental pathways. Sensory detail is selective (ethereal hum, coolness on skin) and filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias toward the unseen.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    The coastal cave network functions as micro-setting: salt-damp air, bioluminescent algae, and stone contours shape Elara’s actions and perceptions. Sensory detail is selective and profession-filtered (e.g., tracing walls as a map-maker). The elm fossil constrains the final choice—its placement triggers the chamber’s light—and charges the ending. However, the setting doesn’t foreclose options or impose tangible stakes beyond atmosphere; it supports but doesn’t pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    The amber warehouse functions as micro-setting: its silence, dust, and glow shape Elara’s ritual and emotional tenor. The cliffs recur meaningfully, framing both opening and closing. Sensory detail is selective (humming jar, creaking wood) and filtered through Elara’s focus. However, the setting never constrains a tactical choice—it atmospherically supports but doesn’t pressure action, missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zephyr Bluff’s mist, snow, and pines are vividly rendered and filtered through Elara’s perception. The pillbox functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (she nearly uses the pill) and charging the final image (slipped into pocket, unused). However, the bluff itself doesn’t actively pressure decisions beyond atmosphere—it’s evocative but not causally active. Sensory detail is selective but leans visual; tactile and auditory cues could deepen immersion under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.1)
    The fog-bound river crossing functions as both barrier and bridge, directly shaping the coachman’s perceptual stance and the story’s thematic core. The yarn needle—a micro-setting object—constrains interpretation and charges the final image when it transitions from “key” to “reminder.” Sensory detail is selective (ticking gutters, silver gleam, churning waters) and filtered through the coachman’s profession and intent. The environment actively participates in the closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    The scorched wasteland and crumbling hives establish stark contrast to the oasis’s resistance, and the lantern glass functions as micro-setting that charges every key moment. Sensory detail is selective—sunlight, dust, thrumming vibration—and filtered through Elara’s potter’s attention. The setting actively guides her method (following sun patterns) and culminates in the healed garden, fulfilling the 9+ gate: environment constrains choice and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    The harbor, fire escape, and potted plants form a micro-setting that reflects Elara’s ethos—beauty in overlooked spaces. The lantern light, moonlight, and water shimmer aren’t mere backdrop; they actively shape mood and symbolize her core motivation (“reflect light into dark corners”). The lockmaster’s lantern echoes the tooth’s design, charging the final image with visual reciprocity. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., breeze on leaves, sharp edges of the tooth).

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tidal library isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures Elena: shelves shift with celestial tides, air thickens as she descends, walls close in during the labyrinth. Crucially, the setting constrains her path (only the hum guides her) and charges the climax: the stone circle’s hum *is* the library’s voice. The brass sundial and crystalline orb function as micro-settings—their physical properties (reflectivity, resonance) directly enable plot turns. Final image ties setting to theme: clouds parting as she steps out shows the world now accessible because she embodies the library’s balance.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lotus temple and lily pond are vividly rendered and function as micro-setting: the pond reflects both temple and Elara, visually reinforcing unity. Rain-scented air and dragonfly details serve Elara’s whimsical perception without tourist detachment. Crucially, the setting constrains nothing—Elara could perform her ritual anywhere. Yet the final image (“temple continued to rise… testament to the beauty of unity”) charges the closure by echoing her realization, satisfying the 9+ gate narrowly despite lack of tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    The university radio station functions effectively as micro-setting: vintage mics, tangled wires, and outdated equipment ground the scene and supply the subwoofer used in Elara’s countermeasure. Sensory detail is selective (hum of equipment, ethereal sunset glow) and filtered through Elara’s professional attention. However, the setting doesn’t *constrain* her final choice—it enables it—and thus narrowly misses the 9-band gate requiring environmental pressure that alters tactics or charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    The shadowed nexus functions as micro-setting: its narrow alleys and shifting walls directly constrain Elara’s movement and amplify her phobia, while the crystalline shard’s glow charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (scent of stone, vibrating air) and filtered through POV urgency. The recurring compass and organ sound serve as environmental extensions that evolve with pressure. However, the setting occasionally veers into lyrical abstraction (“heavens whisper secrets”) without grounding action.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    The quarry isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting: mist obscures identity (amplifying Elara’s face blindness), gravel crunch alerts the figure, jagged edges mirror emotional fragmentation. The ribbon and lancing tool function as environmental extensions that constrain choice (weapon vs. art). Final image of quarry-as-portrait fulfills the 9+ gate: setting charges closure by becoming the subject of unification. Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    The weather station functions as a charged micro-setting: its broken machinery, fogged domes, and atmospheric map directly constrain and enable Elara’s actions. The jet stream shift isn’t just backdrop—it tightens the timeline and reorients the map’s meaning. Sensory detail (ozone, salt-stained pages, humming walls) is selective and POV-filtered. However, the environment doesn’t *force* a tactical pivot beyond what the journals already provide, narrowly missing the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting operates as micro-setting via the glass flake and mountain pullout, both constraining choice and charging closure. The flake’s shifting images align with terrain features, turning geography into active decoder. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—golden light, cool breeze, thinning air—evolving with Bridge-Song’s movement. Final clearing reweights earlier stillness into revelation, satisfying the 9+ gate despite slightly generic “overgrowth” description.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned circus train is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting: ivy, peeling paint, territorial markers all guide Elias’s investigation. The foreign bills and dusky light charge the final moment. Sensory detail is selective and mood-aligned, though tactile interaction with the environment remains limited. Crucially, the train constrains the narrative’s thematic closure—without it, the story collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    The celestial mapping observatory functions as a potent micro-setting: its telescopes, dome, and starlight directly enable decoding and mirror Elara’s internal state. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—cool air, flickering variable stars, frayed telegram edges—all filtered through her professional and emotional priorities. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: dawn light over the horizon contrasts midnight solace, marking transformation. Environment constrains no tactical choice, but deeply shapes atmosphere and closure resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cursed lake and swirling orchard vortex are vividly rendered with multi-sensory specificity (otherworldly glow, scent of decay, moss-covered ground), and crucially, the setting constrains choice—the vortex demands surrender, shaping Eira’s dance. The flesh-eating seed functions as micro-setting, its latent power requiring ritual handling. Final image of crisp, clean air reweights the earlier oppressive atmosphere, charging closure. Only slight deduction for minor overreliance on visual descriptors in mid-section.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cobalt glade and maze topiary function as micro-settings that charge the final image—the clipping’s glow, shifting hedges, and ethereal clearing all constrain perception and guide action. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered (e.g., “thorns catching on her cloak,” “leaves etched with forgotten tales”). However, the setting doesn’t actively pressure Elara into difficult choices; it reveals secrets rather than obstructs or demands sacrifice, missing the 9+ gate for causal constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.3)
    The catacomb orchard isn’t backdrop—it actively resists (roots twisting into warning patterns) and enables (walls for stories, cracks for seeds). Sensory detail is purposeful: “scent of earth and decay” grounds Elara’s resolve; “half-lit corridors” visually echo her liminal state. The setting constrains her final choice—she can’t leave because the place *is* her purpose—and charges the ending when she returns to its walls. Every detail serves pressure, never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    The quarry office trailer functions effectively as micro-setting—its scarred desk, maps, diesel scent, and flickering fluorescents create a tactile, oppressive atmosphere that mirrors Elias’s internal void. The speaker cloth pressed to the window is a charged gesture that bridges past and future. While vivid, the setting doesn’t actively constrain choice beyond mood; Elias could have this realization anywhere. Still, the recurring object-as-setting (cloth) and environmental echoes (hollow quarry = echo valley) cohere tightly with theme, narrowly missing the 9-band due to lack of tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    The magnetic arbor functions as micro-setting: its hum, shimmer, and breath-holding atmosphere directly charge key moments. The knowledge fruit tree’s leaves mirror the arbor’s energy, binding environment to theme. Soil, light, and cloud-filtered dawn are tactile and consequential—not backdrop. However, the setting doesn’t *constrain* a choice (e.g., limit resources or access), slightly undercutting 9+ eligibility despite vivid integration.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.3)
    The tidal atrium functions as both macro- and micro-setting: its breathing walls, bioluminescent runes, and identity-smelting pool directly constrain Elara’s actions and charge the climax. Sensory detail is selective (shimmering floor, cool silvery water) and filtered through Elara’s professional attention. The bamboo creel and wintersun glow recur with purpose, culminating in the final image where long shadows affirm transformation. Every atmospheric element serves theme and closure without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    The crystal caves function effectively as micro-setting: their luminous walls and echoing acoustics shape perception and mood, and the pedestal chamber directly enables the climax. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Elara’s inspector POV (“veins of quartz that pulsed faintly”). Yet the environment doesn’t *constrain* choice—it welcomes and reveals, offering no resistance. For 9+ eligibility, setting must pressure or limit; here it merely beautifies.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    The disused station functions as both setting and micro-setting—the ivy, broken glass, and graffiti directly pressure Elara’s choices (e.g., reading “The river knows” triggers her notebook use). The accordion bellows serve as tool-as-setting, constraining how she carries and accesses maps. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (crunching glass, creaking leather), filtered through her truth-seeking lens. Crucially, the environment charges the final image: the station becomes a sanctuary only after her internal reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glowing library in mist is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (parchment, metallic tang, shifting symbols) and functions as micro-setting: its shelves guide the hum, the desk demands documentation, and its light dims upon departure. The watch and parchment serve as charged objects that constrain action and amplify atmosphere. However, the environment doesn’t actively foreclose options—it enables rather than pressures, missing the 9+ gate requiring constraint or tactical shaping.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    The velvet observatory functions as micro-setting: its ferns, oak, and balcony directly enable the climax (vines snare scouts, plants guide her). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—nightshade scent, brass telescopes, steam like ghosts—all reinforcing theme and tension. The ice-crystal violin charges the final image, and midsummer’s long shadows underscore urgency. Only minor deduction: “velvet-draped ferns” slightly veers into decorative phrasing without tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    The skyborne grotto and aurora are vividly rendered and function as micro-setting: the crystalline walls reflect secrets, the aurora pulses with Elara’s breath, and light filters meaningfully at closure. However, while atmospheric, the setting doesn’t actively constrain choices—it enhances mood more than tactics. The emerald chip and silken shrouds serve as tactile anchors, but spatial choreography remains minimal. Strong sensory hierarchy aligns with Elara’s professional focus.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    The umbral grotto, vineyard hush, and luminous lake create a cohesive, atmospheric micro-setting that filters through Elara’s perception. Sensory details are selective (“moss-covered stone,” “iridescent surface shimmering”) and purposeful, avoiding white-room syndrome. However, the setting never constrains choice—the garden shifts “as if guiding her,” but no spatial or environmental obstacle forces a tactical decision. The hairpin and shell function as object-as-setting but don’t alter access or movement; they’re discovered, not wrested from the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.1)
    The lighthouse at dawn is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (salt air, wooden echoes, fragmented light), and the hollow mirror shard functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Yet the environment doesn’t constrain choices—Elias could perform his ritual anywhere. The setting mirrors theme beautifully but lacks tactical pressure; it decorates rather than dictates.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.3)
    The floating obsidian platform, magnetic grotto, and starlit water aren’t backdrop—they constrain and charge every choice. The stones are handled repeatedly; the grotto’s hum amplifies thought, enabling both concealment and revelation. The final image of starlight mingling with water directly reweights the setting’s meaning, transforming it from vessel of secrecy to conduit of truth. Sensory detail is selective, tactile, and POV-filtered (“sycamore hush,” “cool to the touch”).

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Canyon of Endless Echoes and towers of bone function as micro-setting that actively constrain and charge the climax: echoes amplify silence, bone hollows shape acoustics of revelation, and canyon walls “breathe” in sync with Kael’s pulse. The stone arrowhead and flock are tactile extensions of environment, culminating in a final image where setting, body, and object fuse into thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    The icebound spire functions as micro-setting: frozen corridors constrain movement, luminance dims/reacts to Eli’s presence, and the pedestal’s placement forces the trap sequence. Sensory detail is selective (crystallized breath, shimmering walls) and filtered through Eli’s awe and anxiety. The “lingering luminance” evolves—from passive glow to responsive presence—and charges the final image (“brilliance dimness stayed with him”). The setting actively shapes tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the skeleton key tag and glowing books constrain and charge choices, culminating in the library’s dry, timeless interior contrasting the wet, mortal harbor. Sensory detail is selective—“meteor hush,” “soft blue light beneath water”—filtered through Elias’s lamplighter sensibility. The sunken ship library is vivid but borders on ornamental; however, its dryness and glowing shelves directly enable the vow ritual, making it tactically relevant. Final image ties lanterns to vows, recharging the setting’s symbolic weight without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ambered observatory functions as a potent micro-setting: its glass filters light for prophecy interpretation, its rusted metal hums with anticipation, and its spatial confines focus all action on the distillation apparatus. Sensory detail is selective—ambered glass, static bursts, shimmering liquid—and filtered through Lira’s urgency. The setting constrains choice (only here can essence be distilled) and charges the final image (observatory as bridge between worlds). No white-room syndrome; tactile interaction with tools grounds the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    The observatory functions as a charged micro-setting: its dome opening admits stars that activate the runes, the marble railing anchors Elara’s physical and emotional posture, and the circular platform enables the climax. Sensory detail is selective (cold marble, humming parchment, creaking dome) and filtered through Elara’s sorrow. The setting constrains choice—the ritual must occur here, now—and charges the final image: silent walls now hold new echoes. Only narrowly misses 9+ due to minor atmospheric repetition (“shadows of centuries,” “echoes of what had been”).

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sapphire viaduct functions as micro-setting: its dew supplies rhythm, its arches host the bell, and its glow responds to action. Sensory detail is selective (pale blue/lavender light, cool surface, rust texture) and filtered through Eliard’s ritual focus. However, the setting doesn’t actively constrain a choice—it enables but doesn’t pressure. Final image charges closure, but environment lacks causal friction (e.g., structural risk during repair).

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    The reservoir town, ridgeway, and twilight atmosphere are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (“glassy surface,” “stars like pinholes”), filtered through Elias’s vigilant gaze. The sapphire label functions as micro-setting, charging the final image when framed in town hall. Spatial choreography remains coherent across woods, square, and porch. Yet the environment doesn’t actively constrain choices—Elias moves freely, and the setting serves mood more than pressure, narrowly missing 9+ integration.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    The hidden orchard and kaleidoscopic waterfall establish vivid, selective atmosphere that mirrors Elara’s quest, and the frozen dew crystal functions as micro-setting. However, the environment rarely constrains choice—the grove, altar, and flame appear conveniently without spatial resistance or tactical adaptation. The waterfall’s vibrancy “renewed” at the end charges closure visually, but the setting remains ornamental rather than instrumental. Still, sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through POV.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    The nocturnal arbor functions effectively as micro-setting: its glow, rustling leaves, and shifting branches mirror internal states and subtly guide perception. The parachute buckle qualifies as a recurring object that charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the seeker’s focus, though over-reliant on visual shimmer at the expense of tactile or auditory specificity during high-pressure moments. Crucially, the setting constrains no actual choice—climbing is unimpeded—but it resonates tonally throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating rock dojo is vividly rendered as a liminal space “suspended between clouds and the endless void,” and its humming energy ties to thematic purpose. Crucially, the setting constrains choice: the jar’s central placement forces confrontation, and the void backdrop heightens stakes during the duel. Sensory detail is selective (cool glass, pulsing brain) and filtered through Kael’s numbness-turned-clarity. The micro-setting—the jar itself—charges the final image when shattered, fulfilling the 9+ gate condition despite not quite reaching 9.0 due to minor atmospheric overwriting (“grotesque and mesmerizing”).

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    The nocturnal haven and brook function as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: the key must be dropped into the water to reveal the door, making environment causally essential. Sensory detail is selective and mood-sympathetic (“storm-born silence,” “glowing key”), filtered through Elias’s perception. The brook evolves from backdrop to threshold, charging the final image. However, spatial choreography slightly falters—how the door embeds in the bank lacks tactile grounding—but not enough to undermine closure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    The echo chamber tunnel functions as a charged micro-setting that actively shapes perception and amplifies Eli’s efforts—it listens, transforms, and exhales. The pull cord handle and leaf blower are tactile, recurring objects that constrain and enable action. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (whispers, hum, warmth), filtered through Eli’s urgent POV. Yet the setting never imposes physical limitation or forces a tactical pivot, preventing 9+ eligibility despite strong atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    The frozen garden isn’t backdrop but active micro-setting: ice-encrusted trees whisper, mist seeps into pores, cold becomes part of Elara’s being. These details constrain perception and action—she absorbs the garden precisely because it’s sentient and fragile. The pendant’s glow responds to environmental connection, charging the final image where Elara stands “at its heart, a sentinel of light and shadow.” Every sensory detail serves tension or theme; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ember nexus functions as micro-setting: its ash nourishes the sapling, its twilight light glints off the crozier, and its humming energy responds to Elara’s act. Sensory detail is selective (scent of ash, crackling air, otherworldly shimmer) and filtered through Elara’s despair-turned-hope. The frozen bloom memory ties body (her endurance) to environment. Final image charges closure: ruins now host new growth, proving setting isn’t backdrop but active participant.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.0)
    The abandoned radio tower city over a gorge isn’t backdrop—it constrains action (wind howling through rusted framework, towers leaning like whispers) and charges the final image (glowing frames reborn). The Hollywood star fragment functions as micro-setting, its “serenely electric” pulse altering perception. Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and evolves causally with the shard’s tuning.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    The spectral grotto functions effectively as micro-setting—the starlight, shifting symbols, and dock edge all pressure choices and reappear meaningfully at the end. The hourglass and walls’ patterns constrain tactics, and the final image of Mara bathed in starlight recharges the opening. Sensory detail is vivid but slightly over-reliant on visual shimmer; tactile and auditory cues are sparse during high-stress beats. Still, the setting actively shapes the narrative arc and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.1)
    The optical illusion gallery isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures Elara: walls melt, floors sprout roots, light fractures, all reacting to her weaving. The sinew thread functions as micro-setting, constraining her agency (it tangles, shimmers, connects). Final image charges the tool: the “tangled mess” embodies her earned insight. Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and causally integrated—not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.1)
    The benthic city is vividly rendered through bioluminescent streets, inverted stalagmite towers, and shifting etchings—details filtered through Elara’s professional gaze. Crucially, the anchor chain constrains choice (symbol of resistance) and charges the final image (its resonance in her hand). The alien ships’ “shards of moonlight” and holographic star charts merge setting with theme. Every detail serves the central tension between old knowledge and new wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mist-clad atrium is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting: mist thickens with emotional pressure, spatial choreography is coherent, and the stone pedestal anchors key action. Crucially, the setting constrains choice—Elara follows pulses through labyrinthine corridors—and charges the final image: the atrium becomes a “sanctuary” where living and dead meet. Sensory detail (cold air, clinging mist, sepia tones) is selective, POV-filtered, and evolves with the protagonist’s emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    The submerged facility functions as both setting and micro-setting: silt-choked corridors, tidal breathing walls, and the vault’s congealed air directly pressure Elena’s movement and mental state. The headlamp’s flicker and water’s rise/fall are tactile, sensory anchors that evolve with plot. However, the environment doesn’t *constrain* a key choice—the fleck works regardless of spatial logic—and the final image isn’t charged by a specific environmental detail, missing the 9+ gate. Still, atmosphere is vivid, selective, and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    The opal observatory under snow functions as both setting and micro-setting: its isolation enables focus, its cold mirrors emotional fragility, and its ancient computers constrain tactics (defragmentation via analog-digital fusion). Sensory detail is selective—frosted dome, aged wood, porcelain ridges—and filtered through Elara’s anxious perception. The shard and inkblot serve as object-as-setting, culminating in the dawn-lit sanctuary that reweights solitude into communion. Only minor deduction: “opal” in the name isn’t leveraged beyond visual metaphor, missing a chance to deepen constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting functions as micro-setting and active constraint: the tunnel’s pulsing walls, luminescent moss, and bone towers directly shape Lira’s tactics and emotional state. The canyon isn’t backdrop—it breathes, echoes, trembles, and ultimately receives the language. Sensory detail is vivid yet selective (glinting veins, jagged facets, rustle-like melody), filtered through Lira’s urgency. Crucially, the environment charges the final image: dawn-softened towers and soaring birds reframe the bone spires from ominous to sacred, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    The underground garden is masterfully specific—moss-covered stone, glowing mushrooms, ozone-laced air—and actively constrains choice (e.g., guiding Lena to the alcove). Crucially, the setting charges the final image: the still pool reflecting the cryptid, not Lena, reconfigures selfhood and observation. Sensory detail is purposeful, filtered through Lena’s researcher POV, and evolves with the metamorphosis. This environment is indispensable to the story’s logic and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    The enchanted orchard functions as micro-setting: its tarnished hues, whispering trees, and uprooting roots directly constrain and enable action (e.g., roots immobilize statues). Sensory detail is selective—iridescent shell, hummed melody, stone eyes—and filtered through Elara’s longing. The sky-bridge’s precariousness charges the final image, and setting evolves causally (muted → shimmering). Only minor deduction: “tapestry of tarnished wonder” leans slightly generic amid otherwise precise textures.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cobalt arcade functions as micro-setting: its frozen clock mirrors the border stalemate, and its flickering neon frames Elias’s departure. Sensory detail is selective—cool glass, whirring propellers, crackling air—and filtered through Elias’s urgency. The arcade constrains no tactical choice, but it charges the final image: neon glow on his retreating figure crystallizes the theme. Vivid but slightly ornamental; setting doesn’t actively shape the drone’s path or evasion.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    The abandoned circus train is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (rusted wheels, faded murals, blooming oasis) and functions as more than backdrop—it supplies the hidden compartment and carousel that catalyze the climax. The halo fragment and wind bells tie setting to action, and the “misting hush” permeates perception. However, the oasis’s sudden appearance lacks spatial foreshadowing, slightly undermining choreography. Still, the final image of the gleaming carousel charges the setting with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    The scientific poetry library functions as a potent micro-setting: its shelves, scent, and spatial logic directly enable Elara’s ritual. The tattered scarf and book arrangements constrain choices (spiral, fractal, Möbius strip), culminating in the doorway of light. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (lavender replacing ink), though the setting’s rules lean lyrical over causal, which suits the Accumulative lens but narrowly misses 9+ due to minimal environmental resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    The whispering archipelago functions as both setting and micro-setting: its light, tides, and whispers directly shape Elara’s method and emotional arc. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—salt-laden breeze, damp sand, cerulean blue—filtered through her artistic POV. The environment constrains and enables: dawn’s fleeting quality forces urgency, and the palette’s placement on the pier ties tool to place. Final image charges closure: the glowing colors mirror the internal shift, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)
    The nexus functions as a potent micro-setting: shadows “breathe,” starlight “whispers,” and the Obsidian Vault is a living entity—all constraining Elara’s approach. Sensory details (damp earth, pine, glowing ribbon) are selective and mood-driven, never stalling momentum. The lock of hair acts as object-as-setting, illuminating the path and charging the final image. Vivid specificity meets functional pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sunken greenhouse and shipwrecks are vividly rendered with tactile specificity (“glass walls fogged with age,” “timber beams groaning”) and directly charge the closure—the fairy ring aligns with constellations above, making setting instrumental to revelation. Sensory balance favors touch and sight appropriately for Elara’s folklorist POV. However, the environment doesn’t constrain choices beyond providing the locket; it’s evocative but not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    The forgotten library functions as a micro-setting that actively pressures choice: its groaning shelves, damp air, and cracked windows shape Elara’s mood, method, and movement. The shard-mirror and tea leaves are tactile tools that constrain her actions. Crucially, the setting charges the final image—the wind through broken windows mirrors her resolve, turning silence into anticipation. Every detail serves atmosphere and theme without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.6)
    The verdant parapet and waterfall are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (scent of flora, roar vs. birdsong), filtered through Elara’s professional attention. The setting functions as micro-setting: soil quality determines planting site, waterfall rhythm mirrors her ritual cadence, and the parapet’s liminality supports the “between worlds” conceit. Crucially, the environment charges the final image—the glowing shoot against golden dusk reweights the entire setting as sacred space. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prism sanctuary functions as micro-setting: stained glass casts prismatic shadows that evolve with emotional beats, and starlight shifts to mark time. The needle and net are handled tactically, grounding abstraction in physicality. Yet the environment never *constrains* choice—Elara could perform this ritual anywhere; the sanctuary’s properties feel decorative rather than instrumental. Final image uses prism light effectively, but setting doesn’t shape tactics, capping 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.1)
    The “rain-scoured fresco vault” functions as micro-setting: rain reveals layers like tree rings, directly informing Elara’s interpretive method. The henge’s misalignment and preserved wood are made plausible by this damp, layered environment. Frescoes “glow” only after understanding arrives—environment charges closure. Every sensory detail serves theme or action, never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sunken ship library functions as both setting and micro-setting: its decay contrasts the globe’s pristine state, and its spatial layout (via the map) directly guides Elara’s movement. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—damp wood, brittle pages, cold air—filtered through her marine archaeologist POV. The snow globe, as object-as-setting, charges the final image by embodying impermanence. Environment constrains choice (navigation through wreck) and reconfigures meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    The misty courtyard above clouds functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: its liminal altitude mirrors the ghost’s threshold state. The flower press bolt plate—a tactile tool—constrains choice (must be used in the device during the storm window) and reappears transformed (silent, fulfilled). Sensory detail is selective (glow of lightning, hum of gears, luminous mist) and filtered through Elara’s poetic perception. Weather actively shapes tactics—lightning initiates, thunder concludes.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    The icebound spire is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting: cold, altitude, and light directly shape perception and action. The aurora, prisms, and frosted interiors aren’t just backdrop—they enable decryption via the goggles and charge the final image. However, spatial choreography occasionally drifts (e.g., “gallery of portraits” appears without transition), and the spire’s rules remain atmospheric rather than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sky gondola functions as a potent micro-setting—its railing enables the leap, its broken string creates urgency, and its brass surfaces reflect starlight to charge key images. The “dusty starlight” and cloud formations are filtered through Elara’s meteorological subjectivity, avoiding generic description. Crucially, the telescope (a tool-as-setting) constrains choice—it’s used to observe, sketch, and finally witness the cloud’s memories—and reappears gleaming in the closing line, binding the final image to environment. Sensory detail narrows appropriately under stress (cold air, creaking floor), enhancing verisimilitude.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.3)
    The tree trunk library functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables choice—Elara must enter it, read its shelves, and respond to its groans.

The setting charges the final image—the book safe’s constellations glow in dim light, tying environment to theme. Every detail serves atmosphere, character, or closure without white-room vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is vividly rendered—the brass airship, murmurations, and hopscotch board merge atmosphere with function. The antique airship acts as micro-setting: its stern hatch and engine hum directly enable plot movement. Starling flight patterns mirror board symbols, charging the final image. Yet the environment doesn’t *constrain* choice—it facilitates revelation without resistance, missing the 9+ gate for active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.3)
    The frozen library functions as both setting and micro-setting: its parchment scent, frosted windows, and labyrinthine shelves constrain Elara’s search and shape her perception. The hall of mirrors intensifies this by distilling “the essence of time” into spatial pressure, directly altering tactics (she must face reflections to claim the gears). Crucially, the clockmaker’s gear assortment charges the final image—its light casting shadows that echo earlier moonlight, tying environment to closure. Every sensory detail serves rhythm or revelation, never stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    The orchard planet’s floating rock arches, blooming trees, and nebula create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere. Sensory detail is lush and purposeful, especially in the garden’s decay and rebirth. Yet the setting rarely constrains choice—the arches loom poetically but don’t impede or enable action. The watering bell functions as micro-setting, but spatial choreography among four characters remains vague during restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse functions as micro-setting: its groaning walls, stuttering beam, and pane of hush directly pressure Elara’s tactics and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (violet-and-ash dusk, rough porcelain edges) and filtered through her urgency. The puppet head acts as object-as-setting, constraining choice via its fragility. Every atmospheric element tightens around the central act of mending.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, and cursed orchard aren’t backdrop—they constrain every choice. The birds’ “graceless yet precise” movements mirror Elara’s own constrained beauty; the frost deadline tightens urgency. The nut functions as micro-setting, its impressions altering spatial understanding. Final image—bud pushing through cursed soil—is charged by environment, tool, and recurring object converging under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    The braided ravine is vividly rendered with tactile specificity (damp earth, pine, jagged rocks) and filtered through Elena’s scientific perception—she sees structural harmony in chaos. The setting charges the final image: twilight in the ravine mirrors her internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.3)
    The glass orchard library isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and enables. Glass stairs demand caution; hovering books signal narrative flux; cloud-sea mirrors emotional turbulence. Every detail serves Elara’s ascent and the story’s thematic core. The setting culminates in the final image: once-fragmented shelves align as the library becomes a “beacon,” proving environment charges closure. Sensory specificity (scent of ink, hum of blade on glass) avoids cliché and remains POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    The coral icebound pavilion functions as both setting and micro-setting, constraining Elara’s actions (she must descend, touch walls, reach the shard) and charging the final image as it melts into sand. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: damp sand, star-reflecting pools, icy corridors—all serve her synesthetic perception. The desert fortress isn’t just backdrop; rain enables the tidal pools that guide her. Only minor deduction: the fortress itself exerts no direct pressure on choices.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    The astronomical clock tower functions effectively as micro-setting: its silence mirrors social fracture, and its mechanics respond to Elara’s song, charging the climax.

The cuckoo weight’s reflection in the final image adds resonance but doesn’t alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    The moonlit canyon functions as micro-setting: shadows “danced like ancient spirits,” wind carries “whispers,” and lunar glow activates the mirror’s symbolism. Crucially, the setting charges the final image—the canyon bathed in “silvery glow” frames Elara’s vow, making the environment inseparable from her epiphany. Sensory detail is selective (visual dominance fits nocturnal focus) and filtered through Elara’s engineer-archeologist lens. The periscope mirror, as tool-object, constrains her action and becomes the fulcrum of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    The serpentine grotto is vividly rendered with luminescent veins, mist, and damp stone, all filtered through Elara’s focused perception. Setting actively enables the plot: the inversion reveals hidden passages, and the pedestal’s symbols interact with the doodle. The crystal’s pulsing light ties environment to character state. Crucially, the grotto constrains choice—only during inversion can she proceed—and charges the final image with ethereal decay.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    The siskin alder grove is rendered with selective, poetic specificity—sunlight as “whispered secrets,” bark holding “silent melodies”—and filtered through Elara’s professional perception. The porcelain insulator and chisel function as micro-settings that constrain attention and charge the final image. However, the grove never actively pressures choice; it remains a reverent stage, not a crucible. For 9+ eligibility, setting must alter tactics—here it aestheticizes but doesn’t obstruct or enable.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    The magnetic nexus and twilight setting are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (“air hummed faintly,” “indigo and amber”), and the basalt worry stone acts as micro-setting. However, the environment doesn’t constrain choice—it enables revelation without resistance. The nexus pulses conveniently rather than imposing limits; it’s atmospheric backdrop, not active pressure. Final image charges the stone and board, but setting never alters tactics or blocks paths.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    The shadowed workshop functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image—the stars, machinery hum, and open window all reflect Elara’s interior state without overt symbolism. Sensory detail is vivid and selective, filtered through her intuitively descriptive POV. The setting constrains nothing materially but emotionally frames the act of revelation. It earns high marks by functioning as both atmosphere and psychological mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sylvaris is vividly rendered with tactile, olfactory, and spatial specificity—the treetop bridges, wildflower hush, and dappled light create a cohesive micro-setting. The garden functions as both environment and tool, constraining Elara’s actions (e.g., rainwater collection) and charging the final image. However, while atmosphere is lush, it doesn’t actively pressure choices beyond mood; the setting enables rather than compels. Still, the recurring floral imagery tightly integrates with theme and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    The orchard planet is vividly rendered with bioluminescent moss, floating arches, and inverted gravity that actively shape navigation and tension. The river functions as both guide and constraint, and the grove’s ancient trees charge the climax. However, the setting rarely *constrains* Elara’s choices beyond aesthetic framing—she moves through it unimpeded, reducing environmental pressure to backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    The shipping container labyrinth actively shapes events—it creates the wind funnel that causes the crash—and charges the final image (moonlight casting long shadows behind Elara as she exits). Sensory detail (saltwater, metal, oil streaks) is selective and profession-filtered. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the setting evolves from eerie maze to death trap to tomb. Environment directly constrains choice and outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.1)
    The ice cavern functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: fractured ice underfoot, crystalline walls that “whisper,” and auroral light as conduit—all directly shape Elara’s method and stakes. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through synesthetic POV (“blues of distant whispers”). The amber sheet and prism bells are tactile tools integrated into action. Final image of softening walls charges closure with environmental transformation tied to thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Thunder-Echo Range and canyon hush are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (crackling sky, avalanching silence, amber light). The setting actively pressures Elara—walls close in, shadows menace—and the gilded flute’s shimmer ties environment to object. Crucially, the canyon hush deepens as tension rises, charging the final image. However, the setting doesn’t constrain a key choice; it atmospherically supports but doesn’t force action.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Topaz workshop functions as a potent micro-setting: open ceiling links cosmic and craft, ink bottles and type trays ground Elias’s profession, and the halo fragment’s placement on the bench enables tactile interaction. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—“shimmering glow,” “smooth surface”—filtered through Elias’s obsession. The setting constrains no physical choice but deeply charges the final image: stars gone, yet the space “alive,” mirroring internal shift. Just shy of 9+ because environment doesn’t *narrow* options, only reflects them.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway functions as both environment and micro-setting: its light guides, its narrowing path pressures movement, and its liminal quality mirrors Elara’s threshold state. Sensory detail is selective (cold breath, shimmering wings, dancing shadows) and filtered through Elara’s anxiety and awe. The pendant-as-setting constrains choice—it hums, urges, syncs—and charges the final image. However, the setting doesn’t actively foreclose options; it atmospherically supports rather than forces decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    The quartz arbor isn’t backdrop—it actively amplifies energy, enabling the experiment, and its mist muting sound creates the hush necessary for communion. The prism functions as micro-setting, constraining Elara’s attention and charging the final image with rainbows over grief. Sensory detail (diffuse light, hum, chill) is filtered through Elara’s mystic priorities. However, the car window frost—a key method—is recalled, not woven into present action, slightly weakening environmental integration.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting functions as micro-setting: bamboo forest, orchard, and loom constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (“sunlight filtered through the swaying canes like liquid gold,” “streams that flowed backward”) and filtered through Elara’s perception. The amber bead and loom serve as environmental extensions that evolve with the narrative. However, the setting never actively impedes or enables a tactical shift—it atmospherically supports but doesn’t pressure decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    The orchard planet’s floating rock arches, molten core, and fruit-metal air are vividly rendered and actively shape the narrative: the arches frame both menace and renewal, the mines constrain Eli’s path, and the forge grounds his identity. Crucially, the setting charges the final image—the arches now “hum with life,” softened by vines—directly reflecting the thematic shift. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Eli’s blacksmith POV. The environment functions as a dynamic constraint and payoff mechanism, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.9)
    Setting details are vivid (“rust and old grease,” “lush, alien forest”) but function as backdrop rather than constraint. The repair bay never pressures Elara’s choices—it’s merely a stage. The green shard acts as micro-setting but doesn’t alter spatial dynamics or access. Final image reweights the bay symbolically, but no tactile interaction or environmental pressure shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lantern room functions as a charged micro-setting—its darkness, flickering lamp, and stone arrangement directly enable plot turns. Sea glass and oil crates ground the space in tactile specificity, and sensory detail (gulls, crashing waves) filters through Elias’s professional attention. However, the setting doesn’t actively constrain choices beyond providing props; it atmospherically supports but doesn’t pressure decisions. The “haunted” descriptor isn’t leveraged spatially or physically.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    The emerald lighthouse, glass wick, and starlit sea form a cohesive micro-setting that charges the final image—the green beam carving a path through living fog—but only the wick actively constrains choice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (shimmering wick, unnatural sea rhythm), filtered through the Herald’s ritualistic attention. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric; it enables but doesn’t pressure tactics beyond providing the beam mechanism. The green glow’s recurrence earns resonance without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    The floating rock tea house is evocatively rendered—groaning beams, jasmine air, cloud-kissed plateau—but remains backdrop rather than crucible. The morpho wing functions as micro-setting: its iridescence guides Kael’s perception and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear, yet the environment doesn’t constrain choices (e.g., no weather, terrain, or social rules affect decisions). Sensory detail is lush but occasionally decorative, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    The stormlit tower functions as micro-setting: its cracked window admits moonlight that actively enables healing, directly constraining the sextant’s restoration. Sensory detail is selective—silvered stone, hum of dreams, shattered glass—and filtered through Elias’s occupational familiarity. The environment charges the final image: post-storm moonlight isn’t backdrop but agent. Only slight overreliance on visual tone risks minor sensory imbalance, but tactile warmth of the sextant compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse functions as a potent micro-setting, its dulled glass and dormant trees reflecting Elara’s inner state. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—mica’s sheen, fruit glowing like “captured dawns,” stream waters singing—filtered through Elara’s longing. The setting constrains choice: only through the mica window can she access the mirror world. However, the environment doesn’t actively pressure tactics beyond serving as backdrop; it charges the final image but doesn’t narrow options mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the bookstore’s hidden chamber and blank book directly charge the final image. Neon-lit urban sprawl contrasts the library’s hushed wisdom, and tactile details (“crumpled invitation,” “frayed edges,” “flickering candlelight”) filter through Elara’s perception. The environment constrains nothing physically but shapes thematic resonance—knowledge as sanctuary—which suffices for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    The overgrown palace courtyard is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail—damp earth, sourdough tang, chamomile warmth—that reflects Elara’s perceptual bias. The setting actively constrains and enables: ivy chokes light, requiring uncloaking; the tea house offers sanctuary that shapes her ritual. Crucially, the environment charges the final image—the golden-lit courtyard with sprouts and bread—making the sacred tangible. This micro-setting functions as both crucible and canvas, fulfilling the 9+ gate despite minor lyrical indulgence.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “frozen library above the clouds” functions as micro-setting: its cold constrains Elara’s touch (gloves), quartz shelves refract light essential to slide projection, and cloud-hush mirrors her emotional isolation. These details evolve—the hush softens, slides glow brighter—charging the final image of her “heart alight.” Sensory hierarchy favors visual/tactile (mist, velvet casing, prisms), appropriate for an archivist under pressure. However, the setting doesn’t *constrain* a pivotal choice beyond initial conditions, missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    The pier’s rot, salt, and shadows create vivid atmosphere, filtered through Lila’s familiarity. The market functions as micro-setting—vendors, fortune-teller, huddled men—guiding spatial choreography. Yet the environment doesn’t actively constrain choices; Lila moves unimpeded. The watch fob acts as object-as-setting, charging the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate partially but not fully shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lavender bluff and aurora function as a micro-setting that actively shapes perception and stakes—the scent shifts, light intensifies, and air cools in response to the ring’s signals, making environment a dynamic participant. The aurora’s convergence directly pressures Elara’s choice, and the final shimmering approval ties setting to closure. Sensory detail is selective (metallic/sweet taste, cool air) and filtered through POV urgency. Yet the setting never constrains a physical choice or imposes a tangible obstacle, limiting its causal role.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    The subterranean crystal cave is more than backdrop—it actively shapes perception through prismatic light that “dances” during creation, mirroring Elara’s inner shift. Crystals constrain visibility (hiding the alcove) and supply emotional resonance (shimmering hues reflecting mood). The lantern’s light interacts causally with setting to enable discovery and transformation. However, the cave never imposes physical stakes (e.g., collapse, isolation), limiting its role to atmospheric catalyst rather than active crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    The greenhouse city, toxic sky, and decaying undercity are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (“scent of decaying plants and rusting metal”). The gilded-leaf script and zinc plate function as micro-settings that constrain choices—the script wilts near deceit, forcing candor. The final image of glowing leaves in artificial sunlight charges the closure by contrasting natural truth with synthetic survival. Only minor deduction: the central dome’s spatial logic isn’t fully choreographed.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Whispering Bluff functions as micro-setting: altitude, clouds, and thin air shape Elara’s isolation and ritual. The iceberg fragment constrains her method and charges the final image—its glisten triggers the symphony, its dimming signals cost. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., “clouds draped like a soft, gray blanket”). However, setting never actively pressures a tactical shift—it enables but doesn’t complicate.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glass-domed desert rose farm functions as micro-setting: its fragility mirrors Elara’s state, and the enclosed space concentrates pressure. Sensory detail is selective—petals, pulsing wood, shimmering dome—and filtered through Elara’s nostalgic bias. The setting charges the final image (roses glistening post-crisis) and constrains action (only within dome). However, it doesn’t actively shape tactics beyond atmosphere; no spatial choreography or resource use alters outcomes, capping full 9+ integration.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    The courtyard at dawn is vividly rendered with jasmine, cobblestones, and light, filtered through Clara’s observant POV. Setting supports tone and theme but doesn’t constrain choice—the mailbox could be anywhere. The locket functions as micro-setting, charging the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate partially. Yet spatial choreography remains static; no environmental pressure alters tactics beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sunken laboratory is vividly rendered with tactile, decaying specificity—moss-covered walls, dripping water, humming air—and functions as both setting and character. Crucially, it constrains choice: the journal’s dance-language can only be unlocked within this chamber, and the dice respond to movement tied to the space. The final image reweights the setting from tomb to rebirth site, satisfying the 9+ gate, though cost remains implied rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    The salt crystal chamber functions as a micro-setting that actively shapes tactics—it amplifies gravity pockets, enabling the climax. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: Eli notices shimmer, hum, pulse, all tied to his quest. The setting charges the final image as crystals “acknowledge” his return. However, it doesn’t *constrain* a choice (e.g., force a risk), missing the 9+ gate for environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    The nocturnal haven functions as micro-setting: moss stone, brook’s rhythm, pine scent all filter Elara’s perception and enable her technique (“listening to the void between breaths”). The crane’s wing—a tool-as-setting—constrains choice (only it can smooth the hush) and charges the final image (dimmed glow = fragile victory). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, avoiding tourist cataloging. Yet the environment doesn’t actively pressure tactics—it supports rather than challenges.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rooftop garden functions as micro-setting: it constrains choice (only place for celestial communion) and charges closure (her return to earth via neighbor’s door). Sensory specificity—brick chimney, wrought-iron railing, herb scents—is filtered through Clara’s perception. However, the meteor shower borders on generic spectacle; it enhances mood but doesn’t alter tactics. Final image ties setting to action (“knocked on her neighbor’s door”), satisfying 9+ gate partially but not fully.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    The velvet garden functions as micro-setting: moss, still fountain, and fading orchid directly enable discovery and charge the ending. Sensory detail (jasmine, petal texture, shifting hues) is vivid and filtered through Elara’s POV. The orchid’s dimmed glow in the final image reweights the setting’s purpose. However, spatial choreography lacks precise tracking (e.g., exact distance to fountain), slightly limiting constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora ceiling, and stalactites aren’t backdrop—they actively shape the ritual: cold floor grounds Elara, dripping water syncs with her heartbeat, and the aurora’s glow validates her choice. The rose thorn functions as micro-setting, constraining her method of unmaking. Sensory detail is selective (ethereal light, frayed scroll) and filtered through Elara’s trauma. Only minor deduction: “crystalline teeth” verges on mixed metaphor but doesn’t obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    The serpentine nexus is vividly rendered with multi-sensory specificity (“scent of ancient secrets,” “ground... pulse[s] with rhythm of the cosmos”) and functions as micro-setting: the archway, chamber, and starlight pool directly shape Elara’s choices. The whispering seashell qualifies as object-as-setting, charging the final image when it glows post-revelation. However, while atmospheric, the setting doesn’t impose hard constraints—Elara moves freely, and the environment responds passively to her song rather than resisting or enabling tactically.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.1)
    The glacier-ice shrine functions as a potent micro-setting that constrains and charges choice: its candlelight enables vision, its ice hums with energy, and its isolation frames the ritual. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—flickering flames, cracked glass, murky liquid—filtered through Elara’s professional gaze. The environment directly shapes the climax: the melting/refreezing of the globe only makes sense within this cryogenic sanctuary. Final image of dawn painting the sky ties setting to thematic warmth without cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    The whispering parapet after rain is rendered with rich sensory specificity—damp stone, blooming jasmine, firefly glow—and functions as a micro-setting that shapes Elara’s reflection. The bamboo whisk and fireflies are not just described but woven into her cognitive process. However, the setting never actively constrains choice or alters tactics; it remains atmospheric rather than instrumental, preventing a 9+ score despite lyrical precision.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    The orchard functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice—it’s both sanctuary and prison, its stillness enabling Elara’s work while masking danger. Sensory detail (humming bark, inert air) is selective and pressure-driven. The diamond and letters are tactile anchors woven into action. Yet the wasteland remains generic; radioactive dust storms feel like backdrop rather than active environmental pressure shaping tactics beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stormlit observatory above clouds functions as micro-setting that pressures choice—the isolation enables Elias’s focus, and the storm externalizes inner turmoil. The cobalt glass portico constrains action: it must be touched, activated, and understood. Final image of parted clouds and new dawn is charged by this setting, fulfilling the 9+ gate condition through environmental reconfiguration tied to character agency.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    The feral loft beneath the dunes functions as a micro-setting that actively pressures choice: its isolation enables Elias’s ritual, its acoustics shape sound-capture, and its beams echo memory. The music box, sand, glass shards, and morning light are not backdrop but active participants—especially the shard pressed to the ear, which charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., wind “whispering secrets” through cracked beams). However, the dunes themselves remain slightly generic; their golden shimmer adds tone but doesn’t constrain action beyond initial arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered with brine, shifting ice, and golden sunset, and it actively pressures Elara’s urgency (fading light = narrowing window). The lighthouse’s spiral stairs and hidden compartment function as micro-setting that enables plot. However, the environment doesn’t *constrain* her final choice—the key’s power works identically anywhere—missing the 9+ gate for setting-as-tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.1)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that mirrors Elara’s internal state without overt symbolism. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—silver moonlight on ice, residual moisture on iron beams—and the setting evolves subtly as visitors arrive. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains a backdrop rather than an active force. This prevents 9+ eligibility despite strong textural control.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    The subway tunnel setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (rust, damp earth, flickering lantern light) and filters through Elara’s professional attention. The lantern functions as micro-setting, constraining visibility and charging the final image (“light seemed brighter”). Spatial choreography is coherent, and environmental details evolve with plot (shadows “shift,” air “grows colder”). Yet the drought’s end is noted without affecting tactics—missed opportunity for mud, seepage, or structural instability to pressure choices.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.3)
    The antique shop isn’t backdrop—it’s micro-setting that constrains and charges: shelves of silenced music boxes mirror Thomas’s trapped hope; the cracked floral box embodies abandonment; oil-and-wood scent textures every decision. Final image of “vibrant hush” echoes opening, now reweighted by Elias’s resolve. Setting directly enables the thematic turn and closure resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.1)
    The acid-sea workshop functions as a dynamic micro-setting: its corrosive mist fogs windows, its bobbing motion mirrors thematic instability, and its hybrid tech (gears + holograms) embodies evolution. Crucially, it charges the final image—the stilling sea “listening” to the bell—and constrains Lira’s isolation, forcing inward innovation. Sensory detail (clanking metal, whirring cogs, iridescent hues) is selective, purposeful, and filtered through her tinkerer’s POV.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.1)
    The social network archive functions effectively as a micro-setting: its metadata, timestamps, and hidden folders directly enable and constrain Elara’s investigation. The patch and song are tactile, recurring objects that evolve in meaning. Sensory detail is selective (frayed fabric, static-filled audio) and filtered through Elara’s professional attention. However, the archive never physically pressures her—no spatial stakes or environmental resistance—limiting its constraining power at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lighthouse orchard, ice floes, and vintage store are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (salt-and-blossom air, creaking floorboards, glinting windows). The setting functions as micro-setting: the mirrors constrain knowledge and guide action, directly enabling the plot. However, the environment doesn’t *pressure* Elara’s choices—she moves through it effortlessly—and the final image, while resonant, isn’t charged by environmental constraint. Still, the recurring object (mirrors) and location cohere tightly with theme.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.1)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered with sensory specificity—“jagged shards… like broken teeth,” “wooden piers creaking under frozen debris”—and functions as micro-setting that constrains mood and meaning. Crucially, the parasol (a recurring object-as-setting) contrasts the harshness and culminates in the aurora-lit closing image, directly charging the thematic payoff. Every detail serves tone and theme without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    The amber pavilion and autumn vineyard are rendered with sensory specificity—golden hues, rustling leaves, cool air—that mirror Elara’s internal state without overt symbolism. The setting functions as micro-setting: the pavilion’s light “whispers encouragement,” shaping her introspection. Yet it never actively constrains choice or alters tactics; its role is atmospheric rather than causal. Still, the environment charges the final image, nearly meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    The kinetic parapet and murmuring pavilion function as micro-settings that constrain choice: Elara must consecrate the parapet to preserve wisdom. Sand, silk, and stone are tactile and recurring, charging the final image (wind erasing bootprints vs. enduring parapet). However, the environment doesn’t actively pressure tactics—it’s a resonant stage, not a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lavender field and factory ruins are vividly rendered with tactile, olfactory, and visual specificity that serves mood and theme. The setting functions as micro-setting: the field offers solace, the ruins embody decay-turned-resilience, and both charge the final image. However, the environment doesn’t constrain Elara’s choices—she could perform her ritual anywhere—missing the 9+ gate requiring environmental pressure on action.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    The library functions as micro-setting: dust, shadow, and silence mirror Elias’s internal state and constrain his work—no distractions, only decayed resonance. The crystal, chandelier fragment, and dawn light are purposefully selected; each charges the final image (crystal spent, light arriving). Spatial choreography is clean, and the setting evolves causally—from suspended time to lifted hush. Only narrowly misses 9+ due to slight atmospheric dominance over tactile interaction with space.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.3)
    The fog sculpture garden functions as active micro-setting: metal loops guide chalk lines, the spiral pulls Elias forward, and the pond enables the final ritual. Fog isn’t just atmosphere—it mutes sound, distorts direction, and embodies Elias’s cognitive haze. Every object constrains choice (e.g., absent driftwood forces chalk improvisation), and the setting charges the ending when still water reflects his earned poise. Sensory hierarchy (damp earth, cold metal) filters through Elias’s urgency without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lunar observatory functions as micro-setting: its thin air, stone floor, and eastern wall anchor choices (e.g., cross-legged on cold stone). Sensory detail is selective (whisper of falling leaf, burning stars) and filtered through Elara’s repairer POV. The setting charges the final image—sunlight on clouds below contrasts the prior isolation, signaling change. However, the environment doesn’t actively constrain tactics beyond mood; tools and body do more causal work.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.9)
    The “radiant haven above the clouds” is vividly rendered with scent (lavender/eucalyptus), light, and tactile detail, filtered through Elara’s professional sensitivity. The vinyl fragment functions as micro-setting, charging the closure when it “seem[s] almost whole.” Yet the setting doesn’t constrain choices—it’s atmospheric, not tactical—missing the 9+ gate despite strong specificity and integration into mood.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating isle, nocturnal observatory, and clockwork key form a vivid micro-setting that constrains and charges the narrative. The workshop’s frozen automaton and the precipice at noon directly enable key actions and reweight the key’s meaning. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., brass etching “pulsing faintly under moonlight”), and the environment actively shapes tactics—especially the noon void’s emergence. Final image of the dormant key gains resonance from its tactile journey through these spaces.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    The hedge maze and garden function as active micro-settings: the maze tests resolve, the fountain demands sacrifice, and the glowing flora charges the final image. Sensory detail (damp earth, jasmine, gravel crunch) is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding white-room syndrome. Yet the garden’s magic lacks consistent rules beyond metaphor, and the setting doesn’t *constrain* Elara’s tactics—it welcomes her after the trial, reducing environmental pressure at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    The serpentine grotto functions as micro-setting: its mist, moss-light, and winding walls constrain and reflect Lira’s internal state. Sensory details (damp earth, salt, luminescence) are filtered through her longing and craft, never generic. The sea glass itself becomes environmental—a charged object that alters tactics (polishing) and culminates in the closure image. Only minor deduction for slight overreliance on visual texture over other senses in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.3)
    The abandoned data center turned moss garden is not backdrop but active crucible: moss reclaims servers, icicle patterns become art, sunlight charges emotional beats.

The amber pendant and fern-lit shaft directly charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for environmental integration.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    The feral nexus functions effectively as micro-setting—the mist constricts visibility, the shore anchors spatial logic, and the glowing tree crystallizes theme. The shell fragment constrains choice by serving as both compass and key, directly charging the final image when placed among other shells. Sensory detail (cool surface, swirling hush) is selective and POV-filtered, though weather/mist occasionally veers toward atmospheric cliché without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    The verdant arbor functions as micro-setting: dew, leaves, and vines actively participate in the ritual, mirroring Elara’s emotional shifts without overt symbolism. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—golden light, humming, shimmering tendrils—all filtered through Elara’s tinkerer-POV. The setting constrains no tactical choice, however, which bars 9+ per gate rule; it enhances atmosphere but doesn’t foreclose options. Still, the arbor charges the final image as the locus of rebirth.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    The withered orchard in a subarctic crater functions as a potent micro-setting that constrains and charges the final image—its desolation contrasts with the glow of the completed map, enhancing thematic weight. Sensory details (frost-kissed ground, shattered glass, ghostly moonlight) are selective and woven into action. However, the environment doesn’t actively pressure choices; it serves as backdrop rather than crucible. Still, the recurring illustration plate and starlight tie setting to closure with strong atmospheric cohesion.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    The marble cavern is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting: its reflective surfaces directly enable Elias’s method and climax. Light shifts at dusk provide the key insight, making environment causally active. Sensory detail is selective (shimmering veins, hum of gears, warmth of captured echoes) and filtered through Elias’s professional attention. Yet the setting doesn’t *constrain* choice—it supplies resources without imposing limits, missing the 9+ gate requiring environmental constraint on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.3)
    The bronze grotto isn’t backdrop but active micro-setting: its starlight pulses with Elara’s breath, its damp earth scent grounds abstraction, and its walls’ metallic tang echoes the “calcified” burdens. Crucially, the kerosene lamp burner constrains choice—it’s gripped for grounding, its flicker mirrors uncertainty, and its steadied flame charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy narrows under stress (focus on lamp’s warmth vs. ambient shadows), and spatial choreography stays coherent (figure approaches from grotto’s edge, shadow stretches across floor). Environment directly shapes the closure’s resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: light dictates workability, rain mirrors internal state, tools are hauntingly practical.

Sensory detail is selective—dust, brass gleam, echoic acoustics—and filtered through Eli’s engineer POV. The sextant and terminal jointly charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate condition, though the carnival’s offstage presence slightly dilutes spatial focus. No white-room syndrome; choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.3)
    The sanctuary isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and catalyst. The “glacial hush” initially cages Elara but becomes a cradle once she acts; the crystal forecourt’s post-rain hum directly triggers her crisis and resolution. Tools (pen, clock face) and body (trembling hands, breath catching) function as micro-settings that charge the final image: the completed clock’s moving hands mirror her internal shift. Every sensory detail—petrichor, cool stone, translucent pavement—is filtered through Elara’s scribe-POV and serves escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    The twilight barge canal functions as micro-setting: decaying barges, damp earth, and silence shape mood and frame Elara’s search. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, filtered through her perspective. Crucially, the canal supplies the chest—directly enabling the climax—and its transformation from symbol of decay to “alive with possibility” charges the final image. The sundial and journal are handled tactically, not just described, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.0)

Sensory details—crisp air, woodsmoke, crunching leaves—are filtered through the traveler’s attention and heighten intimacy. The palace thread charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate. No white-room syndrome; every detail serves atmosphere or theme.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    The suspended palace and fungal glow establish a tactile, haunting atmosphere that mirrors Kael’s isolation. Sensory detail (damp stone, flickering lantern, eerie blue light) is purposeful and POV-filtered. The stalactite setting functions as micro-setting—it enables the hidden chamber and isolates Kael, shaping his solitary quest. However, the environment doesn’t actively constrain a pivotal choice; it frames rather than pressures, missing the 9+ gate for causal environmental agency.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    The obsidian lagoon and black sand function as micro-setting that constrains choice—the sterile soil defines the impossibility Elara defies. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: cool water, coarse sand, red thread against black. The environment charges the final image (seeds buried in barren ground), fulfilling the 9+ gate. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    The city functions as a dynamic micro-setting: dried fountains, moss-cracked basins, and whispering cobblestones constrain Elara’s path and charge the climax. The stained glass box—a recurring object—constrains choice (its glow syncs with her doubt) and directly fuels the ending’s liquid starlight. Sensory detail is selective (sidereal patience, fractured blues) and filtered through Elara’s luminous POV. Every locale evolves causally: geese depart → return; silence → song.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.1)
    The nebula garden functions effectively as micro-setting, its bioluminescent blooms and falling petals shaping mood and symbolizing transience. The gear—a recurring object—constrains no choice but charges the final image as a “mirror of her endless soul.” Sensory detail is vivid yet over-reliant on visual metaphor (“liquid silver,” “troubling serenity”), with minimal tactile or auditory grounding. Still, the setting coheres tonally and supports thematic resonance without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ancient greenhouse is vividly rendered—not just visually but through sound (“humming glass”) and temporal texture (“weight of centuries”). It constrains choice by isolating Elara in a liminal space where memory and craft converge, and directly charges the final image: the stone “hum[s] with life” as stars reflect on the same panes. However, the setting doesn’t actively *alter* tactics—it’s atmospheric rather than instrumental—preventing a 9+ score despite lyrical strength.

    The tidal obsidian ridge, clock tower, and rake handle form a tightly integrated micro-setting where environment charges meaning: the ridge’s whisper mirrors the town’s secrets, the pendulum’s arc embodies balance, and the broken tool becomes a vessel for wisdom. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (Elias notices callouses, brass constellations, splintered wood). Crucially, the pendulum bob constrains the climax—it must be still for revelation—and the final image ties moonlit obsidian to internal peace. No white-room syndrome; every detail serves tone or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the cobalt silo, willow tree, and sovereign case are tactile, recurring, and charged. The silo evolves from storage to “cathedral,” altering the emotional weight of the space. Sensory detail is selective—damp earth, tarnished silver, frayed velvet—and filtered through Elias’s profession and obsession. However, the silo doesn’t *constrain* choice; it’s atmospheric rather than instrumental, missing the 9+ gate requiring environmental pressure on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake anchor early and evolve symbolically—from monument of past achievement to “gateway” as sunlight returns. The kingfisher quill functions as micro-setting: its iridescence and mythic power charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (pine scent, shimmering ink) and POV-filtered, avoiding tourist cataloguing. Environment constrains no tactical choice, but its transformation mirrors thematic shift, satisfying the 9+ gate via object-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “ember alcove in mist” functions as micro-setting: its parchment, ink, and damp wood constrain Clara’s actions while the radio’s glow physically transforms the space. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—paper scent during transcription, static hiss during discovery—filtered through her copyist’s focus. The final image of dawn lifting mist reweights the setting from sanctuary to threshold, fulfilling the 9+ gate via environmental charge at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    The gallery functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image—the mask’s shards and the chair’s stillness directly shape Elara’s ritual. Sensory detail is selective (marble echoes, ash dancing in light) and filtered through her grief. Spatial choreography remains coherent, though the mask’s display under glass slightly distances tactile engagement. The environment constrains choice by providing only symbolic tools for closure, intensifying thematic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sewer and sunken city are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (stench of decay, sedimentary layers, eerie sunset glow), all filtered through Kael’s obsessive lens. The chronometer cog functions as micro-setting, constraining his choices and charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite shifts, and environmental details evolve causally (collapse forces action). The setting actively pressures decisions—ruins aren’t backdrop but archive and threat—earning high marks for integration without over-description.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    The velvet library functions as micro-setting: its stained glass, parchment scent, and “hollow silence” directly shape Elara’s method (“subtracting noise”). The rosette—a recurring object—constrains choice by focalizing attention and recharging meaning at closure. Autumn’s progression (golden → crimson light) subtly tracks time and emotional shift. Yet spatial choreography remains vague—who sits where? How do bodies move during rehearsal? Minor drift in tactile specificity prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rusted greenhouse is more than backdrop—it constrains choice (only here can the seed grow), supplies thematic texture (“scars on an old warrior”), and evolves causally from ruin to rebirth. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: Elara notices rust, soil, luminescence, rain-scent—all tied to her nurturing identity. The setting charges the final image: the glowing tree at dawn reconfigures decay into possibility. However, it doesn’t actively obstruct or enable a pivotal tactical decision beyond providing location; its role is resonant but not instrumental under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lightning tower functions as micro-setting: its dormant state pressures Elara’s quest, and the hidden staircase alters tactics. The lacquer box and orb charge the final image, with star patterns reweighting “wonder.” Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“nectar dusk,” “faint hum”), though the chamber’s machinery remains generically “ancient” without tactile specificity that would constrain choices more concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bay functions as micro-setting: its stillness mirrors Elias’s inner state and supplies the objects that catalyze his realization. Sensory detail is selective (dawn hues, rusted key, photograph’s faded laughter) and filtered through his perceptual bias. However, the setting doesn’t constrain choice—it enables reflection without resistance—missing the 9+ gate for environmental pressure on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    The underwater garden is richly textured—muted coral arches, crumbling fountains, tangled seaweed—and filters through Liora’s ancient, observant perspective. Crucially, the setting functions as micro-setting: the ampoule’s fragility only matters because the environment (deep water, diver’s movement) threatens it. However, the garden doesn’t actively constrain choices beyond mood; it’s evocative but not tactical. The foxglove-stained glass charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate partially.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    The infinite staircase functions as both setting and micro-setting—it constrains choice (no retracing steps) and charges the final image through its pulsing walls and shifting geometry. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: chalk equations, stone scuffing, thunder-like die clatter. The dice serve as tool-as-setting, directly shaping tactics and closure. Only minor deduction for slight overreliance on visual descriptors in mid-section.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rooftop greenhouse functions as a potent micro-setting: its grime contrasts the moonlight, its plants sway in approval, and its glass panes frame the liminal space between pollution and purity. Crucially, it constrains Elara’s choices—this is her only sanctuary—and charges the final image when dawn returns the smog but the painting’s light endures. Sensory details (humidity-fogged glass, jasmine scent, indigo ink) are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding tourist cataloging. The setting actively participates in the thematic reconfiguration of memory as resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.1)
    The grotto city isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting: waterfall mist clings like dread, moss-covered arches frame ritual, and damp air carries both cascade hum and memory. The opera glass lens functions as object-as-setting, its emerald glow charging the final image as it reflects cascading water. Spatial choreography is precise (workshop → square → altar → waterfall), and sensory detail serves urgency—e.g., shadows dancing only when lens is present. Environment directly enables the climax: mist, scent, and glow draw the crowd.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the lighthouse’s rusted gears, shattered glass, and the island’s “rocky spine” actively constrain and mirror Elias’s ambition. Salt, decay, and low tide are sensory anchors filtered through his obsession. Crucially, the lighthouse *changes* post-activation—gears turn counter-clockwise, light casts reverse shadows—charging the final image. The hunger stone’s embedded position and tidal rhythm directly shape tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    The funhouse functions as a potent micro-setting: warped mirrors constrain perception, clocks spin to destabilize time, and lingering luminance actively reveals hidden truths. These details are filtered through Clara’s dread and directly shape her choices (e.g., stumbling into the clock room). The opera clasp and dream dictionary act as environmental tools that charge the final image. Yet the setting remains static—no physical change beyond mirror-shattering—limiting full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    The floating orchard, driftwood xylophone, and blue hour cohere as a micro-setting that actively constrains and charges every choice—Leeward’s bare feet, the mallet’s warmth, the sea’s sway all shape tactics. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered, avoiding white-room syndrome. The environment culminates in the final image, making it indispensable to closure under the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)
    The turtle-shell city isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains choice (cracks dictate passage) and charges the final image (living shell = failing foundation). Sensory detail is selective: “sunwashed dread,” “glowing symbols,” “obsidian eyes” serve tone and pressure without bloat. The reed whistle and spiral shells function as micro-settings that shape tactics. Every environmental detail ties to theme or escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    The disused station functions effectively as micro-setting: ivy, damp air, and crumbling beams constrain movement and charge atmosphere. The cracked mirror and rosebush are purposefully integrated, reflecting thematic distortion and temporal markers. However, the setting rarely *alters tactics*—Elara finds the archive through narrative convenience (a loose floorboard) rather than environmental logic. Final image of swaying bare branches resonates but doesn’t actively reconfigure stakes beyond symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    The submerged pavilion functions as micro-setting: silt-buried arches and upward-carved hands directly pressure Elias’s choices (wading deeper, repairing foundations). Sensory details (brine, decay, murky water) are filtered through his professional attention—stone textures, mortar work—not tourist observation. The mosaic’s glow charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Minor deduction: the drawbridge’s role remains atmospheric rather than constraining action.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sunken library setting is vividly rendered with bioluminescent algae, crumbling stone, and reclaimed stillness that actively shapes Elara’s perception and method. The micro-setting—the stamp, the shelves, the collapsed archway—constrains choices and culminates in the final chamber beneath cracked glass, charging the closure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, though weather/time effects are underutilized. The environment doesn’t merely backdrop—it enables and responds, satisfying the 9+ gate condition despite minor missed opportunities.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    The floating island tea garden isn’t backdrop—it pressures Kael’s psyche (“descended while ascending”) and supplies the origami crane that triggers his epiphany. The glass basilica evolves from judgmental beacon to truth-revealer, directly charging the climax. Crucially, the recurring object—the origami crane—constrains choice (he must unfold it) and recharges the final image. Sensory detail (mist like “a lover’s whisper,” humming basilica walls) is selective, POV-filtered, and woven into action.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating observatory functions as micro-setting: its geode-lined walls and electromagnetic hum directly charge Zara’s perception and final insight. Sensory detail is vivid (“scent of ash,” “cool surface,” “otherworldly radiance”) and filtered through trauma—crisis narrows focus to tactile and visual immediacies. The geode constrains choice by becoming the focal object of her hunt, and its interior light directly shapes the closing image. Setting evolves with emotional arc: silence during breaker cooldown enables reflection, then hum returns as purpose reignites.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.1)
    The observatory is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (dust, stained glass, cold stone) and spatial coherence. Details serve atmosphere more than constraint—Kael navigates effortlessly without environmental resistance. The “brilliant dimness” motif recurs but doesn’t charge the final image beyond mood. Setting supports tone but rarely pressures choice; micro-setting (drone, chip) functions more actively than the location itself.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt terrace and driftwood shore function as micro-settings that constrain choice—the terrace’s height isolates Elias, the shore’s carvings become his moral archive. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (salt and decay, fractured mirror sky), never touristy. The watch hand and driftwood clock directly charge the final image. One persistent constraint—the sea’s “sieved hush”—shapes tactics by muting distraction and forcing inward focus.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    The parapet, mist, and storm are vividly rendered and filtered through Elara’s perception, yet they remain atmospheric rather than tactical—they don’t constrain choices or alter outcomes. The drawer pull functions as micro-setting and charges the closure, satisfying the 9+ gate partially, but the environment itself is passive. Sensory detail is selective (wind’s howl, lantern flicker), but weather doesn’t impact negotiation mechanics beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coastal kayak launch functions as micro-setting: it’s a threshold that pressures choice (“place of beginnings and endings”). Sensory details—salt, seaweed, lapping waves—are filtered through Mara’s melancholy and evolve with her state. The astronomical compass and utility poles are purposeful recurring objects, but only the compass charges the final image. The setting doesn’t actively constrain tactics beyond mood, missing the 9+ gate for environmental pressure on decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.1)
    The lake is not backdrop but active micro-setting: its glow reveals carved walls, its warmth contrasts cavern chill, and its bioluminescent fish respond to the baseball. This environment directly charges the final image—Elias carries its glow in his eyes—and constrains his choice to enter. Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and evolves with action (ripples → depths → surfacing). The “delicately robust” ecosystem subtly mirrors Elias’s fragile transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    The orchard functions as both setting and micro-setting: its shifting paths, star-fruit, and spice-laden air directly enable and pressure Elara’s choices. The permanent moonlight and phoenix-timeframe establish consistent rules. Final image charges the setting—Elara walks back through the same orchard, now changed internally—fulfilling the 9+ gate. Yet the environment doesn’t *constrain* her actions so much as accompany them; it could be swapped with another enchanted grove without structural loss.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    The midnight glade above clouds functions as both setting and micro-setting: its crystalline leaves, mossy ground, and humming air directly shape Elara’s perception and ritual. The dolls’ tea set—especially the cracked saucer—is handled repeatedly, evolving from relic to map to vessel of revelation. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., “choking beauty” reflects her guilt), never decorative. The environment charges the final image: the crack’s glow emerges from the glade’s latent energy, making place inseparable from transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    The recycled spaceship and crystalline relic function as micro-settings that charge the final image—hull patches echo stitching, tear merges with core. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (cool surface, hum of life), though golden-light dimension risks generic utopia. Crucially, the ship constrains choice (sanctuary vs. mission) and reappears as resilient vessel in closure, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    The black sand beach, sulfur air, and volcanic rock aren’t just backdrop—they constrain movement, charge atmosphere, and culminate in the hidden cove that enables the climax. The bottle of lightning bugs acts as micro-setting, its glow syncing with stars to heighten the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., “cool grains,” “scent of sulfur”). Yet the volcano remains visually imposing but inert—never actively pressures choice beyond ambiance.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    The fort’s “eerie stillness” and absent enchanted lanterns establish atmosphere that directly pressures Elara’s actions. The bronze quill holder and sundial function as micro-settings that constrain choice—the quill deciphers, the sundial hides the key—and the final image of the quill “glinting in the light” charges the closure. Yet the fort itself remains somewhat generic; its luminosity isn’t leveraged tactically beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tidal bluff under aurora functions as micro-setting that actively pressures choice: tides whisper secrets, aurora shifts in response to ritual, and rocks are selected for mathematical properties. Sensory detail is vivid yet purposeful (“silver bodies glinting,” “low hum in the back of his mind”). Final image—dawn-lit bluff with shifted rocks—charges closure by implying ongoing mystery. Only minor deduction: “borrowed dawn” leans slightly decorative without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “stormlit observatory above clouds” functions as a potent micro-setting that constrains choice: isolation enables secrecy but also forces confrontation with the past. The darkroom timer and glass dome are tactile, recurring elements that charge the final image—Elara’s shadow cast by stormlight during the act of writing. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (electric air, ticking timer, tearing seal), though weather occasionally veers toward cliché (“lightning cracking like a whip”). Still, setting actively shapes the protagonist’s poise and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glass atrium, brook, and mechanical arm form a micro-setting triad that charges every exchange—the fractured rainbows mirror epistemic splintering, the brook’s murmur counters verbal thrusts, and the arm’s servos embody calibrated seeking. Spatial choreography remains crisp: pedestal, sundial, and characters’ positions never blur. However, the setting doesn’t *constrain* a pivotal choice—it reflects rather than pressures, narrowly missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rusted library under stars is richly sensory and thematically charged, functioning as micro-setting that constrains and enables: its decay mirrors societal collapse, its shelves become canvases for resistance. The coffee tin and moonlit rooftop anchor key beats with tactile specificity. However, while atmosphere is lush, it rarely pressures action—Elias and Clara move through the space without spatial choreography affecting decisions. The setting resonates symbolically but doesn’t causally shape tactics beyond providing backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tidal arbor functions as both setting and micro-setting: its compasses guide action, its archives house the reel, and its ethereal stillness mirrors Elara’s emotional state. The upright piano, broken clock, and flickering compasses are tactile anchors that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—golden hues, ethereal breeze, pulsing film—filtered through Elara’s wistfulness. Only minor deduction: the “labyrinthine heart” lacks spatial specificity, but this serves thematic disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “ancient ridge in bloom” functions as micro-setting: its breathing blooms mirror Elara’s rhythm, and the crescent moon anchors the climax. Moss cradles the seed; rain threatens dissolution—environment directly shapes stakes. Final image of blooming ridge recharges opening motif with earned resilience. Vivid, selective sensory detail avoids cliché, though “luminous doubt” leans abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    The breezy islet after rain functions as a micro-setting that actively shapes action: slick rocks demand steady steps, the cottage shelters discovery, and the hidden cove is only reachable via tide-guided navigation. Sensory detail (damp earth, salt, cerulean glow) is selective and filtered through Elias’s bonsai-trained attention. The ghost compass and lace pattern serve as object-as-setting, constraining interpretation and guiding movement. Final image is charged by the sea’s light and receding tide.
