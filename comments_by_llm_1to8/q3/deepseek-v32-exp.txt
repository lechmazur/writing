  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.1)
    The canyon under stars is established early and the frost patterns constrain her decipherment choice in one middle beat, meeting two gates. However, the setting functions primarily as a static backdrop for reflection rather than dynamically shaping tactics or the final image. The frost's disappearance at sunrise could have altered her options but instead remains ornamental. Sensory detail is present (cold stone, morning frost, waking sky) but lacks POV-specific selection that would reveal urgency or professional bias.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.1)
    The winterglass conservatory is vividly rendered with "frost-etched flora," "crystalline workbench," and "frozen breath," and the unshaken marvels anchor the setting's thematic weight. The conservatory supplies both sanctuary and stage, and the glass itself becomes the canvas for heat-mapping. The tuning fork case and grand piano with cut strings serve as micro-setting elements that constrain Elara's method, elevating the score into the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.1)
    The underwater library is vivid and purposeful: "coral-encrusted spires," "pages floating like ghosts," and the moonlit chamber all ground the action. Spatial choreography remains clear through descent and chamber navigation. The moonlight shaft creating an "impossible space" constrains the final choice and charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. However, occupational detail (undertaker tools, submersible mechanics) is mentioned but not used tactically, and the lens fragments' physical arrangement lacks micro-setting texture that would deepen the repair sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.4)
    The terra-cotta arbor and ridge anchor place; the humid night air and amplified quiet establish atmosphere. The arbor constrains action by serving as the distribution hub and donation drop-point, shaping logistics. However, spatial choreography during the midnight runs remains generic—"cramped basement," "shadows," "dusty path"—without tactical friction or sensory hierarchy reflecting urgency. The setting supports but does not charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.1)
    The viaduct and wisteria provide vivid sensory anchors early, and the camera obscura is handled in an opening beat. However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics—she moves freely, and the environment offers resources (the tear, the strands) without cost or access friction. The "invisible architecture of emotion" and "silvery strands" function as ornamental metaphor rather than concrete spatial obstacles. Because the setting does not charge the final image or force a trade-off, it remains in the functional-but-passive band.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.1)
    The living bridge garden and hyperbolic geometry are vivid in early description, but neither constrains a choice or charges the final image. The bridge's disintegration is told as transformation, not shown through tactile detail that alters Elara's options. Sensory specificity is present (jasmine scent, crystal streams) but remains postcard-level and does not filter through urgency or professional bias. The halo fragment as micro-setting object is handled twice but without evolving meaning that shapes closure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.1)
    The carnival setting is vividly described ("faded banners fluttering like ghosts," "dusty shelves and broken toys") but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The piano bench matters briefly for the decoding beat, qualifying as micro-setting. The dry soil appears only at the end to receive seeds, without prior establishment as obstacle or resource. Spatial choreography is loose: the guard's position and Elara's chains never materially hinder movement.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.1)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse and shipwrecks are vividly described ("skeletal frames," "silt that held centuries of sorrow," "bitter apples that tasted of regret"), but these details remain postcard texture—no element constrains Elara's choices or alters her tactics. The forge is a static backdrop; the water depth does not limit her movement; the bitter apples are tasted but do not affect her work. Spatial choreography is unclear: the greenhouse is "submerged yet thriving," ringed by shipwrecks, but whether Elara is inside or outside, whether the forge is covered or exposed, remains ambiguous. Sensory detail leans heavily visual/taste without embodied consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.7)
    The emerald station, moonbeams, and flower arrangements are vivid and carry consistent sensory texture. The service corridor disguised by jasmine directly alters the escape tactic, meeting the micro-setting constraint test. However, spatial choreography is loose—crowd density, alcove placement, and guard positions shift to serve plot rather than establishing a legible map. The "verdant tiles," "moonlit facade," and repeated "emerald station by moonlight" feel more painterly than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.4)
    The abandoned control room supplies vivid anchors (grimy windows, dusty panels, frigid air, dripping ice) and the portable furnace constrains her work spatially. The cracked bookmark and cobalt glass rod are handled on the page. However, the environment does not pressure a choice or charge the closure—Elara's departure is not forced by structural danger but declared as future necessity. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (glassblower's priorities), but the setting remains backdrop rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.1)
    The rusted library is vividly sketched ("skeletal structure," "oxidized metal mixed with dry perfume"), but it does not constrain Leo's choices—he kneels, deciphers, leaves, with no spatial friction. The seashell and notes are handled, meeting micro-setting criteria, but the environment itself remains postcard. No gate penalty, but the setting does not charge the final image or alter tactics, capping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.1)
    The storm-tossed ridge fort, single star, and "ambered hush" anchor atmosphere effectively. The booklet is handled twice (placed, pages glow), meeting micro-setting criteria. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; the Oracle's meditation succeeds without spatial friction, leaving setting ornamental at closure and capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.8)
    The frozen courtyard, ice sculpture, and twilight are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (glinting frost, chilling winds, pale hues). The ice violin functions as a recurring object across multiple beats and charges the final moment, satisfying micro-setting criteria. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; J-7's actions proceed unimpeded by cold or spatial layout. Spatial choreography is clear (central sculpture, benches, pathways), but the setting remains postcard description that frames rather than pressures the protagonist's quest.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    The crystal forecourt is rendered with sensory specificity ("slick, dark pavement," "resonant hush," wet surfaces for projection) and returns at closure to host the staff gathering. The lens object is handled across multiple beats (examination, projection onto crystal). However, spatial choreography during the investigation remains generic; we don't feel how the wet crystals or acoustics constrain Elara's movements or choices in real time. The setting stages action but does not pressure a key decision—the tickets could be examined anywhere with light.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.1)
    The garden maze supplies atmospheric detail and recurring imagery (hedges, vines, clearings) but does not constrain a key choice—Elara moves through it without spatial friction or resource scarcity. Sensory detail is generic ("vibrant life coexisted with decay") and not filtered through urgent POV needs. The marbles and maze are described extensively yet function as symbolic set-dressing rather than tactical elements that shape outcomes.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.2)
    The xenobiology station, gas giant, and Mothraals establish a vivid far-future setting with purposeful sensory detail (leathery wings, swirling hues, magnetic nexus). The brass lever and holographic console are handled on the page. However, the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome—the Mothraals' dormancy creates a time window mentioned but not dramatically tested. Spatial choreography is clear, but the setting functions as backdrop rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.1)
    The flooded opera house is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (chest-high water, flickering lanterns, dripping ceiling, half-drowned piano). Spatial choreography is coherent throughout; the environment shapes Elara's movements and constrains her path. The water itself becomes a functional element—she uses it to reveal the code and then slaps it to complete the composition. The setting charges the final image (memorial to lost art) and the micro-setting (orchestra pit pool) drives the climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.7)
    The mountain weather station, botanical illustration, and data console are anchored early and return with purpose. The illustration constrains her final choice (unpinning, studying, re-pinning with acceptance), charging the closure image. Sensory detail is selective: "slick with sweat," "auroral light," "smudge on the screen." The micro-setting (illustration, console, window) functions as the environment that pressures reflection. However, the station itself remains a backdrop; occupational systems (sensor calibration, atmospheric data) are mentioned but not dramatized in ways that alter tactics or complicate the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tunnel setting is vivid and particularized: crumbling bricks, absolute dark, gravel, silt, rusted pipe stub. The beaded valve wheel functions as micro-setting, its "tiny glass beads...for grip in the dark" detail charging the final recognition. The environment constrains movement (reckless navigation, headlamp beam) and the oppressive silence/cold builds atmosphere. The valve wheel's physical presence and Kaelen's gesture of replacing it on the pipe stub anchor the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain choice or charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.1)
    Setting details are vivid and atmospheric (moss, obsidian walls, subterranean river) but remain decorative; the overgrown library and refuge do not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the origami swan as micro-setting object appears multiple times, but it functions as a portal device without pressing the keeper's options. The environment charges mood but does not drive a beat or the final image with cost, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.6)
    Sage Ridge and the oak tree are named but remain postcard generics without sensory particulars or choice-shaping terrain. The eclipse darkens the sky, but no detail of shadow, temperature, or sound affects tactics or charges the moment. The baby hair curl's "softness" is told once without tactile integration into action. The phrase "beneath the hush of dreaming roots" recurs as atmospheric decoration but never constrains movement or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.1)
    The silo library and fireplace anchor space adequately, and "bronze quiet" recurs to sustain atmosphere. However, the tapestry, diaries, and device remain props described rather than handled with tactile constraint: Elian "traces" the tapestry and "activates" the device without spatial choreography, tool mechanics, or environmental friction that alters his attempts. The ending claims the walls "spoke on" but offers no sensory signature or perceptual shift that charges the final image, leaving setting functional but not deeply integrated with choice or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lighthouse is named early and returns in the final third, but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint. No on-page moment shows the rocky island or lantern room altering a choice—spatial details (rowing, entering, sitting) are narrated but do not pressure tactics. The microdot films and fortune cookies are handled in multiple beats, which lifts the score slightly, yet the environment itself remains a static stage rather than a resource or obstacle that shapes the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dimensional anchor is named but not grounded spatially—no walls, light sources, distances, or access points constrain movement. The loop pedal and ultramarine mark are handled on the page and constrain Elian's ritual choices, lifting the score above generic placeholder. Sensory selection remains narrow (sound, light, silence abstracted) without temperature, air quality, or tactile grounding that would charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, and mirrored horizon supply vivid visual anchors early. Prismatic light, cracking ice, and the nautilus shell recur across beats, but none constrains a choice or alters tactics under pressure. The setting functions as backdrop and metaphor rather than as a spatial or material force that shapes the protagonist's options at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.6)
    The viaduct is described with vivid imagery—"rain-slicked stones shimmering," "darkening brightness"—but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. No physical detail (distance, object, or environmental pressure) alters a choice or charges the ending. The setting could be any liminal magical space without structural loss.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cavern setting (shaped wood, stretched hides, hammer tap) anchors early and the phonograph's vibrations through wood constrain Elara's sensory access, charging the transformation. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (she "felt more than heard"). Spatial choreography remains clear across the phonograph corner, workbench, and drum-lined walls. The broken needle pressed into clay at closure supplies a concrete micro-setting payoff that reweights her journey.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.4)
    The courtyard anchors early with selective detail (ivy-covered wall, stone bench, rain gauge) and the dusk-to-night transition mirrors the thematic arc purposefully. The rain gauge and logbooks recur as tools that enable Elara's discovery, constraining her method and charging the workspace. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, the setting does not impose a meaningful constraint at closure; the collaboration could occur anywhere, limiting its role to atmosphere rather than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    The terra-cotta grotto and starlight frame the scene vividly and the rope is handled multiple times, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective ("warm, earthy walls," "cold light," "rough strands") and filtered through Elian's poet perspective. The grotto itself does not constrain a choice—Elian could perform the ritual anywhere—so the setting functions more as atmosphere than tactical pressure. The rope (micro-setting-as-object) does constrain and charges closure, lifting the score into the 7s but not higher.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse and shipwrecks anchor early and recur, but they remain postcard backdrops—Elara never navigates spatial constraints or uses wreckage as a resource that alters tactics. The mendicant's bowl is handled across beats, which elevates the score moderately. Sensory detail is vivid but not filtered through urgency or professional bias; every night feels identically atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.4)
    The amber grotto is vividly described with sensory detail (translucent walls, day's last light, warmth) but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The blotter petal and static electricity are handled as props without spatial pressure—Elara examines the petal and senses the grotto but neither element forces a tactical choice. The setting charges the final image through recurrence but does not shape the protagonist's moves.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.9)
    The breezy library under stars recurs and frames key beats, but remains atmospherically generic without constraining choice or charging the final image with specific sensory detail. Spatial choreography across multiple locations (streets, cottage, library, port events) is competent but the piece does not use environment to pressure decisions. Sensory detail is present ("saltwater stain," "starlit sky") but leans decorative rather than filtered through Elara's professional or personal priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.1)
    The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (faceted gems that chime, dark stone that drinks light). However, the environment remains largely decorative—neither constrains Elara's choices nor supplies resources that alter tactics. The arbor functions as a findable object rather than a space that pressures decision, keeping this just above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rooftop canal system and infinity pendant are named repeatedly and anchor the spatial frame. The canals "stretch like taffy," "waver like a mirage," and provide transit, but they do not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elara rows unhindered. The pendant glows and hums at key beats (beginning, middle, end), charging the final image with its "promise of cycles yet to be sculpted," which creates a lyric reprise. Micro-setting (boat, oar, water) appears but remains largely decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cavern orchard is anchored early with vivid, selective detail: glowing fruits, dripping stalactites, mosaic stepping stone. The drips activate the mosaic in a feedback loop, directly enabling the climactic image of Lyra—environment constrains method and charges the final revelation. Sensory selection (damp soil, nutrient-rich water, chipped tiles) filters through Elian's focus without catalog excess. The setting does functional work tying tool, action, and closure together.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.4)
    The library, crawl spaces, and pipe chases are anchored early and tracked consistently across moves. The ferromagnetic tape and old player provide tactile micro-setting that Kaelen handles in multiple beats, though neither constrains his choices or alters his tactics under pressure. The sapphire hush and flickering lights recur but remain atmospheric decoration rather than shaping decisions. Spatial choreography is coherent but the environment never forces a trade-off or charges the final image with specific cost.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mossy trellis and storm-lashed garden are filtered through Elara's scientist's lens (soil pH, light exposure) and constrain her final choice—she observes the tree's bend rather than rushing to prop it. Sensory detail (petrichor, rain-beaded veins, wet bark) is vivid and selective. The ending image of standing in rain while rebuilding support with fallen branches uses environment to charge closure. However, spatial choreography remains static (trellis → tree, minimal movement), and the setting does not escalate pressure mid-scene; it functions as backdrop until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal island, slick rocks, mud, and rain trails supply vivid, purposeful sensory detail that anchors Kaelen's physical journey and reflects his internal search. The freshly exposed patch of earth and convergence of artifacts charge the discovery beat with specificity. The amber brooch's "golden hue catching the faint light" and the damp outcrop where they sit integrate setting into key moments. The setting constrains Kaelen's movement (trek across slick rocks) and the rain both guides and pressures his quest, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping choice and charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.4)
    The musical crystal cave supplies vivid sensory detail (crystals chime, shadows overlap, downpour inside) and the cave pearl returns with reweighted meaning. Spatial choreography is clean. However, the environment largely decorates rather than constrains: Kaelen could perform the same guidance in any magical space. The overlapping shadows create atmosphere but do not force a tactical trade-off. Meets the mid-band but lacks the irreplaceability for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ivory harbor, rain-slick docks, and dusty archive are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (wet stone clicks, dust motes, fog rolling). However, the environment never constrains a choice or charges the final image—it remains atmospheric backdrop. The trumpet valve's physical presence is noted but not integrated tactilely into Elara's navigation of space. Spatial choreography is coherent, but the setting does not earn its thematic weight through action.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "starlit vault in mist" and "crystalline structures" provide vivid visual detail, but remain postcard description without constraining Elara's choices or altering her tactics. The phantom punch cuts through fog and reveals pathways, yet the mechanics of navigation are told rather than shown through spatial choreography. The cracks forming arrows are mentioned early but do not return to shape the final image, and the "frozen tears" of past seekers remain ornamental rather than a resource or obstacle that affects outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.1)
    The tower is anchored early and returns in the final image ("The tower stood open"), providing spatial coherence. However, the setting remains largely decorative—whales' songs and salt wind supply atmosphere but do not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics. The tile is handled across multiple beats, qualifying as micro-setting, but its mechanics (how the symbols shift, why they glow) are vague and do not shape on-page decisions with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prismatic escondite is vividly described with functional detail (living crystal, magnetic field concentration) and constrains Kaelen's choice by offering the necessary confluence of storm energy. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, the setting does not evolve or charge the final image: the ordinary cave at the end is a reset rather than a transformation that carries forward prior environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.1)
    The funeral home prep room is signaled early and returns with motif language ("deathly vitality," "the prep room hummed"), but it functions primarily as backdrop—no tool, body constraint, or spatial detail pressures Leo's choice in the climax. The ink pot's physical properties (tarnished silver, dried crimson, warmth) are described but never constrain action: Leo could carry any object with the same narrative result. Sensory detail is generic ("stainless steel table," "silence") and not filtered through professional priorities or urgency shifts. The setting does not evolve causally—no object state changes, no spatial choreography matters—and the final image ("closed the door, stepping into the dawn") abandons the prep room without charging it with cost or reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.4)
    The bonsai labyrinth and mountaintop are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (starlight on tiny leaves, blooming miniature grandeur), and the fluorescent lamp becomes a recurring anchor. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elian's process unfolds without spatial friction. The setting charges atmosphere but remains decorative rather than pressing options at closure. Micro-setting (the flat stone, the lamp post) is present but static.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    The shipping-container labyrinth is vividly established and used as both literal setting and metaphor for the protagonist's fragmented mind. Sensory detail (slime-covered pilings, corrugated steel, water lapping) is selective and filtered through the POV. The poison label, a micro-object, returns with reweighted meaning and charges the closure by anchoring the final realization. The setting constrains movement and supplies the discovery beats, meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.1)
    The abandoned observatory on the cliff is anchored early and sensory details (wind, salt, shattered glass) create atmosphere. However, the setting never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome—it functions as backdrop for reflection rather than a crucible. The painted seashell and ephemeral compass are described repeatedly but do not pressure action; the cello leans against the telescope without spatial consequence. Micro-setting does not charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.7)
    The carnival setting is vivid and sensory (fried dough, salt, sea spray, magenta paint on damp wall), and the raft city's aesthetic becomes a tactical shield for coded messages. Spatial choreography (outer docks, main thoroughfare, carnival alleys) remains coherent throughout. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; while the wall's dampness and carnival's chaos enable Elara's method, no environmental constraint narrows her final choice or charges the closure image with tactical cost. Sensory detail reflects her priorities (culture shock absorber scanning for surfaces) but doesn't force a micro-decision at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    The moonlit summit is anchored early with vivid, purposeful detail: low gravity affects movement, the terminator line advances, the crater's bowl-shaped depression is framed. Sensory detail (suit hum, silence, first sliver of sunlight) is selective and POV-filtered. The hourglass grain and camera constrain the final act, and the environment's dawn progression drives the timed sequence. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, meeting the micro-setting standard for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.1)
    The mist-coated rail depot anchors place and tone early, and the Aethel's visible anchor-lift provides spatial reference. However, the workshop interior remains generic ("tools and half-mended devices") and the water bowl—central to her method—is a shallow prop that never constrains her movement or choice. Sensory detail leans visual despite Elara's blindness; her tactile perception of "minute changes in temperature and energy" through light refraction is asserted but not dramatized through choice or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rusted outpost and frozen lake are described vividly ("metallic decay," "white desert under a pallid sky"), and the fissure becomes a micro-setting constraint at the end. However, setting detail is front-loaded and then static; the trek to the center and the discovery feel spatially vague—steam curls from stone, but we don't feel proximity, cold resistance, or Elias's bodily negotiation of the ice. The condensation on glass is the strongest environmental actor, guiding his interpretation and final choice, which elevates the score modestly.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    The archway, cobblestones, and tuning fork are vivid and purposefully recurrent. The ebony fork's warming ("grew warm in his hand") subtly signals work completed, and the cobblestones' gleaming marks the town's response to Elian's rhythm. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. However, no environmental feature constrains a choice or alters Elian's tactics—he walks, strikes, listens, and succeeds without friction from the setting. The archway functions as symbolic anchor rather than a resource or obstacle that shapes outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.9)
    The underwater temple's "grand architecture," "soft phosphorescence," and vaulted ceiling are vivid and consistent. The locking mechanism (levers, crystalline rods) directly constrains Kaelen's choice to slow down despite oxygen alarm, meeting the Q3 9+ gate test for constraint. However, spatial choreography remains vague—distances, room transitions, and the path back are sketched rather than tracked, and the "dome where the gathered hush coalesced" materializes without prior setup. Sensory detail is weighted heavily visual; no taste of salt water, tactile cold through the glove, or pressure gradient as he swims back.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.7)
    The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, and copperlight repose create vivid atmosphere. The lattice's crosshatched pattern and door scuffs guide passage, fulfilling the micro-setting function. However, the labyrinth itself remains abstract—"maze of lies and half-truths"—without spatial stakes or obstacles that force tactical choices. The beacon chamber appears late with minimal constraint on prior moves. Sensory detail (salt air, metallic glow) supports tone but does not alter Kaelen's options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.4)
    The greenhouse is vivid (luminescent fruits, glass panes, twisting branches) and the endless night frames tone, but setting does not constrain a tactical choice or charge the final image—Elian could complete this arc in any isolated space. Spatial choreography is clean (rows, shelf, fields beyond). The carved stone bead (a micro-object) reappears and is placed on a shelf, but this is ceremonial rather than a move that alters options. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful without becoming a checklist.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.4)
    The centuries-old labyrinth and red canyon walls provide vivid anchoring detail early, and the "damp hollows," "rubble," and "faded symbols" add texture to the central chamber. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop: no spatial constraint narrows Elara's options, and the "overlapping sleepwalking paths" remain abstract rather than concretely mapped on the page. The storybook plate glows and hums but does not alter her route or force a tactical choice. The final image—light filling the chamber—reweights the setting thematically but does not depend on a specific spatial or material constraint that shaped the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered with strong sensory particulars (gnarled apple trees, roots snaking between bones, sealed clay vessel). Spatial choreography remains coherent across the excavation beats. The sundial's shadow pointing to a specific tree provides a concrete constraint that advances the plot. However, the setting does not pressure Elara's choices—she encounters no physical obstacles, resource limits, or environmental resistance that alter her tactics or shape the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.1)
    The golden arcade is vividly described with selective sensory detail (brass arches, smooth tiles, dawn light) and the ebony clipboard recurs as a tactile anchor. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome—it functions as atmospheric backdrop. Spatial choreography is clear. The micro-setting (arcade, clipboard, chalk) is present but does not pressure tactics or charge the closure image beyond decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Cobalt Observatory is anchored early with sensory particulars: autumn leaves, stone courtyard, the great dome's "echoed silence," and the Eternal Candle's single flame casting constellation-mimicking shadows. The candle constrains her focus ("steady her thoughts") and charges the final image when she extinguishes it, altering the space from illuminated sanctuary to weaponized darkness. Spatial choreography is clear (courtyard, dome interior, doorway, niche high on wall). Micro-setting qualifies: the candle and embroidery hoop function as tools that shape her method and final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mangrove labyrinth, aerial roots, waxy leaves, and moonlight are vividly rendered with strong sensory detail (humid air, murky water, shimmering spirit forms). The shard constrains one choice—its healing energy "knitting together the frayed edges of her spirit"—and charges the final image when it goes "cool and inert, its purpose fulfilled," satisfying the 9+ gate partially. However, spatial choreography within the labyrinth remains vague; we never learn how depth, distance, or the root-chamber's layout affect her path or decisions. The setting guides mood more than it shapes tactical movement or forecloses options; the "roots parting to reveal a path out" is convenience rather than earned navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.1)
    The mist-clad atrium is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (bruised purple light, vapor curling, marble benches, ferns). Spatial choreography is stable and the brain coral fragment returns as a tactile anchor. However, the setting does not constrain choice or supply resources that alter Elara's decryption work; it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure vessel. The body (drugged, floating) is described but does not limit her mental process in a way that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.9)
    The ruined orchard district is vividly established (skeletal tree, crumbling walls, perpetual fog) and sensory detail is purposeful. The fresco fragment and prism/algae tools constrain Elara's light-painting method, charging the final image when phantom orchard blooms. Spatial choreography is clean. However, the fog itself—a centuries-thick blanket—functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active constraint that alters a choice in the closure beat, limiting high-band eligibility.

    The Sound Wave Garden is vivid and purposeful: the central crystal, sonic flora, and reflected sound waves shape multiple beats (prying the coin, tapping the crystal, the garden's response). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the restorer's professional lens. The hobo nickel functions as a micro-object that charges the final image, and the mural itself evolves causally. Setting constrains early exploration and pressures the ending, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but spatial choreography remains abstract—Elara's position relative to mural, crystal, and garden boundaries is never clarified.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.8)
    The greenhouse setting is vivid with sensory specificity (humid, chirping crickets, iridescent beetles, vines twisting). However, it functions primarily as backdrop; the plants shift due to "energy distortion" but this doesn't constrain Elara's choices in a legible way. The gourd rattle seed as micro-object does return and constrain one choice (scattering seeds to reinforce the signal), lifting the score slightly. Spatial choreography during the enforcers' entrance is unclear—where were they hiding, how did the gap in foliage suddenly appear?

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.1)
    The gargantuan shell supplies vivid phrases ("pearlescent arches," "reef-shadow joy") and functions as recurring anchor, but it never constrains a choice or alters tactics—the poet simply dwells and writes without spatial pressure. Sensory detail is filtered through elevated diction rather than POV-specific perception, and the setting remains static across the entire span. The galaxy postcard and shell reappear in the final image, lending modest resonance, but neither object forces a trade-off or charges the closure with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.4)
    The opal library, glass orchids, and wind chime are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (translucent petals, shifting light, frozen milk clouds). Spatial choreography is clear through the ascent and descent. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics in a meaningful way—Elara's path is determined by knowledge (the tablet) rather than by spatial or material friction.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.7)
    The archive is anchored with sensory detail (towering shelves, flickering candle, oak desk) and the glass ink well functions as a tool that constrains Elara's method. However, the space itself doesn't pressure her choices—she works uninterrupted in a sanctuary that remains static. The final beat where "the archive seemed to breathe" and "the door creaked open" provides minimal environmental participation in the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.7)
    The volcanic amphitheater is vividly anchored with breathing cycles, basalt blocks, black ash, and carved benches; sensory detail (tremor, dust, warmth) is selective and integrated. However, the environment remains scenic: the building's breath complicates Elara's work but does not constrain a pivotal choice or materially alter her tactics. The surveyor's chain and hidden compartment offer micro-setting touches, yet neither forces a trade-off. Spatial choreography (stage, loose block, floodgates) is clear but underutilized for pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.1)
    The attic skylight and dust-mote mapping recur but remain decorative; they never constrain a choice or alter tactics. Spatial choreography is vague—pigeons, letters, and the meteorite chip float without tactile handling or positional clarity. The bookshop setting anchors genre atmosphere but does not pressure decisions; no object or environmental feature shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "drifting prism terrace" supplies vivid imagery (crystalline planes, rainbow shards, fractured light) and the oak bench provides a tactile anchor for the grain-analysis action. However, the setting never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters Elara's path—she could perform the same analysis anywhere. Spatial choreography is minimal; the terrace drifts passively without affecting tactics. The luminous threshold at the end is introduced late and crossed without friction, functioning as backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.6)
    The underwater facility is anchored with concrete detail (control room, curved glass, dusty console, library datapads) and the bioluminescent organisms provide sensory texture. However, the setting remains largely postcard description; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Spatial choreography is clean and the environment evolves (darkness to bioluminescence to sunrise), but the facility functions as backdrop rather than pressure on Elara's tactics or final image.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.1)
    The iridescent cave and crater glass are vividly described and anchor the scene throughout. The glowing seeds connect to the crystalline walls in a purposeful way that affects Kaelen's method of discovery. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint forces a difficult choice or alters tactics. The final image of "shimmering memories" charges atmosphere but does not redirect action.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.1)
    The tidal arcade under stars is vividly rendered with salt-laced wind, stone arches, lighthouse beam, and scattered rose petals. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elara executes her plan without spatial friction, and the environment serves as backdrop rather than pressure. The bishop placed on a ledge and the wind's predicted path show setting awareness, but these are implemented without obstacle, keeping the score in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.1)
    The twilight garden is anchored early with sensory detail (damp grass, emerging stars), and the moonstone dust is handled twice (summoned, then settled). However, the setting never constrains a choice or supplies a tactical complication; it remains a beautiful stage. The "gaps between constellations" are observed but their mechanics don't shape an attempt that fails or succeeds under pressure. Spatial choreography is clean, and the repeated star imagery does return in the final lines, lending modest resonance without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.3)
    Setting details are vivid and purposeful: mist coiling at ankles, prism atrium floating "like a ghost," concentric rings on the pond. The pond and pebble function as micro-setting that enables the communion ritual, and the sun's breakthrough transforms the atrium into a spectacle of color. Spatial choreography is clear (damp planks → atrium → pond center). The dawn timeframe and the dredging project anchor urgency, and the prism ceiling's geometry charges the final image. Minor deduction: the setting primarily enables reflection rather than constraining a choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.1)
    The moonlit ridge path is vividly described with selective sensory detail (gravel scuff, silvered ribbon, cool air on scars). The porcelain box functions as a micro-setting element, handled across multiple beats and charging the final image. However, neither environment nor object constrains a choice—Elara's walk and meditation proceed unimpeded. The setting provides atmospheric support but does not alter tactics or pressure a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tide-polished grotto is vividly established ("cavern smoothed by centuries of gentle sea caresses, its walls gleaming with wet light") and anchors the action throughout. Sensory detail—brass cool against skin, luminous kelp, the hum of energy—is concrete and filtered through Elara's purpose. The setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics, but the grotto's serene quality mirrors and supports the tone. Spatial choreography is clear; the grotto functions as a legible container for the ritual without becoming a mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ivy-veiled passage, damp earth scent, moss-covered stone, and cold fireplace provide vivid sensory anchors filtered through Elara's professional lens. The corridor's physical details (ivy trembling, walls pulsing) appear but function as atmospheric markers rather than constraining choice or shaping tactics. The fireplace serves as a discovery site but does not pressure Elara's movements or options; spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.1)
    The terrace, parapet, and prismatic moisture are vividly described and filter through Lyra's perceptual priorities. However, the environment remains a static backdrop—no spatial constraint forces a tactical choice, and the final image does not charge setting details with new meaning. Sensory selection is consistent but ornamental; the world does not push back.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.8)
    The ancient terrace is described early with sensory detail (warm stones, fading mosaics, cracks). However, it functions as backdrop rather than constraint; Elara could perform this ritual anywhere sacred. The clipboard's "ebony wood" and "silvery runes" are mentioned repeatedly but never alter a tactic—she traces runes, holds it, drops it. The celestial convergence is noted but doesn't pressure the timing of her choices; she begins chanting as moons "drew closer," without urgency or a ticking consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.1)
    The salt flat is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (crystalline crust, coarse salt crunching, blanched earth) and the cracks function as both map and metaphor. The setting constrains movement (he follows the crack-map to the epicenter) and charges the final image (rain washing salt from his hands). However, no tactile interaction with the environment alters a mid-scene choice; the flat is stage rather than obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    The silver courtyard under snow is established early and returns at closure, and the snowfall and starlight charge several beats. Spatial anchors are clear (courtyard, kneeling, frozen ground), and the final image—"silver courtyard lay behind her, silent and serene, but forever altered"—attempts to charge the setting with consequence. However, the environment never constrains a tactic or forces a trade-off; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dome is vividly sketched ("vast, curved structure," "metallic skin," "acoustic oddities") and recurs throughout, but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no environmental feature alters Elara's choices or tactics. The campfire story stick is handled multiple times and charges the final packing image, lifting the score slightly. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through POV ("grain," "ink pots," "stars visible through cracks"), though the setting never pressures a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.7)
    The verdant grotto is vividly rendered with moss, stone, mist, and cloud proximity. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Elian's reverence. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it serves as a stage for contemplation rather than a pressure point. The moth wing and arch function as micro-setting objects, but their handling is ritualistic rather than choice-forcing, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.4)
    The icebound sanctum and aurora are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (frigid air, prismatic sparks, glistening walls). The ceremonial rope functions as a tactile, hands-on object that enables the central action. However, the environment does not constrain choice—the sanctum facilitates rather than resists, and no environmental detail forces Elara to adapt tactics or pay a spatial price at closure. Strong description but lacks the pressure-test needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    The vine-draped bunker and approaching storm provide vivid, purpose-driven atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective: "scent of wet earth and ozone," "vines scraping against the bunker's metal door." The wafer seal functions as micro-setting object, handled twice (initial focus, final dissolution), and its crumbling directly enables the gateway. The storm's arrival at the closure beat charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion. However, spatial choreography of the dream-stones arrangement and the protagonist's movement through the bunker could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.6)
    The reimagined Babylonian palace supplies vivid anchors—ziggurats, mosaics, lavender sky, dusky observatory—and the magic square tile and floor mosaic physically constrain Aris's ritual choreography at closure. Spatial staging is coherent (corridors → central observatory) and the tile's alignment with constellations provides tactical micro-setting. However, the environment does not force a difficult choice or scarcity; it remains a backdrop that enables rather than pressures, keeping the score in mid-band despite solid descriptive work.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "soundless sanctuary" is evocatively named and the silence device (mental projection) is established early. However, the space functions as backdrop rather than constraint—it doesn't pressure Elara's tactics or Kael's resistance in concrete ways. The "non-light" and "serene void" remain abstract; no sensory hierarchy or spatial choreography tracks their movements. The setting supplies atmosphere but doesn't shape the pivotal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.1)
    The fog, mirrors, and twilight frost create a vivid sensory envelope. The broken sextant and mirror circle shape the ritual spatially. However, the glass mountains remain abstract ("transparent slopes rising into the sky") without micro-setting details that constrain a choice or alter tactics. The final mirror captures the dream but does not charge the closure image with environmental cost or specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.1)
    The orchard-in-rafters image is vivid and purposeful, anchoring the setting early and returning at closure ("dew on the orchard leaves"). Spatial choreography is clear—cathedral, crypt, altar, orchard—and the mossy altar functions as a micro-setting that charges the offering. However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choices; the orchard "whispers" and "thrives" as backdrop rather than obstacle. The crypt's rubble and the bag's contents are tools retrieved without difficulty, not environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.4)
    The astral orchard is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (ozone, pearlescent paths, luminous fruits) and the crystalline bathroom provides a contained micro-setting for reflection. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop. The cameo's physicality (pistachio shell, smooth surface, odd heaviness) is noted but does not charge the final image or shape tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.6)
    The labyrinthine bookstore occupying an entire mountain is evocative but remains a postcard backdrop; spatial choreography is vague (how do aisles twist? where is the horticulture wing relative to biography?). The floating-books chamber and the botanical diary constrain one beat each, but the environment never pressures a choice at closure—the doorway simply "shimmers into existence" when the ritual completes. Sensory detail is sparse and generic ("dusty alcove," "glowing tomes") without POV-filtered specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.1)
    The carnival ship, fog, and weathered carousel horse anchor the scene with vivid sensory detail. The emerald swatch card's glow and the fog's thickening create atmospheric texture. However, the setting remains largely postcard—description does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The final "clearing" where the garden appears is spatial hand-waving rather than earned geography, preventing higher-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.1)
    The clock tower mechanism room is vivid and specific: "labyrinth of brass and iron," ceremonial rope "coiled near the central pendulum," gears that "groaned in sympathy." The rope's physical presence enables the climactic action (reconfiguring braids), and the pendulum's proximity matters. The setting constrains movement and supplies the ritual tool, lifting this into the 7+ band despite the lack of deeper occupational systems or spatial friction that would test higher.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.1)
    Harmonic caves provide vivid sensory anchors (chaotic resonance, frozen tears, ice patterns) and constrain Elara's method—she must read cracks to restore balance. The echo chamber stone functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (cave walls, niche, her kneeling position). The ice cracks enable her conjuring and their gleaming luminescence at the end reconfigures the space. Environment actively shapes tactics and the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glass pavilion's hum and the prism fragments are vivid and recurring, and the setting provides the tools (notched brass instruments, stone table) that Elara uses at closure. Sensory detail is purposeful—"edges sharp and cloudy," "violet" sky—and filtered through her mission. The pavilion's harmony with the light in the final beat charges the ending image. Minor slack: the "fused silica" and "colossal lens" descriptions front-load world detail without immediate pressure, and spatial choreography during the alignment could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    The stormlit observatory, solid fog, and crystal forecourt are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (luminous panels, whispers rising "like steam"). Shadow measurements at three monuments provide spatial choreography that tracks cleanly. The environment does not meaningfully constrain a choice—he examines each monument without obstacle—but the final image of fog shimmering in response to epiphany charges the setting modestly. Micro-setting (the stone bench, the obelisk) is present but does not alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    The fortress anchors vividly (jasmine, cereus, phoenix mosaic), and the kerosene rag's scent and weight are specific. The starless night and blooming petals charge the final image with purposeful contrast. However, the setting does not constrain choice—Elian moves through it unopposed, and no environmental feature alters his tactics or imposes cost. The mosaic's glow is descriptive payoff rather than a lever that changes options.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.1)
    The grotto, stars, and tidal pools are vividly rendered and anchor the scene throughout. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (cool jade, gritty sand, fluid tide), filtered through Elara's professional lens. However, the setting functions primarily as thematic backdrop rather than constraint: no spatial element forces a tactical choice or alters the conversation's outcome. The hermit crab and pools serve as metaphor rather than micro-setting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bunker's oppressive walls and the xenial trellis are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory selection (glowing strands, warm stillness, inverted landscapes). Spatial choreography during the ascent is clear, and the tether functions as micro-setting that constrains action. The trellis itself does not pressure a choice—it welcomes Elara without friction—so environment constrains only during transit, not at the closure image. The collection vial and doll are handled tactilely, charging the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "drifting prism terrace" supplies vivid visual detail (crystalline platforms, refracted rainbows, pastel hues) and anchors place early. However, the setting remains a backdrop; it neither constrains Elara's choices nor charges the final image—she could perform identical actions in any quiet location. The storm glass vial and gondola are mentioned but do not shape tactics or outcome, keeping the piece in the functional but replaceable band.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.1)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall, hidden orchard, and cavern staircase are vividly described and serve as waypoints. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop: the waterfall shields but does not complicate entry, the orchard supplies no resource tension, and spatial choreography is clean but the environment does not constrain Elara's choices. The ruby flake guides movement, but the walls, murals, and pavilion are static rather than interactive obstacles. Sensory selection is broad (iridescent hues, luminescent fruit, crimson glow) yet remains at the level of catalog rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ashen sanctuary and starlight anchor atmosphere effectively. The doorknocker ring is a concrete object that charges one beat (the chime), and the charcoal dust is mentioned at the invitation. However, none of these constrain a choice or alter tactics; they remain backdrop. The gate for 9+ (environment/object constrains choice or charges final image) is not met, capping the score below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.4)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vividly rendered ("shifting blue and green patterns," "shadowseam wonder") and brackets the story effectively. However, it functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no choice depends on the fungi's properties or the lab's layout. The porthole bolt is handled across multiple beats and charges the final image, qualifying as micro-setting that carries some weight. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.1)
    The sepia reading room is mentioned repeatedly but never constrains a choice or charges the final image—it remains postcard description. "Golden shadows" recur as ornament without tactical pressure. The gramophone is handled twice (wound, then still), meeting minimal micro-setting use, which lifts the score slightly. Spatial choreography is vague (the window's position, the table's distance), and no sensory detail beyond the visual appears to ground the protagonist's state.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.9)
    The alchemical orchard is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (luminescent fruits, silver branches, shimmering air) that reflects the mystical tone. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the greenhouse does not constrain Alaric's choices or supply resources that alter his approach—he moves freely, the program is simply found, and the orchard's "approval" at the end is passive. The spatial choreography is coherent, and the void overhead and endless night anchor the atmosphere, but the environment does not pressure the outcome. The program and orb are handled on the page, which provides some micro-setting function, but neither object's physical properties shape a tactic under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.6)
    The file room is anchored early with "towering shelves," "wooden desk," and "brittle" bindings that constrain Elara's careful movements. Dust patterns function as micro-setting, shaping her investigative method and charging the discovery beats. The veteran's archive appears late without spatial grounding, and the display case materializes conveniently at the end. Sensory detail is selective (tarnished button, crackling paper, "cool, metallic surface") and filtered through archival priorities, but the room itself never pressures a choice—it supplies resources without imposing friction or access limits that would alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.6)
    The auric lagoon and phone booth appear but do not constrain choice—Kael inserts the key, hears voices, records them, and leaves without spatial friction or resource limit. Sensory detail is generic ("faint gold," "weeping willows," "luminous depths") and filtered through tourism rather than POV urgency. The puddle-map is asserted as guidance but never shown altering a tactic or route on the page. No environment, body, tool, or recurring object demonstrably narrows options or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.4)
    The radiant grotto, prism atrium, and morning fog are vividly rendered with sensory specificity—dewdrops on ferns, mist swirling, light pulsing—and the grotto functions as a micro-setting that frames the ritual. The atrium's light patterns "resist" and "flicker," creating a quasi-antagonistic environment that Elias must counter, which crosses the threshold from postcard to pressure. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics in a legible way; the grotto reacts to his music but does not force him to adapt his method or confront a spatial problem. The final image ("radiant grotto and prism atrium would wait") charges the closure with place-specificity, lifting the score into the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ashen skyborne arbor is visually evocative but functions as backdrop rather than constraint: branches, leaves, and moss appear in description without shaping Elara's choices or altering her tactics. Spatial choreography is vague—we never know where she stands, how she moves among branches, or what physical limits the arbor imposes. The setting greens in response to her work, but this change is told in summary ("grey branches to sprout vibrant green") rather than shown through concrete sensory detail that charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.1)
    The neglected greenhouse, subterranean waterfall, and grotto are vividly rendered with sensory detail (perfume of rot, mist rainbows, glowing moss). However, these settings function primarily as stages for discovery rather than constraining Elara's choices—she navigates them without spatial friction or resource limitation that alters tactics. The compass and key enable rather than complicate, so the micro-setting credit remains mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rain-washed foundry is not mere postcard: "cold forges and rain-slicked anvils" become her laboratory, and the coin placed on the central worktable anchors the spatial choreography. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"thin, gray light," "shimmering, verifiable heat patterns," "soft, internal light"—and filtered through Elara's alchemical priorities. The crack in the coin and the gold repair are tactile and charged, constraining her approach (she risks the coin's stability) and charging the final image. The foundry's physical specificity shapes her choices and the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.1)
    Echo Gorge is named and described (whispering walls, amplifying silence, golden rays) but functions as postcard backdrop; no spatial constraint alters Elara's choices. The harp and crocodile's tooth are handled on the page (set on rock, traced in air, clutched), satisfying micro-setting presence. The hidden sunrise bookends the piece and modulates light (chill → golden rays), charging the final image with tonal shift. However, the gorge's acoustics never complicate the spectral summoning or force a tactical adjustment, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ultraviolet forest is vivid and consistently filtered through Kaelen's enhanced proprioception: glowing glass-barked trees, violet light as "low-grade burn," black water under the canopy. Sensory hierarchy is strong—pain coordinates and pressure dominate perception. The stream and found strap function as micro-setting beats that constrain choice minimally but charge the final image. The forest pressures mood more than tactics; it watches but does not force a navigational or resource trade-off that alters the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.4)
    The alchemist's market is vividly rendered with swaying rope bridges, glowing elixirs, and ozone-thick air, and the lighthouse cliff in the vision is tangibly storm-lashed. The lens fragment is handled in multiple beats (pocket, hums in resonance, grows warm, pulses) and functions as a micro-setting anchor. However, neither the market nor the fragment constrains a choice or alters Elara's tactics; she moves freely from stall to vision to city without spatial pressure. The setting enriches atmosphere but does not drive the stakes or charge the final image with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.2)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly sketched with faded posters, overhead fluorescent buzz, and dusty surfaces. Spatial choreography (ladder, ceiling, rafters) remains clear throughout. The mainspring barrel and dust patterns function as micro-setting elements that guide Leo's investigation, but the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—it serves as backdrop rather than crucible. The setting earns functional credit but does not reach the constraint/charge threshold for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.1)
    The glass orchard library and sea of clouds establish a vivid, purposeful frame. The bottled whisper's "misting over with chill of contained potential" offers sensory specificity. However, the setting remains largely descriptive; spatial choreography during the rupture (books sliding, branches twisting) does not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics. The frost patterns guide the glyph sequence, providing one causal link, but the environment otherwise serves as backdrop rather than pressuring decisions at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.1)
    The baroque asteroid, visible time strands, and ion storms create a vivid conceptual setting, and the mirror-covering practice recurs with purpose. The crystal shard constrains Elara's experiment and charges the final museum image, meeting the micro-setting test. However, spatial choreography remains vague—her study, the dig sites, and the museum blur together without tactical grounding—and the "baroque" descriptor is never made concrete through architecture or lived detail.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.1)
    The resonance chamber amplifies sound and vibrates during the song, providing minimal setting constraint. The music box and philosopher's stone chip are handled across multiple beats and return at closure, qualifying as micro-setting objects. However, spatial choreography is vague—no clear sense of room layout, exits, or how the townsman's entrance affects proximity or tool placement. The chamber does not meaningfully constrain Elian's choices or alter his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is vivid and multi-sensory: granite quarry, limestone cliffs, stalactites, obsidian-black lagoon water "shockingly cold." The lagoon functions as more than backdrop—it charges the closure image (reflections of lost men, compass pointing inward) and the petrichor intensifies as she descends, guiding her choice. Spatial choreography is clear (fissure entrance, narrow tunnel, broader chamber, dome ceiling). The factory siren bookends time and the mechanical/natural contrast supports theme without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.4)
    The storm-tossed archway is vivid (groaning stone, stinging rain, turbine-hum) and returns at the ending to frame her departure. The van workbench and the driftwood's "gnarled form" shape her method. However, spatial choreography is vague—she pries the slide free, returns "through the stinging rain," then the slide projects "against the van's wall" without clear staging of her position or the light source. The archway's "turbine-hum" functions more as atmospheric label than constraint; it wraps her in trance but never forces a tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    The amber pavilion, cathedral, and garden are vividly rendered with sensory detail (frost, stained glass patterns, autumn leaves). Setting provides atmospheric specificity and the cathedral window's mechanics matter to the discovery. However, the environment does not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics—she moves freely between locations, and no spatial or resource limitation complicates her quest. The pavilion functions as backdrop rather than crucible; the children wander in without spatial resistance, and the mural's creation encounters no material obstacle tied to the setting itself.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.1)
    The obsidian lagoon and beach debris create vivid sensory anchors ("grains of sand between her toes," "surface so still it seemed like black glass"). The floating library zeppelin is mentioned but remains postcard description without constraining choices. Spatial choreography within the vision is coherent, though the transition back to the library feels abrupt and ungrounded.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.1)
    The paper-lantern cove is named and revisited frequently, and the lanterns receive a purposeful reprise (decorations → solar collectors → glowing workshops). However, the setting remains postcard-level description; no spatial choreography or environmental constraint pressures a single on-page choice. The amber bottle is handled twice (carried, then placed as a centerpiece) but its "sealed nature" never materially alters Elian's tactics—it functions as thematic symbol only.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ancient orchard atop a skyscraper is vivid and the intertwining roots anchor spatial texture. Sensory details (wax curls, rustle of leaves, distant city hum) are selective and layered into action. However, the garden does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters Elian's tactics; it remains atmospheric rather than causally active at closure, capping the score below 7.0 despite strong descriptive work.

    The icebound atrium under starlight is signaled early and maintained consistently; the frozen flora, frosted dome, and silver glow create a coherent sensory frame. The setting constrains the action (cold vigils, egg-hatching ritual) and the starlight motif bookends the piece, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (Elara holds the egg, places the cap, seeds in orbits, portal on far wall). Micro-setting (the acorn cap as tool) shapes the central ritual, satisfying the 9+ gate. However, the atrium's ice and cold do not constrain a choice or alter tactics in a felt way—description remains somewhat postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.1)
    The windblown sanctuary and cathedral bell rope anchor setting and recur at closure, satisfying the micro-setting test. Sensory detail is present (wind, pressure drop, bell chime) and the bell's sound carries tactical weight. However, much description remains postcard-level—"above the clouds," "stone parapets"—without filtering through Elara's professional or personal priorities under pressure. The sanctuary's spatial layout (where sensors sit, how the bell rope relates to the siren lever) never becomes tactile enough to constrain her movements.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.1)
    The shooting star tracking station is anchored early with clear spatial markers (dome, viewport, corridors, console). Sensory detail leans heavily visual ("golden trails," "cascading lights") with minimal tactile or auditory grounding. The yellow lantern glass object appears in multiple beats but functions as a passive lens rather than constraining a choice. The setting does not pressure Kael's actions; he could conduct his reflection anywhere. Micro-setting potential (the glass, the console) is present but underutilized in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.1)
    The oasis setting (hives, honey house, scorched wasteland frame) is vivid and integrated into early atmosphere. The stained glass box appears in multiple beats and carries sensory detail (warmth, scent of honey). However, neither environment nor object constrains a tactical choice—the recluse's actions (watching, opening the box) are unimpeded by spatial or material limits. Micro-setting allowance applies, but without choice-constraint the 9+ gate is missed; cap at 8.8 per the quick test, and accumulated minor issues (generic "green embrace," "deep resonant stillness") lower the band to mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.1)
    The emerald silo is vivid in color and hum but remains a static backdrop; its labyrinth interior never constrains a choice. The urn fragment is handled twice (discovery, examination with Leo) and its "cool surface" charges one moment, pushing the score just into functional range. Garage sales are mentioned but not staged on the page, weakening the setting's causal role. The "Great Shift" world rule is declared but never shown affecting action.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cobalt lagoon and rain-washed air are vivid and consistent. The drake's tail feather is handled twice and used to teach the child, giving it modest pressure. Spatial choreography remains clear. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions primarily as backdrop for the poet's aesthetic demonstration. The feather charges the final image weakly, resting "silent witness" rather than forcing a tradeoff or reweighting prior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.1)
    The living stone pillars that hum and shift, the copper-clad oak, and the crystalline veins provide tactile, specific anchors that recur across beats and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—orchard center, young oak between pillars, systematic repetition throughout the grove. The micro-setting (copper wire, oak branches, stone surface) constrains Elara's method and pays off when birds nest in crystalline formations. Minor issue: the temple's "ancient energy" and "sacred grove" labels lean generic in early exposition, but the materiality of wire and stone compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rainwashed tower and overgrown sculpture path are rendered with vivid, selective detail ("stones dark and gleaming," "strangled by ivy," "bronze quiet"). Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's scientific focus: she notices molecular patterns more vividly than weather. The fly amber charges the closure image, functioning as micro-setting that enables the climactic revelation. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the journey and tower interior.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.1)
    The blooming jetty, glowing flowers, and dead reef provide a vivid backdrop, and sensory details (twilight, birds, soil) are filtered through the coachman's purposeful attention. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—he kneels, plants, and leaves without spatial friction. The jetty functions as a stage rather than a crucible. The final image of flowers nodding charges the setting lyrically but does not tie it to a pivotal decision.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.1)
    The scrapyard setting is vividly particular ("eviscerated train cars," "cracked wasteland") and constrains the final choice: leaving sanctuary for hostile terrain. The phonograph cylinder and leaf function as micro-setting objects that charge the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("red and gold hues blazing in dim light"), though the wild hush motif occasionally drifts into abstract atmosphere rather than concrete environmental pressure. Spatial choreography (cabin, shelf, table, threshold) remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.7)
    The observation deck, time dilation effects, and the station's dormant state are vividly rendered and shape the narrative atmosphere. The gilded compass rose applique recurs across the text with purposeful weight. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraining a choice or charging the final image in a way that would reach the 7+ threshold. Spatial choreography is clear, and sensory details (echoed silence, liquid constellation drift) support tone, but the environment does not force a tactical decision at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.1)
    The icebound spire, blue ice platform, and "wrong sky" with violet smears and green halo provide vivid, purposeful anchoring. The pocket sundial lid clicks into place on the ice pedestal, a tactile detail that charges the ritual moment. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the ascent and summit encounter. The setting constrains the action (sheer faces, windswept platform, thinning air) and the sundial pedestal becomes a functional prop that enables the closure beat, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.4)
    The whispering gallery is vivid and functional: echoes carry her spelled words and amplify the mantra, constraining her method. The pawn-less chessboard appears twice and charges the final image by shifting from "lack" to "potential," meeting the micro-setting gate. Sensory detail is selective (marble floor, curved walls, "smooth wood"), though the interregnum itself remains abstract—no street-level grounding or social texture. Spatial choreography is clear. The environment shapes her ritual but does not force a tactical choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.1)
    The mountain bookstore and mercury-glass pools are vivid early, and the stone's obsidian texture is noted. However, setting details become ornamental in the second half—shelves "shifting" and "hidden thunder" operate as metaphor rather than spatial constraint. The feather's texture is mentioned but does not alter a tactic or complicate a choice on the page. Micro-setting (body, tool, object) is present but does not charge the final image in a way that would lift the score into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.4)
    The time-frozen village is vividly evoked ("woven hush," suspended leaves) and the platinum labyrinth is handled twice (first as a reminder, then as a puzzle). The tapestry's frayed threads supply a method and sensory anchor. However, the environment does not constrain Elian's choices—no clock pressure, no denied path, no resource scarcity. The setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a force that shapes tactics or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.1)
    The canyon, bone towers, and pale spire create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that filters through the ritualistic frame. The echoes function as both setting and mechanism, shaping the refractive effect and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (listeners gathered, Elara moving among them), and the mist-shrouded spire anchors the closure moment, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrains or charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.1)
    The acid sea and gears-and-cogs workshop are vividly sketched—"green-tinged waters," "brass mechanisms whirred and clicked," "corrosive vapors"—and the setting provides tactile constraint (acid stings, hull groans, platform lowers). The statue's pockmarks function as both setting detail and plot key, shaping the method. However, the workshop itself remains largely decorative after the opening; Elian could perform the same dive from any floating structure. The body and the charm constrain the final choice minimally, keeping this in the solid mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    The coastal cave network constrains the revelation: light through fissures, the pool's reflection, and the natural rock shelf all guide Elara's final choice. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her nostalgic lens (brine, ancient stone, shifting patterns). The cave's architecture—hidden entrance, secluded chamber—directly enables the discovery and charges the closure image. Micro-setting (the pool, the rock shelf) functions as an active agent in the realization beat.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    The cobalt lighthouse, spiral staircase, lamp room, and garden are vivid and purposeful. The vial and cork function as micro-setting that constrains the ritual's choreography. Sensory detail (jasmine, damp soil, morning light absorbed in cobalt walls) is filtered through Elara's focus and supports the tone. The brother's ship setting is generic and his sensory anchor (garden scent on salt air) arrives without spatial grounding, but the lighthouse itself charges the final image as a "beacon of hope."

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.1)
    The starlit signal station and the patina bronze censer foot are vivid and purposeful: the censer foot constrains Elara's ritual timing (waning gibbous moon, alignment with Polaris) and charges the final image with its pulsing glow. Spatial choreography is clear (control room floor, crude circle, center placement). The setting functions as a crucible—hydraulics failure traps her, forcing the mystical detour—though the stars and cosmos remain somewhat decorative rather than applying additional pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.4)
    The hanging orchard, ravine, and storm are vividly rendered and return at closure to anchor her "hard-won tranquility." The glass eye's physical presence (cold, heavy, charged, then dull) tracks clearly across beats. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—the lightning is awaited passively and arrives on cue. Sensory detail (truffle scent, storm lashing) is present but not POV-prioritized under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.7)
    The opal dock, mist, and nautical twilight anchor setting consistently and charge the ending image with atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("mist that blurred the line between sea and sky," "fog itself watched his solitude"). The lighthouse and dock serve as micro-setting that shapes Elias's routine and final return, though neither constrains a mid-story choice with tactical consequence. The Edelweiss, while vivid, functions more as symbolic token than as environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.4)
    The blooming cavern is vivid (bioluminescent fungi, midsummer flowers, rising creek), and the rising water provides urgency, but the environment functions more as backdrop than constraint that alters Elian's tactics at the threshold. The matrix chip responds to the cavern's light and opens the door, yet this interaction feels more like puzzle-solving than lived-in spatial pressure. The shop's maps and overgrown fields are sketched lightly; the cavern's sensory detail is strongest but does not charge the final choice—Elian steps back without the space resisting or offering a visible cost tied to his position or the flooding.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt and ember grottos are visually rendered with specific color and atmosphere ("shimmering with a deep blue hue," "pulsing with a faint, orange light"). Spatial choreography through the climb is coherent and the thin air, narrow path, and high ceilings anchor the ascent. The fireflies and bleeding starlight function more as set-dressing than as constraints that alter Elara's choices in the moment, limiting the setting's causal role.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ember nexus is anchored early with sensory detail (soft dying light, low hum, smoldering heart). The nautilus shell and pocket-sun are handled on the page, and the shell's use (channeling energy, vibrating, drawing essence) constrains Elara's method. However, spatial choreography is vague—no sense of distance, proximities, or how the twilight sky relates to their position. The nexus itself does not meaningfully constrain choice; it responds passively to Elara's will rather than imposing resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.9)
    The cabin is anchored early with specific details (rough-hewn table, charred stick, dusty supplies, maps on walls) and micro-setting (birch bark scroll, fireplace) constrains the chronicling choice. The dream-geography (mountains, forests, sun-dappled clearing with grave) is vivid and purposeful, filtered through the POV's "jaded wonder." Sensory detail is selective and voice-driven. However, the cabin itself does not evolve or constrain a second choice; once the scroll is filled, the space recedes. The final image invokes the scroll but not the cabin's physicality, so setting pressure is front-loaded rather than sustained through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.1)
    The shop's sensory details (condensation, ticking shadows, drip and flow) are vivid and mood-apt. However, the environment never constrains a choice or charges the closure; it remains a backdrop. The birthing clamp screw is described but not physically handled in a way that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.7)
    The floating tea ceremony platform is vividly anchored and the crow quill is handled across multiple beats. Spatial grounding remains clear (platform, storms circling, steaming tea). The quill and platform contribute to the final image but do not meaningfully constrain a choice—Elara's actions could proceed unchanged on a static surface. Sensory detail ("saturated hush," "gem-like formations") is purposeful but does not alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sheet music archive is vivid—"shelves bowing under the weight of bound scores," scent of aged paper—and the orchard's scheduled removal supplies deadline pressure. The perfume bottle and the sonata lectern anchor micro-setting that enables the ritual. Spatial choreography is clear (archive interior, orchard beyond stained glass). The orange-blossom scent and the apple blossom's drift through a closed window charge the final image with lyric specificity, meeting the 9+ gate test for setting constraining choice and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ancient temple library is evoked with atmospheric detail ("dust of epochs," "scrolls and tomes," "ceiling lost to darkness") but never constrains a choice or alters tactics. Spatial choreography remains vague—"aisles," "chamber," "pedestal" appear without legible distances or obstacles. The mural and dictionary are handled, satisfying minimal micro-setting use, but neither pressures the witness's movement or options. The Q2 orientation penalty caps Q3 at 7.0; execution here reaches mid-5s on its own merits.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.4)
    The fjord, granite outcrop, and hydraulic clocks establish vivid sensory anchors filtered through the shepherd's professional attention. Water channels and gear teeth receive concrete detail that reflects his expertise. However, the horizon measurement station functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no environmental feature narrows a choice or charges the final image. The mantle clock key is handled twice but does not alter tactics or close an option, keeping Q3 below the 7.0 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.6)
    The rainwashed library and mica-pane lantern offer vivid sensory anchors. Spatial choreography within the library (stacks, journal location) remains generic; the subway setting is a transit device rather than a pressure point. The lantern's "kaleidoscope of shadows" and "shimmer with new patterns" describe effect without showing how light or mica constrain Elara's search or charge the closure image with tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.1)
    The subway utility tunnel, glass booth, and harmonica disc are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (smudged glass, coiled cord, polished crystal, distant rumble of trains). However, the environment remains atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint: no choice depends on the tunnel's layout, the booth's antiquity, or the harmonica's mechanics. The glass disc is described as enabling the loop, but this is asserted rather than shown through tactile interaction or spatial choreography that alters Leo's tactics. Micro-setting potential exists but is not exploited to charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.1)
    The jetty setting is introduced early and described with sensory detail (jasmine, gravel, gulls, salt air, twilight flowers). However, the environment does not constrain Elara's choices or supply resources that alter tactics—she unpacks her tools and performs her ritual without interference. The locket functions as a small recurring object across beats (clutched, opened, steeped, glowing, carried away), giving the piece modest object-as-setting credit. The town council's demolition vote is mentioned but never pressures the on-page action, and the final image ("blooming jetty at twilight") reprises the opening without reweighting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.1)
    The disused railway station is vividly rendered—ivy, crumbling brick, steel rafters, mossy bench—and its transformation from "tomb" to "living heart" charges the ending. Spatial choreography is clear: Elara moves through arches, Leo sits on a bench, strangers gather in the hall. The ivy "seeming to listen" at closure ties setting detail to thematic resonance. The environment does not constrain a mid-story choice in a causal way, but it meaningfully frames the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ultrasonic forest is vivid and purposeful: trees sing at frequencies Elara's skin absorbs, and the great resonant tree floods her with history, clarifying purpose. The platinum ring's warmth and directional pull, the gully's stillness, and the earth's quiet song all constrain her path and guide micro-choices. The final kneeling and hand-placement on soil charge the closure image, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement that environment or object shapes the ending. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (textures, sounds beyond common hearing, vibrations in marrow), though spatial choreography stays simple.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.1)
    The gravitational anomaly supplies vivid sensory anchors ("light bent in impossible curves," "time felt thin," "weightless environment where up and down were suggestions") that establish tone. The dried-up pen returns twice, charging the final choice when it "felt alive in her hand." Spatial choreography is coherent (console, Outpost interior), though the anomaly itself remains abstract—no tactile constraint on her physical options. The pen and anomaly together qualify as micro-setting that charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate narrowly.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    The luminous harbor is vividly anchored (moonlight, weathered dock, lapping waves) and recurs throughout, shaping the advisor's demonstrations. The camera functions as a micro-setting tool, framing moments of quiet. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or block a path—it serves as backdrop and symbolic stage rather than pressuring tactics or altering outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.6)
    The archive is vividly sketched with dust, cold air, crumbling walls, and a shaft of light, but remains largely postcard description. Spatial choreography is adequate (corridors → halls → alcove) but the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome. The tapestry fragment is handled across beats, yet its physical properties (faded colors, patterns) do not narrow tactical options at the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.1)
    The sound wave garden and auric lagoon are vividly named and atmospherically sketched ("vibrating flora," "ethereal gold"), but they remain postcard backdrops—neither constrains a choice nor supplies a resource that alters outcome. The lagoon "responds" to her drumming with pulsing light, yet this is ornamental synchrony rather than a causal pressure point. The garden's "acoustic healing" design is told but never exploited in tactics, and the final image reprises the setting without new spatial detail or cost tied to the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.4)
    The shipping-container labyrinth is vividly rendered early ("steel canyon," storm-lit walls) and the geomagnetic storm scrambles digital guidance, forcing Elara to use her paper map—a micro-setting constraint that shapes the opening choice. The hidden relay niche is spatially coherent. Sensory detail (emerald pulses, charged air) supports atmosphere. However, the environment does not constrain the ending; Elara's success is a demonstration of philosophy rather than a spatial problem solved by setting features, limiting the final-image charge.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cobalt dock, rain-washed air, and warehouse shutters are vividly rendered and return at closure, but they do not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics. The dental mirror catches light, yet its physical properties (angle, reflection mechanics) never limit what she can do or force an adaptation. Sensory detail is selective—metallic sheen, black mirror water, muted grays—but remains postcard-descriptive; no environmental friction (a stuck shutter, a gust extinguishing reflected light) complicates the weaving. The setting charges the final image atmospherically but does not supply a resource or obstacle that affects outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "cobalt library" and "magnetic grotto" are vivid in description but function as postcard backdrops rather than constraining choice. Spatial choreography is clean (library aisles, side door, stone path, grotto, window) and the lodestone properties are mentioned, but the setting never pressures a tactic or alters an outcome. The mist and starlight remain decorative. Micro-setting potential (the lodestone king) appears but is not leveraged to charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sublittoral fringe is vividly rendered as a liminal space and the sensory details—dark wet stones, glistening rocks, cool shallow water—anchor the closing beats effectively. The scrimshaw's warming and glowing provides a tactile constraint that charges the final crossing. The docks and whalebone object function as micro-setting elements that shape Elara's final choice, meeting the 9+ gate criterion, though the island itself materializes late and is more backdrop than active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.1)
    The farmhouse, turbines, and dried bouquet are introduced early and recur with sensory specificity (whittling blade, brittle petals, turbine hum). The bouquet functions as micro-setting, handled twice and charged with memory, qualifying it as a constraining object. However, spatial choreography remains vague—Elara's position relative to table, turbines, and landscape is never clarified—and the "remade hush" operates more as thematic claim than tactile environmental pressure that alters a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and humming quartz colonnade are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (deep blue glass, low resonant hum, liquid cobalt pool). The quartz constrains the poet's approach (he must place his hand to feel vibration, signaling a key), and the pool serves as the site for verse composition, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear across moves. However, the setting does not alter tactics under pressure—the poet's path from entrance to heart to exit proceeds without environmental friction or resource constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.7)
    The glassblower's courtyard is vividly rendered with specific details (cracked glass fountain, marigolds and ivy, molten vase) that ground the reader spatially. The cracked fountain's imperfections "catching the light" directly supports Elian's thematic discovery and constrains his painting subject, meeting the 9+ gate partially. However, many details remain ornamental (bonsai tree, lavender and thyme arrangements) without altering tactics, and the courtyard's role diminishes after setup, functioning more as backdrop than active pressure in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    The laboratory setting—"silvery disks," "wire coils," "golden shadows"—establishes a distinct sensory signature and the miner's lens is handled across multiple beats, satisfying the micro-setting allowance. Spatial choreography remains coherent (lens, atrium, resonance chambers). However, environmental detail does not meaningfully constrain Elara's choices; the lab functions as backdrop rather than pressure. The "golden shadows" recur but remain decorative rather than charging the final image with tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.1)
    The observatory is anchored early with sensory specificity (velvet curtains, dusty table, dome light) and provides a coherent spatial frame. The tattoo stencil on vellum and origami figures supply recurring objects that charge the protagonist's arc, and the final lamp placement shows environmental evolution. However, the observatory functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint (access, proximity, tool limitation) forces a mid-story choice or meaningfully alters tactics. The micro-setting (workbench, sealed room, telescope) is present but does not narrow options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.1)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft anchors the scene early and recurs with atmospheric consistency. Sensory detail (rain patter, onyx ink drinking light, metallic gleam of tape) is vivid but primarily decorative; the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics. The measuring tape's physical use to mark card distances is described but remains metaphorical rather than tactile. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the loft's mood supports tone, lifting the score into mid-band despite the lack of choice-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.6)
    The bronze prism pagoda and archive are anchored early with vivid visual detail. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; Elara's "random movements" occur in spatial abstraction without props, distances, or physical obstacles. The setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure, keeping the score mid-band despite atmospheric competence.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "blooming library suspended above clouds" and "crystalline shelves" are vivid but function as backdrop; the environment does not constrain Elara's choice or alter her tactics. The river stone is handled twice (placed on console, clutched at the end) but its solidity does not block an option or charge the closure image with new meaning—it remains symbolic. Spatial choreography is clear, and the "petals of light unfolding" image is striking, yet the setting does not pressure the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    The misty workshop under stars is anchored early and sustained throughout, creating coherent atmosphere. The chameleon's enclosure, the worn wooden bench, and the jars/tools provide tactile grounding. The chameleon's body and its missing tail tip function as micro-setting that constrains Elara's method (she cannot reattach; she must foster regrowth) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's professional and emotional priorities. Spatial choreography remains clear across all moves.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tower setting is vivid and purposeful: ivy whispers provide information, the loose flagstone becomes a tactical choice, and the crystalline chamber charges the closure. Sensory details (cold stone, wet clay scent, frosted hourglass) are filtered through Aris's urgency. The recurring hourglass constrains his sense of stalled time and reappears at closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but the final "soft click" feels ornamental rather than a choice-driver, capping the score at high-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.1)
    The projection booth is vividly rendered ("dust-moted silence," "metal table," "hushed thunder") and the film strip is handled twice (initial touch, final inertness). The spatial particulars do not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the booth functions as backdrop. The body and the crystal (a micro-setting object) are mentioned but do not charge the final image with a price. Sensory detail is purposeful but remains decorative rather than integral to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.1)
    The aurora-lit archway and orrery are described vividly and recur, but neither constrains a choice or charges the final image in a way that alters tactics. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, filtered through the moonstruck lens. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single location. The orrery functions as a symbolic partner rather than a tool whose mechanics shape outcome, keeping the score in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.6)
    The glowing dune supplies vivid sensory anchors ("sand warm and alive beneath her boots," "flowers pulsed like slow heartbeats") and the fractured lullaby modulates tone across beats. Yet setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the dune and archive remain postcard backdrops. The chess clock is handled twice (set down, observed) but does not enable or block an action. Micro-setting allowance met minimally; no closure charge from environment.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mechanical rainforest is vividly rendered with specific textures: "trees of interlocking brass plates," "mercury waterfall," "titanium tree." Sensory details are purposeful and layered across touch, sound, and sight. The gear constrains one choice—its directional pull guides Elara—and the jammed nexus shapes the final beat, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement. However, spatial choreography across translocations is vague (leagues away, "elsewhere again"), and the forest's mechanical rules are ornamental rather than tactical constraints that limit her options mid-journey.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    The veiled ridgeway, moss-laden paths, pines as sentinels, and the shoreline all create a coherent liminal atmosphere that supports the vigil's symbolic weight. Sensory details—damp earth, distant sea, velvet blue twilight—are selective and mood-consistent. The star stamp on Elara's hand functions as micro-setting/object anchor, reappearing in the final image to charge closure. Spatial choreography through canyon and oak remains clear. The setting does not constrain a tactical choice in a high-pressure beat, keeping it shy of the 8+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cobalt fortress under snow is vividly rendered with consistent sensory details (blue-metal walls, cold halls, relentless snowfall). The spiral staircase and piano function as micro-settings that guide discovery and enable the bolt repair. Setting details are filtered through Elian's hyper-aware nerve regeneration, creating a lived-in texture. The environment does not constrain a pivotal choice at closure, but it effectively grounds the atmosphere and investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.9)
    The library is vividly evoked ("shelves curved like sleeping dragons") and its timeless isolation frames the action. The iron gall ink pellet and the rune etched into the floor constrain the method and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (library, tomes, floor rune), and the setting functions as sanctuary and weapon. Pushes toward 7.0 because the rune's physical presence on the floor enables the climax, though the library itself remains atmospheric rather than dynamically altering tactics mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.2)
    The monitoring station, sensors, control room, and console are named and spatially coherent. Sensory detail (salt air, hum of machinery, tap-tap rhythms) appears but does not constrain choice or evolve with pressure. The atlas page recurs and shifts meaning at closure, providing micro-setting function. However, the station itself remains a backdrop rather than a resource or obstacle that shapes Kaelen's assembling of the report or the revelation's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.1)
    The abandoned spaceport is anchored early with vivid, selective detail (gantries, gutted hulls, cool concrete, graffiti) filtered through Elara's stargazer perspective. The stone circle introduces a spatial constraint and hums as a recurring sensory anchor across beats, shaping her final stance. However, the setting does not force a tactical choice—Elara's barefoot sensitivity to vibrations is noted but never alters her approach or creates friction. The environment charges the final image ("stone circle glowed brighter") but does not meaningfully narrow her options mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.4)
    The volcanic hot springs setting is signaled early and returns at key beats (discovery site, unsealing cavern, final council gathering), but functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint that shapes tactics. Sensory details like "warm mist," "steamy, mineral-scented passages," and "glowing moss" provide texture but don't alter Elara's choices or access. The geothermal vents are mentioned in the reconstruction plan but don't pressure the closure moment. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the cave navigation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.2)
    The arboretum setting is vivid (junipers, flowering cherries, cliff edge, automated lighthouse beam) and filters through Elara's horticultural expertise. Sensory detail (brine, blooms, wind) supports tone. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice or directly charge the closure image; the grafting occurs without spatial pressure. Meets baseline specificity but remains slightly ornamental at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse library is vividly rendered with specific textures (dust, salt, oak table, stone walls, filtered lamp-light) and the oppressive "walls closing in" motif constrains Elian's perception and frames his psychological descent. The tarot cards function as micro-setting objects that anchor reflection beats. The final "charcoal from the dusty floor" and "blank pages of a forgotten book" charge the ending image with purposeful detail. The setting does not impose a hard physical constraint on choice, but it supplies the symbolic architecture and the tools (cards, charcoal, book) that shape the redesign action.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.1)
    The wind-carved encampment is vivid and specific, with "surfaces smooth and undulating like frozen waves" that anchor the opening. The disappearing ink on the polished stone tablet and the hummingbird drone supply tactile, visual detail. The micro-setting (stone, ink, air) does constrain the experiment's method and the encampment frames the return, charging the final image with "scent of dust and change." Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cryogenic library under snow is vividly anchored with misting breath, icy controls, and dizzying quiet. Sensory details (chilled air, soft chime, snowflakes) are selective and atmospheric. The terminal and data chip function as micro-setting that enables the key action. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or evolve causally—Elara's upload proceeds without spatial friction, and the snow remains a static backdrop rather than an active pressure on tactics or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glass dome and desert rose farm are described vividly but function as backdrop rather than constraint. Spatial choreography is minimal—Elara moves from perimeter to dome interior, but distances and physical layout never shape a tactical choice. The airship scrap is handled (sheathed, placed at the root) but its physical presence does not alter an on-page decision. Sensory detail leans heavily visual ("tranquil blaze," "colors more vibrant") without filtering through urgency or professional priority.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sound wave garden is vividly rendered and consistently strange; sensory detail (shimmering ribbon, dissonance waves) filters through the quest frame. The rail spike and garden both constrain movement choices (zigzag paths, sonic structures collapsing). However, the environment does not charge the final image—Kael simply "held" the echo and walked away—so Q3 remains below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory above perpetual clouds functions as both sanctuary and crypt, pressuring Elara's choice through spatial descent (dome to archive). The rosewood nib is handled in multiple beats and its worn smoothness from "generations of Aethelred hands" anchors family legacy materially. The lower chamber's sensory detail (smell of old paper, filing cabinets as "silent sentinels") supports atmosphere. The fusion of rosewood nib into tablet stylus at closure charges the ending image with old/new tension. However, the clouds "seeming to part for her resolve" at the ascent reads as symbolic convenience rather than lived environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.4)
    The laboratory is named but never grounded spatially; no tool, room dimension, or constraint shapes a choice. "Meteor hush" and "haunted firmware" remain metaphoric labels without physical anchors. The amber and escritoire appear but do not constrain movement or access. Sensory detail is generic ("profound silence," "faint energy") and filtered through an omniscient catalog rather than POV-specific urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.4)
    The grotto's acoustics and mist are vivid and coherent; the whispering gallery tile flake and sand mandala function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (lilac haze, damp rock, wet stone) and filtered through Elara's craft-centered attention. However, spatial choreography of the "few others huddled" remains vague—no blocking or proximity shifts constrain Elara's choices, so the environment pressures atmosphere more than action.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ancient plaza, shattered sky, and mosaic fragments anchor the scene early and create atmospheric pressure. The minaret mosaic tessera returns with reweighted meaning at closure (grows warm, prompts renaming), and the chipped patterns guide Elara's tactile discovery, meeting the Q3 9+ test. The "warm coldness" is repeated throughout and modulates slightly at the end ("balance she could embrace"), but sensory selection remains static rather than varying with urgency. Spatial choreography is clear; the setting constrains choice minimally beyond providing the tessera and stepping stone.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mystic orchard is vivid (silver apples, greasepaint scent, trees forming proscenium) and sensory detail is selective. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it passively responds to Elara's performance. The tarot coin charges the final image but does not function as micro-setting that narrows options. Spatial choreography is clear; the garden's transformation supports atmosphere without applying pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    The light painting studio's long-exposure setup and LED wand constrain Alex's method, making the environment functional. The muscovite geode sliver refracts light into branching patterns at a key beat, contributing to the final image. Sensory detail is selective (tingling skin, cool shade/warm sun somatic recall, soft inner glow) and filtered through Alex's purpose. The studio transitions from "place of doubt" to one "brimmed with...promise," grounding the thematic shift, and the pedestal placement of the geode charges the visual climax.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.1)
    The coastal cave is anchored early with "labyrinthine," "saline drafts," and "echoing chambers." Sensory detail is present but generic ("golden light," "soft glow"). The cave does not constrain choice or alter tactics; Kaelen follows a glowing path without navigational friction or resource cost. The environment functions as backdrop rather than crucible, failing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.1)
    The amber warehouse and canyon echo jar are vivid in isolation but remain postcard details—no object or environment constrains a choice or charges the final image. The buttons, while cataloged extensively, do not alter tactics or impose spatial logic; they are shuffled without friction. "Unearthed silence" and "sourceless light" offer atmospheric texture but no pressure that the protagonist must navigate or resist.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.7)
    Zephyr Bluff and mist provide consistent atmosphere and selective sensory detail (coiling mist, silver hush, thin cold air). The snow codes and bluff's "unique atmosphere" for transmission constrain Elias's approach and enable the climax, satisfying the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography is clear across descent and cabin. Minor deduction: "peculiar formation of ice and rock" and the transmitter setup remain generic; the setting supports but does not deeply personalize the action.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.1)
    The fog-bound crossing, yarn needle, and rain gutters anchor the scene with sensory specificity. The needle recurs and is handled across beats, gaining symbolic weight at closure. However, environment remains largely atmospheric; fog and river do not constrain choice or supply resources that alter outcome. Spatial choreography is minimal but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.1)
    The abandoned oasis is vividly anchored: crumbling hives, dry channels, faded lantern glass. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Kael's potter's touch ("fingers tracing the rough wood... feeling the history embedded in the grain"). The lantern glass functions as micro-setting, recurring across three beats and charging the final image when held aloft. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the meditation and vision sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.2)
    Harbor setting is evocatively rendered with selective sensory detail (sea damp, moss, silver surface). The mirror and boat constrain Elara's nightly method, and the cliffs supply the target for her ritual. However, the environment does not alter her tactics or charge the closure beyond atmospheric backdrop; the bud's appearance is independent of spatial pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Tidal Library is vivid and consistent: halls suspended above clouds, books floating on air currents, obsidian pedestal, stone circle core. Sensory detail is selective (the hum vibrates through bones, the sundial glows) and the library's rhythm pressures Elara's approach to the circle. The brass sundial and stone circle function as micro-setting elements that constrain her method and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. However, spatial choreography is minimal—no sense of distance, movement through the library, or how the pedestal relates to the circle—and the setting remains more postcard than lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, and post-storm atmosphere are vivid and sensory ("white petals glistened, each one holding a droplet"). The twig spiral and woven reeds anchor micro-setting and are handled on the page. The environment does not constrain a choice—Elara's art-making proceeds without spatial friction—but the prismatic mist and temple backdrop charge the final image. Spatial choreography (sodden path, cleared area, spiral center) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.1)
    The university radio station is established early with concrete anchors (humming consoles, waterfall display, outdated equipment, main transmitter) and the control room constrains Aris's choice—he must wait for the building to empty and bypass safety protocols, spatially grounding the gamble. The subsonic frequencies function as both method and micro-setting tool, their bone-deep thrumming charging the climax. However, the quadrangle crowds remain abstract; we hear "shouting" and "edge of panic fading" but never see spatial choreography or sensory detail that personalizes the division. Occupational detail (celestial signal interpreter, subsonic broadcast parameters) reads plausible within the speculative frame and supports the choice without overwhelming the scene. The station shifts from listening post to shield at closure, a purposeful evolution, though the external community remains a placeholder backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "shadowed nexus under starlight" and "spatial mutiny" are described atmospherically but never constrain a choice or supply a tactical resource—walls are said to shift, yet Elara's path remains unimpeded. The church organ appears as a set piece without spatial integration (how does it exist in a chaotic nexus?). Sensory detail defaults to visual generalities ("serene glow," "darkness") without body, proximity, or POV-filtered perception. No tool, environment, or recurring object charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    The quarry is vividly rendered with selective, purpose-driven detail: mist clinging to granite, wet stone underfoot, jagged quartz where the ribbon snagged. The setting constrains Elara's process (she paces the perimeter, closes her eyes to "feel the space") and charges the final image (rough rock versus delicate ribbon). The body and the ribbon fragment function as micro-setting anchors. Sensory hierarchy reflects her face-blindness: she notices texture, weight, and spatial relationships rather than faces. The quarry's silence is intentionally opposed to the masquerade's cacophony, shaping her realization and meeting the high-band gate for constraint and closure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.6)
    The weather station is described as "skeletal structure of sensors and whirring machinery" but never constrains a choice or becomes tactile. Alarms "sometimes blare" without affecting Elara's actions; the storm "brews outside" as wallpaper during the final report. The shipwreck and copper nail—potentially vivid—are viewed remotely via probe cameras, flattening sensory presence. Spatial choreography inside the station remains unclear; we never learn where Elara works, eats, or sleeps.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.1)
    The mountain pullout, scaffold wrap, and glass flake are rendered with some sensory specificity (torn fabric fluttering, shifting cloud shadows, the cool smoothness of the shard). The scaffold wrap's patterns guide Elias's realization, offering a micro-setting constraint that enables his epiphany. However, the ending pivots to abstract "liminal space" language that abandons spatial choreography, and the fiddle performance occurs without grounded physical detail or environmental cost.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.2)
    The abandoned circus train is vividly established with sensory detail (dust, faded lion, animal smells, broken boards). However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint—Leo's movements through the train do not face environmental resistance or resource scarcity that alters his choices. The territorial markers (scratched arrow, stacked stone, knotted rope) shape one beat (dissuading the squatter) but do not return to charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is coherent but the train itself remains passive scenery.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.1)
    The observatory and variable stars are named and visualized, but spatial choreography remains generic—telescope, desk, parchment appear without constraining choice or altering tactics. Mira in Cetus is specific, yet the mechanics of observation never pressure a decision. The daylily-pressed telegram is a recurring image but does not constrain action or charge the final moment beyond symbolic mention. Sensory detail is limited to visual assertion; no smell, temperature, or tactile texture grounds the setting under urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sensory detail is vivid in patches ("scent of ozone and rotting fruit," "veined like marble") but remains decorative rather than shaping choice. Spatial choreography is unclear: Elara moves "outward from the vortex's eye" through "expanding circles" yet the confession is later "wedged between two roots" with no legible path or distance established. The swirling orchard vortex supplies mood but does not constrain a tactic or alter the protagonist's approach; removing it would not break the plot. No recurring object or environmental element charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt glade is vividly rendered (blue light, wet earth, ozone, moss) and the roots physically anchor Elara, constraining her movement. The maze topiary clipping appears in multiple beats and its thorns draw blood, supplying a micro-object that pressures choice. However, spatial choreography during the portal sequence is abstract; we lose track of distances, the clipping's physical handling, and how the glade's layout affects her approach. The setting charges atmosphere but does not alter tactics at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.1)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid and purposeful: roots embracing bones, half-lit amber glow, bone-piled archway. Spatial choreography remains coherent (Elara kneels, keeper emerges from archway, she settles among roots). The setting constrains her physically (navigating bone-laced earth) and symbolically (life/death intertwined), and the final image of roots curling around the card charges the closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's introspective lens, though the "vast, silent space" risks generic scale where micro-texture would sharpen the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.1)
    The quarry office trailer is anchored early and the grille cloth scrap provides tactile detail. Sensory selection is limited: no dust on Leo's hands, no trailer creaks, no quarry sounds outside. The space remains static postcard rather than constraining choice—Leo could have this conversation anywhere. The cloth's texture is mentioned but does not alter his grip or his next move in a way that charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    The magnetic arbor is vividly rendered—levitating stones, metallic vines, thin cool air, magnetic pulses adjusting to the seed's presence—and setting details (the central magnetic stone niche, the clouds below swirling in new patterns) are woven through action rather than front-loaded. The arbor's magnetic lattice directly enables the final move (reestablishing its hold on the clouds), satisfying the constraint test. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single location. The piece falls short of 9-band because the body and tool interaction (tracing imaginary cuneiform in the air) is gestural and does not constrain a choice with cost; the seed glows and emits visions, but its physical properties do not narrow Elian's options in a way that charges the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.1)
    The tidal atrium is vividly rendered with gears, pools, and moon-responsive identities. However, the setting remains a backdrop: no environmental constraint forces a choice, and no spatial detail alters Elian's tactics or charges the final image. The bamboo creel is described but never used to solve a problem or complicate one; it simply holds identities without overflow, a passive container rather than a tool with stakes-shaping properties.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.6)
    The crystal caves offer vivid sensory anchors (iridescent seashell, chime of water, rainbows on walls) and the stalagmite functions as a micro-setting object that enables the climactic act of crowning the pearl. However, spatial choreography is vague—Kaelen's position relative to the bunker door, the seashell's exact location, and the scale of the caves remain unclear. The caves do not constrain choice; they serve as backdrop rather than pressure. Occupational detail (bunker systems, inspection protocols) is mentioned but never integrated into the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.1)
    The disused railway station is vividly rendered with ivy, crumbling platforms, dusty benches, and shattered windows. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful throughout. The accordion as a tactile, recurring object constrains her choices (she carries it, hesitates to play, then finally uses it) and charges the final image when she plays. The bathroom setting supplies the graffiti wisdom that shifts her stance, making environment essential to the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.1)
    The mist, glowing library, and watch supply vivid sensory anchors that guide Elara's tactics (echo delays, visual shimmer). Spatial choreography remains coherent across the journey. However, setting detail trends descriptive rather than constraining a key choice at closure; the library "welcomes her" without environmental resistance. The watch and mist shape methods but do not charge the final image with cost, capping micro-setting credit.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.1)
    The velvet observatory is anchored with sensory detail (dark fabrics swallowing sound, midsummer heat, weeping ice droplets), and the ice violin's cold seeping into Elara's palms provides tactile specificity. However, the setting does not constrain a key choice; the plants and violin exist in the space without spatial choreography affecting tactics. The micro-setting (her desk, the coffee cup) returns at the end but does not alter the closure action.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.1)
    The skyborne grotto and aurora provide vivid, high-concept imagery ("floating cavern carved into a cumulus cloud," "aurora borealis draped the heavens") but function as backdrop rather than constraint. Sensory detail is selective and consistent with the fantasy register. The emerald chip and obsidian slab are named and handled, granting some micro-setting presence, though they do not alter tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent within the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.1)
    The umbral grotto and its ethereal mosses, offering stone, and cliffsides provide vivid anchors. Sensory details are present but function as postcard description rather than constraint—the grotto never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. The hairpin is handled in multiple beats (tucking, tracing, pulsing glow), and the scalloping action engages the environment, pushing the score above mid-band. However, spatial choreography remains vague (how high is "high branch"? where is the alcove relative to the offering stone?) and the "vineyard hush" tone operates as atmosphere without modulating under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.2)
    The lighthouse setting anchors time and weather effectively; the breeze and wind chimes supply sensory atmosphere. However, spatial choreography is vague—positions of bench, gallery, sea relative to each other and the characters remain unclear, and the hollow mirror shard's physical handling (how it's held, peered into) lacks tactile grounding. The setting provides mood but does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; it remains decorative rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.1)
    The floating platform and magnetic grotto provide atmospheric backdrop but never constrain a choice or supply tactical resource. Spatial choreography is abstract—"below," "drifted," "beneath them"—without concrete distances or anchors that alter action. The sycamore hush and starlight are vivid tokens but remain static across the entire sequence. Micro-setting credit: Kael's embodied position (kneeling, closing eyes) briefly grounds the trance entry, lifting the score marginally.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.1)
    The bone towers and canyon echoes are vividly sketched and recur across beats, but they function as backdrop rather than constraint: no moment shows Elara navigating around a tower's placement or using the acoustics to solve a tactical problem. The arrowhead and dust layers are handled on the page, giving micro-setting credit, but the final image does not turn on environmental affordance—Elara could complete the same arc in any resonant space. Sensory detail is present but filtered through generic "harmonics" and "frequencies" rather than character-specific priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.1)
    The icebound spire and its "brilliant dimness" are vividly sketched and anchor the opening. However, setting detail remains largely ornamental: the ice, clouds, and frost-kissed clearing do not constrain any choice or alter tactics. The keystone's placement beside the flower triggers transformation, but the environment itself does not pressure Elian's decisions. Spatial choreography is clean, and the recurring "lingering luminance" motif returns at closure, lifting the score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sunken library and glowing tome are vivid, and the pier's gas lamps anchor the opening. However, spatial choreography inside the wreck is vague (how does he surface in an air chamber? where is the pedestal relative to the fissure?), and the environment does not constrain his choices—he encounters no obstacle, only discovery. The library charges the final image but does not shape tactics. Within the 9+ gate test, the setting fails to constrain a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "ambered observatory deck" is vivid and returns in the final image, satisfying early signal and lyric reprise. The "obsidian table" and "ancient speakers" add texture, and the amber light casting shadows modulates atmosphere. However, the setting never constrains a tactical choice—Elara's moves would read identically in any isolated room. The spatial grounding is clean but ornamental, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.1)
    The observatory is vividly rendered with prisms, lenses, and crumbling stone arches. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—the reaper uses the apparatus without obstacle or trade-off. The atlas page recurs with shifting symbolic weight (threats → guardians → memories) but remains inert, never forcing a decision. Strong atmospheric detail but minimal functional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sapphire viaduct supplies vivid anchors (crystalline structure, cool blue stone, dawn light) and the dripping dew provides a concrete rhythmic constraint. However, spatial choreography remains static: Elian kneels, arranges fragments, and chants without the environment pressing tactical choices or evolving causally. The viaduct "hums" and "glows with approval" at closure, lending atmospheric charge, but these responses feel ornamental rather than a resource Elian must navigate or earn through interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    Midnight Ridgeway at twilight is established early with sensory detail (dusky light, mirrored hush) and spatial clarity (path, lakebed, town hall). The trail of photographs functions as micro-setting, guiding movement and discovery. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Elias moves freely without friction from terrain, weather, or social context. The sapphire liqueur label and wind chime recur but remain symbolic rather than tactile objects that press against options at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    The hidden orchard and kaleidoscopic waterfall are vividly described with sensory detail (scent of blooming apples, roar, prismatic light). The frozen dew crystal is handled across multiple beats (cradled, warmed, levitates, drips). However, setting and objects remain largely decorative; the orchard does not constrain Elara's choice, and the crystal's mechanics feel convenient rather than physics-bound. Spatial choreography is clear, and the micro-setting (crystal in hand, waterfall mist) charges the final image slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.1)
    The nocturnal arbor is vividly sketched (woven metal, living vines, bioluminescent plants, star-dusted canopy) and the parachute buckle is handled twice (securing cables, glinting in starlight). However, the arbor functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; it doesn't constrain her choices—she could perform the same analysis anywhere with a console. The buckle's cold metal touch and the buffeting winds gesture toward environmental pressure, but the winds don't force a tactical adaptation and the arbor's verticality or isolation never limit her options. The setting charges the final image ("watchtower of hope") conceptually but doesn't shape the middle decision.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.4)
    The floating dojo is anchored early with vivid details (stone surface, mist-shrouded valleys, energy convergence point), and the jar of amber fluid provides tactile presence. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the floating stones and "psychic reverberations" do not constrain Kael's choices or shape the custody debate tactics. The final ritual occurs "at the dojo's heart, where energy lines converged," a phrase that asserts rather than dramatizes spatial influence on the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.1)
    The echo chamber tunnel is signaled early and its amplification property recurs across beats, shaping the sonic method. Spatial choreography is minimal but coherent (the Conductor stands, adjusts blowers, pulls cords). The setting enables the tactic (sound multiplication) and charges the final image (the tunnel holds the moment "forever"), meeting the micro-setting standard. No occupational or physical implausibility harms the closure, and sensory detail (drone, hum, vibration) is selective and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.7)
    The frozen garden supplies vivid sensory markers—ice-coated fur, skeletal branches, mist—and the recurring "boundaries of light" thread through the text. However, the environment never constrains a tactical choice or alters the guardian's options; it functions as backdrop rather than active pressure. The pendant's weight and the ice glyphs are described but do not force a decision. Micro-setting potential (the pendant as tool) is present but underused at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ember nexus is vividly described (bowl-shaped depression, eternal coals, pulsed light) and anchors the setting early. However, it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; the environment does not constrain Elian's choices or supply resources that alter his tactics. The altar stone and reagents are listed but not engaged tactilely during the ritual. Sensory detail is visual-heavy with limited haptic or auditory specificity during the high-pressure climax. The setting charges the final image ("seemed to burn brighter") but does not shape the action that leads there.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.4)
    The radio tower city and gorge are vivid and establish a distinct micro-world. The "shard of hush" at the dish's focal point constrains the tuning attempt (one beat), and the hollywood star fragment warms in her hand, charging the moment. The lunar perigee frames urgency but does not alter her physical access or immediate tactics on the page. Sensory detail is purposeful, though the setting functions more as backdrop than as a resource that pressures choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.6)
    The grotto setting supplies vivid imagery (stalactites, pools of dark water, starlight reflections) but remains postcard-descriptive rather than constraint-driven; no spatial feature pressures Eli's choices or alters tactics. The empty hourglass as micro-object does constrain the final beat by casting "lines of silver" that "connect points," partially satisfying the Q3 gate, but the spectral grotto itself never forces a meaningful decision. Sensory detail defaults to the visual without body-anchored perception or occupational filter.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.1)
    The optical illusion gallery is vividly described (walls shifting, floors curving, ceilings opening into voids) but functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint. The sinew thread glows and pulses but does not impose a spatial or material limit on Elara's choices. The forest of shifting trees at closure is visually striking yet remains abstract; no environmental detail forces a tactical decision or charges the final image with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.7)
    The benthic city setting is vivid and purposeful (translucent corridors, Astral Chamber dome, holographic stars). The boat anchor chain link functions as micro-setting, handled twice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and supports the somber tone. However, the underwater environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than crucible. The setting frames rather than pressures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.1)
    The mist-clad atrium and twilight haze are evoked through sensory detail (glass dome, marble bench, cold seeping through clothes), and the hearing aid's glow adds purposeful texture. However, the environment does not constrain choice or alter tactics—Elara moves freely, the bench is simply where she sits. Spatial choreography is clean, but the setting remains backdrop rather than crucible, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.1)
    The undersea facility and phase-transition corridors supply vivid sensory detail (walls that "ripple like water," cracked cables sparking). Spatial choreography is mostly coherent across the descent and return. However, the environment never constrains a live choice: Elara follows the codex's golden light without navigating between paths or working around obstacles. The "crashing hush" phrase recurs but remains a tonal flourish rather than a sensory anchor that shapes perception or urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.1)
    The opal observatory's milky luminescence and encasing snow create coherent atmospheric pressure for midnight reckoning. The spilled ink on the workbench becomes functional micro-setting, constraining the defragmentation method and charging the final image when its patterns "fix in her mind forever." Spatial choreography remains clear (floor shard, desk, workbench, dome above). The porcelain shard and ink anchor tactile choices. However, the observatory itself remains somewhat postcard—its structure and resources don't alter Elara's tactical options beyond providing solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bone towers, blood-colored sky, and echo-amplifying canyon are vivid and specific. The starlings' flight pattern directly enables the tunnel's discovery, and the diamond's physical flaw (the black lightning bolt) becomes a tactical obstacle. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout: scuff of boot, pedestal of fused bone, the shimmer at the tower's base. The setting participates in the closure as Elara's voice "swoops and dives," echoing the birds within the tunnel's acoustic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.1)
    The underground garden's gravitational variance (floating herbs, anchored stones) is vivid and purposefully strange, and the arrowhead's levitation at the garden's heart constrains Aris's ritual in one key beat. Sensory detail is selective—earth scent, cool air, rustling leaves—and the spatial choreography remains clear. However, the garden does not evolve causally after the metamorphosis; we're told it "thrived" and plants "swayed in a rhythm that felt like laughter" without micro-setting constraints that alter final tactics or charge the closure image with environmental cost.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.1)
    The sky-bridge and orchard are sketched with vivid phrases—"crystalline bridge," "tarnished wonder," "fruit with a tarnished wonder, glowing dimly"—but remain postcard backdrops. The bridge's arches "spanning the groves below like frozen music" is a strong image, yet the setting does not constrain Elara's choices or shape tactics. The locust shell caught in the railing provides one micro-setting touch that seeds the plan, lifting the score slightly above pure ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cobalt arcade at twilight is vividly rendered with "neon signs unlit," "brittle hush," and "blue-tinged shadows." However, the setting remains postcard description—Elian could execute this plan in any secluded location. The faded pinball machine he leans against does not constrain choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome. Spatial choreography is minimal (he steps forward, places bottle, watches drone leave) and the environment never pressures his decision.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.7)
    The circus train setting provides vivid visual anchors (peeling murals, stacked horses, velvet rot) and the halo fragment constrains Elias's immediate goal. However, the environment never forces a tactical choice or supplies a resource Elias must work around; he lays out tools "with care" and proceeds without spatial friction. Wind bells recur purposefully, but their chime remains atmospheric rather than a constraint that alters a decision. The "misting hush" thickens mood but does not pressure the character's moves, keeping the score below the 7.0 gate for constraint-driven choice.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.8)
    The scientific poetry library is vividly rendered ("stained-glass atoms," "curved walls"), and the scarf's tactile detail (tattered silk, smell of old paper and roses) charges multiple beats. The central reading room's hyperbolic architecture directly enables the climax, constraining Elara's method and shaping the doorway's emergence. Patrons browsing in the background provide atmospheric pressure but remain underutilized as a live social constraint. The setting's micro-details (scarf, geometry) drive the ending, lifting the score into the 6+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.7)
    The moss-covered jetty, archipelago whispers, and brass-bound camera provide tactile grounding. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Elara's artistic focus (liquid dawn hues, swirling light). However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraining choice or supplying resources that alter outcome. The watercolor palette and camera are handled, but the environment itself does not pressure decisions—missing the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain a choice or charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "shadowed nexus under starlight" anchors place, and sensory fragments (shadows shifting, starlight piercing) recur. However, the environment does not constrain a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it remains atmospheric backdrop. The lock of hair and archway function as props in sequence but lack micro-setting pressure. No body, tool, or recurring object charges the final image, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sunken greenhouse and shipwrecks are vivid, anchored early with sensory specificity ("briny water," "phosphorescent fungus," "sweet rot of apples"). The fairy-ring mushrooms constrain Elara's method—she must map and align them—and the final alignment charges the closure image as water recedes and wrecks groan. Spatial choreography is clean, and the setting acts as more than backdrop, pressing the protagonist's choices throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.7)
    The forgotten library anchors the scene with sensory detail (dusty floor, distant swing creak, tea cups on table, afternoon light). The swing sound functions as a recurring environmental cue that triggers the archivist's backwards walking, constraining her movement twice. Spatial choreography is clear (she moves away, Elian bends over the shard). The swing falls silent at closure, marking the session's end, but the environment does not visibly constrain Elian's final choice or alter the archivist's tactics beyond the nervous-walk trigger. Setting supports atmosphere but remains somewhat passive in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.1)
    The parapet, waterfall, and orchard are anchored early with vivid sensory details ("thunderous waterfall," "gray malaise," "golden-azure light"). However, setting elements remain decorative: the waterfall's mist serves as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining a choice, and the parapet functions only as a platform for Elara's uncontested work. No environmental pressure shapes her decision or alters tactics; the sapling's rapid growth ignores the physical constraints the text establishes. The micro-setting test is not met—no tool, body limitation, or spatial constraint charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prism sanctuary and starlight create vivid atmosphere, but the crystalline walls and shifting patterns remain decorative—no choice hinges on spatial constraint or light quality. The fisherman's net is described (coarse, salt-smelling) yet its physical properties don't alter Elara's method or complicate her task. Sensory detail is present and consistent but does not charge the final image or constrain a beat.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.1)
    Setting details (mossy stones, rain-scoured vault, fissure) are visually present and anchor space adequately. The fissure's widening over decades offers one purposeful detail that enables the reopening action. However, the environment never constrains a choice or complicates tactics—Elara's work proceeds unimpeded. The final chapel interior supplies atmospheric description but does not charge the closure image; she simply "stepped in" and observed. Micro-setting allowance partially met but without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.7)
    The sunken library is vivid and purposeful: "shelves stood like skeletons, volumes swollen with sea" grounds the metaphor in concrete detail filtered through Elara's profession. The snow globe constrains the closure image, charging the final beat. Spatial choreography (fissure, desk, hidden drawer) tracks cleanly. Minor: the opening fame reference ("the world celebrated") and surface air lack the same sensory particularity, creating mild tonal drift from the submerged core.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.4)
    The misty courtyard above clouds is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (glass chimes, ozone scent, ancient machinery). However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; no spatial constraint or resource shortage shapes Elara's choices. The flower press bolt plate is handled but operates as a magical tool without friction. The setting intensifies atmosphere but does not alter tactics or charge the final image with environmental consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.4)
    The icebound spire, brass elevator, and carved ice walls establish vivid atmosphere with selective sensory detail (frost, internal radiance, prismatic patterns). The goggles function as a tool that constrains one choice (decoding the diary through refracted light). Spatial choreography is stable, and the ten-floor ascent creates a legible ticking clock. The setting does not, however, force a dilemma or alter tactics beyond enabling the decode; it remains scenic rather than a crucible for decision.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sky gondola and brass telescope anchor the physical frame early and recur throughout. "Dusty starlight" tone and thin air provide atmospheric specificity. However, the setting remains postcard-descriptive; no environmental constraint shapes a tactical choice or charges the final image beyond mood. The telescope enables observation but does not constrain or complicate a decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tree-library anchors early with "curved shelves carved from living wood" and "faint scent of oak and ink," filtering detail through Elara's textural perception. The lectern and crystalline lenses function as micro-setting that constrains her method, and the final tremor of demolition machinery charges the ending. Spatial choreography (shelves, lectern, dome overhead) remains coherent, though the mural's physical emergence—grinding pigments, applying fractally—could benefit from one additional sensory anchor (hand fatigue, quartz grit texture) to fully ground the craft action.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.1)
    The antique airship is vivid ("brass fittings," "creaking timbers") and the starling murmurations create atmospheric texture. The hopscotch board is a specific micro-setting detail that enables the discovery, meeting the minimal constraint test. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. However, the environment does not pressure Elara's choices—objects and space accommodate her rather than complicate her path.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    The frozen library is vividly rendered with selective detail ("glacial blue," "frost clung to parchment") that establishes atmosphere without catalog-listing. The hall of mirrors charges the conceptual turn with its reflections of "lost moments" and shifting clockwork mechanisms. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the journey from misty stairs through aisles to the central chamber. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraining choices or supplying resources that alter Elara's tactics in a high-pressure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    The floating arches, orchard, and bell are vivid and recur across beats. The bell's placement "at the highest point of the largest floating arch" constrains the climactic choice and its resonance charges the ending. Spatial choreography (eastern ridge, butterfly garden center, sleeping domes) remains clear. However, the orchard planet's sensory texture relies on visual cues (luminous fruit, glowing veins) without other senses sharpening urgency, and the "deserted sidewalks" function as message boards without further environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.4)
    The hidden lighthouse at dusk is anchored early and the lantern room with its clock provides spatial grounding. The puppet head's hollow core and the pedestal are concrete, and the beam pulsing with song rhythm charges the final third. However, the setting does not constrain a choice; Elara encounters no access problem, resource limit, or environmental pressure that alters her approach, keeping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, and cursed orchard are vividly rendered with concrete sensory detail (bronze wings whirring, frost forming, nut's shell "intricately carved"). Spatial choreography is mostly clear; Elara's movements along the cliffside and the travelers' path are trackable. The nut and device constrain her assembly choices, and the frost deadline adds urgency. The mechanical birds' patrols shape her evasion tactics, lifting the setting above postcard description and grounding pressure in the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.9)
    The braided ravine is vividly anchored (wet stone, decay, water channels) and the foam patterns serve as both setting detail and conceptual tool, constraining Aris's insight and charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects his chemist's eye (surfactants, surface tension). The chrysalis and flowing water recur with purpose. However, the lab return is generic—no tactile or spatial grounding of the polymer design work, no environmental friction in the presentation to the team. The ravine setting drives the central insight but does not constrain the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glass orchard library floating on clouds is vivid in conception but remains postcard description—branches tremble, mist forms, but none of these details constrain Elara's choices or tactics. The vial of bottled moonlight is handled twice (uncorking, tracing) and charges the final image when empty, lifting the score slightly. Spatial choreography is unclear: we never learn the store's layout, where the counter sits relative to the orchard branches, or how the doorway's position affects movement.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.1)
    The desert fortress and coral pavilion are vividly rendered with sensory detail ("icy coral walls shimmering with captured tears"), and the setting is anchored early. However, the environment does not constrain Kaelen's choices or alter his tactics—he moves through it without spatial friction or resource limitation. The tidal pool formations are mentioned twice but never shape a decision or charge the final image, remaining ornamental rather than integral. The micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) does not participate in closure, capping the category at mid-band despite strong descriptive work.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.1)
    The clock tower setting supplies vivid architectural detail (circular library, arched windows, spiraling stairs) and the brass weight is handled twice. However, spatial choreography in the chamber scene is vague—four people work together without clear blocking. The weight's star-chart etchings are noted but do not constrain the repair choice. Borrowed starlight recurs as atmosphere but does not alter tactics or charge the final image beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.1)
    The moonlit canyon provides vivid visual atmosphere but functions as postcard backdrop rather than constraint. Spatial choreography is minimal (she positions herself once and stays put). The broken mirror is described repeatedly but never constrains a tactical choice or alters her methodology. Sensory detail leans heavily visual without body-state or tactile grounding during the purported neural rewiring.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.1)
    The serpentine grotto's inverted gravity and mist supply vivid sensory anchors and constrain Elara's movement across multiple beats. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the climb and final vault entry. The manuscript doodle functions as a micro-setting object that guides navigation, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment or tool constrain choice. Sensory hierarchy is consistent but some details (stalactites as floors, mirrored clouds) read decorative rather than tactically consequential at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    The siskin alder grove is vividly anchored early with "cathedral of stillness" and "alder trunks standing like silent sentinels." The porcelain insulator's "hairline stress cracks webworked across its glossy white surface" provides tactile micro-setting that charges the closure—Elara fashions the instrument from it, and its cracks supply the resonant frequencies. Sensory selection is purposeful (the "soft, grey sky," the "pure, clear note"), and the grove's silence functions as both atmosphere and constraint, directly pressuring Elara's practice. The setting is fully integrated into the final image as the trees' leaves tremble "from an inner vibration."

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    The magnetic nexus supplies vivid atmosphere ("air humming," "light seem to bend," lodestone altar) and the basalt stone's dent fits a ridge in the nexus core, creating a micro-setting constraint that enables the climactic act. Twilight deepening into indigo modulates mood effectively. However, the setting does not force a difficult choice or alter tactics; it remains a stage for Kael's ritual. The specificity is strong, but the environment's role in the closure is more symbolic than causal, keeping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.1)
    The workshop is anchored early with selective detail (crystalline device, brass clasp, starlight through windows). However, the setting remains postcard backdrop; no environmental constraint shapes her choices or tactics. The final image does not charge the workshop or use micro-setting to alter the ending's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.7)
    The treetop village, woven platforms, and enriched-soil balcony are vivid and stable. Elara's olfactory filter is consistent: "wet stone and ozone," "minute shift in soil's aroma." The seed's physical texture (dark, wrinkled, first crack, tender shoot) evolves and charges the final image. However, the setting remains largely postcard—atmospheric but not constraining a choice—and the "wildflower hush" arrives late as tonal declaration rather than emerging from prior spatial or sensory pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.4)
    The floating arches, inverted water, and glowing cavern are vivid and consistent. Spatial choreography is clear across the skiff's path. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—Kaelen drifts passively through set-pieces without the world imposing friction. Sensory detail is selective (quartz gleam, soft gurgle, pulsing moss) but remains decorative rather than pressure-bearing, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.1)
    The container labyrinth is vividly established ("rust-streaked walls forming a metallic canyon," "metallic sighs") and shapes spatial choreography throughout (narrow gaps, vortices, clearing with scarred metal). The anemometer and wind currents constrain Elias's survey path and enable reconstruction of the crash's final seconds. The setting participates actively in the closure: the patch is "half-buried in grime," the debris patterns tell a story, and the labyrinth's wind dynamics drive the thematic answer. Strong sensory selection and POV filter (investigator's eye for causality) push this into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ice cavern anchors early and sensory details (refracted light, natural ice window) are vivid. However, the space never constrains a choice or alters tactics; Elara positions herself beneath the window without friction. The amber music sheet and bells float as props rather than tools with mechanical consequence. Atmosphere is thickly described but passive—no object or environment charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.7)
    The thunder-echo range is anchored with sensory detail ("avalanchingly quiet," "gray stone," "driftwood...bleached and smoothed by ancient waters") and the driftwood markers constrain Kael's navigation across realms, enabling his return—a clear choice-shaping role. The otherwhere realms are less spatially coherent ("light bent like liquid and shadows had substance") but serve the accumulative design. Micro-setting (the flute, the case, the markers) functions purposefully. The final image recharges the canyon setting ("less like a prison and more like a sanctuary"), meeting the 9+ test's threshold, though the broader world remains underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.7)
    The topaz workshop, night sky, and vanishing stars are vivid and consistent. The halo fragment glows, pulses, and reacts to emotion, but these reactions do not constrain a tactical choice or alter the ending's charge—they remain atmospheric. The letterpress mechanism ("clicking like a falling lock") is described but not handled in a way that shapes outcome. Spatial choreography is clear, and the setting modulates with time (stars vanish, dawn threatens), yet the environment functions as backdrop rather than active constraint at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.1)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway is vivid and anchors the scene early, with selective sensory detail (green to violet shift, rocky spine, cold mist). The pendant's vibrations respond to the aurora's energy, creating a micro-setting constraint that affects the encounter's duration. However, the setting does not force a tactical choice or visibly shape the ending image; it remains atmospheric rather than decisive. Spatial choreography is clean and the environment reflects Kaelen's shifting mood, but the final sunrise arrival feels like scenic backdrop rather than a setting element that charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.1)
    The quartz arbor and frost-covered car window are vivid and purposeful. The frost patterns constrain Elara's method and charge the revelation beat. However, the arbor itself remains a postcard backdrop—"crystalline structures rose like trees from the mist-shrouded ground"—without exerting pressure on her choices or supplying resources that alter tactics. The prism and frost function as micro-setting well; the arbor does not.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    The orchard and bamboo forest are vividly rendered with "skeletal sentinels" and "green-tinged shafts," and the setting directly pressures Elara: the advancing silence chews at the world's edges, forcing urgency. The loom and amber bead function as micro-setting that constrains her method. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the orchard's interior layout remains vague. The final image—orchard blooming anew, vines climbing bamboo—charges the closure by showing the sacrifice's effect on the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.1)
    The floating rock arches and abandoned mines are vivid and specific, anchoring locale and providing resources. However, setting details remain postcard description: the arches "hum in sympathy" but never constrain a choice or alter tactics. The forge and mine shafts appear in multiple beats, but spatial choreography is vague (we never see Elian navigate distance or obstacle). The "whispering trees" grove materializes without prior setup and disappears after one exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay is vividly sketched with selective detail (derelict starship skeletons, ancient gravel, emerald light filtering through dust) and the green glass shard becomes a recurring anchor that Kaelen handles multiple times. The rift and alternate-reality visions provide atmosphere but remain largely visual backdrops; the environment does not constrain Kaelen's choices in a way that changes tactics. The shard warms, pulses, and cools, lending some micro-setting pressure, which lifts the score into functional range.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lantern room's "profound stillness" and "luminescent ache" create a charged micro-setting. The sea glass, spiral stairs, and Fresnel lens are vivid and purposeful. The cairn-building on the shore grounds the abstract "protect" imperative in tactile action. The "spectral cold" intensifying as he works below creates spatial pressure that links setting to conflict. Sensory hierarchy (cold, stillness, the lap of water) is POV-filtered and advances atmosphere without catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.1)
    The emerald lighthouse and glass wick anchor setting early and recur, but neither constrains a choice or charges the final image—Kael manipulates the wick without friction or cost. Spatial choreography inside the tower is vague (spiral stairs, chamber, lenses float without clear layout). The post-newspaper timeframe is mentioned once and never pressures tactics. Sensory detail skews visual and generic ("green stone glowing," "verdant patterns") without POV filter or urgency modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.1)
    The floating tea house and valley mist are vividly sketched and anchor the opening cleanly. However, the setting remains postcard description—Kaelen never uses the levitation, thermal currents, or bamboo deck to constrain a choice or enable a tactic. The sun trails are mapped but don't alter his approach; the wall that displays symbols is passive scenery. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric but doesn't pressure the character's inquiry or shape the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.1)
    The stormlit tower, moonlight, and ancient oaks are vividly sketched and anchor the single scene cleanly. Sensory detail leans visual (gleaming stones, silver light, cracked lens) with minimal tactile or auditory grounding beyond the pin's clink. The sextant's broken state and the storm remain postcard elements—neither constrains Elara's actions nor supplies a resource she must work around. The tower room and window frame the final turn, but spatial choreography (table, window, oaks outside) stays static rather than shaping her choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.1)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly described with selective detail (phosphorescent plants, mica window's internal luminescence). The mica window constrains Elara's method—she must stand before it and direct song through it—giving the setting functional pressure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. However, the "mirror world" and "endless night" remain atmospheric backdrops without altering tactics or the final image, capping deeper integration.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.8)
    The hidden door mechanism and vast chamber of ancient tomes provide atmospheric detail, but spatial choreography is sparse: we never learn where Elara sits relative to the elder or how she moves through the stacks. The library supplies mood but does not constrain a tactical choice. The crumpled invitation charges the opening and closing as a symbolic object, lifting the score modestly, but environment itself remains backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    The courtyard is vividly anchored (mossy stones, ivy curtain, dormant fountain) and the fountain's hidden compartment directly enables the climactic discovery. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's noticer lens (scent of old paper, cold carved stone). The setting constrains her actions (guerrilla gardening, the physical effort of shifting marble) and charges the final image of the tea house as sanctuary. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.1)
    The frozen library is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (frosted marble, ice-crusted books, quartz hush). However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as atmospheric backdrop. The magic lantern slide and projector are handled concretely, yet they enable Elian's work without imposing cost or complication. Micro-setting (body, tool) does not charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.4)
    The pirate market setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (salt, decay, damp wood, dripping water, lantern glow) and the tidal deadline provides atmospheric pressure. Spatial choreography—Elara moving from stall to crates to alcove—remains clear throughout. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; no physical constraint (proximity, tool, terrain) forces a tactical choice or charges the final image. The watch fob's tactile presence (cool metal, intricate design) recurs but remains ornamental rather than constraining action.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lavender bluff and aurora are vividly rendered and anchor the opening. The tin ring recurs across beats and the man's personal mist provides concrete sensory detail. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop; the bluff does not constrain movement, the forest elections hum without spatial consequence, and the convergence happens in open dialogue rather than through environmental pressure. Spatial choreography during the descent and meeting is vague.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.1)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vividly rendered ("walls glittering with embedded crystals," "auroral glow") and constrains Elara's choice: she uses the smooth crystal wall as a makeshift canvas, which directly shapes the climactic sketching act. Spatial choreography is coherent (narrow fissure, crystal pillar, carved niche). Sensory detail is selective and supports the reflective mood, though some passages drift toward catalog ("prismatic shimmers," "fractured versions") without POV filter.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.4)
    The greenhouse city, toxic sky, and postal archive are vividly established and the zinc plates function as both setting detail and key object. Spatial choreography through sectors and atriums is coherent. However, setting details often ornament rather than constrain: the toxic sky never forces a tactical choice, and the archive's "rusted sorting machines" are described but not used. The leaves function as micro-setting that constrains (wilting near lies), lifting the score modestly.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Whispering Bluff is vividly rendered with clouds, wind-whispers, and kinetic sculpture, and the iceberg fragment's glisten charges multiple beats including the final image. Spatial choreography (bluff, sculpture, bells, fragment) remains coherent and the sensory hierarchy (visual light, auditory chimes) supports the POV focus. However, the environment does not constrain a tactical choice—Elara adjusts bells without environmental friction—so the setting's role remains atmospheric rather than pressure-driven, capping the score below 7.0 per the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.1)
    The glass dome, desert roses, and "strangely organic" surfaces anchor setting vividly in the opening third and return at closure. The dome's "weakest point" and magnetic flicker provide the escape route, constraining tactics. Spatial choreography is clear (isolated sector, opening, desert beyond). Yet the farm functions largely as backdrop; no tool or proximity forces a mid-scene trade-off, and the roses' "awareness" is ornamental description rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.7)
    The vibrant courtyard is established early with sensory anchors (dawn light, cobblestones, fountain, pigeons). Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (apartment, courtyard, mailbox). However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—it serves as backdrop rather than micro-setting that alters tactics. The locket's "faint scent of lavender" and the "rusted and stubborn" mailbox supply texture but do not pressure the ending beat. Entering the 7.0+ band requires setting to shape closure; here it does not.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sunken laboratory is vividly anchored with algae-streaked walls, fractured viewports, and green light filtering through deep ocean. Sensory detail is purposeful and integrated into action (placing dice on a rusted control panel, the stasis chamber irising open). However, the environment never constrains a choice or complicates tactics; it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure. The final image does not meaningfully charge the setting ("mysterious familiarity of the deep"), missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.2)
    Setting detail is vivid and integrated: fluctuating gravity pools anchor action (boots sinking, floating with the jar), the salt-crystal chamber's halite walls and falling shards create atmosphere, and gravity's erratic pull constrains movement throughout. Micro-setting—the jar buried near a salt cube—drives the exhumation beat. Sensory selection is strong (bitter coffee, gleaming walls, thick air), though some passages lean decorative ("leviathan of gleaming silence"). The salt chamber participates in closure by supplying the physical site where memory-objects wait, satisfying the constraint test for higher band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.1)
    The nocturnal haven and brook are named but never constrain a choice or alter tactics. Sensory detail is generic (starlit sky, gentle flow, quiet brook) and interchangeable across fantasy settings. Spatial choreography is vague—Elian's body, the water's surface, and the origami wing float in abstract relation. The setting functions as backdrop, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rooftop garden during the Leonid shower supplies vivid sensory anchors—jasmine, ferns, meteor streaks—and recurs across beats to frame lessons and the final dissolution. The seal as micro-setting object constrains teaching method (warm wax, parchment, tracing patterns) and charges the final image when it glows and transfers. Spatial choreography is clean; the spectral transparency detail and tea-pouring ballet embed Finch in the setting without postcard cataloging. Environment actively shapes the teaching ritual and the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.4)
    The velvet garden is vividly anchored early with sensory specifics—moss underfoot, night flowers, deep shadows—and the Circle of Echoes provides spatial grounding for the ritual. The seashell and resonance stones function as micro-setting elements that constrain the archive action. However, the garden itself does not evolve or pressure Elara's choices; it remains a static backdrop whose beauty is described repeatedly without altering tactics or charging the final image beyond atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.1)
    The marble sanctuary and aurora provide vivid visual anchors. Stalactites drip throughout, creating a rhythmic sensory thread, and the thorn is handled twice (clutched, then pressed). However, the setting never constrains a choice—Elara could perform the same ritual anywhere. Spatial choreography is clean, and the pearl twilight modulates tone, but the environment remains postcard-beautiful rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.1)
    The serpentine nexus and starlight anchor setting early, and "under starlight" recurs at closure, creating a light lyric frame. However, the environment remains decorative: no spatial constraint alters Kaelen's tactics, and the nexus supplies exposition rather than obstacle. The whispering seashell is handled twice but does not constrain a choice—it confirms what Kaelen already perceives. Sensory detail is generic ("winding paths," "ancient secrets") without POV filter or urgency modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glacial shrine and melted snow globe are vividly described and recur across the text. However, neither constrains a choice: the shrine is a backdrop, the globe a static relic handled off-page. Spatial choreography in the port-town visits is generic; no sensory detail or environmental friction affects Kaelen's method. Micro-setting does not alter tactics or charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.1)
    The whispering parapet, moon paths, and fireflies are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail filtered through Kaelen's perceptual bias. However, the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics—it remains postcard atmosphere. The bamboo whisk and nets are handled but do not shape action; the setting supports tone without pressuring the protagonist's options or charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.7)
    The wasteland orchard is vivid and specific—radioactive dust, unblemished fruit, precise geometry of branches—and the setting does pressure Kaelen's search. The diamond's physical properties (milky, cracked, pulsing light) anchor the final image, and the stillpoint's activation clears the air in a "perfect, silent sphere," which charges the ending. However, the orchard functions more as atmospheric backdrop than as a constraint that alters tactics; Kaelen digs at the tree base without spatial or environmental resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    The observatory, cobalt portico, and rain-slick glass create vivid atmosphere, and the descent through storm is tactile. However, spatial choreography below the observatory is vague—crowds, councils, and the "makeshift cobalt canopy" float without anchoring who stands where or how distances shape action. The portico's blue hue is described repeatedly but never constrains a choice or charges the closure image with mechanical consequence, keeping it shy of the 9+ gate despite strong sensory work early.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    The feral loft beneath the dunes is vividly rendered with driftwood walls, salt-crusted air, and sunlight filtering through cracks. Sensory detail is selective and atmosphere is strong ("lonesome splendor"). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains postcard description that supports mood without shaping the protagonist's decisions or charging the final image. The music box and jars are handled, but the loft itself is static.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.1)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly painted in the opening ("frozen waves catching light like shattered glass") and the sunset anchors time. However, the setting remains decorative backdrop: the ice's thinness is declared dangerous but never constrains a choice on the page. The key and lighthouse mechanism are named but their physical operation—insertion, sound propagation, ice response—is told rather than shown through tactile, immediate detail. Spatial choreography is legible but static, with Kaelen moving from dock to lighthouse base without the environment shaping his tactics or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.1)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly described and recur across the text. However, they function as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraints that shape choice—Elara's actions (laying hands on the viaduct, aligning a lodestone) proceed without environmental friction or resource scarcity. The viaduct "enhanced by the recent rain" is mentioned but never tested; no moment where its properties fail, complicate, or demand adaptation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful but does not pressure the protagonist's path.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.1)
    The subway tunnel is vividly sketched (cracked concrete, frayed wires, rust) and the lantern functions as a recurring object across beats. Spatial choreography is clear: Elara moves through the tunnel, pauses at the fall site, discovers the hidden compartment, confronts Thorn, exits. The drought justifies rushed repairs and skipped inspections, tying setting to stakes. However, the environment does not meaningfully constrain her choices in the peak beat—Thorn lunges, she sidesteps—so the setting remains illustrative rather than indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    The music box shop is vividly rendered ("cathedral of forgotten melodies," "oil and old wood," "dust motes...like shards of hope") and the workbench supplies the concrete site for the repair. The clockwork heart's ticking pulse at the end charges the final image. However, the prison—central to the backstory and the chaplain's return—remains abstract; no spatial detail roots the "gray world" or makes it pressure a choice here. The shop constrains the chaplain's learning but does not force a tactical decision (e.g., a missing tool, a time limit).

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.4)
    The acid sea, gears-and-cogs workshop, and kaleidoscope are vivid and consistently rendered. The arrow-tip insertion and kaleidoscope eyepiece anchor micro-setting, and the hissing sea provides atmospheric pressure. However, no environmental detail constrains a choice or alters the final image; the setting remains a backdrop rather than a tactical participant. Spatial choreography is clear but purely decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.1)
    The social network archive setting is sketched with "vast, humming servers" and "cool air," but the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics. Spatial choreography remains vague; no body/tool/recurring object pressures a decision. The patch is described but not handled across beats. Setting functions as backdrop rather than crucible, missing the constraint test for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lighthouse orchard and shifting ice floes frame the opening vividly, and the vintage store's mirror-lined walls supply concrete setting for the central sequence. Spatial choreography inside the store is clear as Kaelen moves from mirror to mirror. However, setting never constrains a choice or imposes cost—the ice and orchard serve as backdrop, the store's mirrors facilitate rather than complicate. Driftwood's "salt-weathered buildings" and the store's "dust and old wood" smell are generic postcard touches that do not filter through Kaelen's professional or emotional priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    The drift-ice marina supplies vivid sensory anchors (groaning wood, misting breath, ice slurry) and the parasol tip is handled across multiple beats. The setting shapes Elara's meditative state and the trawling action, though it does not force a pivotal tactical choice. The parasol tip's return in the penultimate beat charges the final image, lifting the score into mid-6s under the micro-setting allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.1)
    The amber pavilion, autumn vineyard, and burned letter edge are vividly sketched with purposeful seasonal detail. However, setting remains scenic: the pavilion's walls glow, vines rustle, but neither constrains a choice nor supplies a resource that alters outcome. The letter is held, not manipulated in ways that change his stance. Spatial choreography is clean (station → pavilion → vineyard edge), but the environment functions as backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.1)
    The murmuring pavilion, dunes, and kinetic parapet are named and described but remain abstract backdrops. "Warm stone" is the sole tactile anchor; no spatial choreography tracks Kael's movement or proximity. The parapet's emergence and positioning are told rather than shown through sensory detail or obstacle. Atmosphere is asserted ("whisperfield calm") rather than built from perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.1)
    Lavender field and factory ruins are vividly established and return in the final image, satisfying the lyric-reprise path. Spatial choreography is clear (field → blanket → community hall). However, setting never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics. The vines climbing and bees humming are atmospheric decoration, not pressure. For the 9-band, environment must shape a decision; here it remains postcard backdrop throughout, capping the score below 6.0 despite strong sensory anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.1)
    The shadowed library is vivid and purposeful: towering shelves, gloom, defunct chandelier, scarred oak table, high windows casting rainbows. Sensory selection is strong (dust, suspended hush, dawn light striking crystal), and spatial choreography is clean. The crystal's physical properties (prismatic, sonically reflective) constrain Elara's method and charge the final image when it amplifies her voice, satisfying the micro-setting / object-as-setting criterion for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.7)
    Fog, driftwood, and chalk are vividly rendered and recur across beats, yet they function primarily as atmospheric motifs rather than constraining choices. The "foggy throne" appears at closure and the chalk snaps there, charging the final image, which lifts the score into mid-6s. Spatial choreography is coherent, though the garden's layout remains abstract. The videotapes are mentioned repeatedly but never pressure a decision or shift tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.7)
    The lunar observatory, crystalline dome, and airless environment are vividly established and integrate with the plot (no natural leaf-fall; Elara must use an Earth recording). Sensory detail—tremors, light floods, the recording's "whisper-soft rustle"—supports atmosphere and guides the climactic trigger. However, spatial choreography remains generic; we never see Elara navigate constraints of the dome or tools in ways that pressure her choices. The setting charges the final image (silent dome, constant stars) but does not constrain tactics in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.9)
    The Radiant Haven setting is vivid (mountains, clouds, jasmine) but remains postcard description; it does not constrain Elara's choices or supply resources that affect outcome. The vinyl shard is handled in multiple beats and gains symbolic weight, lifting micro-setting above ornamental. Spatial choreography is clean (room, window, terrace) but the environment never pressures tactics or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.1)
    The nocturnal observatory and floating isle are vividly rendered with residual energy hum, etched runes, and stellar dome. The orrery and mosaic constrain Elara's ritual actions concretely (alignment, spiral completion). Sensory detail is selective but leans visual; the automaton's bronze form and blue-glowing eyes anchor the space. Micro-setting (blood drop, key slot) charges the ritual beat, though the final image does not return to environment in a way that reweights meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.1)
    The secret garden and hedge maze are anchored early and supply concrete details (moss-covered stone, overgrown patches, verdant walls). The garden functions as micro-setting by constraining the ritual space and returning at closure when flowers bloom and fireflies rise, charging the final image. However, the environment does not pressure a choice—it responds to Elara's resolve rather than complicating it. Sensory detail is present but generic (scents of herbs, rustle of leaves, silver and blue flowers).

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.4)
    The serpentine grotto is anchored early with sensory detail (damp passages, smooth cold rock, narrow fissure). The sea glass functions as a micro-setting element that constrains Elara's method and charges the final light-projection image. However, spatial choreography remains vague—her walk out "the winding path" does not evolve the environment causally after her polishing work. The mist operates thematically ("serpentine mist seemed to listen") but does not pressure a tactical choice. Strong on atmosphere, but the setting guides choice only obliquely rather than forcing a visible constraint at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    The moss-cathedral data center is vivid and specific, with sunbeams through broken panels and thick eastern-wall moss creating spatial grounding. The icicle-drip channels constrain symbolic choice (the pattern becomes their blueprint) and the setting charges the final image of growth from wreckage. Sensory detail is purposeful: "honeyed hush," "damp earth," "gentle percussion" all filter through Elara's need for sanctuary. The micro-setting (mossy floor, amber pendant warmth) actively shapes the closure moment when Leo fastens the pendant and they stand together watching the drips.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.4)
    The feral nexus is vivid ("mist-shrouded void," "swirling hush") and anchors early. The seashell returns across beats, warming and glowing as it accumulates hopes, which charges the final image when raised "ablaze." However, the environment does not constrain a single tactical choice—Elara moves freely, and mist thickens without altering her options. The piece satisfies micro-setting allowances (recurring object) but does not reach the 9-band gate (environment must constrain choice or charge closure with spatial consequence).

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.1)
    Setting is visually described ("emerald leaves and silver dew") but remains a postcard backdrop. The arbor's decay is asserted, not demonstrated through blocked movement or resource scarcity that would constrain Elara's choices. Spatial choreography is vague—no clear distance, obstacles, or micro-environment pressures. The vine tendril's physical handling (cool, trembling, curling) provides some embodied detail, lifting the score slightly, but the setting does not shape tactics or charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered (thin air, cold, twilight), and the orchard setting supplies atmospheric texture. However, environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Elara kneels, arranges items, and completes the ritual unimpeded. The discarded objects and flash-paper function as procedural props rather than obstacles. Spatial choreography is clear, but the micro-setting (snow, frozen earth) does not shape the outcome or charge the final image with constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    The marble cavern's acoustic properties are referenced throughout (dawn/noon/dusk reflection angles), and the crystalline vessels function as micro-setting objects. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Elian's work proceeds without spatial friction or resource scarcity. The "wounded season" outside remains postcard atmosphere, and the final image does not charge the setting's properties to alter meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.1)
    The bronze grotto and starlight are anchored early and recur throughout, establishing a coherent locale. However, the environment functions primarily as static backdrop; the grotto's "metallic walls reflecting the cosmos" and "shingled hush" are described but do not constrain choice or supply resources that affect outcome. The kerosene lamp dims and is adjusted, but this does not alter Elara's tactics or the calcification process. Sensory detail leans heavily on visual and abstract registers ("shingled hush," "boundary-lessly trapped") without grounding in body, tool, or micro-setting that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rain-beaded skylight and loft anchor the scene early with vivid sensory detail ("rust-hued peace," "scent of wet ash"). The ash wood's grain is noted but does not constrain a carving choice. The kettle provides ambient pressure but does not limit tool selection or stroke sequence. Spatial choreography is clear, and the setting charges atmosphere, but it does not alter a tactic or decision on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.4)
    The kinetic lagoon, cloud-ground texture, and disposable camera wheel supply vivid sensory anchors. The setting presses Elara's wading choice and the island destination, but spatial choreography (how far she wades, how the mist thickens, where the ghost stands) remains vague at key beats. The camera wheel's glow at closure charges the final image, narrowly meeting the 9+ gate test for object-as-setting, but the lagoon's "kinetic energy" is declared more than it constrains tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.4)
    The spaceport setting is vivid and specific (soaring arches, dormant escalators, cracked domes, utility tunnels mimicking constellations). Sensory detail is selective and supports atmosphere. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice or charge the final image in a way that forecloses options—Kaelen navigates the space freely, and the resurrection proceeds without spatial friction. The sextant piece and solar reflectors function as tools but do not impose a cost tied to setting properties.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting detail is vivid and consistent: moss-softened stones, translucent tiles, arched eaves, petrichor scent, and the whispering forecourt all build a coherent sensory world. The crystal tiles after rain constrain Elara's timing (she visits "only after a rainfall") and the forecourt's whispers charge the thematic atmosphere. However, setting elements do not materially alter tactics or drive a concrete choice in the present scene—they remain primarily atmospheric. The tools (oiled cloth, delicate instruments) and the clock's gears are present but do not impose a physical obstacle or cost that shapes the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.4)
    The twilight barge canal is described with selective sensory detail (damp edge, mossy stones, still water, silent barges) that fits POV and tone. The sundial's shadow falling on a crack in the stone where water seeps through is a micro-setting moment that charges the final realization. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting does not constrain a choice but does participate in the closure image, placing the score in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.4)
    The golden dock, snow, and fog establish vivid atmosphere, and the fisherman's rope serves as a tactile puzzle object across multiple beats. Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling, peering through glass, coiling rope). However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elara decodes knots without environmental friction, and the setting remains postcard-descriptive rather than pressuring tactics. The final dock image is static recapitulation, not a charged reprise that reweights stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.1)
    The shadowed autumn garden supplies recurring atmospheric detail (skeletal trees, damp bench, fallen leaves, chill) and the palace carpet thread is handled twice with warm tactile specificity. Sensory selection serves mood well, though the spatial grounding remains somewhat static. The thread's glow and the projection images provide purposeful micro-setting effects that charge key beats, and the final sea vista reweights the garden's enclosure. The environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics, capping the score below 7.0, but it contributes meaningfully to tone and closure's affective texture.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.8)
    The suspended palace anchored to stalactites is vivid and recurs across beats (opening, quaking reverie, final sigh), lending spatial coherence. Sensory detail—dripping stalactites, whir of engines, hiss of steam—grounds the mechanical world. However, the setting remains largely decorative: the palace sways and groans atmospherically but does not constrain the prince's assembly work or alter his tactics. The moss and dew from stalactites are incorporated into the device, a functional touch that lifts the score modestly, but the ending's environmental detail (stalactites "gleaming with moisture") does not charge the closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    The obsidian lagoon, black sand, and volcanic beach are vivid and sensory-specific, establishing a distinct locale. The sand is used twice—mixed into paste and clinging to Elara's hands—giving it slight functional presence. However, the setting does not constrain choice or alter tactics; it remains postcard-beautiful backdrop. Spatial choreography is clear, but the environment does not pressure the scene's resolution, keeping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.4)
    The City of Forgotten Fountains is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (dry marbled lips, cracked cobblestones, rusted iron scent). The stained glass box and fountains recur across beats and the box's alignment with stars provides a concrete constraint at closure. Spatial choreography is clear (narrow alleys, broad plazas, Grand Fountain at the heart). However, the setting does not force a trade-off or complicate Elara's path—it supplies clues without friction, trending toward postcard richness rather than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    The nebula garden is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail (swirling gas, crystallized flora, falling petals of light) and filtered through Elara's sentimental lens. The calculating machine gear and the hidden panel on the floating ark constrain her choices: she must insert the gear to access the stellar-cycle maps, and the sonar data guides her final encoding decision. However, the setting remains largely a backdrop for reflection rather than a live pressure that alters tactics beat-by-beat. The spatial choreography is clean, and the garden's decay charges the final image, pushing the score into mid-6s despite the orientation debt cap from Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ancient greenhouse at dusk provides vivid anchor (fractured glass, ivy, ferns, dusty bench) and recurs as a spatial frame. The woven ribbon roll and butterflies function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image through reprise. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Elara moves freely without access, proximity, or material limits altering her tactics. Sensory detail is selective but skews visual; the "thundering calm" operates as metaphor rather than lived atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.4)
    The tidal obsidian ridge and clock tower are vividly anchored with concrete sensory detail (groaning waves, brass gears, moonlit tide). The pendulum bob and rake handle appear in multiple beats and shape Elias's actions, satisfying the micro-setting allowance. Spatial choreography (spiral stairs, workbench, balcony) remains clear throughout. The setting does not, however, constrain a pivotal choice—Elias's adjustment proceeds without environmental friction—preventing entry to the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.8)
    The cobalt silo under stars provides a coherent setting that anchors the nocturnal mood. Sensory detail is present ("velveteen gloom," "rough-hewn shelves," "dusty crate") but remains ornamental—none of these textures constrain a choice or alter tactics. The tapestry's frayed threads and hidden compartment shape the plot mechanically but do not force Elara to navigate spatial or material limits. The setting never complicates her work or charges the final image with spatial particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.1)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vivid as images but function as backdrop and symbol rather than constraint. The spire's "profound gloom" and the lake's stagnation are described, yet neither shapes a tactical choice or alters Kaelen's options on the page. The quill and parchment are present, but the act of writing itself—ink flow, hand cramp, the physical effort—remains abstract. At this length, the body or tool could function as micro-setting, but Kaelen's embodied interaction with his workspace never pressures a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.7)
    The ember alcove is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (fading coals, mist, shortwave glow) and recurs across beats. The dust motes swirling into shapes provide a micro-setting detail that charges the final image. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it remains atmospheric rather than pressuring. The alcove functions as sanctuary and symbol but does not test Elara's options in a way that shapes the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.7)
    The vanishing point gallery and rocking chair anchor space and tone effectively. The pestle, stone slab, and paper are handled on-page and constrain the ritual's sequence. However, the gallery's "walls that seemed to retreat into infinity" and "lines of perspective sharp" remain atmospheric decoration rather than elements that shape Elara's choices or the final image. Spatial choreography is clear but the environment does not pressure tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sunken sewer system and sedimentary layers are vividly rendered with concrete sensory detail (damp stone, grime, faint glow from a crack). The chronometer cog is handled twice (in her pocket, held up to light) and the brass plate discovery provides a concrete final image. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or meaningfully alter tactics; it serves as backdrop rather than crucible. The body and tools (trowel, scraps of metal) appear but do not shape the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    The velvet library is vividly rendered with Persian rug, leaded glass, and autumn light slanting through dust motes; the setting grounds Elara's reflection and shapes her search through tactile engagement (fingers over dusty shelf, carved oak chest). The rosette's placement in the chest and its later position on the piano provide spatial coherence. However, the rehearsal hall remains a white room—no sensory detail or spatial choreography beyond "faces a mosaic of apprehension and hope." The library's atmosphere charges the first two-thirds but does not extend into the closure beat, limiting its contribution to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.1)
    The rusted greenhouse is described repeatedly (skeletal iron, broken panes, creaking framework) but functions as postcard backdrop rather than constraint. Elara clears fertile soil and prunes vines without spatial friction—no blocked path, no scarce resource, no physical limit that alters her tactics. The celestial alignment provides ambient light but does not pressure timing or choice. Micro-setting exception not met: no body state, tool, or recurring object meaningfully restricts action or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lightning collection tower and drone beehive provide vivid sci-fi anchors, and "nectar-dusk" offers consistent tonal color. The summit climb and water-spray action involve the setting physically, constraining the repair attempt to the tower's rods. However, the lacquer box and matchbox function as portable props without altering spatial choreography or offering location-based obstacles. The setting charges the final image modestly (tower as sentinel), meeting the lower edge of integration but not shaping a decisive tactic or closure cost.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.1)
    The quiet bay, cherry blossoms, cobblestone streets, and rusty gate provide sensory anchoring, but remain postcard descriptors that do not constrain choice. The orris root shard on the gate latch is the sole moment where setting detail (the latch) supplies a micro-constraint for the displaced-object method, narrowly satisfying the 9+ gate requirement. Otherwise, the cottage interior and bay function as backdrop without altering tactics or charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.1)
    Underwater garden imagery is vivid ("drifting seaweed," "iridescent coral," "bioluminescence") and establishes mood, but remains decorative. The "structural weaknesses" and "fragile seam" are mentioned as access points but do not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page. The foxglove ampoule is handled twice (recalled, then guided telepathically), meeting minimal spatial coherence, but the garden itself supplies no obstacle or resource that shapes the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.6)
    The infinite staircase is named but not grounded in sensory particulars—no material (stone appears once, late), temperature gradient, acoustic signature, or spatial scale that would anchor Elara's position. The chipped die is handled twice (clutched, rolled) but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Spatial choreography is absent: we never learn if she's ascending, paused, or moving laterally when the rupture occurs. The setting functions as conceptual backdrop rather than lived-in pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rooftop greenhouse, smog-choked city, and moon-tipped brush establish vivid atmosphere. Sensory detail—humid air, saffron quiet, acidic haze—supports tone but does not constrain a choice or alter a tactic. The waxing moon intensifies visions yet functions as backdrop rather than pressure lever. Spatial choreography (stairs, table, greenhouse edge) remains clear, and the micro-setting (brush, bowl of water) charges the final vision sequence, narrowly meeting the 9+ gate at the low end.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.1)
    The grotto's mist, waterfall roar, and carved rock anchor setting early and recur purposefully. The eastern cliff's blue succulents supply the decisive resource, constraining Elara's final choice and charging the closure. Rosewater-scented vines layer atmosphere with the dread motif. Spatial choreography (museum back room, oldest quarters, home, cliff) tracks cleanly. The waterfall's "muffled roar" and "perpetual cool mist" are vivid and POV-filtered. The setting does meaningful work but remains somewhat backdrop; the cliff ascent in the final act finally makes environment a tactical obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse, hunger stone, and yoyo all constrain Elara's method and charge the final image. The tide's retreat governs the window for discovery and work, and the reversed rain at closure reweights the lighthouse beam's arc. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"sucking kelp," "cool, damp stone," "air thickened"—without catalog sprawl. The island "holding its breath" is a purposeful ambient echo that supports tone without forced symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.4)
    The funhouse setting is vivid in texture ("rust and rotten cotton candy," "cracked and distorted" mirrors) and the clasp is handled across multiple beats, constraining her final choice. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the hall-of-mirrors sequence. However, the "lingering luminance" remains a floating abstraction—its source and mechanics are never anchored, weakening the micro-setting's causal grip on the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.5)
    The floating orchard and blue-hour setting are vivid and specific, anchoring who/where/when early. However, the driftwood raft and crystalline resonator remain decorative; neither constrains a choice or evolves under pressure. The wave is described but its threat feels rhetorical—spatial choreography of the "fragile circle" never translates into tactical limits. Sensory detail skews heavily visual ("indigo expanse," "swirling nimbus") without embodied immediacy during peak action.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    The turtle shells are handled repeatedly (tracing whorls, correlating patterns, the crack) and constrain Kaelen's method—pattern-reading depends on the physical substrate. The reed whistle and the crack that glows charge the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Kaelen's cartographic focus. The setting is purposeful rather than postcard; the shells function as both landscape and code, and the "highest point of the central turtle" anchors the climax spatially.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.4)
    The disused station, ivy, and rosebush are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("scent of damp earth and old roses," "rusted tracks," "crumbling brick"). The setting provides atmosphere and a symbolic frame (the fallen petal signals beginning, the thorned bush closes the piece) but does not constrain Elara's choices or supply resources that alter her tactics. The illuminated letter is described in detail yet handled as a static object; spatial choreography (spread notes on bench, photograph the detail) is clean but minimal. The environment functions as backdrop rather than active pressure, landing the piece in mid-band despite strong descriptive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.1)
    The submerged pavilion is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail—"slimy tiles," "black, placid water," "gaunt ribs"—and the water constrains Elias's movement and chills his legs, meeting the micro-setting standard. The antique inkwell functions as tactile anchor across beats. However, the setting does not evolve causally or alter tactics; Elias's actions proceed unimpeded by the environment's decay, and the final placement underwater feels more symbolic than a forced adaptation. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.1)
    The forgotten library and sunken setting are vividly established with sensory anchors (carved wood, salt scent, warped cabinet). The blackout creates spatial constraint—navigation by memory and touch—and the antique stamp functions as a recurring micro-setting object that charges the final beat. However, much of the setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than a live pressure that alters her tactics mid-scene; the hidden drawer discovery is the one moment where environment meaningfully shapes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.1)
    The floating island, glass basilica, and tea garden are vividly described with sensory detail (transparent walls refracting rainbows, tea leaves rustling). However, setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint—Elara's movements through garden and basilica do not meaningfully narrow options or charge the final image. The shadow's spatial position (garden's edge, mimicking her) does not alter her tactics or force a choice. Spatial choreography inside the basilica (climbing to higher chamber, selecting orbs) remains clear but ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    The observatory is anchored early with "silent corridors," "dormant telescopes," and "overtaxed circuit breakers," and the Stellar Resonance Chamber functions as a micro-setting that constrains the hunt to a timed window. The geode in its cradle and the feedback loop that triggers darkness are spatial/material anchors that drive the key turn. Sensory detail is selective (sparks, absolute blackness, emergency lights) and purposeful. The circuit-breaker countdown and the spatial choreography of console/cradle/panel remain coherent, and the final viewport image charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.1)
    The observatory's "brilliant dimness," crystal prism, and lever engage three distinct beats—setup, complication (garbled output), and climax (alignment). The "dusty screen" and "cold brass handle" add tactile grounding. However, the spatial relationship between console, dome, and lever remains vague, and the star trails themselves are visual postcard rather than a constraint that shapes Kael's choices mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.7)
    The cobalt terrace frames the opening and closing, anchoring place with color and mood. The shore's "sieved hush" and "overgrown" path create tactile detail, and the driftwood carvings serve as micro-setting objects that Elara handles. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—she simply finds the carving she sought, and the setting provides backdrop rather than complicating her access or forcing a tactical shift. Sensory hierarchy reads as consistent (damp sand, grooves in wood), but spatial choreography remains static.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.1)
    The parapet setting is vividly established with sensory detail (mist, wind, stone) and returns in the final image. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a pressure element that shapes negotiation moves. The drawer pull as micro-setting object is mentioned but not handled in multiple tactile beats that change Elara's approach. Spatial choreography is clear, and the mist/moon provide thematic resonance, but the setting remains ornamental to the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.1)
    The coastal launch, utility poles, and lighthouse anchor the spatial frame. Poles function as micro-setting, constraining Kael's navigation method and charging the final acceptance. Sensory detail is present (salt air, cold water, choppy waves) but often generic. The kayak and compass are handled on the page, and the poles return at closure to validate the humble method. Setting participates in the ending but does not deeply constrain the middle choices; the transformation hinges more on internal shift than environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    The underground bioluminescent lake is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (damp air, soft glow, pulsing creatures). The baseball returns as a tactile anchor ("delicately robust," "time-worn leather"), and Leo's act of throwing it onto the water to reveal a new path gives the setting a functional role in one key beat. However, spatial choreography on the narrow stone path is vague, and the lake's mechanics—how choices "ripple outward"—remain abstract. The final paragraph's return to the ball constrains no present choice, limiting setting's role at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    The orchard, moonlight, and altar are established early and provide a coherent spatial frame. The rare spices (saffron, cinnamon, cardamom, myrrh) are handled concretely and their scents actively conjure the bridge. The bridge itself enables the crossing, constraining Elara's path to metamorphosis. The permanent moonlight and orchard return in the final image, charging closure with continuity. Minor: the "realm of swirling mists and echoing whispers" is generic postcard description without tactical texture.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.1)
    The midnight glade is vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (silver grass, whispering ferns, clouds below swirling like liquid time) and the body/tool micro-setting (saucer, tablecloth, deck) recurs across beats. The saucer's crack glows and becomes a gateway, directly enabling the climactic action. Spatial choreography is clean (kneel, spread cloth, place saucer, shuffle cards, reach into crack) and the environment charges the final image ("choking beauty" as "sweet weight"). The glade constrains choice by being the place where lost time accumulates, making it essential rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.1)
    The recycled spaceship is signaled early and its "ghostly resolve" hums through the piece. Sensory detail is selective—"worn metal grating," "faded photographs," "milky quartz"—and reflects Elara's archival focus. The quarters function as micro-setting, constraining her method (photographs require sanctuary), and the ship "groans" sympathetically during her work, charging the atmosphere. However, spatial choreography beyond the quarters is vague, and the environment does not meaningfully constrain the final beat; the door opens in her room without the ship's layout or hazards shaping the attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.1)
    The black sand beach and volcano are vividly named and provide a charged backdrop, but neither constrains a choice or alters Elara's tactics—she walks to the center "pulled," sits, and releases the bugs without spatial or environmental friction. Sensory detail ("cool, black sand," "warm glow") is present but remains ornamental. The setting does charge the final image (volcano glow, starlight path), lifting the score into mid-band despite the lack of on-page constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.1)
    The luminous fort and blackout frame the action, and the sundial anchors the cipher scene with functional spatial detail. However, the armory and courtyard remain generic holders for plot moves; no environmental constraint shapes Elara's choices, and the setting does not charge the final image. Sensory detail is sparse and unfiltered by urgency—"shadows clung to rusted weapons" reads as stage dressing rather than perception under pressure. The quill holder functions as a tool but does not embody the setting's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal bluff and aurora are vividly rendered with sensory detail (shimmering, pulsing light, cold, slick surfaces). The painted rocks and leadwood box function as tactile anchors. The rocks' angle adjustment and the star dust's hovering behavior constrain Kaelen's final choice, satisfying the micro-setting gate. Specificity is high and the setting charges the closure image, though the "frictionless world" premise remains largely atmospheric rather than pressing tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.1)
    The stormlit observatory is visually vivid but functions as postcard backdrop; the storm never constrains a choice or alters tactics. The darkroom timer is mentioned but does not interact with the space—no detail of the observatory's tools, layout, or access pressures Elara's decisions. Spatial choreography is clean (Elara moves from console to telescope to the stranger), but the setting remains ornamental rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glass atrium, brook, sundial, and needle card are vividly named and recur across the text. However, setting remains postcard: the atrium's "prismatic shards" and "dignified chaos" are declared rather than constraining movement or choice. The sundial's hidden compartment clicks open conveniently, and the brook's murmur is atmospheric rather than tactical. Micro-setting credit: the needle card is handled twice (traced, inserted into sundial groove), but its measurement function is expository rather than a live constraint that alters an on-page decision.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.7)
    The rusted library under stars is vivid and consistent, with sensory details (silver glow, wind whistling through holes, precarious tower of books) filtered through the present action. Spatial choreography is clear and the setting charges the tone. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics in the present scene—Elara and Leo work methodically without obstacle or friction from the ruin itself. The coffee tin's false bottom functions as micro-setting and does participate in the ending gesture, lifting the score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.7)
    The tidal arbor is vividly anchored with pulsing flora, erratic compasses on brass pillars, and mist curtain as screen. Spatial choreography is clean (piano, film canister, projector, curtain of mist), and the shift from arbor to monochrome ballroom is legible. The arbor's failing protection does shape Elian's urgency ("he needed to act now"), and the film's black-and-white world becomes a micro-setting that constrains his final move. The compasses' shift from spinning to still in the film-world charges the transition, though the final ballroom's empty stage feels more postcard than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ancient ridge and standing stones are named and described with sensory detail (blooms, humming air, pulsing ground), but they function as postcard backdrops rather than constraints that alter tactics. The crystalline ark and enchanted reeds appear only to solve problems without prior setup. Spatial choreography is vague—Elara "hurries" and "rushes" without coherent distances or obstacles. The blooming ridge does frame the opening and closing, providing mild lyric resonance, but it does not charge the final image or narrow a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.4)
    The islet after rain is vividly established with sensory detail (wet earth, salt, breeze) and the bonsai-lace objects anchor micro-setting effectively. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Kaelen walks the shore without spatial friction or resource limitation. The locket discovery in the cove offers a spatial moment, but the environment itself remains atmospheric rather than pressurizing.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting is vividly specific and POV-filtered, with "silver grass and whispering ferns" and "clouds below swirling like liquid time" charging the final image. The saucer and tablecloth function as micro-settings that constrain choices, such as the crack becoming a gateway, and sensory details are purposeful. Spatial choreography is coherent, with the glade actively pressuring Elara's journey.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    The recycled spaceship setting is vividly described with sensory details like "worn metal grating" and "faded photographs," creating a ghostly atmosphere that pressures Elara's mission.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful, with the glass atrium and brook mirroring internal states and influencing choices (e.g., sundial as micro-setting). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, though some descriptions risk ornamentation without constraining closure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rusted library under stars is vivid and atmospheric, constraining choices through the rebuild action and charging the final image with symbolic weight. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's POV, though tactile integration could be deeper. The setting pressures tactics and supports theme.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.3)
    The tidal arbor setting pressures choices through the violent tides and flickering compasses, constraining Elian's escape.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse is vivid and coherently rendered, with mud-smeared glass, broken stems, and dust-filled fractures that evolve over time. Setting and object (the butterfly scale) are tightly integrated with Aris’s perception and with the final reweighting of meaning. Environment doesn’t quite constrain tactical choices, but it strongly charges the closing image and supports the mood of slow reclamation.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.5)
    The canyon, stars, and frost are clearly evoked and create a consistent meditative atmosphere, with the frost-patterns doing good symbolic and functional work. Sensory detail is mostly visual and somewhat generalized, but it remains coherent and filtered through Elara’s artistic eye (e.g., comparing frost to her glass work). The setting rarely constrains choices or materially changes tactics beyond supplying the frost as a decoding surface. Overall it’s effective mood-wise, but not yet fully exploited as a live environment.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    The winterglass conservatory, frost-etched flora, cut piano strings, and color-blooming glass create a vivid, coherent environment that is strongly filtered through Elara’s sensory and emotional priorities. Setting is not mere backdrop: the frozen panes and plants thriving in stillness directly embody the world’s rules (no noise) and thematically echo her project, and the glass literally serves as the canvas for her “music.” The recurring physical objects—the piano, tuning forks, crystalline workbench, and glass surfaces—constrain what is possible and substantially charge the final image of the conservatory holding her masterpiece. A slightly broader sensory range (beyond the visual and temperature) might have pushed this even higher, but what’s here is focused and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    The underwater city library and its surrounding seascape are vividly evoked—coral-encrusted spires, marble columns, warped books, the moonlit shaft and pocket of air—and feel specific rather than generic. Environment genuinely constrains choice: the submerged architecture, the air pocket, and the meeting of light and water are what make the repair possible. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elijah’s aim for rest and understanding. The setting strongly charges the final image of the reactivated lens and the quieted library.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.0)
    The terra-cotta arbor, ridge, humid night, and cramped basements create a distinct, moody environment that supports the story’s quiet, clandestine tone. Setting is consistently present and filtered through Elara’s purpose, especially the arbor as both drop point and sanctuary. However, the environment rarely constrains choices in specific ways; it colors the scenes more than it forces tactics beyond generic “swift and silent” movement. The bell as object is strongly integrated and helps charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    The twilight viaduct, wisteria, damp stone, and silvery strands are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the story’s liminal, spiritual atmosphere. The environment is not just backdrop: it functions as a repository for unused love and charges the final image as the wisteria “glow with renewed vitality.” While the setting doesn’t sharply constrain tactical options moment-to-moment, it does define the metaphysical rules (liminal storage sites) and the kind of closure available. The specificity and sensorial richness feel publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.0)
    The living bridge garden, woven willows, and crystal streams are vivid and central, and the environment actively participates in the climax when the oldest bridge disintegrates. Details like the corkboard of fading photographs and hyperbolic maze contours add specificity and atmosphere while reinforcing theme. Most description is visual and conceptual, with less engagement of other senses or practical constraints on action. Still, the setting clearly shapes the final image and is tightly interwoven with the story’s concept.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    The abandoned carnival, decaying prize center, and rusted wall are vivid and coherent, and the environment meaningfully supplies tools (piano bench, arrow, hidden room) that shape Elara’s tactics. The wall’s physical collapse and sunlight flooding in effectively charge the final images of planting. That said, the sensory palette leans heavily visual and symbolic (“ghosts,” “forgotten dreams”) and could benefit from more idiosyncratic, embodied detail to avoid a slightly generic post-apocalyptic mood. Still, place and objects do real work for both plot and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid, original, and strongly filtered through Elara’s perception: the sunken orchard, shipwreck ring, aurora, silt, and bitter apples all mirror broken promises and regret. These details recur and evolve, from shipwrecks as “tombstones of failed voyages” to a final peace found amid “relics of failure,” so they do thematic work rather than serving as static backdrop. Environment doesn’t sharply constrain tactical choices, but it consistently charges her actions and the final image. World rules (submerged yet thriving orchard, aurora-lit forge) feel internally consistent within this slightly surreal frame.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.3)
    The emerald station by moonlight, the verdant tiles, and the flower-adorned pillars are richly imagined and strongly filtered through Elara’s perception. Setting is not just backdrop: the station’s flowers encode routes and dangers, and the physical arrangement of jasmine hides her escape corridor. The moonlit surfaces interacting with the jar’s glow give the environment a tactile, operative role in the magic system. This integration of atmosphere and function is excellent, even if not quite at a once-in-a-decade level.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    The abandoned control room, melting ice, and makeshift furnace are vivid and integrated, with weather and space mirroring and lightly constraining her choices (the structure will become unsafe; she must work in cold, improvised conditions). Objects-as-setting—the furnace, glass rod, sphere, and bookmark—are all handled and recur to charge the final tableau. The environment supports tone and theme rather than feeling like postcard description. It could exert a bit more concrete, immediate pressure on her process beyond the eventual need to leave.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.5)
    The rusted library under the stars is richly evoked with purposeful detail—the smell of oxidized metal, decaying paper, and skeletal shelves establishes tone and Leo’s exposed vulnerability. The later move to the clock tower ties setting to character stakes by exploiting his fear of heights, and the stars recur to frame his transformation. Still, the library itself functions more as atmosphere than as a constraint on choice; Leo’s tactics do not significantly depend on the environment. Strong specificity and mood, slightly less strong functional integration.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific: the storm-tossed ridge fort, ancient stones, single star, and textured hush all create a strong atmosphere. Details are filtered through her history with the pebble-shore and silence, which gives the world some character-specific specificity. However, the environment rarely constrains options or tactics; it mainly supports mood rather than shaping choice. The final image of the fort as “silent witness” is effective but more decorative than pressuring.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.3)
    The frozen courtyard, twilight, and ice objects are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through J-7’s perception, creating a strong, unified atmosphere. The courtyard’s status as outside normal temporal flow is not just decorative; it directly enables the loop mechanics and charges the experiment and final image. Weather and temperature lightly constrain action (de-icing, frost, cold) but mostly function symbolically rather than as hard constraints, keeping this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.5)
    The “crystal whispering forecourt after rain” is vivid, sensory, and consistently returned to, with the crystals’ whispers nicely mirroring the theme of overheard truths. The environment participates in the action (echoes she “eavesdrops” on, wet crystal surfaces as projection screen), not just as backdrop. Weather and surfaces also shape image choices, though they rarely constrain options in a way that creates real difficulty. The final image of the forecourt as a place of peace meaningfully reweights the opening atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    The garden maze, hedges, and marbles form a coherent atmospheric frame, and details like paths parting and blossoms opening to her give the environment some agency. However, sensory specificity remains mostly abstract and visual, with little tactile, olfactory, or spatial grit to ground us in particular spots. The maze and marbles do charge the final image, but they rarely constrain concrete choices in scene. As a result, the setting feels thematically apt but not fully lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    The xenobiology station, gas giant, Mothraals, and magnetic nexus are all vividly and coherently rendered, with a strong sense of place and atmosphere. Details like “mechanically warm” lights against the icy void and the dormant Mothraals on the spires feel specific and embodied, not generic SF dressing. The environment meaningfully shapes the timing (twilight alignment, hush before wingbeats) and charges the final image of quiet discovery. This is one of the story’s most polished components and comes close to top-tier, though it doesn’t quite press hard enough on character choice to reach the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    The flooded opera house is vividly rendered—chest-high water, dripping ceiling, drowned piano, lantern reflections—and these details are consistently filtered through Elara’s musical sensibility. The environment constrains action (she must wade, instruments are ruined, water becomes percussion) and directly shapes the final tactic of slapping the surface as a kind of performance. The recurring objects (lanterns, water level, stained program) clearly charge the ending and help stage the ghost’s release. This setting feels specific, atmospheric, and functionally integrated rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.7)
    The mountain weather station, the auroral dawn, and the high-peak microclimate are vivid and consistently integrated with Elara’s work and realizations. Setting is filtered through her professional eye (sensors, data console) and emotional state (“auroral sorrow,” margins of the world), which supports tone and theme. The Bloom’s ecology and the station’s altitude meaningfully explain its rarity, tying world-detail to the core realization. The environment constrains the premise more than on-page tactics, which keeps this strong but shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    The abandoned train tunnel is vividly rendered—dark, collapsing, acoustically resonant—and the oppressive environment supports the mood and the ghost-shift conceit. Specifics like crumbling bricks, gravel, and the rusted pipe stub that receives the valve at the end integrate setting with action. The environment matters: the tunnel’s silence and echoes make the spectral machinery plausible and charge the final act of placing the valve back. A modest expansion of non-visual sensory detail under peak pressure could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The overgrown library, subterranean river, and obsidian refuge are vividly evoked and tonally coherent, with moss, dust, and black reflective walls building a strong atmosphere. Setting is firmly anchored and returns in the final image, recharged by the keeper’s new stance. Yet these environments rarely impose concrete constraints or alter tactics; they function more as mood and metaphor than as active pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.2)
    The oak tree, “dreaming roots,” and the hills of Sage Ridge provide a gently atmospheric frame that matches the story’s tone. The eclipse and valley setting give the central scene some visual distinctness, and the recurring oak roots motif helps with lyrical cohesion. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or action; it decorates rather than pressures the characters or redefines options. Sage Ridge itself is lightly sketched and could be swapped for any tranquil rural locale with minimal change.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “reclaimed silo library” and “bronze quiet” give the piece a strong, coherent atmosphere, and details like concentric levels, heat-cracked stones, and etched astronomical charts are purposeful and evocative. Setting is well filtered through Elian’s purpose (walls as archivists of sound), and it returns meaningfully in the final image of the walls speaking. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics or presents obstacles—it’s a gorgeously rendered backdrop rather than an active pressure, which keeps it shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.2)
    The lighthouse on the jagged island and the mainland pub establish a clear, somewhat atmospheric frame, and the final image of the lighthouse as beacon of shared mystery is thematically apt. Still, most setting detail is high-level and repetitive (“rocky island,” “mysterious lighthouse”) rather than sensory or lived-in. The environment rarely constrains tactics beyond generic isolation; the fog, rocks, and sea don’t shape moment-to-moment choices. As a result, the place feels symbolic first, physical second.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting—the dimensional anchor chamber, the ultramarine mark, the vibrating stillness—is vivid, coherent, and tightly integrated with the action. The silence, the loop pedal, and the blue light all behave as environmental tools that shape how Elian conducts his ritual rather than as static backdrop. World rules (silence as decoration, sound as structure, the anchor’s groan absorbed) feel internally consistent and are shown through event, not exposition. The only limit is that the space doesn’t significantly constrain movement or choice beyond mood and metaphysics, keeping it just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, mirrored horizon, stained glass, and dawn light are vividly rendered and recur in purposeful ways, especially the lake cracking and the prismed light amplifying the climax. Setting is tightly integrated with mood and theme—the reflective lake mirrors her backward gaze; the spire and glass refract both light and “unheard symphonies.” Environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, but it decisively charges the final images (“mirrored horizon now held the entire sky,” the nautilus lying beside her). Overall atmosphere is rich, coherent, and specific without devolving into a static postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glowing viaduct, rain, abyss, and shifting bridges form a vivid, consistent environment that both mirrors the interior conflict and affects tactics (gravity-defying leaps, path generation, gaps he must cross). The darkening glow/shadow dynamic supports the tonal arc and charges the final image when the viaduct’s glow stabilizes and then ceases. Sensory detail skews visual and could deepen into other senses, but the spatial and atmospheric anchors are strong and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.3)
    The drum maker’s cavern, the old phonograph, and the leaves outside are specific and sensorially vivid, especially in how they’re filtered through touch and vibration. Environment isn’t mere backdrop: the wood, drum skins, and spatial acoustics (muted yet resonant) actively mediate how Elara can experience “music.” Recurring objects (needle, phonograph, drums, leaves) accrue meaning and charge the final images of clay and turning seasons. A slight bias toward visual/abstract phrasing over non-hearing-specific sensory oddities keeps it shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    The courtyard at dusk, ivy wall, and pigeon create a consistent, gently atmospheric micro-setting that suits the quiet-conspiracy mood. Weather and environment (courtyard serenity, dusk-to-night transition) mirror Elara’s internal shift and are reprised at the end. However, the setting rarely constrains choices or tactics; it’s more tonal backdrop than active pressure. Detail remains fairly general instead of leveraging very specific, character-filtered sensory cues.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.3)
    The greenhouse of extinct plants, “cathedral of glass,” and “crystal shadows” are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the light-and-memory premise. UV lanterns, glass, and the Lumina Blossom’s fluorescence directly shape what can be perceived and understood, not just mood. The environment’s fragility and artificial preservation quietly mirror Elara’s emotional state without being over-explicit. A slightly broader use of non-visual sensory detail in the space itself (beyond scent) could deepen immersion further, but what’s here is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    The terra-cotta grotto, the starlit sky, and the aurora-like beings are vivid, sensorial, and integrated with Elian’s interiority; details like the warm clay and the rope on the floor anchor the lyricism. The setting constrains choices in a micro-setting way: the secluded grotto and rope as the main tool focus the conflict into this ritual-like act. The world’s rule about “energy fields” and a new frequency is sketched efficiently, though it leans abstract and could use one more concrete interaction to fully ground the beings’ pain. The final image of him standing under “silent, watching stars,” now reweighted by what we know of the beings and his loss, is strong and charged by the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and thematically charged: Echo Harbor, the sunken orchard greenhouse, and the shipwreck ring form a distinctive imaginative space. Environment matters—water, hulls, and glass shape how her music behaves and how echoes can be “caught,” and the final sense of sanctuary depends on this setting’s hybrid ruin/greenhouse quality. Details are filtered through the story’s acoustic and unfinished-beauty concerns, so they rarely feel like postcard description. The world’s rules around hush and resonance remain consistent and enrich the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.0)
    The amber grotto is vividly realized through light, translucence, and “static electricity,” and it persistently mirrors and amplifies Elara’s internal change. Environmental details—the pulsing amber light, emotional residues in the walls, the grotto’s “gratitude”—are filtered through her perception and recur meaningfully at the end. The grotto functions more as a symbolic sanctuary than a constraint on action, so it charges the final image more than it shapes concrete choices. Nonetheless, the setting is distinctive, integrated, and tonally consistent with the story’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.5)
    The “breezy library under the stars,” seaside town, and cliffs are pleasant, atmospheric touches that provide a loose, coherent sense of place. However, the setting rarely shapes choices or imposes constraints; it decorates rather than pressures the action. Details are generic (port, ships, cottage) and mostly visual, with limited embodied specificity. The recurring library/stars motif contributes to tone but does not substantively charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and particular—marsh reeds, crystalline orchard, shimmering crater, and especially the obsidian arbor all feel integral rather than decorative. Details are consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, like the reed-weaving analogy, and the arbor physically hosts the key discovery and later gatherings. The environment supports theme and mood without collapsing into static description. Its only shortfall at this level is that it rarely constrains tactics; it enriches more than it pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.0)
    The rooftop canal system, towers, and distant giant establish an evocative, unusual environment that supports the story’s dreamy tone. Details like the boat gliding, the spire, and the giant’s snore as ambient geography anchor the action enough to avoid white-room syndrome. However, the setting rarely constrains tactic or choice; the canals and heights are mostly scenic rather than actively shaping what Elara can or cannot do. As a result, atmosphere is strong but not fully weaponized into narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cavern orchard, glowing fruit, and stalactites dripping onto roots and mosaic are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elian’s analytical yet wonder-struck gaze. Crucially, the environment is not just postcard: stalactite drips become part of his method (activating the mosaic, feeding the feedback loop), and the orchard’s fruits respond at the end, charging the closure image. Sensory detail is mostly visual but used with purpose, and the spatial logic (trees, stone, stalactites) remains coherent. A touch more non-visual texture or physical constraint under pressure could push this toward elite work.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    The “shadowed library at dawn” and “sapphire hush” are vivid and recurrent, with the ducts, intercom, and tape player integrated into Kaelen’s actions rather than offered as décor. The environment meaningfully shapes what’s possible: his crawl-space knowledge, the hidden panel, and the library’s PA system all facilitate his quiet intervention. Sensory detail leans visual and tonal but is purposeful and cohesive. The setting charges the final image more than it constrains choices, but it does so with consistency and specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    The nursery, mossy trellis, rain, and storm-drenched garden are vividly rendered and tightly tied to Elara’s perceptions, especially the moss absorbing rain and the linden bending with wind. Weather and environment meaningfully mirror and gently pressure her choices—not tying the tree, allowing herself to be soaked, gathering fallen branches. The trellis evolves from mere structure to symbol of flexible support, charging the thematic frame. While the setting is atmospherically strong, it rarely constrains options in a concrete way beyond symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)
    The tidal island, slick rocks, mud, and “rare drizzle” are tactile and integrated into the action—rain exposes the artifacts and physically guides his movement. The post–water wars world is economically but convincingly sketched, and scarcity of water colors every image and choice. The amber brooch as “captured sunlight” and the unearthed patch of earth create a charged micro-setting that supports both revelation and theme. Setting doesn’t heavily constrain tactics beyond isolation and the rain’s path, but it distinctly shapes tone and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    The musical crystal cave is vividly rendered—the chiming crystals, luminous orb, shimmering downpour, and “bright darkness” create a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting details are functional and integrated into action: crystals respond to Elara’s entrance and the rain, and the cave’s magic radiates into surrounding villages. World rules (crystals chiming, shadows as conduits, pearl as amplifier) stay internally consistent. The environment colors mood more than it constrains choice, which keeps it from feeling fully indispensable as a tactical space.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ivory harbor, recent rain, and disordered archives create a strong, coherent atmosphere that feels lived-in and supports the mood of neglect and tentative renewal. Details like “pages stained by sea spray” and “dust motes dancing in the light” are specific and filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The harbor and trumpet sound meaningfully charge the final image, linking environment to emotional closure. A bit more use of setting as an active constraint (beyond tone) could have pushed this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    The misty city, crack-marked pavements, and “starlit vault in mist” are vividly sketched and tonally coherent, giving the story a consistent dreamlike atmosphere. Details are mostly visual and sometimes generic (mist, silence, glittering vapors) but integrated into action rather than info-dumped. The environment rarely constrains or complicates choices beyond serving as a beautiful corridor toward the goal; the vault is more backdrop than active pressure. Still, the recurring mist/light motifs do support the thematic move from obscurity to clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stargazer’s open tower, salt wind, and whale migration create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that fits the contemplative, quasi-mystical tone. Environmental details (whale songs, dimming sky, archives with brittle scrolls) are filtered through Elara’s observational, scholarly bias and reinforce the themes of pattern and reflection. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, it meaningfully frames the tower as a sanctuary and beacon at the end, charging the final communal image. The recurring presence of the whales and tower helps the world feel specific rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prismatic escondite and solar storm are vividly rendered, with living crystal, fractured light, and magnetic fields woven into both atmosphere and mechanism. Setting meaningfully constrains tactics—he must place the fragment at the cavern’s heart where fields concentrate—and the collapse of the escondite into a single point of light is the story’s primary material cost. World rules around magnetic fields and spacetime remain internally consistent and learnable through action. The density of visual description flirts with excess but mostly serves tone and stakes rather than becoming a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.0)
    The funeral home prep room is vivid enough—stainless steel table, caskets, “death’s honesty”—and thematically aligned with Leo’s pursuit of fairness. The setting functions partly as a moral backdrop and sanctuary that contrasts with his father’s world and charges the tone of “deathly vitality.” However, the environment rarely constrains tactics or forces specific choices; the same plot could largely unfold in another quiet workplace. The ink pot, as object, does more of the heavy lifting in charging the final image than the room itself.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mountaintop bonsai labyrinth, cool still air, and fluorescent lamp are vividly realized and filtered through Elian’s sensibility as a collector of temporal “textures.” Setting consistently supports the meditative, meticulous tone and the time-refracting conceit, and the lamp in particular functions as a concrete micro-setting tool. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain his choices, but it deeply charges the atmosphere and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    The port, tides, and container labyrinth are vivid and consistently filtered through his perception, with the containers doubling effectively as a metaphor for his blocked mind. Sensory detail (metallic canyons, slime-covered pilings, groaning containers) supports the mood without feeling like a catalog. The environment gently pressures the story via its maze-like quality and the tides marking time, but it rarely constrains specific choices. The poison label as a small, recurring object nicely charges the atmosphere without fully governing tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    The abandoned cliff-top observatory, howling wind, shattered glass, and salt decay are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s end-of-journey perspective. Recurring objects (seashell, compass, half-finished cello, broken telescope) function as micro-settings that charge and focus key moments, especially in the final image where they remain as witnesses. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain concrete choice, but it convincingly isolates and cradles her “dying dreams,” supporting the quiet, terminal mood. Overall, atmosphere is rich, purposeful, and well-integrated with the inner arc.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    The raft city and perpetual carnival are vivid and sensorial—fried dough, salt air, sea spray, lights against twilight—anchoring both place and mood. Setting is filtered through Elara’s priorities (walls as canvases, ships as looming threat) rather than reading like a tourist catalogue. The foundation stone chip nicely functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. The environment supports but only lightly constrains her choices, which keeps this just short of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lunar summit, low gravity, creeping terminator, and “dawning hush” are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with tone and action. Environmental details—cold, silence, shadows, the terminator line—shape what she can do and when, especially the timing of the photograph. The recurring objects (hourglass grain, vials, camera) function as micro-setting pieces that meaningfully charge the final image. A slightly broader sensory range beyond visual and abstracted “hush” (e.g., more tactile/somatic specificity under stress) could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.3)
    The mist-coated rail depot and the oily, metallic shop are vividly evoked, and the sensory palette is nicely skewed toward touch, smell, and sound in line with Elara’s blindness. Environmental details—mist, dripping water, light through the bowl—support the contemplative tone and her unique diagnostic method. The geography (rail depot yet proximity to a departing ship) is slightly hand-wavy but not disorienting. Setting rarely constrains choice beyond providing the water and lamp, so it enriches mood more than it pressures action.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rusted outpost and frozen lake are vividly rendered and tonally aligned with the theme of buried origins and stalled revelation. Environmental details like the condensation map, fissure in the ice, and steaming bedrock are integrated into action, not just backdrop, and the cold meaningfully shapes his trek and discovery. The outpost’s decay and the entombed spring mirror the story’s preoccupation with time and lost vibrancy without feeling over-explained. Setting could push higher if it imposed stronger constraints on his choices rather than mainly providing clues and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and consistent: dust devils, cobblestones, the ancient archway, and the humming fork all build a strong, haunted atmosphere. Environmental details are tightly linked to action—he reads the town through vibrations, and the world responds physically (gleaming stones, pulsing archway). The archway and tuning fork recur to charge the final images with a sense of threshold and ongoing song. Sensory range leans heavily on sight and sound, but the selectivity suits the tonal focus.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underwater temple is vividly evoked (fractured light, phosphorescent stone, domed heart of hush) and tightly tied to tone and stakes. Environmental constraints—water pressure, temple age, inner sanctum mechanism—shape tactics, while the vial as recurring object charges the final image. A bit more sensory variety beyond the visual and abstract “hush” could deepen immersion, but as-is the setting strongly undergirds both atmosphere and action.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse prison on a jagged reef is vivid and omnipresent, with details like the copperlight staircase, scuffed narrow door, and spectral wardens woven through action rather than bolted on. The environment constrains choices: the labyrinthine interior, the hidden shaft, and the beacon’s story-fueled power all shape his route and options. World rules around “sustained impossibilities” stay consistent and pay off at the end when the attribute wanes. The final image—standing on the reef with a purified beam and hush over the water—recharges the setting in a thematically loaded way.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.5)
    The alchemical greenhouse, endless night, and winter-cracked fields are vividly rendered and recur in ways that matter: the orchard reacts to the bead, and the softened fields and eased hush at the end charge the final image. Details like luminescent fruits and glass panes under an eternal night create a distinct, atmospheric micro-world that mirrors the emotional state. The environment does lightly constrain options (her haunting is bounded to the greenhouse, his life to tending it) and participates in closure. A bit more tactile, character-filtered use of the space under stress could push this toward the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.5)
    The red canyon labyrinth, tide pools, and post-tidal light create a strong, coherent atmosphere that suits the mythic tone. Setting details (red walls glowing, damp hollows, central chamber rubble) are vivid and integrated with action, especially the stone floor she sews into. The environment participates in the ending—the labyrinth “stirs” and the canyon walls “breathe”—so the place meaningfully charges the final image. Some sensory range beyond visual/abstract (sound, texture, smell) could deepen immediacy further.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid, specific, and tonally cohesive, with roots snaking between bones and the sundial physically anchored in that environment. Setting is not just backdrop: the orchard and its geometry (the sundial’s alignment, the particular tree, the vessel hidden in roots embracing a skull) actively direct choices and reveal crucial information. The final images—tree roots as “living tapestry,” sundial as guardian—recharge earlier details and carry thematic weight. A slight lack of sensory variety beyond the visual/atmospheric keeps this just short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    The golden arcade at dawn is vividly rendered—the brass arches, smooth tiles, and nostalgia-soaked atmosphere recur and are clearly filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The contrast between ephemeral chalk and permanent golden structures does real thematic and atmospheric work. The environment doesn’t significantly constrain her options beyond offering a smooth surface for chalk, so it’s more evocative than tactical. Still, it charges the final image of the silent arcade as a “testament to the enduring power of human connection,” giving the ending some spatial weight.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Cobalt Observatory, autumn courtyard, and Eternal Candle are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s perceptions, creating a strong, unified atmosphere. The “echoed silence” and the candle’s flame both function as environmental tools that shape her method (listening, focusing) and constrain her final action. The recurring candle specifically charges the last image when she extinguishes it, reweighting the space from sanctuary to active danger. A touch more non-visual sensory texture during the climax could push this even higher, but what’s here is already strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mangrove labyrinth, aerial roots, and singing spirits are richly rendered and tightly tied to Elara’s journey: the songs guide/mislead, roots form the final chamber, and the labyrinth physically opens when her decision is made. The moonlight and water interact with the shard in a concrete, rule-like way that shapes timing and possibility. Details like condensation messages on leaf-“windows” are specific, sensory, and filtered through her mediumship. The setting not only adorns but actively channels and mirrors the inner conflict, especially in the final path-opening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    The mist-clad atrium, twilight light, and humid foliage create a vivid, tonally apt liminal space that mirrors Elara’s anesthetized consciousness. The brain coral functions as a recurring object that charges the final image, especially when it “felt lighter in her hand.” Setting details are selectively chosen and filtered through her state rather than reading like a catalog. The environment doesn’t significantly constrain action, which keeps this just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ruined orchard district and centuries-thick fog are vividly rendered and threaded throughout, from “skeletal apple tree” and “bleached bones” to the holographic orchard reoccupying the space. Details feel lived-in and purposeful, not touristic, and they clearly mirror the internal arc (fog as prison → fog as canvas). The environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactical options, but it does charge the final image conceptually. Sensory specificity (damp walls, porous fragment, luminescent algae) strongly supports atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.0)
    The Sound Wave Garden, sonic flora, central crystal, and mural of “sonic history” are vivid and consistently used as more than backdrop. Environmental elements directly inform action—the reflected sound, crystal resonance, and mural responses shape what Elara can do and perceive. World rules (sound becoming visible, the mural as living chronicle) are taught through her experiments rather than exposition. The final image of the garden self-painting through sound waves strongly recharges the setting at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    The entomologist’s greenhouse is vividly realized—humidity, insects, vines and warping space—and the environment participates in the conflict (distorting plant patterns, offering foliage for concealment, shaping escape routes). Setting details are generally purposeful rather than touristic, with the warped flora directly threatening the coded messages. The insect life and breathing walls help sustain an atmosphere of unstable, living danger. The piece could go further in making specific physical constraints (layout, doors, glass, benches) tactically decisive, but what’s here is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    The gargantuan shell is vividly and consistently realized, with tactile and acoustic properties (“echoes pooled like liquid silence,” wind through fissures) that matter to how the poems travel. The setting mirrors and amplifies interior states—sanctuary, isolation, “reef-shadow joy”—without feeling like generic symbolism. The galaxy postcard, as a recurring object, also charges the atmosphere and final image. While the shell does not force hard tactical choices, it meaningfully conditions the story’s emotional and thematic field.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    The opal library above the clouds, glass orchids, and museum of extinct feelings are richly imagined and sensorially specific, creating a distinctive atmosphere. Setting is integrated into function: the chime literally stabilizes the structure, the opal tablets store feelings, and the echoing walls conduct the healing song. The environment mirrors the emotional register (elevated, rarefied, fragile) without becoming mere ornament. It stops just short of 9+ because the physical constraints of the setting rarely force tactical trade-offs beyond mood and premise.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    The extinct language archive and the glass ink well are vivid, well-integrated anchors that feel specific to this story’s world. Environmental details (towering shelves, crumbling scroll, humming air, glowing glyphs) are filtered through Elara’s linguistic obsession, which is apt. The ink well in particular functions as a micro-setting tool that constrains action and charges the final image. The atmosphere is consistently arcane and hushed, supporting the emotional stakes without becoming a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dormant volcano amphitheater is vividly evoked—the “breathing” architecture, black ash, basalt blocks, and thermal vents are specific and atmospheric. Setting meaningfully constrains action: modern devices fail in the volatile atmosphere, the breathing cycles shape her work, and the final image of rhythmic breaths charges the theme of harmony. The surveyor’s chain as a tool-object further grounds the environment and returns in the closing image. This is one of the story’s standout strengths.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.5)
    The vintage bookshop attic, with its dust, skylight, and paper-scent, is vivid and thematically apt, echoing memory, decay, and preservation. The skylight and dust motes recur meaningfully, charging the final image where mapping dust becomes celebration instead of escape. The meteorite, pigeons, and paper trails all feel anchored in this micro-world rather than generic props. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it consistently reflects and amplifies the emotional and thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    The drifting prism terrace and the oak bench are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s mind as tools for decoding “necessary distances.” The setting’s crystalline, fractured quality supports the post-butterfly-effect reality and thematically echoes thresholds and refraction. The bench grain and prismatic light return in charged ways around the threshold crossing and final stabilization. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain her choices, it is deeply entwined with how she thinks and what she discovers.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.0)
    The underwater research facility and drowned city are vividly and consistently evoked—the hum of generators, creaking metal, black water, and bioluminescent organisms all build a convincing atmosphere. The environment reflects her inner state (isolation, then gradual illumination) and the burnt feather is nicely bound to the facility’s history. However, the setting rarely constrains options or forces specific tactics; it mostly serves as a beautiful, moody backdrop. The final image of star charts imprinted on the ocean floor is strong and thematically apt.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.2)
    The iridescent cave inside a giant crystal geode is vivid, sensorial, and integrated: crystals store echoes, the seeds plug into the walls, and the whole environment participates in memory retrieval. The “cheerful gloom” tone is anchored by setting details rather than merely told, and the cave’s glow and hum charge the final image. The world rules (memories in crystal, sea-foam recollection) are consistent within the piece’s logic. It stops just short of 9-band because the environment enhances rather than decisively constrains any concrete choice.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tidal arcade, salt wind, lighthouse beam, and starlit sky are vividly rendered and integrated into Elara’s perception and art. Environmental features (arches, wind, sea, petals, balloon against Cassiopeia) are used as part of the performance, so the setting is not mere backdrop but a partner in the illusion. However, the environment rarely constrains her choices or imposes real costs; it mostly cooperates with her plans. Still, as atmosphere and tonal anchor, the setting is rich, specific, and consistently leveraged.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    The twilight garden and starfield are vividly rendered and consistently threaded through the piece; the environment clearly frames this as sanctuary against the nostalgia ban. The stars and gaps are not just backdrop but functional tools for her method, and the garden’s hush reinforces the illicit intimacy of the act. Still, the setting doesn’t significantly constrain her options beyond providing privacy, so it enriches mood more than it shapes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: damp planks, mist, harbor sounds, the ghostlike prism atrium, and the dark pond all feel tactile and atmospherically coherent. Environmental elements evolve meaningfully with the story—the fogged glass, still water, and then the sunbeam and rainbows reweight the final image. The sensory filter is shaped by a glazier’s eye, which keeps the detail from becoming generic. The main limit is that the environment colors and mirrors her inner state more than it constrains actual choices.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    The moonlit ridge, dark forest, and star-strewn sky are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a firefighter and survivor. The porcelain box functions as a micro-setting object, repeatedly handled and finally glowing in her palm, charging the last image. Environmental details mirror internal states (ridge as conduit between soul and cosmos) effectively, even if sometimes a bit on-the-nose. The setting does more atmospheric than constraining work, but it’s specific and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tide-polished grotto, sea-smoothed stones, luminous kelp, and the humming walls create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that supports the “serene upheaval” theme. Setting details are purposeful: the grotto as laboratory, the tide’s slow certainty, and the stilling sea at the end all mirror the methodical, gentle transformation she enacts. Objects-as-setting (stones, kelp, pearl, gauge) are woven into both action and closure. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but it does meaningfully charge the final image and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ivy-veiled corridor, damp air, mossed stone, fireplace, and ash are vivid and sensorially grounded, and they’re well-filtered through Elara’s quasi-mystical vocation. The setting feels coherent and lived-in, with the environment echoing themes of reclamation and buried history. While the corridor doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it does charge the key objects (fireplace, diaries, film) and the final image (ivy veil “sighing”). Overall atmosphere is strong and tonally appropriate without becoming a museum tour.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is the standout: “echoing terrace,” “prism parapet,” post-rain moisture, and jasmine scent all feel specific, tactile, and consistently filtered through Lyra’s artistic attention to light and sound. Environmental features—echo, rainwater, mirrors—directly enable her method, not just decorate it. Weather and time of day matter: spring’s softness and the pre-bell hush are integral to the mood and the mechanics of her work. The final image of the dusky terrace holding a lingering promise shows the place has been charged by the events.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ancient terrace, twin moons, fading mosaics, and cracked stone are vivid and thematically aligned, creating an atmosphere of sacred yet “flawed” beauty. The environment matters: the terrace’s ritual history and the celestial convergence at midsummer are necessary conditions for the ceremony. Details are well-filtered through Elara’s ritual focus (runes, light patterns) rather than reading like a tourist catalog. That said, the setting could constrain action more tightly—beyond being the appointed place/time, it rarely forces specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    The salt flat, riverbed cracks, and approaching storm are vivid and purposeful, not wallpaper. Environment and object-as-setting (egg, salt, fissures) clearly constrain action: the drought-created landscape is literally the ritual’s method and stage. Weather and terrain evolve with the scene, from still, charged lull to rain that “washes the salt from his hands,” effectively charging the final image. The specificity and integration are strong enough that the story would lose much of its force if transplanted elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    The silver courtyard under snow, with starlight and shadows as “spectral threads,” is vivid, consistent, and tonally aligned with the piece’s alarming serenity. Setting details are well filtered through her purpose—she’s literally feeling along the frozen ground for “invisible seams,” and the environment responds as the starlight intensifies. The courtyard doesn’t strongly constrain her choices (no real physical obstacles or social pressures in space), but it does charge the final image: leaving the altered courtyard makes the transformation feel anchored. Occasionally the imagery verges on ornamental, but overall atmosphere and place are tightly fused with the story’s concept.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.5)
    The decommissioned radar dome and “meteor hush” create a distinctive, atmospheric setting with consistent sensory cues (curved structure, metallic skin, stars through cracks). The environment is filtered through her sensibility as an artist, with scrolls, puppet stages, and acoustic oddities anchoring mood. While the dome functions more as contemplative container than active constraint on choice, it does charge the final image as a “crucible” left behind. The bar setting remains more generic and summarized by comparison.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    The grotto above the clouds, with moss, mist, and diffused light, is vivid and tonally coherent, providing a strong atmospheric frame. Details like the “misty breath” and “soft glow” are well integrated into action rather than staged as static backdrop. The environment matters conceptually—chosen for isolation and vantage—and charges the final image of him descending, but it doesn’t meaningfully constrain tactical choices beyond that. Still, the setting’s specificity and recurrence do substantial work in anchoring mood and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    The icebound sanctum, aurora, and ceremonial rope are vividly rendered and unified in tone; the aurora’s pulsing and the ice dripping actively respond to the ritual, charging the final image. Details feel specific—“alpine hemp and silver thread,” the dome of ice, the prismatic sparks—without straying into incoherence. The environment isn’t just backdrop; it participates in the transformation from “prison of cold” to “sanctuary of sonorous light.” The only shortfall is that the cold and remoteness rarely constrain concrete tactics; they color the ritual more than they shape hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    The vine-draped bunker, rewilded forest, concrete dust, wet earth, and ozone give a vivid, textured sense of place, and the oncoming storm effectively charges the atmosphere. The storm and bunker both matter to the plot (the seal cracks with the storm; the bunker wall becomes the gateway), so setting is not merely ornamental. At times the description leans into lush repetition rather than evolving the environment’s tactical role, and the forest’s “ancient and knowing” gaze edges toward generic mysticism. Overall, the specificity and integration are strong but just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    The reimagined Babylonian palace is vivid and specific—lavender sky, celestial mosaics, hanging gardens, round observatory—and those details are meaningfully functional. The environment is not just backdrop; its corridors map planetary paths, its floor mosaic accepts the magic square, and the palace itself is the encoded blueprint that must be deciphered. Setting and tone reinforce each other in the “dusky harmony” of twilight and transition. While the palace does not physically constrain his options, it structurally defines the entire method and closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    The “soundless sanctuary” and shifting reality are evocative and conceptually coherent, giving the piece a distinct atmosphere. Still, the environment remains mostly conceptual—“non-light,” “shimmered,” “void”—with limited tactile or sensory specificity to ground the reader. The sanctuary and cylinder do charge the final image somewhat, but they rarely constrain action in concrete ways. The setting feels like a designed stage for a thesis rather than a lived-in, pressuring space.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ruined orchard, fog, frost, and glass mountains are vividly drawn and tonally cohesive, giving the piece a strong, eerie lyric atmosphere. Details like “gnarled skeletons of apple trees” and “twilight frost” integrate well with the dreamlike magic. However, the environment mostly decorates rather than constrains their tactics; the fog and orchard don’t actually force different choices or interference. The recurring mirror and sextant act as quasi-micro-settings, but again more as stage dressing than hard constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cathedral-orchard hybrid is vivid and memorable, with strong sensory cues (“scent of blooming apples and decaying stone”) and a consistent mirroring of ruin/growth across the piece. The environment is woven through action (orchard in rafters, mossy altar, dew at reconciliation) and thematically echoes the deciduous-vows motif. It rarely constrains concrete choices beyond providing sanctuary and an altar, so the setting feels more atmospheric than tactical, but its presence clearly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    The astral orchard, lonely asteroid, crystalline bathroom, and luminous fruits are vividly and economically rendered, with sensory detail (“scent of ozone and blooming possibility”) and integrated world-building. The setting is strongly tied to theme—the orchard as a “library of living light” and the roots drinking “veins of silent history”—and the cameo’s placement among the roots at the end charges the final image. However, the environment rarely constrains concrete choices beyond providing a mystical interface; it’s more symbolic than tactical. A bit more lived-in interaction with the constraints of the asteroid/orchard could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Glimmering Stack as a mountain-spanning, mist-veiled bookstore is vivid and distinctive, and the floating-book chamber extends that atmosphere effectively. Setting is generally integrated into action—using shelves, wings, and catalog gaps—rather than functioning as a static backdrop. However, the environment rarely constrains choice in a tactile, moment-by-moment way; the labyrinthine aspect is mostly asserted rather than dramatized through navigation difficulty or danger. The final image leans more on conceptual resolution than on a charged environmental object or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.0)
    The derelict carnival ship in a foggy bay is vivid and specific, with concrete anchors like the weathered carousel horse and creaking rides that feel like “skeletons of joy.” Setting is consistently filtered through Elara’s emotional state, reinforcing the themes of trapped freedom and faded memory. The environment meaningfully shapes her path—she moves along the deck to the bow, toward the brightest fog where the garden appears. While the ship and bay are more atmospheric than physically constraining, they clearly charge the final image and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    The clock tower mechanism room is vividly rendered—brass, iron, gears, weights, dust motes in pulsing light—and feels lived-in through Elara’s familiarity. Setting elements participate in the action: the ceremonial rope is plausibly stored there, the pendulum and gears echo and “groan in sympathy,” and the space visually frames the magic as part of a time-keeping apparatus. The integration is strong, though sensory range leans heavily visual and the environment constrains choice only lightly rather than forcefully shaping tactics. Still, this feels like a specific place rather than a generic fantasy chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    The harmonic caves, crack-veined ice, and vibrating energy beings create a vivid, coherent environment that is inseparable from the story’s logic—the soundstorm actively threatens Elara’s senses and the caves’ stability. Setting details are not postcard-like; they’re functional, as the ice maps guide tactics and the echo stone’s glow and resonance signal progress and outcome. The final image of the caves in “hammered repose,” with glowing ice cracks and the stone left as guardian, effectively charges the environment with thematic weight. A touch of descriptive repetition keeps this shy of the very top tier, but the world-building is a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glass humming pavilion, the fused silica ribs, the colossal lens and prism, and the star paths create a vivid, distinctive environment that feels inseparable from the story’s mood. Setting details are filtered through Elara’s sensibility (the pavilion “sang a low, constant note,” the night sky as a working surface), avoiding tourist catalog description. The environment meaningfully charges the final image: the pavilion’s hum harmonizing with the rekindled light makes the place feel like an instrument she’s playing, not just a backdrop. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain options tactically, its integration with tone and closure is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid, original, and tightly meshed with theme: the stormlit observatory, sea of clouds, solid fog, and the crystal forecourt whose wet panels whisper memory all feel both striking and functional. Environmental details aren’t just decorative; the crystals’ behavior under rain and the monuments’ shadows are the actual instruments of inquiry. The final image (“forever part of the whispering forecourt” with the observatory above the clouds) is charged by this world-building. Slight overabundance of atmospheric descriptors at times edges toward luxuriant, but not enough to harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.0)
    The blooming fortress is vividly rendered—jasmine, night-blooming cereus, mosaics, courtyards, and the starless sky form a tactile, atmospheric stage. Setting details are strongly filtered through Elian’s artistic-professional gaze (e.g., the phoenix mosaic, the sky as “canvas”), which deepens both world and character. Environment and objects meaningfully charge the final image: the fortress as “cradle of radiance,” the glowing mosaic note, the lingering hum of light in the night. The setting rarely constrains tactical choices, but it profoundly shapes tone and thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto and tidal pools are vivid and sensorially grounded, with details like the hermit crab’s shell-change and the star canopy mirroring the theme of transition. Setting is consistently filtered through Elara’s attentional bias as a “tidal-pool chronicler,” so environmental specifics feel character-driven rather than touristic. The jade cicada functions as a recurring, object-as-setting anchor that charges the final beats. However, the environment primarily operates as reflective mirror rather than as a constraining force on choices, which keeps it below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    The settings—the oppressive bunker, the inverted sky, and especially the xenial trellis—are concrete, imaginative, and tightly filtered through Elara’s perceptions. Environmental constraints (underground pressure, gravity inversion, the need for anchoring/tether) shape what’s possible, not just decorate the premise. The trellis and the vial materially charge the final image, turning “setting” into a live force that alters her relationship to the bunker. A bit more tactile or non-visual sensory detail under peak stress could raise atmosphere further, but what’s here is already well integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    The “drifting prism terrace” and crystalline platforms refracting light into rainbows are vivid and memorable, strongly coloring the atmosphere. Setting details are consistently integrated with mood (“light softened into pastel hues”) and echo the thematic gentling of noise into comfort. However, the environment almost never constrains tactics or creates real problems; it’s an evocative backdrop rather than an active pressure. The storm glass edges toward micro-setting, but again serves monitoring more than choice constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting work is the story’s strongest aspect: the “kaleidoscopic waterfall,” “silver trees bore luminescent fruit,” and the domed ceiling mimicking the night sky all create a vivid hybrid of ruin, magic, and technology. These details are mostly visual but consistently atmospheric and clearly anchored in space. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or creates problems; it tends to decorate the quest rather than shape it. The ruby flake and throne room do help charge the final image, but more as objects than as leveraged setting constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.5)
    The ashen charcoal sanctuary, starlight, and thresholds are vividly and consistently evoked, creating a strong, unified atmosphere. Details like the charcoal dust, the ancient door, and the ring feel cohesive with the story’s liminal, smoky mood. However, the setting mostly operates as metaphorical backdrop rather than a concrete constraint on action or options. It charges the final image nicely but stops short of fundamentally shaping tactics or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    The bioluminescent mushroom grotto and adjoining lab are vividly realized, with light, dampness, and the “humming” fungi integrated into mood and, importantly, the experimental method. The farm’s energy literally powers the experiment and its glow reappears in the closing image, charging the diamond and final tone. Details feel selective and purposeful rather than touristic, and the recurring bolt functions as a micro-setting object that constrains choice and shapes the ending. A slightly stronger sense of physical risk from the environment (e.g., structural strain, physical confinement) could have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.2)
    The sepia reading room, golden shadows, and antique gramophone create a clear, atmospheric space with a consistent visual palette. These details support the meditative tone but don’t significantly constrain options or shape tactics; the environment is more backdrop than active pressure. Specific sensory details beyond the visual are scarce, which limits immersion. Still, the setting is coherent, easy to picture, and tied to the opening and closing images.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly rendered—void overhead, luminescent fruits on silver branches—and its strangeness is tightly tied to the story’s premise of “growing possibilities.” The environment meaningfully participates in the action: the densest part of the orchard becomes the ritual site, the fruits embody “maybes,” and the final stabilization of the greenhouse visually marks closure. Details are mostly visual, but they’re selective and purposeful rather than touristic. A stronger sense of how the setting limits or endangers him physically or socially would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    The foster care file room, with its “palimpsest” dust and towering shelves, is atmospheric and thematically apt, and the recurring button-as-object charges the final image. Setting details are selective and tied to Elara’s occupational gaze, integrating well with her method of reading dust patterns. The environment does not significantly constrain choice or tactics beyond providing access to records, so it supports rather than drives the action. Still, the sense of place is concrete and tonally aligned with the story’s concerns.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.5)
    Images like rain on cobblestones, the auric lagoon under starlight, and the rusted phone booth among weeping willows give a clear, mildly evocative sense of place. The lagoon and booth function partly as object-as-setting, framing the supernatural access to histories and later as a sanctuary. Still, the environment rarely constrains choice or tactics; weather, city geography, and the lagoon’s properties do not significantly alter what Kael can or cannot do. The atmosphere supports the theme but remains more symbolic postcard than fully lived-in world.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    The radiant grotto, mist, prism atrium, and dewdrops are sensually vivid and tightly integrated, with the environment literally enabling the prophecy (fog + light) and his counter-technique. Setting is filtered through the ritual—dewdrops on foliage, on the saxophone, on moss—so it feels lived-in and not like a tourist catalog. Environmental shifts (“light dimming and brightening,” mist thinning) mirror the conflict and charge the final image of a dormant atrium. The one limitation is some repetitiveness in atmospheric descriptors (“quietly vivid,” “eerie nostalgia”) rather than new, precise observations as pressure rises.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ashen skyborne arbor is vivid and specific—the fusion of ash-grey sky, moss, leaves inscribed with symbols, and tiny twig-and-pebble monuments creates a memorable, coherent atmosphere. The environment meaningfully participates in the story: the arbor’s branches, falling leaves, and moss respond to her actions, and the hush where past meets prophecy frames the temporal mood. Still, the setting rarely constrains choice; it is a responsive canvas more than a pressure source, with little sense of physical risk, difficulty, or limitation. This keeps the atmosphere strong but short of truly charged worldbuilding.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    The settings—the cluttered workshop, ruined greenhouse, subterranean waterfall, and moss-lit grotto—are vivid and specific, creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. Details like “glass domes shattered and iron框架 twisted by ivy” and glowing moss over carved ships feel tactile and purposeful rather than generic. Environment occasionally shapes action (slick stone by the waterfall, niche behind the falls) but rarely constrains choice in a way that raises stakes. The recurring movement from enclosed, ordered spaces to wild, hidden ones supports the thematic drift from control to uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rain-washed foundry, scrubbed windows, cold forges, and anvils create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that mirrors her emptied, repurposed search. Details are filtered through her alchemist’s priorities (worktable, flame, crucible, powdered gold), which keeps the setting purposeful rather than touristic. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactics beyond providing isolation and light, but it does charge the final quiet with a sense of post-battle aftermath. Overall, the specificity is strong and tonally aligned, if more supportive than determinative.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.8)
    Echo Gorge, the hidden sunrise, and the harp on a rock give a tangible if modestly sketched environment, and the echoing gorge nicely amplifies Lyra’s laughter at the end. However, much description leans on abstractions (“luminous ache,” “pain of unresolved lives”) rather than concrete, sensory detail. The crocodile tooth and gorge charge the atmosphere but don’t significantly constrain choices or tactics. World rules around the spectral realm are consistent enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ultraviolet forest is imagistically strong—glass-barked trees, violet glow, black water—and thematically apt as an externalized penance. Environmental details are filtered through Kaelen’s heightened body-state (light as judgment, soil’s give, snapped twig) in a way that mirrors his trauma. The setting charges the mood and final image but only lightly constrains action; he mostly walks and reflects rather than being forced into specific tactics by the environment. Still, the recurrence of UV light as “accusing glow” effectively supports theme and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.5)
    The alchemist’s market above the rooftops, the rope bridges, and the sensory mix of “ozone and old parchment” provide a vivid, integrated atmosphere. The lighthouse and lens details in the vision are clear and recur meaningfully, particularly in the fragment that warms and then rests heavy in her pocket at the end. The setting is mostly textural rather than constraining—nothing about the market’s physicality forces a different choice—but it does effectively mirror her liminal role. Overall, specificity and tone are strong even if environmental pressure is limited.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly realized—the dust, faded posters, and erratic fluorescent buzz create a strong atmosphere filtered through Leo’s professional eye. Setting details (dust patterns, drop ceiling, rafters) directly enable his discoveries and the plot’s turns. The circus-specific remnants (ledgers, tickets, wronged performers) add texture and thematic resonance around spectacle and exploitation. While very effective, the environment could pressure Leo more actively rather than serving mainly as a readable archive.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “glass orchard library” above a “swirling sea of clouds” is vivid, specific, and threaded throughout, with evolving details (frost patterns, crystalline branches, chimes) that respond to events. Frost functions as a tool and guide, and the library’s physical transformation under pressure charges both the rupture and the final image. World rules—reality negotiable, words imprinting reality—are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition dumps. The only reason this doesn’t edge higher is that the environment, while richly textured, rarely constrains her choices in a way that deepens tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is conceptually rich and distinctive: a baroque asteroid, visible time strands, ion storms, and mirror-covering customs all interlock with the plot. Time threads and the shard are integrated into action (the experiment, the museum display) rather than remaining pure backdrop. Still, the sensory palette leans heavily visual and atmospheric, with limited tactile or bodily grounding in the environment, especially during high-pressure moments. A bit more lived-in interaction with Veridia’s physicality would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    The resonance chamber, music box, and rust-afflicted tools form a distinct, coherent micro-setting that suits the premise and is introduced early. The environment does do some work—sound amplification matters to the ritual, and the rust response to lies concretely affects the scene when the gears begin to wilt near dishonesty. Still, sensory rendering leans heavily on abstracted wonder and light rather than tactile or spatial specificity, keeping the space a bit airless and symbolic. The chamber and box do charge the final image, but they could constrain choices more viscerally to reach a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting work is vivid and purposeful: rain-starved uplands, the factory’s silence, the narrow fissure, and especially the lagoon’s “black and perfectly still” water all create a palpable atmosphere. Environment and objects (the cliffs, tunnel, stalactites, still water, compass) constrain movement and perception, and the lagoon’s stillness explicitly shapes the lost men’s choice and Elara’s temptation. Details feel filtered through her professional and sensory bias (petrichor as presence), not like a neutral tour. The cave’s “resonant hush” and the factory’s absence of noise meaningfully charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    The coastal storm and archway are vividly rendered and not merely decorative: the weather, the crumbling road, and the humming stone all condition Elara’s discovery and mood. The archway functions as an environmental crucible and later as a charged final image (“a sentinel for the next lost traveler”). Details like the “turbine-hum” and “oceanic violence” in the driftwood are filtered through her artistic sensibility, giving the setting a character-specific bias. A slightly tighter integration of physical constraint (e.g., more immediate danger or difficulty moving/working in the storm) could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    The amber pavilion, autumn leaves, and cathedral interior are vividly rendered and carry a consistent mood, with good use of light (amber glow, shifting sun, starlit sky) to echo the theme. Setting is well integrated into action: the pavilion as studio and sanctuary, the cathedral glass as investigative tool, the garden as origin point. That said, environment rarely constrains her options or forces different tactics; it mostly supports atmosphere rather than applying pressure. The final image of the mural in the pavilion and night flowers blooming elsewhere does nicely charge the closing mood.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Both the floating library and the obsidian lagoon are vivid and sensorially specific, with tactile details like sand grains, cool night air, and the black-glass water. The setting is filtered through Elara’s archivist perspective and history-focus in a way that supports tone and theme. The lagoon as clandestine meeting site nicely mirrors the buried truths she uncovers, and the zeppelin’s aerial pass over dunes at the end gives a resonant visual reprise. The environment could, however, constrain her choices more directly rather than mostly serving as atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.0)
    The “paper-lantern cove” and ghost-town imagery are vivid and specific enough to ground the story, and the lanterns later being redesigned to harness solar energy nicely ties setting to theme. Environmental details are selective (tattered lanterns, brittle leaves, weathered bench) and filtered through Elian’s lens. That said, the cove rarely constrains concrete choices; it’s more a thematically apt backdrop than a pressure-bearing environment. The amber bottle as object-setting is stronger than the physical geography in charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard atop the skyscraper, the foghorn, and the wax-cylinder apparatus create a vivid, distinctive atmosphere that feels carefully curated rather than generic. Setting is not mere backdrop: the garden’s “ancient energy” and its literal rootedness in the building echo and help justify the nature-reclaiming-city prophecy. However, the environment rarely constrains options or tactics beyond supplying ambience and thematic charge. Strong specificity and tone, but the setting could further shape action to reach the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    The icebound atrium under starlight is vivid—frosted glass, frozen flora, silver glow—and atmosphere is consistently sustained. Setting details like the glass dome, cold air, and seeds in orbital patterns are thematically apt and integrated into the ritual. Still, the environment rarely constrains options or changes tactics; the same sequence could mostly occur in any mystical chamber with only minor adjustment. The atrium enriches mood and imagery more than it exerts real narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.2)
    The “windblown sanctuary above the clouds” and “solstice hush” give the piece a calm, elevated atmosphere that suits the theme of listening. Specific objects like the bell rope and parapets add some texture, but sensory detail leans heavily on wind and quiet without deepening tactility. The environment rarely constrains tactics beyond making bells and sirens plausible; it functions more as mood-board than active pressure. Still, the final image of the sanctuary as beacon ties setting modestly into closure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.2)
    The Shooting Star Tracking Station and dome are conceptually strong, yet they remain mostly atmospheric rather than tactile—few concrete textures, sounds, or constraints beyond “pristine floors” and humming machinery. The night sky and meteor showers are vivid in idea but often described in generic, lofty terms (“primal elegance,” “canvas of raw beauty”) rather than specific images. The yellow lantern glass partially compensates as a recurring micro-setting object charging the final image. Overall, the environment supports tone and theme but rarely shapes action.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    The beekeeping oasis in a scorched wasteland is vivid and specific, with the honey house, fallen hive frame, and scents of honey and dust creating a strong atmosphere. The stained glass box functions as a charged object tied to place and history, and the return of bees at the end nicely reweights earlier environmental detail. The setting is more backdrop than constraint—nothing in the physical environment forces particular tactics beyond supplying the relic. Still, tone and world rules remain consistent and contribute meaningfully to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.0)
    The emerald silo is vivid and memorable, its “verdant, aged metal” and relic labyrinth shaping the atmosphere and charging the final image of it as a beacon. Setting details (green walls, humming forgotten energy, market) are selective and purposeful, clearly filtered through Elara’s time-obsessed lens. The urn fragment and silo environment recur in the ending as symbols of continuity and growth, effectively charging the closure. Some worldbuilding elements like the Great Shift remain abstract, but they don’t damage spatial or atmospheric clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lagoon after rain, damp sand, mist, and specific objects (kite, feather) create a vivid, coherent micro-world that strongly matches the contemplative tone. Details are well-filtered through the poet’s sensibility rather than feeling like a generic seascape catalogue. The recurring lagoon/feather/kite imagery charges the final pages conceptually, though the environment rarely constrains choice beyond mood. Overall, the setting is a genuine asset, even if it functions more as atmosphere than as a tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    The temple orchard and living stone pillars are vivid, specific, and integrated with action—the humming stone, crystalline veins, and copper-wound oaks are all described through Elara’s work rather than static exposition. The environment meaningfully shapes what she can do (using pillars as conduits, the oak as partner) and charges the final image of intertwined oak and pillar. Sensory detail is primarily visual and conceptual but sufficiently rich to create atmosphere without bogging down. World rules (grown pillars, slow stone motion) feel internally consistent at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.3)
    Setting work is vivid and purposeful: the overgrown sculpture path, rainwashed tower, and “bronze quiet” chamber all reinforce pilgrimage and homing motifs rather than reading like postcards. Details like the salmon, turtle, and birds literalize the homing theme and echo the later molecular projections, integrating world and concept. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, but it does charge the central act of placing the amber and the final image of her returning along the path. Sensory specificity (wet earth, gleaming stones, drifting dust) stays tight and consistent with mood.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the blooming jetty, dead reef, glowing flowers, circling birds, and dark ocean all contribute to a strong, coherent atmosphere. Details are consistently filtered through the coachman’s task and skills (soil, compost, seed powder, reading bird calls), so place and action feel integrated rather than scenic wallpaper. The jetty’s narrowness against an immense sea nicely embodies the “narrow vastness” tone and charges the final image. The only limitation is that the environment rarely constrains his choices in concrete ways; it colors them more than it pressures them.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    The scrapyard settlement and cracked wasteland are evoked with tactile specificity (“ragged tapestry of rust and remembrance,” cabin between “eviscerated train cars”). The leaf and phonograph function as micro-settings that charge the atmosphere and anchor Baron's choices, and the wasteland ahead subtly frames the cost of his journey. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactics yet, it meaningfully shapes tone and the sense of pilgrimage. Overall, the setting feels lived-in and thematically aligned rather than postcard-like.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    The time dilation observation deck, starfield, and “echoed silence” are vividly evoked and threaded throughout, giving the piece a coherent atmosphere. The gilded compass rose as recurrent object and the steady star function as a micro-setting constraint and charge the final image, especially once sensors are aimed at it. Worldbuilding around shutdown and time dilation is light but consistent, though largely decorative rather than deeply tactical. Overall, the environment feels specific and tonally apt, if not fully exploited for concrete obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    The icebound spire, wrong sky, and celestial sundial are vividly rendered and tonally cohesive, producing a strong, icy-cosmic atmosphere. Setting and objects constrain action: Kaelen must climb, the summit platform focuses the ritual, and the sundial pedestal physically determines how the solution unfolds. The world’s rules (Unweaving, captured starlight, chess-piece secrets) feel consistent and are shown through use rather than explained mechanically. The environment meaningfully charges the final image of the repaired sky and humming spire.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.3)
    The whispering gallery, with its uncanny acoustics, is vivid and integral: it enables the walking-words conceit and turns her steps into a literalized echo of memory. The chessboard missing pawns and the nomadic penumbra add layered atmosphere that clearly reflects and refracts her internal state. The final image of the gallery’s “luminous absence” and the now-potential chessboard demonstrates setting charging the closure. Description is rich and purposeful without losing spatial orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.0)
    The mountain-spanning labyrinthine bookstore, mercury-glass, and obsidian language stone create a distinctive, atmospheric setting that feels coherent with the premise. Details like “shelves shifting as if acknowledging her intent” and hidden thunder in the depths let environment mirror and lightly pressure her inner change. The setting also charges the final image: the mountain as sanctuary, not prison, is a concrete reweighting. At times the space is more backdrop than obstacle or resource, so its effect is more thematic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    The time-frozen village, woven hush, hall, tapestry, and storm are vividly and consistently rendered; they all feel of a piece tonally. Setting is filtered through Elian’s priorities (puzzle, game, silence), and the frozen world mirrors his emotional stasis. The village and hush gain thematic weight at the end when the silence shifts from “prison” to “blanket of peace,” recharging prior images. That said, the environment mostly reflects and frames rather than materially constraining his tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    The canyon of endless echoes, towers of bone, and pale spire are vivid and purposeful, not mere backdrop: the echoing environment literally enables “refraction” of truth and shapes Elara’s method. The setting’s rules (sound refracting into new meanings) are consistent and tightly integrated into the ritual’s cosmology. The final image—spire unchanged, air thick with echoes, forged hush—charges the environment with thematic weight. A bit more tactile or bodily engagement with the bone towers could deepen immersion further, but what’s present is already strong and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop on an acid sea, the submerged statue, and the corrosive environment are vivid and specific, with recurring details (acid vapors, waves battering the hull, pockmarked stone) shaping both mood and available actions. The setting does real work: the acid constrains time and movement; the floating workshop frames the risk and the fragile sanctuary for memory. Sensory detail is strong though heavily visual and conceptual—less tactile or auditory variation than the premise could support. Overall, the world feels distinct and integrated, even if the prose occasionally lingers on atmospheric flourish over functional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.0)
    The quay and coastal cave are vividly evoked through specific, sensory detail (“peeling wood and crying gulls,” light through fissures, the cool damp and brine). The environment harmonizes well with the emotional arc, especially the reflective pool mirroring her interior reflection. However, the setting mostly provides atmosphere and symbolic echo rather than constraining choices or tactics; Elara could act almost the same in a differently dressed contemplative space. Beautifully rendered, but not fully weaponized against the character.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt lighthouse, cliff, dawn light, and heat-broken air are vividly rendered and integrated with mood; the blue interior and the rising sun mirror the story’s shift from oppression to hope. The lamp room, circular ledge, open window, and sea create a legible spatial frame for how scent and “vibrations” escape into the world. The night garden and its jasmine-and-soil scent are concrete and recur meaningfully when her brother smells them at sea, charging the final reconnection. Setting rarely constrains tactics in a hard sense, but it consistently shapes tone and the story’s symbolic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.2)
    The starlit signal station, failed hydraulics, great dish, and cold cosmos create a distinct, atmospheric micro-world that feels integral rather than decorative. The censer foot functions as an object-as-setting, physically grounded (cool, patinaed, glowing) and central to the final image, charging the ending. Spatial and temporal anchors (roof, control room floor, moon phase, dawn) are clear and consistent, and the environment plausibly shapes the isolation and inward turn of the story. More tactile, non-visual sensory texture could deepen the immersion, but what’s here is purposeful and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    The hanging orchard, ravine, and storms are vividly rendered and atmospherically rich, giving the piece a memorable physical texture. The environment lightly constrains choice (the risk and availability of lightning, the ravine as refuge) and mirrors theme in its resilience. Still, much of the setting remains scenic rather than actively shaping tactics at key beats; the storm’s danger is asserted more than dramatized in how she operates. Strong and publishable, but not quite at the level where environment decisively charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and tonally aligned: the opal dock, nautical twilight, mist, and lighthouse beam all work together to externalize isolation and liminality. Environmental details recur and evolve—the mist that once imprisons later lifts as he achieves a kind of peace—charging the final image. Sensory specificity is strong (sea vs. alpine contrast, snow crunch, chill winds) and consistently filtered through Elias’s preoccupations. The space doesn’t significantly constrain his choices, though, so its role is more atmospheric than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    The map shop, overgrown fields, creek, and especially the blooming cavern with bioluminescent fungi are vivid and sensorially specific. Setting actively shapes the story: the creek’s rise imposes a time limit and the cavern’s wall and symbols determine what he can do with the chip. Details feel filtered through Elian’s sensibility (maps, typefaces, old tools) rather than generic fantasy décor. A slightly sharper sense of physical jeopardy from the flooding cavern could strengthen the environment’s pressure even more.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting work is vivid and well-integrated: the sea of clouds, cobalt grotto, ember-lit inner chamber, and bleeding starlight create a distinct, atmospheric place. Environmental details track with her journey and mood shifts—the narrowing ridge, thin air, and fireflies all mirror internal states and the piece’s tonal arc. The grotto and its physical properties directly shape the climactic vision and the charged menace that follows her back. There is room for slightly richer tactile or non-visual sensory grounding in the grotto, but what’s here already carries a strong, coherent atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ember nexus, pocket sun, and nautilus shell create a vivid and coherent micro-world, with the environment responding to Elara’s actions in tactile ways (pulses quickening, embers flaring). Details are specific and purposeful rather than touristic; the nexus’s “dying”/“dreaming” ambiguity threads directly into the stakes. The setting meaningfully participates in the climax as it awakens and paints the sky. At times the imagery leans toward decorative lyricism, but it generally remains integrated with action and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cabin, with its silence, maps, and supplies, is efficiently evoked and clearly anchors the present-tense reality against the vastness of the mountains and sky. Environmental images—the peaks as “broken teeth,” the grave in a sun-dappled clearing, the pulsing birch bark—mirror his mental state without feeling overdetermined. The scroll and cabin function as micro-setting constraints, channeling his response into writing rather than flight. Weather and physical details are selective but sufficient to sustain tone and orientation throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.0)
    The fogbound city and water clock repair shop are vividly evoked, with tactile details like condensation, “ticking shadows,” and the drip and flow of time that echo the thematic focus on occlusion and hidden pattern. Setting is well-filtered through Elara’s altered perception (she feels the rhythm but cannot smell), which grounds both mood and her loss. The recurring fog and the rhythm of the water clocks meaningfully charge the final image, even if the environment doesn’t strongly constrain her choices in a practical sense. Overall, atmosphere and specificity are strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    The floating tea ceremony platform above storms is vivid and consistent, with details like the “saturated hush,” pulsing magic, and swaying rock giving a strong sense of place. The setting meaningfully mirrors and lightly pressures the internal arc—the storms as circling predators, the platform’s sway during held breaths, the tea as an offering to the winds. The tools and environment (quill, inkwell, ceramic cup, rock) are well-integrated into action rather than feeling like a backdrop. That said, the storms rarely constrain concrete choices; they’re more symbolic weather than fully active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sheet music archive and orchard are vividly, economically rendered (“paper ghosts of compositions past,” “gnarled apple trees”) and tightly integrated with the haunting’s mechanics. Environmental elements do real work: Alistair is bound to scores, Isabella to the trees, and the final apple blossom on the sonata page charges the closure image. The electromagnetic device and perfume bottle are tactically used rather than merely displayed. A slight limitation is that the archive itself doesn’t significantly constrain options beyond providing a moody container; its atmosphere is rich, but its physicality could shape choice more directly.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.5)
    The “ancient temple library lost in time” and “resounding hush” are strongly evoked, creating a unified atmosphere with a few concrete touches (dust, infinite aisles, mural, pooled light). Yet the description leans heavily on repeated abstract phrases rather than fresh, specific sensory details, and the environment rarely constrains his options or behavior. The setting ultimately charges the final image by fading away, but feels more like a static backdrop than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.0)
    The fjord, granite outcrop, and horizon measurement station are vividly realized and tightly integrated: water-driven timepieces, sun arc tracking, and the still water all echo the story’s obsession with time and measurement. Details like “razor edges of the gear teeth” and the glint inside a clock are filtered through his professional eye, which grounds both atmosphere and theme. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain his choices—he could have the same realization in most quiet, mechanical settings—but it does charge the final image of him standing in the fjord quiet with the clocks still running. This is strong, purposeful atmosphere rather than mere postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm and permeable, glowing barriers are vividly rendered and integrated into Elara’s perceptions and methods (“Pressing the laser pointer button, she projected a thin red beam toward a shimmering, permeable barrier”). The environmental details support tone and theme rather than feeling like a tourist catalog. The setting does shape the narrative conceptually (permeability/letting go) but less so tactically—it rarely constrains physical options in concrete ways. Strong atmosphere and specificity, just shy of the highest band because the environment doesn’t quite force decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is vivid and thematically integrated: the rainwashed library, damp-paper scent, subway cars, and mica-pane lantern all mirror her liminal emotional state. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain options, but it consistently charges images and the final beat (lantern in midsummer twilight) with resonance. Details are selective and not generic; the “rainwashed” library and “midsummer quietude” are doing character work. Overall, atmosphere strongly supports the piece’s mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.5)
    The subterranean tunnel, streetlamp hum, and smudged antique booth are vivid and cohesive, and they recur to charge the final image of Leo alone with the resting disc. The environment meaningfully supports the theme: his isolation below the city literalizes estrangement and creates a liminal, almost sacred workspace. Details like the rumble of trains and the disc’s gleam are selective but evocative, felt through Leo’s peculiar world. The booth and tunnel don’t quite force tactical choices, but they strongly frame and deepen every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    The blooming jetty, night-blooming jasmine, salt air, gravel, and gulls are vividly rendered and recur throughout, giving the piece a strong, cohesive atmosphere. Setting is tightly bound to memory and covenant—the same place as the old photo, the rescue, and the final charged image. While the environment doesn’t materially constrain her choices, it does charge the final image and stakes (this place vs. development/forgetting). The specificity is high and consistently filtered through Elara’s attention.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    The disused ivy-choked station is vivid and omnipresent, from pigeons in rafters to mossy benches, and the environment’s decay/overgrowth nicely mirrors the story’s emotional terrain. The station and its transformation into a “living heart” charge the final image and embody the thematic shift from tomb to community. The moon rock operates as a micro-setting/object that shapes ritualized behavior and anchors the closure. Setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, but it deeply inflects mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ultrasonic forest, tactile navigation, and the ring as a physical tool are all vividly rendered and deeply filtered through Elara’s non-visual perception. The environment is not decorative: the forest’s ultrasonic language and the gully’s stillness directly shape her path and the climax. World rules (absorbing languages via skin, frozen constellations) are consistent and tonally cohesive. A slight expansion of how the wider world relates to this rare cosmic pause could make the setting feel even more consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The gravitational anomaly, warped light, and weightless, directionless environment create a distinct, consistent atmosphere that supports the contemplative tone. The Outpost’s isolation and the anomaly’s behavior matter to the premise and to closure (stabilization from roar to hum), and the dried pen helps function as a micro-setting object at the console. However, the environment rarely constrains choice on a tactical level—her work could almost occur in any remote observatory—so the anomaly is more metaphysical backdrop than active spatial pressure. A bit more concrete interaction with the physical weirdness of the anomaly would raise the setting from evocative to indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    The luminous harbor, moonlight, and water are vividly rendered and recur throughout, with details like waves and breeze explicitly reinterpreted as musical instruments. Setting is not just backdrop: the harbor’s sounds/quiet are the raw material for the “mapped” silence and the closing image of horizon and water charges the final realization. Some imagery trends toward familiar lyric shorthand (“liquid silver,” “radiant embrace”), but overall the environment is integral to mood and theme. The camera functions as a micro-setting tool that shapes perception at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.0)
    The “lost civilization archive” and its dust, cold air, murals, and stone tablets create a credible, moody environment tied to the art-trail device. Setting details are reasonably specific and consistently filtered through his goal of decoding and preserving. However, the environment rarely constrains his choices or tactics; the archive is more atmospheric backdrop than active pressure. The final image with the tapestry in the shaft of light is strong but could be more viscerally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sound wave garden and auric lagoon are vivid, distinctive, and consistently re-invoked; the environment’s responses to her drumming (pulsing light, symphony of plants) charge both the climax and the final image. The setting does some thematic work as sanctuary/prison and as a medium for connection. Still, its rules stay mostly poetic rather than dramatized through constraint—there’s little sense of what can’t happen here or how the space limits her choices beyond mood. The result is lush atmosphere with partial integration into action.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the “towering labyrinth of shipping containers” under an auroral geomagnetic storm—and these environmental pressures materially shape events (digital failure, disorientation, lost workers). Details like the hidden panel between containers and the storm-lit metal walls feel lived-in and purposeful rather than touristic. The port maze and storm conditions directly justify Elara’s role and methods, integrating atmosphere and function. The final image of the storm waning and the map folding down gives the world a subtle temporal and emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cobalt dock, post-storm canal, shutters, and reflections are vividly rendered and tightly integrated into action. Setting is not mere backdrop: the shutters, water surface, and dental mirror are the literal means by which she exerts agency, and the rain-cleared sky charges the final image. Sensory detail stays strongly visual but feels purposefully selective for the reflective, optical premise. The world’s rules are consistent and atmospheric without heavy exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt library, mist, and magnetic grotto are vivid and recurring, giving the piece a strong, coherent atmosphere. The lodestone chess set and windows-as-constellation create memorable images that charge the rebellion’s quiet tone. Setting mostly enriches mood rather than constraining tactics, though the grotto as a “place that amplifies intentions” does lightly shape how the rebellion is conceived. Overall the specificity feels above-average but short of fully integral to choice-making.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    The marine setting is vivid and purposeful: docks, splintered wood, “sublittoral fringe,” and the materializing island all feel textured and atmospheric. The fringe as a liminal zone is not just decorative; it’s explicitly the place where the island appears and where she must cross, so environment and choice intersect. Details are filtered through Elara’s body and work (cargo crates, wet rocks, surf) rather than feeling like a catalogue. The world rule of the Great Pacification is lightly sketched but tonally consistent with the soft, almost numinous atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    The farmhouse and wind turbines create a vivid, oppressive atmosphere; “remade hush” and shadow-bars are concrete and thematically apt. The dried bouquet functions as a micro-setting object, evolving in meaning and anchoring key moments. The environment (Mandate-era countryside industrialized by turbines) consistently mirrors and charges Elara’s internal state. It doesn’t much alter tactical choices, stopping this short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and humming quartz colonnade are vivid, specific, and tonally unified, with strong sensory texture (“deep blue glass,” “liquid cobalt,” “lantern-moth hush”). Setting evolves with events—the walls blur, the ice cracks and thaws, the quartz falls silent—so environment and transformation mirror each other in a satisfying way. Details are filtered lyrically through the poet’s sensibility, avoiding generic fantasy décor. The main limitation is that the environment mostly reflects theme rather than constraining choices, which keeps it just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    The glassblower’s courtyard, with its shimmering glass, plant tapestries, and cracked fountain, is vivid and feels integral to the magic system and emotional stakes. Details like the cracked glass fountain and bonsai roots concretely mirror the “imperfection as beauty” theme without feeling purely symbolic. The setting also shapes action—communication through plants, the presence of a glass reed, and ambient phoenix magic all arise from place. A bit more sensory variety beyond the visual could push atmosphere further, but the specificity is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Laboratory of Lost Sounds is richly and specifically rendered—silvery disks, wire coils, resonance chambers, golden shadows—and always filtered through Elara’s acoustic focus. The miner’s lens and the atrium’s responsive acoustics are not just decorative; they shape tactics and make the final transformation possible. The setting’s mood (warm, humming, shadowed) coheres with the thematic focus on preserved vs. living sound. Environment clearly charges the final image as the lab turns into a “living organ” resonating with the outer grid.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.5)
    The observatory, dome light, dusty sealed room, and “curtains of intention” create a distinct, atmospheric space filtered through Elara’s grief and craft. Setting elements like the telescope and constellation “The Resilient Heart” are thematically charged and participate in the final movement. That said, environment rarely constrains choice or imposes real limitations—it more reflects and echoes interior states than shapes tactics. Strong, coherent mood but shy of fully using setting as active pressure on the story.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.5)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft, onyx-ink cards, and measuring tape are vivid, coherent anchors that create a strong, moody atmosphere and clearly situate us in space. The rain and glass occasionally interact with action—catching light on the tape, casting shifting shadows, modulating from patter to streams to easing—which supports the sense of an environment alive with secrets. However, the setting mostly underscores tone rather than constrains choices or tactics; Elara’s work and stakes would be similar in any quiet room with a table. The final image of light breaking through the clouds does charge the rebirth theme, but still reads more symbolic than situationally necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.5)
    The archive, twilight, and bronze prism pagoda are vividly sketched and tonally coherent, giving a strong sense of place and mood. Details like fractured, colorful beams and the breathing stones nicely mirror the mystical, memory-based work she’s doing. The environment, though, mostly serves as backdrop and ritual apparatus; it doesn’t significantly constrain tactics beyond being the one location with the pagoda. Strong atmosphere and specificity, but the setting could shape choice and danger more directly to reach elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “blooming library suspended above the clouds” and crystalline dream-shelves are vivid, selective, and tightly filtered through Elara’s work. The river stone functions as a micro-setting object that constrains her choice and charges the final image: she uses it as a key to act and then as the weight of regret. World rules around shared dreams and recorded dreamscapes are sketched efficiently through her practice rather than dumped. The atmosphere of high, hushed altitude and luminous technology supports the story’s liminal, twilight tone without feeling like a postcard tour.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mist, stars, and cramped workshop are vividly rendered and recur in ways that mirror her inner state (“cocoon of peace,” “silent, silver shroud”). The chameleon enclosure and tail wound operate as a micro-setting that grounds her actions and the final image. While the environment mostly sets tone rather than hard constraints on choice, the workshop-as-sanctuary frame does meaningfully support the thematic question of whether it remains open. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with a strong visual palette and a few tactile anchors (antiseptic swipe, worn bench).

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tower, dawn chill, ivy, and underground chamber are rendered with strong sensory specificity, and details like “meteor hush” and “wet clay and old stone” create a palpable atmosphere. Setting is tightly filtered through Aris’s altered perception, especially via the plants’ root-thoughts. Environment meaningfully constrains action—he must work through stone and soil via roots, and the secret chamber is architecturally tied to the tower. The frosted hourglass and crystal both function as charged micro-settings/objects that frame the beginning and end without feeling merely decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.5)
    The vintage projection booth and the dust-moted, reliquary atmosphere are vivid and tonally apt, and the transition into the nebulous memory realm feels like a natural extension of that liminal space. Details like “hushed thunder” of old projectors and “echoes of a thousand forgotten audiences” feel lived-in and conceptually aligned with the theme of stored feeling. However, the environment rarely constrains action or forces choices; it mainly functions as mood- and symbol-machine. The booth charges the opening and closing images effectively but could do more tactical work for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    The aurora-lit archway, brass orrery, and unwritten calendar of moons and falling stars create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that strongly supports the lyric mode. Details like the “shimmering green lights” and “delicate wheels” are efficiently chosen and recur to charge the final image of Elara with her instrument under the changing sky. The setting mostly frames and echoes her interior state rather than constraining choices or tactics, so it feels more evocative than structural. Still, the environment’s recurrence and integration with the cosmic/music theme are a notable strength.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting work is vivid and integrated: “the glowing dune in bloom,” “ashen world,” “dead cities,” and “ruins of a library” all feel textured and filtered through Elara’s task. The chess clock and dune both function as micro-settings that charge the final image, with the dune’s light intensifying in tandem with her progress and the clock shifting from prison to promise. World rules around the divergent archive and wave-function travel are consistent enough for this lyrical mode, learned through her practice rather than exposition. The environment doesn’t tightly constrain action, but it continually shapes mood and stakes in a way that feels deliberate and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mechanical rainforest is the standout: brass-plated trees, wire-vines with glowing fruit, mercury waterfall, and the colossal engine are vivid and purposeful rather than decorative. Setting is tightly integrated with action—she navigates by wind through mechanical leaves, the engine is literally the forest’s heart, and the small gear is of a piece with this world. The environment constrains and enables tactics (following harmonics, slotting the gear, the rotating platform as threshold) and charges the final image of her “joining its song.” This is almost publish-ready at top-tier venues on setting alone.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vividly and economically rendered—the misted ridgeway, pines as sentinels, narrow canyon, and eventual shore all contribute to a strong, coherent atmosphere. Sensory details (cool air, damp earth, distant sea) are well-filtered through Elara’s state and support the contemplative tone. The environment lightly pressures choices via the need for guides and indirect routes, and the shoreline visually and thematically charges the final image. It stops just short of having the environment decisively constrain a specific peak choice, which keeps it out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt fortress under snow, the cold halls, the spiral staircase, and the music room are vividly sketched and tonally unified; they clearly shape the mood of entrapment and chilled refuge. The setting does real thematic work—snow, cobalt walls, and “frostbitten hope” recur and charge the final image of internal thaw. While the environment doesn’t constrain specific tactical choices in a thriller sense, it functions as a conceptual pressure cooker: safety as cold enclosure is ever-present and informs his decision to remain. Detail economy is strong, with focused, non-touristic description.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ancient temple library is vividly rendered—dust, dragon-curved shelves, iron-gall scent, constellations—and consistently filtered through Lorian’s purpose, so atmosphere feels organic rather than decorative. The library meaningfully shapes tactics: it provides secrecy, the medium for cryptic messages, and the physical locus of hidden genealogy and the etched rune. World rules (lost in time, Sunken Throne, constellations) are suggestive yet coherent for this length. It stops short of 9+ because the environment rarely constrains moment-to-moment choices under peak pressure; it’s more stage and symbol than a live obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sea level monitoring station, humming equipment, salt air, and mismatched coastlines create a vivid, grounded environment tied to the protagonist’s work and mood. The post–fossil fuel world is sketched economically yet feels specific enough to support the premise. The atlas page and the station’s cyclical data cycles contribute effectively to atmosphere and the final reconfiguration. Setting enriches theme and tone more than it constrains choices, which keeps it just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the decaying gantries, gutted hulls, and the stone circle feel tactile and atmospheric, and details like the cool dusty concrete under her bare feet integrate body and environment. The abandoned spaceport as a tomb-turned-cradle for rebellion is thematically apt, and the hum, light, and twilight margin all support tone without becoming clutter. The environment shapes what can happen (this is a forgotten place where such a relic can exist and draw future rebels), though it rarely constrains her in a concrete tactical way.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.3)
    The volcanic hot springs, steamy caverns, glowing moss, and plant life are vividly rendered and recur at key beats, especially at the unsealing and in the final gathering. Setting is filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with plant whispers and geothermal details aligning with her nature-bound worldview. The environment meaningfully shapes choice—the hidden fissure, the moss-amplified telepathy, and the hot springs as civic meeting ground all matter. This is strong, purposeful atmosphere rather than postcard backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    The arboretum on a seaside cliff, salt-scorched earth, and the automated lighthouse beam create a vivid, coherent environment that mirrors and supports Elara’s interior state. Details like resilient junipers, flowering cherries, and the wind’s brine-and-bloom scent are selective and purposeful rather than touristic. The lighthouse beam’s automation and rhythm charge the ending image as a world that has moved “after” its keepers, paralleling her life after the strike. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, it meaningfully frames and deepens every choice.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse library is vivid and sensorial—dust, salt, groaning shelves, and the “luminescent ache” from above—integrated through Elian’s perception rather than as static backdrop. The setting meaningfully mirrors and pressures the inner conflict: narrowing circular walls and the notion of descending below the tower echo his descent into memory and fear of darkness. The final image of the lighthouse beam guiding not away from but through darkness recharges earlier environmental details with thematic weight. The only minor limit is that the physical descent remains largely conceptual rather than enacted step by step.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the bruised purple post-eclipse sky, wind-carved caves like “frozen waves,” and the lethargic landslide all build a distinct, atmospheric world. Details are well filtered through Kael’s focused, almost ascetic perspective, leaning on visual and textural elements that fit his role as an observer of subtle phenomena. The environment, however, mostly frames mood rather than constraining action; the encampment, valley, and weather do little to shape options or tactics. Even so, the recurring stone, ink, and drone function effectively as a micro-setting that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    The “echoing library under snow” is vividly evoked; cold, stillness, and the dormant systems create a coherent, atmospheric space. Setting details (icy controls, awakening servers, hushed snow) are integrated into action rather than dumped. However, the environment rarely constrains her choices beyond mood—it doesn’t truly limit or enable tactics in a way that alters the plot. The final snowy quiet image nicely charges the ending but stops short of feeling indispensable to the narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    The desert rose farm and glass dome create a clear, coherent spatial and atmospheric frame—sanctuary versus outer chaos—and the recurring image of the sheathed scrap at the roots charges the final tableau. However, sensory detail remains fairly generic and predominantly visual; we rarely feel heat, dryness, scent, or bodily interaction with the environment in concrete ways. The dome’s protection and the desert context conceptually shape the stakes but seldom constrain specific choices or tactics on the page. As a result, the setting works well as premise and symbol but less as lived, textured place.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “sound wave garden” is vivid and functionally integrated: collapsing sonic structures dictate his zigzagging, and audible ripples, patterns, and constellations concretely shape his movement and tactics. World rules are consistent and learned through action, not exposition dumps. The setting’s surreality reinforces theme and tone without losing spatial logic. It stops short of 9+ because environment constraints, while present, don’t impose a sharply felt, specific cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    The observatory above the clouds, the telescope, and the newsprint crypt are vivid, thematically aligned spaces that mirror her obsession with observation and distance. Details like the smell of old paper and the echoing dome feel selective and purposeful, never devolving into a setting catalog. The rosewood nib as a tool-object bridges environment and theme, charging the final image when it is slotted into the modern stylus. The setting doesn’t heavily constrain her options, but it does charge the mood and final choice effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    The “laboratory of lost sounds,” “meteor hush,” and haunted machines create a distinctive, moody atmosphere, and objects like the resonator, amber, and escritoire recur meaningfully. Setting is thematically aligned with memory and guilt, and the lab’s systems give her concrete tools to act with. Yet many details stay abstract and non-tactile, so the environment rarely constrains her options in a specific, physical way. With more lived-in, sensory engagement, this world could feel fully immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Whispering Grotto and lilac mist are vivid, sensory, and consistently threaded through the piece, with acoustics and haze shaping both mood and mechanics (carrying whispers, then absorbing them). The setting meaningfully constrains and enables the story’s central action: the grotto’s echoes make collective anxiety tangible, and its “whispering gallery” properties allow the tile flake and mandala to plausibly reshape the sonic field. Environmental details evolve with the emotional arc (mist thickens with unease, thins with clarity) and charge the final image. A slight reliance on color-adjective repetition is the only minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    The shattered sky, cracked cobblestones, and mosaics are vivid and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, giving the piece a strong, coherent atmosphere. The plaza and its mosaics do more than decorate; they provide the physical locus and tools (tessera, stepping stone) that enable the revelation and renaming, thus charging the final image. Sensory detail skews visual and conceptual, but the “warm coldness” motif integrates temperature into the mood effectively. The setting could constrain choices more directly, yet it already meaningfully shapes the story’s symbolism and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mystic orchard and hedge maze are richly imagined and tightly integrated: trees bend into a proscenium, fruits become footlights, scents cue her memories. Setting is consistently filtered through her theatrical, synesthetic sensibility, so it never feels like postcard description. The garden directly charges the final image as a responsive stage that “sighs in approval,” not a neutral backdrop. Environment doesn’t heavily constrain options, but it does meaningfully shape the entire performance and its emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.5)
    The light painting studio, camera, LED wand, and darkness are specific and tightly tied to the action; the environment plausibly enables his chosen method and the final long-exposure image. The muscovite sliver as a micro-setting object is well integrated, especially when placed on the pedestal to refract light and charge the final image. Sensory detail leans visual, with limited sound, smell, or texture beyond the initial tingling, but what’s there is purposeful. The setting does more than backdrop, though it could press on his options or constraints a bit more to reach the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.5)
    The coastal cave network is vividly evoked—saline drafts, echoing chambers, mineral veins, inner chambers—and the setting actively participates by glowing in sync with the maps and revealing paths. The elm fossil as a recurring object and the cave’s “factually mystical” properties together charge the environment with more than postcard atmosphere. The cave’s layout and responses plausibly guide Kaelen’s movement and discovery, integrating setting with plot. The piece could go further by letting the harshness or constraints of the caves impose tactically meaningful limits, but what’s here is strong and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.0)
    The amber warehouse, towering shelves of time, and drawers of buttons create a vivid, coherent, and atmospheric setting that feels integral to the premise. Objects like the hourglasses, buttons, and canyon echo are not mere backdrop; they shape how she works and charge the final image of the glowing hourglass and breathing warehouse. Sensory detail, especially visual and tactile, is specific and consistently filtered through her role as caretaker of fates. The environment doesn’t sharply constrain choice, but it does heavily inflect tone and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Zephyr Bluff, the mist, “silver hush,” and snow codes create a strong, coherent atmosphere that’s integrated with character perception. The bluff and its weather meaningfully constrain tactics (stealthy descent, rendezvous location, and the high ridge as broadcast point). Recurring environmental details (mist as shield, hush as listening presence) echo the emotional stakes in a mostly effective way. At times the imagery edges toward repetition, but it still feels purposeful rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.0)
    The fog-bound river crossing, mist, muddy bank, and ticking rain gutters are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through the coachman’s perceptions. Setting is not mere backdrop; the fog’s muffling, the river’s flow, and the shack’s gutters all mirror and modulate his introspective state. The gutters in particular act as a temporal and atmospheric device linked directly to closure. While strong, the environment could pressure his choices more concretely (e.g., danger of river, weather constraints) to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and particular: “abandoned beekeeping oasis” with dry channels, crumbling hives, and flattening chimney smoke creates a strong atmospheric frame. Details are filtered through his hand and gaze, with tactile engagement (rough wood, dusty ground) that fits a potter’s perception. The lantern glass and wasteland contrast charge the final image as he carries inner “sun patterns of kindness” back into desolation. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, but it deeply colors mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    The harbor, moonlight, cliffs, and fire escape garden are vividly rendered and recur in ways that echo Elara’s interior state, especially the dark crevices of the cliffs receiving reflected light. The setting is not just postcard scenery; it provides the physical logic for her rowing ritual and the mirror’s use. However, the environment rarely constrains her choices or introduces friction—weather, tides, or urban pressures never alter options. The harbor and rosebush do charge the final images, but mostly at a symbolic level rather than as active constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tidal library above the clouds, the floating books, the obsidian pedestal, and the stone circle create a vivid and distinctive atmosphere that’s maintained throughout. Setting details are not mere backdrop: the library’s tides, the circle’s hum, and the sundial all participate in the climax and final image, charging her new role as guardian. The world’s rules are consistent within a mythic register, and the environment mirrors her internal shift from isolation to integrated stewardship. A touch more sensory variety beyond the visual could deepen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.3)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, mist, and post-storm light are rendered with vivid, sensuous detail that strongly color the mood. Setting is well-filtered through Elara’s perception—the way the lotus petals glisten and the pond “hums” matches her whimsical, searching mind. The twig spiral as recurring object meaningfully charges the final image, though the larger environment mostly supports theme and atmosphere rather than constraining concrete choices. Still, the world feels specific and coherent rather than postcard-generic.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    The university radio station is concretely evoked (humming consoles, waterfall display, outdated transmitter) and feels like a lived-in technical space. Environmental specifics (empty building at night, crowds in the quadrangle, subsonic thrumming “felt more in the bones than heard”) effectively support the ethereal/gritty atmosphere. The setting also constrains choices: Aris must work with obsolete equipment, institutional oversight, and the station’s physical link to the community. While vivid, the description could push further into idiosyncratic, character-filtered detail to be truly standout.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.0)
    The “shadowed nexus,” “spatial mutiny,” and “starlight” node are evocative concepts, and the organ as a physical anchor in the heart of the nexus is a strong atmospheric choice. Yet the environment remains mostly abstract: walls “shift,” floors “curve,” but we rarely see tactile, sensory specifics that would make the place feel lived-in or navigable under pressure. The setting does constrain and define the conflict (unstable geometry tamed by sound) but reads more as idea-space than concrete place. The final starlit, stabilized nexus is a pleasing image, though not deeply textured.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.7)
    The quarry and mist are vividly rendered (“furrowed hush,” “mist clung to the granite walls like a shroud”) and tightly aligned with mood and theme. Details like the jagged quartz and damp air integrate into the investigative logic, not just atmosphere, particularly in the snagged-ribbon inference. The masquerade setting is mostly evoked via implication, but the contrast between party and quarry effectively supports the “unifying opposites” method. Setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices, but it does charge the final conceptual image.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    The experimental weather station and altered sky are concrete and atmospheric, anchoring the story early and echoing thematically in the final storm. The environment meaningfully supplies tools (archives, deep-sea probes) that make Elara’s plan possible, not just a backdrop. Climate change (shifted jet stream, risen seas) is integrated into the logic of the submerged sentencing site. Some sensory texture remains fairly general, but the station and storm do help charge the final image rather than feeling postcard-like.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mountain scenic pullout, the scaffold fence and torn wrap, the shifting shadows, and the pines create a tangible, atmospheric setting that fits the liminal, uncanny mood. Environmental detail does more than decorate: the fluttering fabric actively becomes the “map” of her secret and the site where the glass flake’s image interacts with shadows. The pullout is convincingly a threshold space between worlds and between despair and wonder. The setting could more aggressively constrain or complicate his choices, but it already charges the final image and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    The abandoned circus train is vivid and sensorial—“cars leaning like tired giants,” “dusky harmony,” faint animal smells—anchoring mood and history effectively. Specifics like scratched arrows, stacked stones, and rope knots integrate setting with the territorial language and Leo’s lineage. The environment genuinely shapes the story’s logic (it’s his father’s hideout and now a tomb), and the final image of him leaving the train charges the setting with thematic weight. A slightly deeper use of the circus-specific elements (the lion, performance relics) to constrain choices would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.8)
    The celestial mapping observatory and the lonely peak are vivid enough to orient and establish mood, and the variable star Mira is a concrete, specific anchor. The daylily-pressed telegram functions as a recurring object that gains emotional charge by the end. However, the environment mostly provides atmosphere; it rarely constrains or redirects action beyond being a generic sanctuary. Setting is effective but could be more tactically entangled with her process and choices.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    The environment is vivid and specific—“swirling orchard vortex,” “froth of petals and decay,” flesh-eating seeds underfoot—and consistently filtered through Elara’s wary, task-focused perception. Crucially, setting is not postcard-only: the dormant yet deadly seeds and the vortex’s energy become the exact tools and constraints that shape her tactic for unbending the confession. World rules (cursed lake, lake-heart vortex, awakening seeds) remain internally consistent at this length. The final transformation into a tranquil grove charges the ending image with a clear before/after reconfiguration anchored in place.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cobalt glade is vividly rendered with strong sensory specificity—blue light, wet earth, ozone—and the environment feels integral to Elara’s identity and power. The glade’s pulse, hue shifts, and sighing at the end consistently mirror and shape the emotional arc, and the root-binding literally constrains her until her climactic choice. World rules around the glade and portal are coherent enough for this length, with the covenant as a living wound in the landscape. A slight overreliance on color adjectives and mood terms keeps it just short of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “catacomb orchard” is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through her perspective—roots threading through bones, half-lit corridors, and the oak embracing a skeleton. Setting is not just backdrop: the roots respond to her offering and literally incorporate the card, charging the final image. World rules (life/death interwoven, sacred morbid grove) remain coherent and are conveyed through action instead of exposition. The only ceiling is that environmental constraints don’t meaningfully limit her options beyond ritual aesthetics.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.8)
    The quarry office trailer and the “dusty,” quiet environment establish isolation and post-failure deflation effectively, and the cloth serves as a strong micro-setting/object anchor. However, the quarry itself never meaningfully constrains choices or tactics; it’s more atmospheric than structural. Sensory detail is mostly visual and tonal rather than fully textured, but it remains consistent and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    The magnetic arbor above the clouds is vivid and specific, with metallic vines, levitating stones, and magnetic fields woven into both imagery and action. Setting and concept strongly interlock: magnetism becomes the concrete model for spiritual transition and literally shapes what Elian can do. Environmental details (the lattice, the clouds below, the central stone) charge the final image and make the world feel particular rather than generic. Some sensory breadth beyond visual and conceptual would deepen atmosphere further.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tidal atrium, gears, pools, and pale wintersun are vivid and consistent, with good integration of water, brass, and celestial cycles into the atmosphere. The environment partially constrains what’s possible—the tides recede and return, the moon affects identities—but those constraints rarely force difficult choices. Details feel particular (crystalline vessels floating in tidal pools, colossal brass mechanisms) and are filtered plausibly through the librarian’s task-focused lens. The setting charges the final image of the sleeping atrium and swaying creel, though it stops short of truly altering tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The crystal caves are vividly evoked—the hush, chime of water, living rock, crystals, and stalagmite give a strong sense of place. The environment meaningfully charges the final image: the stalagmite as “throne” and the crystals catching the pearl’s light make the setting integral to the climax. Details are selective rather than cluttered, and the “resonant hush” supports tone. It could go further in constraining choices or affecting tactics, but it does more than postcard work.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    The disused station, ivy, and grimy bathroom give a strong sense of place, and details like “tomb of dusty benches” and shattered windows are vivid and purposeful. Setting consistently mirrors her internal ruin/overgrowth without lapsing into confusion. The environment lightly shapes her tactics (using decay as a “map,” seeking graffiti in the men’s room) but doesn’t significantly constrain her options. Still, the station and its changing light do charge the final image of departure and new beginnings.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mist, glow, and eventual reveal of the library create a strong, if somewhat uniform, visual atmosphere. The environment interacts with the plot through “propagation delays,” which is a smart integration of setting with method. Sensory range is mostly visual and abstracted, with limited tactile or auditory grounding beyond echoes and whispers. The library as final image is evocative, but could do more to feel materially constraining or lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Velvet Observatory, its sound-swallowing fabrics, midsummer heat, and the weeping ice violin create a vivid, sensorially rich environment that feels specific rather than generic. Setting is filtered through Elara’s priorities (plants’ whispers, the oppressive velvet, the contrast between heat and the violin’s cold) and supports mood and theme. The observatory and its objects charge the final image—“a testament to that midsummer night” with coffee stains as a record—though they constrain atmosphere more than concrete tactics. This is high-level work, just shy of the very top band because the environment shapes feeling more than hard options.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.5)
    The skyborne grotto under the aurora is vivid and specific, with details like the obsidian slab, emerald chip, and silk-lined box rooting the lyricism in concrete objects. The aurora’s crackle and shifting lights are integrated into her method of reading patterns and channeling energy, so the setting is not purely decorative. However, the environment doesn’t meaningfully constrain her choices—nothing about the grotto limits or endangers her, it mostly amplifies tone and theme. World rules feel internally consistent, but the setting functions more as a beautiful backdrop than a pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.5)
    The umbral grotto, clouds, trees, and “vineyard hush” are vividly rendered and recur, giving the piece a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting is not just backdrop: elevation and isolation justify her tree-climbing habit and the grotto’s rebirth lore, and the offering stone structures her key ritual action. Details lean a bit toward purple and repetitive, but they’re generally filtered through Elara’s contemplative caretaking perspective. The hairpin and grotto together charge the final image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.0)
    The breezy lighthouse at dawn, wind chimes, grasses, and sea all fuse into a strong, consistent atmosphere that mirrors the thematic concern with flux and uncertainty. Setting details are selective and purposeful—the chimes and wind especially are woven into action rather than dropped in as postcard description. The lighthouse, wind, chimes, mirror, and cloak recur as a coherent symbolic environment charging the final images of Aris leaving and Elara watching the waves. The environment shapes tone more than concrete choices, which keeps it just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and sensorially specific—the floating rock, mist and stone tapestry, magnetic grotto, and “sycamore hush” create a distinct atmosphere that fits the meditative, mystical tone. Environment is not just decorative; the grotto’s pull and the precarious platform above the forest subtly shape the experience of dissolution and return. However, the landscape rarely constrains concrete choices; it primarily mirrors inner states rather than forcing tactics. Still, the recurring grotto/starlight imagery meaningfully charges the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    The canyon of endless echoes, bone towers, dust, and murmurations of birds form a distinctive and coherent environment that’s tightly tied to sound and resonance. Setting is not just backdrop: the bone towers amplify the hum, the canyon’s acoustics make the pulse’s anchoring plausible, and the dust and age reinforce the sense of long waiting. The closing image of dust settling and birds returning nicely reweights earlier details to signal restored balance. Some description trends abstract rather than sensory-tactile, but the world’s rules feel internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    The icebound spire, perpetual dim ice-light, mists, and the frost-kissed garden are vividly evoked and tonally unified, with the flower and keystone functioning as charged objects. The environment does have some functional impact—mist walking, isolation above the automated world, transformation of ice into living vines—but its pressures are more atmospheric than tactical. World rules remain consistent, though the broader “automated” world is gestured to more than grounded. Overall, setting is a clear strength, but it could constrain choices more directly to reach the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting work is evocative and specific: the old pier, gas lamps, sky lanterns, and the air-filled library in the sunken SS Veridian all feel sensorially grounded. The underwater library and glowing tome are particularly vivid, and the lantern reflections as a “luminous pathway” and later as patterns on the library walls create a coherent atmosphere. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics or forces meaningful adaptation—Elias moves through it more as a backdrop to wonder than as a shaping pressure. The result is strong mood and imagery, but not yet environment-as-crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    The “ambered observatory deck” in a contracted universe is vivid and tonally apt, with the amber light, obsidian table, and ancient speakers contributing to atmosphere. The setting is consistently filtered through Elara’s ritual and work, avoiding white-room syndrome. While it shapes mood more than concrete choices, the archives and speakers do provide specific tools that allow her to enact her function. The deck’s final image as a “beacon of hope” neatly charges the environment with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ancient observatory, prisms, dusk sky, and dust motes are vividly rendered and tightly bound to the action: without this environment, the scattered-light method and the permanent crystallized echo on the floor would not land as strongly. Setting details evolve with the ritual, turning from ruin into a kind of shrine, and the atlas and lenses are used, not just described. The final image of the observatory scattering light into the night effectively charges the theme of memory and sacrifice. A slightly stronger sense of physical constraint or risk in the space could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sapphire viaduct, empty river, dawn light, and dripping dew are vivid and consistently woven through action rather than dropped as static description. Crucially, the environment is functional: the sapphire surface and dripping rates form the very method of magic, and the bridge glows and hums during the climax, charging the final image. Sensory detail is primarily visual, with some tactile cues, but feels purposeful and coherent with the tone. While strong, the setting could press more acutely on choice or danger to reach elite-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    The reservoir, exposed lakebed, and Midnight Ridgeway at twilight are specific and imagistic, and the resurfaced town materially shapes available actions and discoveries. Recurrent details like the wind chime, “mirrored hush,” and lakebed photographs help fuse atmosphere with theme. The setting also functions as micro-stage for the communal gathering, charging the final image. Some opportunities remain to deepen non-visual sensory texture and to let the environment constrain choices more overtly.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    The orchard and kaleidoscopic waterfall are vividly rendered through scent, sound, light, and texture, and their recurring details (dew, prismatic colors, ancient trees) strongly mirror the internal arc. The frozen dew crystal and waterfall act as a micro-setting system, charging both the ritual and the final image, though they rarely constrain choice in a concrete way. Still, the environment feels lived-in and personal—her childhood play-place, a sanctuary—which deepens the emotional charge of her realization. The world-building remains focused and coherent, avoiding touristic listing.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    The nocturnal arbor above the clouds, with bioluminescent plants and star-dusted canopy, is vivid and specific without feeling like a catalog. Setting is consistently filtered through Elara’s functional relationship to it—the wind threatening the cables, the console, the arbor as both prison and watchtower. The parachute buckle and the environment both charge the final image and clearly constrain her actions. A slightly broader sensory range (beyond visual and touch) could deepen immersion, but what’s here is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    The floating rock dojo, mist-shrouded valleys, and shimmering, rewriting history are evocative and distinctive, and the Archivists’ grey versus Vitalists’ green helps atmosphere and alignment. The dojo’s heart and converging energy lines make the setting relevant to the climactic ritual, giving a minimal functional role beyond mere backdrop. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or action; characters do not have to solve problems through the peculiarities of this place. The worldbuilding is vivid and coherent, but more textural than tactically necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    The nocturnal brook, storm-cleansed air, and “storm-born silence” are nicely evoked and provide a consistent, moody backdrop. The setting is filtered through Elara’s puzzle-centric sensibility (e.g., the brook’s flow echoing game design), which adds some specificity. However, the environment rarely constrains or enables action; she could make the same decision in a café without much revision. The corpse flower seed functions as a charged object but still more symbol than concrete constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)
    The echo chamber tunnel, hourglass, and leaf blowers are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with sound as the primary atmospheric axis. The tunnel isn’t just a backdrop; it shapes the method and outcome by amplifying sounds, distorting lullabies, and “holding” memory, and it charges the final image as a place where this moment is stored. The pull cord handle functions as a recurring, tactile micro-setting tool, especially when it cools and later waits elsewhere for another grief. A slight drawback is that non-acoustic sensory details (touch beyond the cord, temperature, smell) are relatively underused, keeping the environment strong but not fully immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    The frozen garden, mist, skeletal branches, and “boundaries of light” create a vivid, consistent atmosphere that’s tightly aligned with the story’s liminal concerns. The garden functions as both prison and sanctuary, and its details (ice glyphs, shifting light) feed directly into the guardian’s perceptions and final reconfiguration. The library dimension is sketched economically yet effectively as a counterpoint space. While the setting could constrain physical choices more concretely, it strongly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ember nexus is vivid and specific—the “bowl-shaped depression” of smoldering coals, twilight sky, and altar stone all support a charged, liminal atmosphere. The environment meaningfully participates in the climax as the nexus’s golden light suspends and reforms the fragments. The crozier as recurring object is tightly tied to place and to the final image of him walking away from the glowing embers. A touch more sensory variety beyond sight and heat could heighten immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and particular—the “city of silent antennas” above the gorge and the lunar perigee create a strong atmosphere that matches the story’s concerns. Details like rusted grating, swaying towers, and the gorge-as-cradle image integrate well with Elara’s internal state. The environment, however, rarely constrains her choices beyond mood; she could largely perform the same actions in a less distinctive place. The recurring objects (dish, shard, fragment) do charge the final images, which elevates this above merely decorative worldbuilding.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.5)
    The spectral grotto and cold starlight are vivid and specific, and they meaningfully shape the mechanism of resolution (patterns in the walls and stars, and the hourglass’s refracted light connecting points in the space). The setting functions as more than décor; it is the physical architecture of the multiversal loom. Sensory range leans heavily visual and the atmosphere edges toward generic “cosmic awe” at times, but overall the environment is integrated and purposeful rather than postcard-like.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.0)
    The optical illusion gallery and the loom with light-absorbing tapestries are vivid, and the shifting walls/voids nicely mirror her destabilizing perception. However, the environment mostly reflects mood rather than constraining or enabling specific choices; Elara’s tactics don’t meaningfully change because of the setting. Sensory detail leans heavily visual, with limited tactile or auditory grounding beyond the final “hum” of the thread. The final image of the gallery as a “beautifully chaotic tapestry” does reweight the space conceptually, giving it some closing charge.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    The benthic city and Astral Chamber are vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail—living coral, nano-ceramics, holographic stars—filtered through Elara’s professional eye. Setting and atmosphere support the tone of somber marvel and the thematic tension between abyss and cosmos. The recurring object (chain link) functions as a micro-setting anchor that charges the final image. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices, but it does conceptually shape what’s possible (no real starlight), which is strong for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mist-clad atrium and glass dome are vividly evoked and sustain a consistent, liminal atmosphere that suits the premise. Details like the marble bench and the chill seeping through her clothes help ground the scene sensorially. That said, the setting rarely constrains action or choices; it’s evocative backdrop rather than an active participant in the conflict. The hearing aid and photograph do more work than the atrium itself in charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.2)
    The undersea facility, shifting-phase corridors, and dormant cables are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s perception (“silence so profound it felt like noise,” walls moving from solid to mist). Environmental rules—tides, pressure windows, unstable matter—constrain what is possible and guide her path. The codex and the core chamber are strong object-as-setting anchors that matter to action and ending image. A bit more tactile interaction with water/pressure in the escape could deepen the already-strong sense of place.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    The opal observatory under snow, the ink, and the porcelain shard are vivid, selective details that create a strong, coherent atmosphere of insulated midnight hush. Setting is not mere wallpaper: the isolation and deep quiet plausibly “permit” this reckoning and charge the final redefinition of the observatory as sanctuary. Objects-as-setting work well—the shard and the ink both shape perception and the closing images. While the weather and dome don’t strongly constrain physical choices, they do meaningfully charge tone and the thematic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bone towers, blood-colored sky, and canyon of endless echoes form a striking, memorable environment that is deeply integrated with the premise. Setting actively shapes tactics: the canyon’s echo properties, the narrow strip of sky, and the tunnel’s pressure all constrain what Elara can do and how. The fused-bone pedestal and the sound-eating aura around the diamond charge the central object and the final choice. This world feels coherent and specific rather than decorative, and it meaningfully frames the story’s core action.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    The underground herbal garden with “gravitationally playful” zones is vivid and distinct, and sensory cues (cool air, earth, strange blossoms) ground the scene. The environment meaningfully shapes action—Aris must place the arrowhead at the garden’s “heart” where gravity is most intense, and the shifting fields visually track the transformation. The setting’s evolution (from heavy sorrow to buoyant, joyful physics) mirrors the emotional turn without feeling like flat allegory. A touch more tactile interaction with specific plants and space under pressure could elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sky-bridge, orchard, statues, and control crystal create a distinct, coherent environment with strong imagistic appeal. Details like “fruit with a tarnished wonder” and the crystalline bridge “like frozen music” effectively mirror the thematic tension between mechanism and magic. Setting elements meaningfully shape the action: the policed orchard defines the problem, the central clearing with the Warden focuses the confrontation, and the bridge and locust shell bracket the transformation. More tactile, sensory layering beyond the visual could deepen atmosphere further, but what’s here is effective and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    The cobalt arcade and twilight atmosphere are evocative and consistent, giving the story a distinctive visual and tonal palette (“blue-tinged shadows,” “brittle hush”). The environment, however, mostly serves as mood rather than a functional constraint: aside from providing generic cover in the dark, the arcade’s specific features don’t shape tactics or options. The “thunderstorm in a bottle” is a strong object-image, but its use still leans symbolic more than tactically grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is the story’s great strength: the abandoned circus train, peeling murals, wind bells, mist, and dismantled carousel are vivid, tactile, and consistently filtered through Elias’s craft-focused attention. Environmental details actively charge the final image—the halo fragment, carousel horses, and wind bells all recur and are transformed by the ending. The atmosphere is cohesive and supports the thematic frame of silence as possibility. The setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, but it deeply shapes perception and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “scientific poetry library” is strongly imagined, with stained-glass atoms, humming sonnets, and shelves of astrophysics and epic poetry creating a distinctive, unified atmosphere. Setting is not just backdrop: the library’s structure is explicitly mapped to hyperbolic geometry and becomes the vehicle for accessing the story-realm, and the final image of memories in the “fabric of the library itself” charges the environment. Details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara’s sensibility. A touch more interaction between her tactics and the physical space under pressure could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.9)
    The Whispering Archipelago, moss-covered jetty, and glowing pre-dawn air create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that strongly supports the lyrical mode. Setting elements (whispering islands, the jetty, the sea) echo and intensify Elara’s longing and the mother-loss reveal. However, the environment mostly frames and mirrors emotion rather than constraining her options or forcing specific tactics beyond “by the sea at sunrise.” That keeps the setting from quite reaching the highest tier, though it’s still rich and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.0)
    The “shadowed nexus under starlight” offers a consistent, atmospheric backdrop with some nice touches like the breathing nexus and shifting shadows. Yet the setting stays mostly in the realm of generalized mystic abstractions—very little tactile, sensory specificity or spatial logic that constrains options. The lock of hair and archway are the clearest concrete anchors, but even these are described in broad, symbolic terms. The piece achieves mood but not a fully felt place that shapes action beyond tone.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the sunken orchard greenhouse, fractured glass, algae, and shipwreck hulls are sensorially rich and consistently filtered through Elara’s history with the place. Environment and magic are intertwined—the broken physical landscape mirrors and participates in the “broken constellations,” and the partial recession of water at the end charges the final image. Details are selective rather than touristic, and the recurring greenhouse/shipwreck imagery clearly reweights meaning at closure. The world’s rules around decay and promise could be pushed even harder into constraint, but what’s here strongly supports mood and action.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.0)
    The forgotten library, shard-mirrors, and the distant playground swing create a specific, atmospheric pocket world that feels lived-in. Environmental details (dusty floor, trapped shadows, tea cups) are filtered through the archivist’s working habits and anxieties, not as neutral catalog. The swing’s sound and the shifting light in the shard meaningfully charge the final image. The setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, but it does strongly shape tone and thematic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.5)
    The verdant parapet, waterfall, mist, and orchard are vividly rendered and recurrently used: the mist as bridge between realms, the spray moistening the seed, the roar softening into a whisper. Setting is filtered through Elara’s task and sensibility, creating a coherent, tranquil atmosphere that supports the lyric tone. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain her choices, it does function as a liminal, sanctified workspace in a way that charges the ritual. Overall, the specificity and integration are strong but not yet transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prism sanctuary under starlight, crystalline walls, and multicolored haze create a distinct, lyrical atmosphere that is sustained through the piece. The environment participates in mood—the starlight patterns seem to make the sanctuary “breathe,” and the closing image of stars through the ceiling nicely bookends the opening. However, the setting is more scenic than constraining: the sanctuary and prisms don’t materially shape tactics or choices beyond creating a sacred, liminal tone. Still, the integration of tools and objects (masks, net, needle) with the environment is strong and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    The henge, moss, mist, rain-scoured vault, and frescoes are vividly rendered and repeatedly tied to action (aligning the map tear at the altar, tracing the fissure, entering the chapel). Setting clearly constrains choices—she only finds the chapel because of the physical alignment of stones, shadows, and cracks—and charges the final image of the whole map and renewed vault. Sensory detail is primarily visual and atmospheric but feels purposeful rather than touristic. With slightly more non-visual texture or environmental resistance, this could enter higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    The underwater library is vivid—“shelves stood like skeletons,” books swollen and frozen in mid-float—and the SS Veritas feels like a specific, eerie space rather than a generic wreck. The snow globe as a preserved object in the ruin nicely charges both the middle and ending images. However, the environment rarely constrains Elara’s choices; depth, pressure, and the physical hazards of the wreck stay mostly atmospheric instead of shaping tactics or risk. Strong mood and specificity, but the setting’s power is more aesthetic than operational.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.5)
    The misty courtyard, glass chimes, ancient machinery, and storm are vividly drawn and integrated into action (the electricity activating the graffiti’s glow is especially strong). Sensory detail is plentiful and consistent with the tone, and the environment feels specific rather than generic. That said, beyond the storm energizing the mural, the setting rarely constrains choices or tactics; it’s more a beautiful stage than an active pressure source. With a bit more functional use of space and physics, this could approach elite-level atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    The icebound spire, brass elevator cage, and luminous carved-ice shaft are vividly realized and integrated with the story’s mood and metaphors of ascent and clarity. Light interacting with ice and the goggles to reveal hidden ink is an elegant use of environment and tool. The setting, however, rarely exerts concrete pressure on Elara’s choices; it frames and echoes theme more than it constrains action. Still, the atmosphere is rich and memorable, and the final image of the silent spire above the clouds is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sky gondola, thin air, dusty starlight, and specific cloud forms create a strong, coherent atmosphere that suits the lyric mode. The brass telescope functions as a tactile anchor that recurs and charges the final image. However, the environment mostly frames contemplation rather than constraining options or forcing tactical choices; the broken string is premise, not active pressure. The setting is vivid and tonally apt, but feels like an evocative stage rather than a full participant in the drama.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tree-trunk library is vivid and particular, with carved shelves, lectern, and living wood that all feel inhabited rather than touristic. Environmental features matter: the hidden safe in the lectern, the towering shelves, and the building’s condemned status all shape what Elara can do. Atmosphere (hush, darkness, tactile navigation) is tightly woven into her perception and process. The demolition-constrained space charges the final image of the doomed, sky-lined dome.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.0)
    The antique airship, cloudbanks, brass fittings, and murmuring starlings all create a strong, coherent atmosphere that feels specific and lived-in rather than generic steampunk wallpaper. The stranded luminance and hopscotch board are embedded in the setting and directly enable the discovery, so environment and recurring objects aren’t merely decorative. Weather/sky and ship structure meaningfully frame how the map is perceived (only in the air, amid murmurations, on that worn deck). The final image of the Zephyr entering the hidden current recharges these elements effectively, though not quite with the intensity or constraint needed for top-tier scores.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.9)
    The frozen library above the clouds, glacial-blue shelves, frosted stone, and the mirror hall offer vivid, coherent, and tonally aligned imagery woven into action. Environment occasionally shapes events (ice-encrusted books, hidden corner prophecies, pedestal of ice, vial embedded in a central mirror), not just backdrop. Sensory detail is dominantly visual but specific and character-filtered enough to avoid a “tour guide” feel. The setting enhances atmosphere and theme, though it very rarely constrains tactics or imposes a concrete price.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    The orchard planet, floating arches, luminous fruit, and derelict butterfly garden create a vivid, specific environment that feels integral rather than decorative. Setting directly shapes tactics—the arches conduct the bell’s resonance, the garden houses the key object, and the nebula’s unveiling is the climax. Details generally track through the POV’s priorities (survival, cultivation, navigation) and support the contemplative, slightly mythic tone. A hair more sensory variety under peak pressure (sound, touch, bodily strain) could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lighthouse on the forgotten cliff, dusk deepening into night, and the “pane of hush” create a strong, coherent atmosphere threaded through the piece. Setting is not just decorative: the isolation field, the lantern room, and the beam pulsing with her song charge the final image of the lighthouse fading and the lullaby echoing. Details stay consistently filtered through the premise; there’s no white-room effect. Still, the environment rarely constrains tactics or forces concrete choices, keeping this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cursed orchard, cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, and night frost are vivid and specific, and they actively constrain choices (she must stay on the cliffside, avoid birds, race the frost). Environmental details are filtered through Elara’s purposes—nut, quartz, wire as tools—rather than as a static tour. The final image of frost settling over the labyrinth and orchard while she stands watch is charged and coherent. Sensory range is good, though non-visual senses could be slightly more present under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    The braided ravine, damp soil, wet stone, and foam patterns are vivid and strongly filtered through Aris’s professional and emotional lens, creating a convincing atmosphere. The setting doesn’t just decorate—it supplies the river foam that catalyzes the core insight and is thematically echoed at the end. However, the environment seldom constrains concrete physical choice or tactics; it operates more as a contemplative space than a pressure-bearing landscape. That keeps the setting from quite reaching the very top band for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glass orchard library and swirling cloud-sea are vivid and distinctive, with concrete images like “transparent branches laden with books that shimmered like frozen dew.” The bottled moonlight as a recurring object meaningfully charges both the inciting act (opening the doorway) and the final image (the empty vial catching a stray beam). That said, the environment rarely constrains choice or alters tactics; it’s more lush backdrop than active pressure. Strong atmosphere and specificity are present, but the setting stops just short of becoming an indispensable dramatic engine.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.0)
    The desert fortress after rain, the dunes, puddles, and coral icebound pavilion are vividly realized and filtered through Kaelen’s sensory and professional lens. Setting details (tidal-pool-like puddles, whispering stones, icebound coral) mirror the emotional work, giving physical form to concepts like trapped remorse and impermanence. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical options, but it does meaningfully charge his choices and the final image. World rules feel consistent within this surreal frame.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    The astronomical clock tower and circular, starlit library are vivid and thematically apt, with the clock’s machinery and the brass weight functioning as both physical setting and symbolic apparatus. Details like etched constellations, arched windows, and zodiacal rings are selective and purposeful rather than touristic. The tower’s environment directly shapes the action: the ascent to the chamber, the need to reattach the weight, and the chiming that bridges the valleys. While atmospheric rather than constraining in a tactical sense, the setting is integrated tightly with both plot and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.5)
    The moonlit canyon is vividly evoked—rock formations, deep crevices, lunar glow, and later the spectrum of refracted light painting the walls anchor the lyricism in a concrete place. The setting supports the mood and the process: moonlight is necessary for the mirror’s operation, and the canyon becomes a kind of resonant chamber for collective memory. However, the environment mostly amplifies atmosphere rather than constraining specific choices or tactics beyond needing moonlight and isolation. Still, the recurring images of canyon, rocks, and light charge the final transformation effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    The serpentine grotto, mist, and inverted-gravity landscape are vivid and functionally integrated into action (walking on the ceiling, stalactites as floors, water as “mirrored clouds”). World rules around inversion and threshold effects stay consistent and are learned through her movement rather than exposition dumps. Non-visual senses are less developed, so the atmosphere leans heavily on sight and abstraction, but the environment does constrain and shape her choices. The glowing doodle as an object-in-setting also helps charge the space without feeling ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    The siskin alder grove and the porcelain insulator are vividly rendered and recur as charged objects, with the grove’s stillness and the insulator’s cracks directly shaping the method and the final image. Environmental details (cathedral of stillness, soft grey sky, trembling leaves) strongly support tone and theme without devolving into a tourist catalogue. The insulator-as-bridge is an excellent example of micro-setting functioning as tool and constraint. Setting is a major strength here.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    The magnetic nexus, twilight sky, lodestone altar, and basalt stone create a specific, atmospheric setting that meshes well with the story’s tone. Environmental detail is filtered through Kael’s strategic, reflective mind, making the landscape feel lived-in and thematically charged rather than touristic. The nexus meaningfully constrains choice by being the focal point of covenant energy and the only place the ritual can occur. The lodestone–dent fit in the climax elegantly ties micro-setting to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.5)
    The shadowed workshop, starlight through dusty windows, and external fireworks provide a coherent, gently atmospheric frame, and the contrast between interior quiet and exterior celebration supports the piece’s mood. Details like strange devices and the crystalline tuner contribute texture, but they seldom constrain choices or materially alter tactics. The environment largely remains backdrop rather than an active pressure or resource. Still, it’s specific enough to avoid white-room syndrome and harmonizes with the theme of curated silence.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.0)
    The treetop village of Aethelgard, the swaying bridges, basket-like home, and “endless green sea” are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensory priorities, especially smell. The environment feels lived-in and tonally aligned with the story’s contemplative, mystical mood. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, it meaningfully charges the belief in the corpse flower and the idea of a collective “tide of thought” under the canopy. The recurring objects—the seed, the journal with wrapping-paper interiors—also help anchor the atmosphere and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and consistently woven into action: floating rock arches, bio-luminous trees, and inverted water flows all shape how Kaelen moves and what he notices. World rules (periodic gravity inversion, upward-flowing river, echo cavern) are clear and stay consistent, with the water and arches physically constraining his route. The glowing moss, spiraling pool, and “whirling silence” give the story a memorable, coherent atmosphere. This environment also charges the final image of him returning to the arches with new knowledge, making setting a genuine asset.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    The port city labyrinth, rusted containers, and channeling wind are vividly realized and tightly integrated with both plot and theme. The environment isn’t just backdrop; it actively shapes the aerodynamics of the crash and Elias’s present navigation (“metallic canyon,” “vortices that could destabilize any aircraft”). Weather and space repeatedly constrain movement and perception, especially in the wind shift that forces him to adjust stance. The setting does heavy lifting without feeling like a catalog of details.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ice cavern, refracted light, and aurora are vividly rendered and tightly woven into the premise of prism-songs and visible sound. Setting details like the “natural ice window” and glowing residual colors in the walls play active roles in staging the climax and the final image. The environment supports theme and mood more than it constrains choice, but it is far from postcard description; it feels like a necessary medium for the event. Sensory specificity is strong and consistently filtered through the story’s synesthetic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    The thunder-echo range, canyon hush, and liquid-light realms are vividly sketched and tonally consistent, with good use of recurring elements (thunder, silence, stone, driftwood) to create atmosphere. Setting is clearly anchored and evolves—from oppressive prison to sanctuary—as his internal stance shifts. The environment shapes some tactics (availability of driftwood, the isolated canyon space for ritual) but rarely constrains choices in a way that heightens stakes. Overall it’s strong mood work that could reach higher if the landscape more directly pressured or endangered him.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.0)
    The topaz workshop, open dome, and vanishing stars are vividly rendered and strongly tonal, and the halo’s light physically interacting with the stone adds specificity. The setting functions as a liminal laboratory whose changing light mirrors the progression from turbulence to clarity. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, the etched memory of the stars in the topaz at the end charges the final image. The world’s magical rules feel consistent and are shown through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway is vividly and consistently evoked, with color shifts, cold air, and the “rocky spine” creating a strong atmospheric spine that matches the story’s contemplative mode. The environment and aurora are tied to the pendant’s function, so setting is not purely decorative but lightly integrated into the magic’s logic. However, the ridgeway rarely constrains concrete choices—Kaelen’s tactics or risks don’t materially change because of terrain or weather. The setting enriches mood and theme more than it shapes action, which keeps it short of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    The quartz arbor, mist, frost, and old car create a coherent, tactile atmosphere that suits the introspective, mystical tone. Details like “crystalline structures rose like trees from the mist-shrouded ground” and the frost patterns on the window are specific and visually strong. The environment mostly serves as mood and symbolic echo rather than a strict constraint on action, but the prism, frost, and arbor collectively charge the final sense of absorption and resonance. It’s vivid and purposeful, if not fully integrated as a source of concrete tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    The bamboo forest and forgotten orchard are vividly rendered and tonally aligned with the story’s melancholy, liminal mood. The environment is not mere backdrop: the orchard is the site of Liam’s disappearance and the later bloom, and the bead and loom function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. The “raveling silence” as an environmental force meaningfully shapes options, literally consuming the world’s edges. A touch more tactile interaction with the space (movement through trees, physical obstacles) would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    The orchard planet with floating rock arches and abandoned mine shafts is vivid and memorable, and these details recur (arches humming in sympathy, standing as “eternal witnesses”) to echo the theme of defiance and resilience. The forge, mines, and arches are integrated into the imagery rather than feeling like a generic backdrop. That said, the environment rarely constrains concrete choices; Elian’s tactics would be largely similar in a less distinctive setting. Strong atmospheric work, but not fully leveraged as a driver of action.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    The abandoned spaceport, derelict “starship skeletons,” and humming, residual energy create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that supports the speculative concept. Details feel chosen through Kaelen’s professional eye, which helps with POV-filtered specificity. The setting does participate in the plot—the spaceport’s residual power is used as an anchor for the weaving—but it doesn’t significantly constrain tactics or force hard choices. Overall, it’s strong and immersive but not fully exploited as a pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse, fog, lens, and haunted lantern room are rendered with vivid, selective detail that’s tightly filtered through a seaman’s eye. Environment constrains action (stairs, dock, shore, lamp mechanisms) and the recurring sea glass object charges the final image in a way that feels integral. Atmosphere (“luminescent ache,” “tangible sorrow for the lost light”) deepens theme without slipping into incoherence or static postcard description. Only the relative safety of the physical situation keeps it from reaching the absolute highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.5)
    The Emerald Lighthouse, green stone, star canopy, fog, and sea form a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that’s clearly anchored and sustained. The mechanics of the lantern, prisms, and beam are integrated into action rather than dumped. Environment does influence function (a lighthouse in storm and fog), but it rarely constrains choices beyond providing a stage for the ritual. Strong mood and specificity are achieved, though the setting stops short of exerting hard pressure on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    The floating rock tea house, valley mist, bamboo deck, and carved stone structure are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Kaelen’s sensory and professional bias. Setting is not just decorative: the open sides and sun trails are mechanically necessary for the ritual, and the levitating solitude underwrites the contemplative tone. The blue morpho wing and light patterns function as micro-setting tools that charge the final image when the wing crumbles. This integration of environment, object, and light strongly supports atmosphere and the story’s magical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    The labyrinth, stormlit tower, moonlight, and ancient oaks are vividly and consistently evoked, anchoring both mood and magic. Setting details (moonlight healing, the tower height, the storm, the trees outside) actively participate in the central action and final realization rather than serving as static backdrop. The sextant, tower room, and parchment maps feel like a coherent micro-environment where the ritual unfolds. Some sensory range beyond the visual and a slightly sharper sense of physical constraint could push this closer to elite-level atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse, endless night, and mica window are vividly rendered and tonally cohesive, with strong, specific imagery (phosphorescent plants, transmutative soil). Setting integrates with story via the window as tool and the plants’ response to the renewed dawn, so the environment is more than a backdrop. World rules stay consistent and are communicated economically through action and brief exposition. Still, the space constrains Elara’s choices only lightly; she rarely has to navigate it tactically under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.5)
    The hidden bookstore and Athenaeum of Whispers are evocative, and the “vast chamber filled with ancient tomes” plus the atmosphere of tranquil secrecy suit the story’s mood. Yet the setting leans on generic mystical-library imagery and abstract labels like “enlarged tranquility” rather than concrete, sensory specifics filtered through Elara’s particular gaze. The environment lightly supports theme but rarely constrains choice or alters tactics. It feels functional and pleasant rather than distinctively lived-in or indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    The overgrown palace courtyard and secret tea house are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, with details like mossy stones, ivy curtain, and dormant fountain integrated into her actions. The setting supports tone and theme, and the environment (fountain base, hidden compartment, absent birds) directly seeds the pivotal discovery and charges the final image. Sensory detail is mostly visual but purposeful and never lapses into generic backdrop. It could push higher if the physical constraints of the space more overtly shaped her tactical choices in the closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The frozen library above the clouds, ice-crusted shelves, “quartz hush,” and brass-and-glass apparatus create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s tightly integrated with Elian’s work. Description feels selective and purposeful, usually tied to his professional focus on books, light, and instruments rather than tourist cataloguing. The environment doesn’t materially constrain his choices—nothing in the setting forces a different tactic—so it functions more as charged backdrop than as an active pressure. Nonetheless, it strongly shapes tone and charges the final quiet with specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    The pirate market beneath the rotting pier is vivid and sensorial—salt, decay, dripping water, lantern glow—and the repeated “comforting unease” is earned through those textures. Environment constrains action: shadows and crates provide cover, the truce of hush explains why everything is murmured and covert, and the rising tide/dawn threaten to erase the space. The antique watch fob also functions as a micro-setting object, charged by the end as a vessel for betrayal. A few atmospheric phrases recur (“comforting unease,” hush) instead of evolving, keeping this just shy of top-tier subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and particular—the lavender bluff, aurora as “terrestrially cosmic bridge,” forest elections, and tasteable air all create a strong atmospheric mesh filtered through Elara’s perceptions. Environmental details (ozone tang, metallic bitterness, lavender scent) are sensorially rich and consistently integrated with her method of navigation. The forest elections and aurora flare at the end help charge the final image, though the environment mostly frames and mirrors the internal arc rather than constraining concrete choices. World rules stay internally consistent and feel lived-in despite the brevity.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.5)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vivid and sensorial—glittering walls, prismatic shimmers, cool still air—and its otherworldly calm suits the story’s interior focus. The cave functions as more than a postcard setting: it gives her a secluded canvas (the smooth crystal wall) and frames the rebirth. Still, the environment rarely constrains her choices or behavior beyond providing sanctuary; nothing in the cave pushes back or forces adaptation. The recurring dawn/crystal imagery charges the final image but stops short of fully integrating with tactical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    The greenhouse city under a toxic sky, the glass panels, grow-lights, overgrown vines, and rusted postal dome create a coherent, tactile atmosphere. Setting is filtered through Aria’s vocation and obsession—especially the gilded leaves that react to lies—and these environmental details carry thematic weight rather than reading like a generic dystopia. The leaves function as a micro-setting constraint on behavior and charge the final image when they “glowed with a renewed light.” Some spaces (e.g., “decaying greenhouse corridors”) stay relatively generic where more specific, lived-in detail could heighten distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Whispering Bluff above the clouds, the wind, and the kinetic sculpture with bells and an iceberg fragment create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels specific to this story. Environmental details (wind moving the sculpture, the glistening ice, the cloud line at sunset) are well integrated into action instead of feeling like static backdrop. The bluff and air meaningfully participate in the mechanics of the symphony, though they stop short of constraining a difficult choice. Overall, the setting is memorable and textured, even if it could exert more coercive pressure on decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.0)
    The desert rose farm, glass dome, and later open desert are vivid and specific, with details like the humming warmth and thorny blooms giving a strong sense of place. The dome and its weakest point directly shape tactics for the escape, while the desert and shifting stars charge the final image. The “strangely organic” feel of environment and objects reinforces atmosphere, though it risks tonal redundancy. Overall, setting is well-integrated and supports both plot and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    The “vibrant courtyard at dawn” and “sandstorm calm” atmosphere are clearly evoked, and the mailbox, fountain, and delivery truck give concrete anchors. The environment supports tone more than it constrains choice, though the locked mailbox as a fixed object does function as a micro-setting element charged in the final scene. Sensory detail is selective rather than lush, but generally well integrated (e.g., the glinting locket, scent of lavender). The courtyard’s vibrancy is mostly told rather than dramatized through specific, lived-in behaviors beyond a few residents.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.5)
    The sunken laboratory is vividly evoked—the algae-streaked walls, green light through fractured viewports, and rusted panels create a strong, consistent atmosphere. Details like the hangman’s dice on metal and the stasis chambers integrate setting with action rather than feeling purely decorative. However, the environment rarely constrains options or meaningfully alters tactics beyond mood; the deep ocean’s “crushing weight” is more emblematic than operative. Still, the final image of peace in the oppressive deep is visually and tonally satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting work is vivid and purposeful: the whale on wet sand, the lantern-strung docks, and especially the salt crystal chamber with fluctuating gravity all enhance mood and meaning. Environmental features actively shape action—her need to anchor herself, the difficulty of digging under shifting gravity, the preserving quality of salt for the buried letters. The recurring use of light, salt, and gravity in specific physical terms nicely mirrors the thematic concerns with memory and weight. A slight limitation is that by the ending, the physical environment recedes into a more generalized “silent night,” so the world feels a touch less constraining and specific at the final beat than it could.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.8)
    The nocturnal haven and brook are clearly and consistently evoked, with tone-appropriate language that sustains atmosphere. The brook plays a conceptual role (whispering secrets, carrying the wing, persisting as reminder), and the setting “amplifies” his power, but this is told rather than dramatized through constrained choices. Sensory detail leans heavily on sound and light; more tactile or embodied interaction with the space could deepen specificity. Still, the final image of the brook and hush gives the piece a coherent spatial frame.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rooftop garden, night-blooming jasmine, and meteor shower are sensuously rendered and strongly tied to mood and theme, and the city-as-library metaphor feels organic to the narrator. The ghostly physicality of Finch and tactile presence of the brass seal anchor the supernatural elements in concrete detail. The setting doesn’t much constrain choices or logistics, but it does charge the final image of her alone under a fading meteor shower holding the seal. Overall, the environment is vivid, selective, and consistently filtered through the narrator’s aesthetic and intellectual obsessions.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “velvet garden at twilight,” moss, Circle of Echoes, and humming stones provide a distinct, coherent atmosphere that supports the ritual and mirrors her liminal emotional state. The environment is not mere backdrop: the circle and stones actively conduct the memory-archiving, and the twilight–dawn shift charges the final image. Sensory detail skews visual and conceptual, but the selection is purposeful rather than touristic. The setting could press more concretely on choice (e.g., physical constraints or risks), yet it still meaningfully shapes mood and mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.0)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, stalactites, and “pearl twilight” are vividly rendered and recur throughout, giving the piece a strong, coherent atmosphere. Details like drops from the stalactites and the aurora’s shifting colors are well-integrated with Elara’s reflection, so the setting feels lived-in rather than touristic. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or meaningfully alters tactics—it primarily acts as an evocative backdrop and symbolic mirror. The final image of the thorn merging with the stone does use the setting to charge closure, but more as visual resonance than as a true constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.5)
    The “serpentine nexus under starlight” and the universe’s hum create a consistent, atmospheric setting that matches the story’s lyric ambitions. However, much of the description leans on repeated abstractions (“nexus,” “webs,” “paths”) rather than tactile specificity, so the environment rarely constrains or enables concrete choices. The best integration is the nexus as a corrupted echo-amplifying device and the seashell as a micro-setting object that carries the final silence. The atmosphere is present and coherent but could be sharper and more materially grounded to reach a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.9)
    The glacier shrine, candlelight, and “frozen constellations” create a vivid, specific atmosphere that frames the story and charges the final image of the globe on the ice altar. The wreck of the Iron Tides and the dreams are sketched more sparsely, but the snow globe as a recurring object functions as a micro-setting that meaningfully reconfigures the ending. Environmental details are filtered through the lyrical, contemplative tone and remain consistent. The setting could further constrain choice (e.g., physical limits of ice or sea), but as mood and thematic ground it is strong and economical.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is a major strength: the “whispering parapet,” wet stone, moon paths, and fireflies are vivid and sensorially integrated into Kaelen’s perceptions. The environment meaningfully colors his philosophy (nets, light-lattices, rain, and whispers all echo “hidden patterns”) and the bamboo whisk functions as a micro-setting/tool that charges the final image on the shelf. While the world seldom constrains concrete options, it does consistently shape what he notices and how he thinks. The atmospheric coherence is strong enough for high-band, even without hard physical constraints on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    The wasteland orchard amid radioactive dust is vivid and specific, with strong atmospheric touches like “bruised sky” and the eerie perfection of the fruit. The environment shapes the logic of the story—its paradox drives the investigation, and the orchard is ultimately revealed as the stillpoint itself. Weather and setting affect action and stakes directly when the dust storm stills and then creeps back as the diamond’s power falters. A bit more tactile interaction with the environment under peak stress could elevate it further, but what’s here already meaningfully charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stormlit observatory, cobalt glass portico, and later makeshift cobalt canopy create a strong, cohesive atmospheric through-line that clearly reflects Elara’s inner state and history. Weather and elevation (above the clouds vs. the wet crowds below) meaningfully color her choices and the story’s emotional palette, even if they don’t strictly constrain tactical options. World-political specifics are vague—the “world below” and its factions feel more archetypal than concrete. Still, the final image of the observatory as distant outline and myth-charged symbol effectively reweights earlier setting details.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “feral loft beneath the dunes” is vividly drawn with driftwood, sea grass, salt, decay, and distant blooms, and it coheres tonally with his feral, marginal existence. Setting details (sunlight through dune cracks like “scattered gold,” wind’s “captured sighs”) are poet-filtered and reinforce the themes of preservation and erosion. The loft’s emptiness at the end reweights it into a “library of captured moments,” charging the final image conceptually. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choice, but it does substantial atmospheric and thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    The drift-ice marina, golden sunset, and lighthouse are vividly realized, with strong sensory work in light, temperature, and sound. Setting is not just backdrop: the unstable ice and its vibrations directly create the conflict and shape the solution through sound. Recurring objects—the key, runes, and lighthouse—charge the final image of restored stillness under the stars. At times the descriptive language edges toward decorative excess, but clarity and atmosphere remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly rendered and recur with evolving resonance—especially the lake as a “sheet of captured time” reflecting their new stillness. Setting details are integrated into action (feeling the viaduct’s hum through her boots, droplets amplifying its pull) and strongly support tone. The environment and celestial mechanics also function as a timing constraint for the ritual, not mere backdrop. This is a key strength of the piece, even if the physical setting doesn’t quite force specific tactical trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    The subway maintenance tunnel is vividly evoked through dust, decay, water drips, and neglected infrastructure, and it mirrors the buried systemic rot she’s exposing. The lantern operates as a micro-setting object, shaping atmosphere and deeply charging the final image on her desk. Environmental details (cracked concrete, frayed wires, misplaced safety gear) are specific and relevant to her professional eye. The physical layout is simple but coherent, with no spatial confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    The music box repair shop is vividly rendered through light, dust, wood, and sound, and these details are consistently filtered through the chaplain’s quasi-religious sensibility (“cathedral of forgotten melodies”). The environment and the clockwork tools aren’t mere backdrop; they shape the tactic (delicate repair) and charge the final image of the heart chiming. The recurring play of light, especially “by the way light breaks through storm clouds,” meaningfully reweights hope at the midpoint. Description edges toward lush, but it remains purposeful and integrated into action.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    The acid sea and gears-and-cogs workshop are vivid and specific, with sensory details like hissing corrosion and grinding clicks that color every beat. The environment underscores isolation and decay but mostly as atmosphere rather than as a live constraint on her choices. That said, the floating workshop and hostile sea do charge the bell’s unheardness and the sense of work done “for epochs yet to come.” The recurring objects (arrow tip, kaleidoscope) function as a micro-setting of tools that meaningfully shape action.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    The archive as a “vast, humming” environment and the image of “digital ghosts” create a consistent if somewhat generalized atmosphere, and the patch is a concrete, memorable object. Still, the setting often feels abstract and disembodied; we rarely get tactile or sensory engagement with the room, interfaces, or Elara’s body that would ground the stakes. The world’s rules (backup clusters, scrubbing frequencies) are sketched well enough to be plausible but remain schematic. The environment supports theme more than it constrains choice in specific, scene-bound ways.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.0)
    The settings—lighthouse orchard above groaning ice, Driftwood’s vintage store dense with mirrors, the unnatural mists—are vivid, specific, and integrated into the mood. Environmental details like “silver-barked trees” and “countless mirrors” are filtered through Kaelen’s purpose and clearly situate us in a lived-in fantastical world. The ice and mist shape the stakes and charge the final image but rarely constrain his tactics in concrete ways beyond ambiance. Strong atmosphere and worldbuilding, just shy of using setting as an active obstacle or tool.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    The drift-ice marina is vivid and specific—“jagged landscape of broken docks and floating ice,” “icy slurry,” groaning wood—anchoring place and mood effectively. Environmental details (cold air, wind, ice, ropes, masts) recur and mirror her liminal emotional state between death and renewed life. While the setting influences texture and tone more than it constrains concrete options, the motif of ice and drift does charge the final sense of thresholds and fragile continuity. Overall, atmosphere is strong and integrated, if more symbolic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    The vineyard, amber pavilion, autumn dusk, and wild edge are clearly realized and thematically aligned with cycles of growth and decay. Setting details like the bus station and vines are integrated into his thought process (e.g., weeds as companions rather than enemies), not just decorative. The charred letter as an object-as-setting element nicely charges the final image. That said, the environment rarely constrains choice or alters tactics; it mostly mirrors mood rather than exerting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    The murmuring pavilion, dunes, and kinetic parapet are vividly and consistently evoked, creating a distinctive atmosphere and clear spatial logic. Setting is not just wallpaper: the parapet rising to curve around the pavilion and “enhancing the whisperfield calm” directly shapes the preservation of echoes and the charged final state. The invented terms (“whisperfield calm,” “conjured clearings”) feel coherent within the world’s logic, though they are leaned on repetitively. Overall, the environment is a strong asset, though it could constrain Kael’s choices more sharply to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lavender field and rusted factory ruins are vividly rendered through multiple senses and recur as living elements (scent, bees, vines, crumbling brick). The contrast between lush field and decaying industry effectively mirrors the theme of beauty arising from pain. “As vines climbed…” functions as a temporal and emotional barometer, culminating in the roof-reaching image near the end. The environment strongly charges the mood and thematic frame, though it rarely constrains concrete choices.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    The library at dawn is vividly rendered and sustained, with the chandelier, shelves, dust, and incoming light all working together to create a strong atmosphere. The crystal and the shifting light function almost as micro-setting, charging the final image when rainbows dance and the room brightens. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, but it does meaningfully shape mood and the sense of a tomb-turning-womb. A bit of descriptive redundancy keeps it just below the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    The fog sculpture garden, driftwood, and stacks of unwatched videotapes create a memorably strange, unified environment that mirrors the themes of erosion and forgotten futures. Setting details are purposeful—fog smudging chalk, skeletal driftwood as fragile markers, videotapes as mute reservoirs of memory. The environment gently constrains choices (navigation via driftwood, chalk’s vulnerability) rather than merely decorating the prose. It stops short of absolute top-tier because the physical layout of the garden remains abstract, more metaphorical than spatially lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    The lunar observatory above the clouds is vividly and economically sketched—airlessness, crystalline dome, lunar clouds, tremors—and clearly shapes tactics (needing a recorded leaf sound because no air, instruments threatened by quakes). Tools and objects (astral camera, spinning clock, film, recording device) feel integrated and recur meaningfully. Environmental shifts (quivering foundations that later still) mirror and influence the narrative arc without devolving into touristic description. The one limitation is that sensory range is heavily visual and conceptual, with relatively little tactile or bodily specificity under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Radiant Haven above the clouds, jasmine, fresh rain, and the “pulsing stillness” create a stable, distinctive atmosphere with good sensory layering. The vinyl shard as a recurring object and the hospice setting both support tone and theme, especially in the closing images. Yet the environment rarely constrains choices or alters tactics; it mostly decorates rather than pressures the action. Strong mood work, but the setting could bite more deeply into the characters’ options.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    The nocturnal observatory, floating isle, and cosmic instruments are vividly and economically rendered, and they integrate with action: orrery alignment and the rune mosaic materially matter to the ritual. The “after spoons bent reality” world is strange yet coherent, with specific oddities like shadows vanishing at noon and teapots as temporal rifts. The environment supports the intellectual, arcane tone but doesn’t quite corner Elara into hard physical constraints. Still, the setting feels lived-in and thematically apt rather than postcard-like.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.5)
    The garden and hedge maze are vivid and function as more than backdrop: they provide privacy from the village, signal liminality (“reality felt thin”), and physically host the transformation of tooth to fireflies. Recurring environmental details—the moss-covered stone, silver and blue blooms, shimmering air—mirror Elara’s internal shift from sorrow to possibility. The fae-connected atmosphere is consistent and tonally apt. A bit more tactile interaction or constraint from the maze itself could further deepen how setting shapes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    The serpentine grotto, coastal mist, and moonlit fissure are vividly imagined and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a star watcher seeking refuge. Setting does real work: the enclosed, damp space supports her introspection, while the narrow slit of moonlight is physically necessary for the glass’s projection and thus charges the central image. Environmental evolution—the mist thickening then thinning, the grotto “sighing” at the end—parallels her shift from inwardness to outward-facing intent without feeling like blunt allegory. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that, despite the atmospheric richness, the grotto rarely constrains her options in a way that sharpens conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    The abandoned data center turned moss cathedral is vivid and specific, with details like thawing icicles cutting channels through moss and “skeletal remains of a wired world” doing rich double duty. Setting is strongly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, so the environment consistently mirrors and softens her inner turbulence. The icicle pattern and moss channels recur as a charged image that feeds directly into the “blueprint” for how she and Leo will move forward. While the space does not heavily constrain physical choices, it meaningfully charges the emotional and thematic field of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    The “feral nexus,” mist, and swirling hush are vividly evoked and consistent, giving the piece a strong atmospheric identity. The seashell fragment functions as a micro-setting/object anchor that charges the final image and mediates her actions. Environmental pressure (current trying to erase hopes, thickening mist) is present but fairly soft; it rarely forces specific tactical decisions. Overall, the specificity and integration with tone are strong, though not yet fully exploited for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    The verdant arbor at dawn is vividly realized with “emerald leaves and silver dew,” and the environment evolves credibly from blighted hush to revitalized sanctuary. Setting details are well integrated into action (the dawn light touching the arbor, limp vines stirring, the tendril curling her wrist) and mirror the story’s spiritual renewal. The harvest moon’s presence as essence in the air and the golden glow adds an atmospheric, quasi-cosmic layer. Still, the setting mainly frames and reflects rather than constrains choices, which keeps this just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    The withered orchard in a subarctic crater is vivid, specific, and tonally aligned, with cold, thin air, and dead trees shaping the mood and Elara’s bodily experience. Environmental detail is consistently filtered through her work (flash-paper flare in the dark, breath misting, cold seeping into bones). The final image of the orchard as a site of transformation, holding “memory of light and life,” effectively charges the setting with thematic weight. Still, the environment influences endurance more than it concretely constrains or redirects on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The marble cavern and “wounded season” create a distinct, atmospheric frame that’s tightly linked to sound, light, and echo behavior. Environmental details (marble surfaces, shifting light at dawn/noon/dusk) are not postcard-like; they directly shape his observations and methods. The cavern’s role as “silent guardian” and cellar niche at the end charges the final image with place-specific resonance. A slightly broader sensory range (beyond visual/acoustic) could deepen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.0)
    The bronze grotto, starlight, and kerosene lamp create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels specific to this ritualized work. Details like the “metallic walls reflecting the cosmos” and the “shingled hush” integrate setting with emotional tone rather than sitting as backdrop. The lamp’s dimming and final extinguishing and the shift from snowmelt to spring subtly charge the closure image even if they don’t strongly constrain tactics. World rules for this quasi-mystical space stay consistent and are learned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The loft, the rain-beaded skylight, the ash’s smell, and the rust-hued light are vivid and consistent, giving the piece a strong, tactile atmosphere. The environment is filtered through her sensibility (sanctuary, wet ash, autumnal light) rather than feeling like neutral set dressing. The setting very lightly constrains action—the kettle and secluded loft define the scene’s temporal and emotional container—but mostly serves mood rather than forcing choices. Still, the recurring skylight/rain/light imagery effectively charges the meditative tone and final peace.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lagoon above the clouds, the soft “cloud-like ground,” and the kinetic water create a distinctive, coherent atmosphere that’s tightly braided with theme. Setting details are selective and purposeful—the carousel debris and island space the emotional journey and the final offering. The kinetic lagoon’s behavior (churning, pulsing, whispering stories) meaningfully shapes how Elara moves and what she can discover. The disposable camera wheel as a recurring object is well integrated into the environment and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.0)
    The abandoned spaceport is vivid and specific—“cracked domes,” “dormant escalators,” aqueducts shaped like constellations—and consistently filtered through a technical yet reverent gaze. Setting elements directly tie into action: utility tunnels, conduits, domes, and hydroponic infrastructure all become tools Kaelen exploits. The environment also tonally mirrors the theme of fallen-but-revivable human ambition. It stops just short of the highest band because the spaceport rarely constrains choices with real friction; it enables more than it pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is richly evoked and tightly integrated: the soundless sanctuary, crystal forecourt, misted sunrise, and petrichor all feel lived-in and character-filtered. Environmental elements (wet crystals, silence, light) are not mere backdrop; they actively refract her inner state and help trigger the whispers and reconciliation. The clock, crystals, and sanctuary cohere into a convincing micro-world with consistent rules and tone. At times the descriptive density verges on over-lush, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.9)
    The twilight canal, sleeping barges, and silence of the morning radio create a strong atmospheric frame and anchor place and time effectively. Setting details are filtered through her interior stakes, especially the quiet and stillness that mirror her introspection. The sundial and the crack in the stone function as a micro-setting moment that charges the ending image. That said, the environment rarely constrains her options or actions; it’s evocative backdrop more than a decisive pressure on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dock, fog, snow, rope, and harbor are vividly realized, with a consistent sensory palette that strongly supports the contemplative, mythic tone. Details like the “coarse, old” rope and the “golden dock…under the snow” feel tactile and specific, and the fog’s thickening and retreat track through the scene. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain her choices—she could perform this ritual in many liminal places—but it credibly frames the encounter and charges the final image. The fulgurite and rope function as quasi-micro-settings that are effectively woven into action.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.3)
    The shadowed autumn garden, skeletal trees, harbor, and distant sea are vividly rendered and tonally unified, giving a strong sense of “lonesome splendor.” Setting is consistently filtered through Elara’s grief-focused lens and mirrors the thematic concern with endings and residue. The palace thread functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image when it dulls. The environment shapes mood more than tactical choices, keeping this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.0)
    The suspended palace, stalactites “dripping with the memory of water,” and the mechanical world below are vivid and consistent, establishing a strong atmospheric contrast between cold machinery and fragile organic remnants. Setting details are reused meaningfully: moss and dew from the stalactites become components of the device, and the quaking palace mirrors and then answers his internal tension. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain his choices beyond providing those organic materials, but it does charge the final image as the palace “sighs” and the world pauses to listen. Overall, the specificity and integration are strong though not yet transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    The obsidian lagoon, black sand, kelp, and migrating clouds are vivid and tightly integrated, with recurring images that evolve in meaning from initial description to charged final tableau. Setting details are filtered through Elara’s purpose (sand as healing mineral, lagoon water for the paste) rather than tourist cataloging. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactics, but it does shape the ritualistic, almost sacred tone of the graft. The final image—lagoon holding its breath, kelp-drift calm—feels inseparable from the story’s emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.3)
    The City of Forgotten Fountains is vividly rendered—dry basins, smog-choked sky, rusted iron—and the environment directly shapes tactics (she must move fountain to fountain; she must wait for visible stars). The fountains and smog condition the method and the final image of water’s return, so setting is more than backdrop. Sensory detail is skewed to visual and atmospheric but well-curated for this length. A bit more tactile or auditory grounding under peak beats could deepen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    The nebula garden is vividly realized via specific, recurring images (crystallized flora, falling light-petals, sonar-painted gas clouds) and a consistent cosmic-lyric tone. Setting is not just backdrop; it mirrors and embodies the stakes of beauty-in-decline, and the garden’s physical state (dimming, dying) directly reweights the narrative. However, the environment rarely constrains concrete tactics beyond “no fire,” so its role is more atmospheric and thematic than mechanical. Still, it strongly charges the final image of a remembered, vanished place.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.5)
    The ancient greenhouse, broken glass, ivy, and monarch migration create a vivid, consistent atmosphere that supports the lyric, meditative mode. Details like the “cathedral” feel of the crumbling structure and the butterflies’ “final dance” tie setting to theme in a satisfying way. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; it is beautifully scenic but mostly passive. The greenhouse and migration charge the mood and imagery more than they generate situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tidal obsidian ridge and the clock tower’s brass gears, pendulum, and balcony provide a vivid, coherent physical frame, and the sea’s pounding subtly echoes his emotional turbulence. The broken rake handle as a tool-object is well integrated into the physical space and his routine. However, the environment rarely constrains his choices in a concrete way; the ridge could be swapped for another dramatic coastline without altering his tactics. Setting enriches mood more than it exerts pressure or enables specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting work is vivid and tonally unified: “cobalt silo,” “velveteen gloom,” and the cemetery under stars create a distinctive, textured atmosphere. Details are generally filtered through Elara’s gentle, attentive sensibility, tying environment to character. While the silo, case, and tapestry shape what she can do (this is essentially a micro-setting puzzle), the environment rarely constrains choice under pressure—it frames more than it forces. Still, the final move from silo to cemetery reuses the spatial anchors in a thematically coherent way.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    The obsidian spire, frozen lake, and kingfisher quill are vivid, recurring elements that charge the atmosphere and final image. The lake in particular evolves from symbolic stagnation to visible transformation, tightly tying setting to theme and closure. Details are selective and purposeful rather than touristic, and the space is easy to visualize. The main constraint is that the environment rarely constrains concrete choices beyond symbolism; it shapes meaning more than tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ember alcove, mist, dust, and radio glow create a strong, coherent micro-setting that shapes mood and activity; the environment feels lived-in and particular. The repeated return to the alcove and to the radio’s hidden light charges the final image of the space “breathing” with stories. Worldbuilding beyond the alcove (“story famine,” authorities) is more gestural than concrete, but it doesn’t damage orientation. The setting supports the theme and atmosphere without bogging the narrative down.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “vanishing point gallery,” infinite-feeling walls, central pedestal, stone slab, and rocking chair create a specific, slightly surreal locus that matches the piece’s introspective, art-led stakes. Setting is tightly woven into action—the chair’s motion brackets the ritual, and the gallery as a space “where realities dissolved and new ones formed” clearly charges the ending. Sensory texture leans visual, but the selectivity feels purposeful for an artist protagonist. The environment constrains the possible actions (this is a private ritual site), which strengthens the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sewer and sunken city ruins are vividly sketched—the “sedimentary layers of construction and collapse” and the “graveyard of sunken city ruins” tie setting directly to theme and method. Details like damp stone, fused nautical charts, and the crack of light overhead feel selective and purposeful rather than touristic. The environment acts as a library and prison, charging both her choices (where she lives, how she researches) and the final image of her scraping away another century. While atmospheric rather than tactically constraining, the setting is integrated and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    The velvet library in autumn is vividly rendered through touch, light, and sound (leaves tapping, dust motes in slanting light), and it establishes a tone that matches the story’s meditative stakes. The rosette and the library’s “traveled stillness” recur to charge the final image and mirror Elara’s inner journey. Setting is consistently filtered through her sensibility as a musician and teacher, avoiding museum-tour description. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain her tactical options, it does meaningfully frame and deepen the thematic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rusted greenhouse, skeletal iron frame, broken panes, and silvery celestial light are vividly rendered and thematically aligned with decay/renewal. Setting details (rust, shards, fertile patch) consistently echo her inner project and the final image of the sprout reaching for the stars is strong. However, the environment rarely constrains her choices—weather, rust, and fragility are atmospheric rather than operative pressures. Some descriptive motifs are repeated in near-identical form, slightly dulling their edge.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lightning collection tower, blackout city, and “nectar-dusk” sky are vivid and specific; the environment feels coherent and sensorially present. Setting directly shapes tactics (condensation on rods, simulated rain, residual energy at the summit). The tower and blackout meaningfully charge the final image of Elara descending into a relit city, though some late images slide toward generalized lyricism. Overall, the world rules (drones, rods, storm logic) hold together without clumsy exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.3)
    The quiet bay in spring, cherry blossoms, cobblestones, and the daydreaming streetlights create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that matches the story’s contemplative mode. Details like the overgrown garden and rusty gate latch are specific and integrated into action, not just scenic wallpaper. The environment subtly mirrors the theme of neglect and renewal, especially in the neglected cottage “waking” and the bay whispering with renewed energy. Still, the setting rarely constrains choice or introduces friction; it enriches mood more than it shapes events.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    The underwater garden is vivid and specific—drifting seaweed, iridescent coral, bioluminescent response, fish “dancing in intricate patterns”—and it feels lived-in rather than postcard-like. The environment meaningfully shapes choices: knowledge is stored in the garden itself, access depends on structural weaknesses, and the central monument’s seam is the only viable conduit. The recurring objects (ampoule, monument, corals) are tightly tied to action and climax. A bit more sensory range beyond the visual could deepen atmosphere, but what’s present is purposeful and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.8)
    The infinite staircase and the dice are strong conceptual anchors, and the staircase nicely embodies “boundless confinement” and perpetual ascent. However, sensory detail remains mostly abstract (“cold stone,” “air hummed”) and heavily metaphor-driven, so the space rarely constrains concrete options or tactics. The staircase functions more as idea than as lived environment, which blunts its atmospheric potential. As a result, the setting supports theme but doesn’t fully operate as a pressure-bearing stage.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rooftop greenhouse, smog-choked city, and waxing moon are vividly rendered and recur as meaningful contrasts—acidic haze versus humid sanctuary, pollution versus cleansing light. The setting is tightly tied to the premise: the moonlight literally powers the visions, and the greenhouse becomes a beacon in the final image. Details like “saffron quiet” and the brush on the weathered table feel selective rather than touristic. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain her choices beyond making this nocturnal ritual possible, it strongly charges the mood and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    The grotto city behind the waterfall is strongly realized through sound (roar of the falls), moisture (cool mist), and scent (“rosewater dread”), and those specifics feel integral rather than decorative. Environment constrains and enables action: the waterfall-carved city shelters the displaced, the misty old quarters frame the search, and the eastern cliff physically shapes the honey-gathering. The opera lens and blue succulents serve as charged objects embedded in the setting, not just props. A slightly clearer spatial sense of the climb and kitchen could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the rocky island, breathing tide, mysterious lighthouse, and storm all interlock with the mythic machinery of time. Environmental conditions directly shape events (low tide revealing the stone; the lighthouse and its clocks as the laboratory; the reversed rain and beam as closure imagery). Details are selective and atmospheric, with the island’s expansion under retreating water mirroring the “unmooring” of fate. Setting objects (hunger stone, lighthouse beam, backwards clocks) meaningfully charge the final image rather than serving as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    The funhouse is vividly realized through purposeful, POV-filtered detail: “paint peeling like sunburnt skin,” “tomb of forgotten laughter,” rotten cotton candy, and sickly neon establish both mood and physical context. The setting does more than decorate; the mirrors and lingering luminance directly host and route the confrontation with fear. Environmental evolution is modest but coherent (neon → luminance → white explosion → ordinary darkness) and tracks the arc from haunted to emptied space. It could lean slightly more on how the space constrains or complicates her options, but as-is it strongly supports atmosphere and thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    The floating citrus orchard on lashed driftwood is vivid, specific, and consistently used: the trees, roots, shells, and sea-glass resonator all participate in the music and in the wave-deflection. Environment shapes action—there is literally nowhere else to go, so he must work with sky, sea, and orchard as instruments. The weather (clouds, wave) and time of day (“blue hour”) tonally infuse the piece and evolve rather than sit as backdrop. This is rich, well-integrated setting rather than postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    The city on gargantuan turtles, the rusted gate, and the hazy horizon with silent watchers are vivid and specific, and they’re introduced early enough to ground the reader. Setting meaningfully constrains choices: the turtles’ migration underpins Kaelen’s cartographic method and the harmonic dissonance discovery, while the shut gate and surrounding emptiness define the stakes of isolation. The crack in the shell and the final image of the drifting city directly charge the closure. A slight limitation is that most sensory detail stays in the visual and conceptual registers; bodily/tactile engagement is present but could deepen under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    The disused railway station, ivy, and rosebush are vividly rendered and recur meaningfully, with the final image of petal-less thorns nicely charging the thematic close. Sensory detail (damp earth, old roses, dust) is selective and apt, never devolving into a tourist catalog. The setting frames her work emotionally as sanctuary/crypt rather than a neutral room. It doesn’t materially constrain choices, but it does shape mood and the final resonance in a deliberate way.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    The submerged pavilion is vividly, precisely evoked—“columns rising like gaunt ribs,” slimy tiles underfoot, water listening in the “salt-heavy dusk.” Setting is not mere backdrop; it constrains his movement, makes the act of repair tactile, and gives the final underwater note a sense of irreversible burial. The recurring water/structure imagery mirrors the theme of damaged foundations and drowned hopes without feeling like a mechanical symbol set. A slight bias toward visual and conceptual imagery over other senses is the only minor limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    The forgotten library in a sunken city is vividly evoked, and the blackout plus water-damaged wood directly constrain tactics (tactile navigation, probing warped seams, reliance on scent and touch). The antique ink stamp functions as a micro-setting/tool that structures her process and charges the ending image. Sensory detail (aged paper, salt, carved wood) feels purposeful rather than decorative. Minor abstraction in places keeps it just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.3)
    The floating island, tea garden, glass basilica, and dream orbs are vividly realized and consistently refracted through Elara’s perception (rainbows on her hands, pulsing dream-heartbeat). Setting details are integrated with action—ascending basilica steps, polishing gems, the shadow at the garden’s edge—rather than feeling like static backdrop. The final image of the glowing basilica and stirred cranes meaningfully recharges earlier environmental imagery. The worldbuilding is lush yet legible, though the environment rarely constrains concrete choices beyond mood and metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    The floating observatory, dark corridors, and Stellar Resonance Chamber create a vivid, tonally consistent environment that reinforces isolation and metaphysical reach. Details like cooling circuit breakers and dormant telescopes are concrete and integrated into the action rather than feeling like a catalog. The geode and the chamber function as a micro-setting and tool, framing how he can seek alternate possibilities. Still, the environment doesn’t deeply constrain tactics—this could almost play in any advanced lab—so the setting enriches mood more than it dictates choice.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ancient observatory, dusk light, domes, lever, and prism are well established and integrated into the main action rather than feeling like backdrop. The observatory’s age and disrepair (“broken telescopes, fragmented star charts”) support the motif of missing pieces and make the mechanical turn (lever, gears, rotating dome) plausible and vivid. Still, much of the atmosphere leans on repeated abstractions (“brilliant dimness,” “latent energy”) rather than sharper, varied sensory detail. The setting supports the final image of the observatory as home, but could constrain choices more concretely to reach a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    Setting and atmosphere are vivid and purposeful: “cobalt terrace,” “sieved hush,” overgrown path, and driftwood carvings all mirror and deepen the internal state. The shore functions as a liminal space where city noise drains away and judgment/clarity are possible, and the recurring watch hand is charged in the final movement. Details stay selective rather than touristic, and the environment evolves as she moves from terrace-prison to reflective shore and back. The landscape doesn’t strongly constrain physical choice, but it does constrain emotional and thematic options in a coherent way.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The storm-worn parapet, mist, and watching moon create a strong, coherent atmosphere that matches the “neutral yet haunted” emotional register of the scene. The recurring sensory elements (wind as “furrowed hush,” mist parting like a curtain) are vivid and integrated into Elara’s perception rather than feeling like a tourist catalog. The setting doesn’t significantly constrain tactics beyond mood—it’s more backdrop than active pressure—so it falls short of the very top band. Nonetheless, the micro-setting and recurrent object (drawer pull) nicely charge the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    The coastal setting, overcast sky, and shoreline utility poles are clear and consistently affect options: he stays close to shore, counts poles, and the choppy water nearly flips him. The lighthouse as destination gives the environment a strong orienting vector and charges the final image of arrival. Detail is selective rather than lush, but the cold water, grey sky, and rocky shore keep the world from feeling generic. The setting could carry even more character-specific texture, yet it already does real work in constraining tactics and embodying his internal journey.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    The underground bioluminescent lake is vividly anchored and meaningfully integrated: light, reflections, and ripples are tied to his decisions and to the notion of a “labyrinth of choices.” Details like the damp, cool air and bioluminescent creatures pulsing with his heartbeat are selective and thematically apt rather than touristic. The environment actively constrains and informs his tactics—the glowing paths change with his choices and the baseball’s contact with the water reveals routes—so it functions as more than backdrop. Some imagery is reiterated a bit plainly, but spatial and atmospheric clarity remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    The orchard, moonlight, and spices are vividly rendered with strong sensory detail (e.g., saffron as “lost sunrises,” moonlight pooling like “liquid silver”) that feel purposeful rather than touristic. Setting meaningfully charges the final image: the fairy-tale orchard under permanent moonlight becomes their sanctuary and emblem of the new order. The ritual’s spatial and sensory staging—moss altar, spices from the world’s corners—anchors the magic in concrete environment. While the orchard doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, it functions as a coherent, atmospheric micro-world that supports theme and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: “midnight glade above the clouds” and “clouds below swirling like liquid time” directly embody the premise of accumulated, unreachable hours. Objects-as-setting—the cracked saucer and birthday tablecloth—are used as ritual tools that constrain what she can do and charge the final image. Environmental details evolve with events (crack glows, glade pulses, dawn tints the clouds), mirroring her internal shift without feeling like pasted-on symbolism. At this length, the world-building is economical yet sensorially rich, with setting actively shaping the story’s meaning and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    The recycled spaceship, worn metal grating, and humming patchwork hull create a strong, melancholy atmosphere that suits the premise. Objects like the photographs and Kwan Yin’s tear function as micro-settings, charged with human grief and hope. Still, the broader environment rarely constrains options; it’s more evocative backdrop than active pressure on her tactics. The locked dimension itself is felt as a “vast, silent pressure” but remains abstract rather than physically or spatially grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    The black sand beach, active volcano, and celestial conjunction create a vivid, coherent environment that strongly supports tone and theme. Setting details like the “cool, black sand” and the volcano’s “gentle awakening” are integrated with action and the final realization about the “texture of transformation.” The recurring contrast of dark sand and light (bugs, stars, volcano glow) charges the final image effectively. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain tactics, it clearly shapes the ritual and reweights the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    The luminous fort, blackout, courtyard sundial, and dusty armory are specific and coherent, and they’re integrated into action rather than described in isolation. The sundial, blackout, and fort’s prior luminosity all materially affect tactics and atmosphere, not just visuals. The “bronze quill holder” and “cradle of sparks” function almost as micro-settings/objects-on-stage that charge the final image. Some atmospheric phrases (“winking hush,” “pregnant pause”) are repeated enough to feel slightly generic, but overall the environment supports tone and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tidal bluff, aurora, frictionless world, eels, painted rocks, and leadwood box are vivid, selective, and integrated into action rather than feeling like backdrop. The aurora and bluff are not just pretty—he literally relies on the auroral beam and the spatial edge to conduct the ritual, and the frictionless environment shapes images like hovering dust and sliding sand. World rules (frictionless, aurora as energy source) stay consistent and legible. This rich, coherent atmosphere substantially enhances both tone and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stormlit observatory above the clouds is vivid and sustained; the trembling glass, telescopes, and lightning flashes are specific and atmospherically tied to Elara’s turmoil. The telescope reflection of her scarred face is a strong, concrete bridge between setting and theme. However, the environment mostly mirrors emotion rather than constraining action; beyond the timer and telescope, very little about the physical space changes what she can or must do. Description is effective but leans more toward mood piece than structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glass atrium, quiet brook, and half-painted sundial are vivid, sensorially grounded, and thematically aligned with “dignified chaos” and measured time. The sundial and atrium both participate in action (the mechanism and the duel), and the final image of stepping out by the brook reweights prior atmosphere into a calmer harmony. However, the environment rarely constrains choice—Kaelen’s tactics would be much the same in a different elegant setting. Strong specificity and mood, but the world stops short of fully shaping stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “rusted library under the stars” is an evocative, specific environment that’s continually present in action (debris, rusted holes, salvaged volumes, open-air ruin). Setting and key objects (coffee tin, books, moon, stars) interact with the characters’ efforts and clearly charge the final image of the library as “a testament to their resolve, a beacon in the night.” The atmosphere is consistent and purposeful, though weather and physical constraints rarely force hard choices beyond mood. Overall, the place feels tactile and central rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tidal arbor above the clouds, pulsing flora, brass-pillared compasses, and mist screen are vividly specific and tightly integrated with the action (instability, timing, and the mechanics of projection and music). The shift into the monochrome film-world is clearly staged, with the new environment’s rules (silent rooms, still compasses, distant point) supporting both mood and goal. Setting repeatedly constrains and enables choices: the failing arbor makes refuge necessary; the projector, mist, and piano are tools only viable in that environment. The final image of Elian in the monochrome ballroom with the reset clock effectively charges the setting with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.5)
    The ancient ridge, blooming flowers, monsoon, and cottage in the ridge provide a coherent, gently atmospheric fantasy setting with a few tactile details (petals, scent, glowing soil). The environment participates modestly in the plot: the ridge’s energy convergence dictates where to plant, and the monsoon/weather frame the urgency and the need for a sanctuary. Still, much of the worldbuilding remains generic—standing stones, flowering vines, crystalline ark—rather than particularized through Elara’s biased perception. Setting supports but rarely constrains or complicates choices in a way that would charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    The breezy islet after rain, the cove, bonsai cottage, and shoreline are rendered with tactile specificity and a coherent, moist, salt-tinged atmosphere that supports the reflective mood. Environmental details like the “calm after the rain” are tied to the ritual’s timing, giving the weather modest functional weight rather than mere backdrop. Objects-as-setting—the compass, lace, and bonsai—feel lived-in and thematically aligned with guidance, patience, and miniature worlds. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, but it does convincingly cradle the emotional and symbolic action.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.0)
    The greenhouse setting is established with some specific imagery ("mud-smeared glass"), but the description often defaults to abstract interpretation ("silent testament," "active site of becoming") rather than sensory grounding. The microscopic focus on dust is vivid but filtered through distant analysis.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting consists of generic descriptors ("quiet canyon," "blanket of stars," "cold stone") without sensory specificity or distinct atmosphere. The environmental mechanism (frost acting as a decryption code) violates the established physical reality of the scene. The setting serves as a passive backdrop until it magically provides the plot solution.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting is established but remains a static backdrop; the "Great Quietening" frames the story without adding active pressure to the scene. Descriptions tilt toward generic fantasy imagery ("frozen panes," "silver-leafed shrubs") rather than specific, tactile interactions that constrain choice.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=4.2)
    Settings are described with standard adjectives ("murky water," "spectral city") but lack tactile immediacy or interaction that constrains the character's movement. The underwater library is a visual backdrop rather than an environment that forces specific tactical choices. Spatial choreography is vague due to the summary nature of the text.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting is described with generic adjectives ("weathered arches," "dusty path") and functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraint. Atmospheric details are told ("amplified quiet") rather than evoked through sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is atmospherically consistent but generic, relying on romanticized tropes (twilight, wisteria, damp stone) without specific, tactile grounding. The environment functions as a passive container for the loot-drop rather than a source of constraint or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.3)
    The "living bridge garden" is visualized with some appealing specific details. However, the "hyperbolic geometry" remains an abstract concept; the story tells us curves defy limits but fails to show what this looks like spatially in the physical garden.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting consists of generic carnival tropes (faded banners, Ferris wheel) without specific sensory detail to create a distinct atmosphere. The "prize redemption center" is merely a named location that does not constrain the character's movement or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.2)
    The surreal setting—a sunken greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks—is vividly imagined and anchors the piece visually. However, the environment often feels like static set-dressing ("stood as tombstones") rather than a dynamic space that forces specific tactical choices or constraints on the character.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is vividly described with consistent color imagery ("emerald," "verdant"), anchoring the scene well. However, the description leans heavily on purple adjectives ("hues of fire and honey") rather than sensory details that constrain the action.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.2)
    The juxtaposition of the control room and glassblowing is visually distinct, but the logistics (lighting a portable furnace in a derelict room) strain credibility. The setting serves primarily as a heavy-handed mirror for the protagonist's internal state rather than a source of constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.4)
    The rusted library is described with standard adjectival strings ("oxidized metal", "decaying paper") but lacks interaction that constraints choice. The "whispering seashell" introduces an unexplained supernatural element that clashes with the grounded thriller logic of codes and safe houses.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is vivid but operates largely as a backdrop rather than a source of constraint or resources. While the "ancient stones" and "storm's aftermath" provide atmosphere, they do not force the protagonist to alter her tactics or adapt her method. The sensory details are functional but standard for the genre.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is established with clear visual anchors ("ice crystal violin," "barren trees"), though some descriptions veer into generic abstraction ("frozen light"). The environment interacts with the character mostly as atmosphere rather than a source of physical constraints or tactical resources.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is vivid but operates on dream logic rather than physical consistency; the "whispering" crystals are atmospheric but their mechanics are vague. The specific projection on "wet crystal" is hard to visualize spatially, though the atmosphere is consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is established but remains generic ("twisting paths," "hidden clearings") and lacks sensory specificity. The magical interaction with the vines is described in abstract terms ("seeming to part slightly") rather than through concrete, grounded details that would make the environment feel real. The "measurable luck" element is mentioned but not integrated into the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.8)
    Visuals of the gas giant and the magnetic nexus are vivid and anchor the scene clearly in a sci-fi setting. However, the environment functions mostly as a backdrop; apart from the timing of the nexus, the setting does not impose constraints or pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.8)
    Physical logic is inconsistent; "chest-high water" implies immense resistance and difficulty keeping a paper program dry, yet Elara moves and acts with unencumbered ease. The setting details ("flickering lanterns") feel generic and decorative rather than constraining action.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting is functional, providing necessary props (machines, window, illustration), but relies on abstract descriptors like "auroral sorrow" instead of concrete sensory grounding. The "lonely outpost" feels generic, lacking specific textures or constraints that would force unique tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.6)
    The "beaded valve wheel" is a strong, specific artifact that grounds the scene effectively. However, the surrounding atmosphere relies on generic descriptors ("oppressive silence," "absolute dark") rather than sensory details that actively constrain the character's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.2)
    Atmospheric imagery like the "cryptic folds" and "obsidian refuge" is effective, though the setting functions largely as a backdrop rather than a constraint that pressures the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting is rendered through generic, repetitive descriptors ("serene hills," "ancient oak") that fail to ground the reader in a specific physical reality. Sensory details are abstract and filtered through the prompt's keywords rather than character perception. The environment does not constrain the characters' choices or create necessary friction.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "bronze quiet" and silo library provide a serviceable atmospheric backdrop, though the imagery often leans into generic ruin tropes. The setting is largely static; the environment does not pressure the protagonist or force tactical trade-offs, serving instead as a passive container for the clues.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.0)
    The setting consists of generic signifiers ("lighthouse," "fog," "lantern room") that provide no sensory grounding or constraint on the characters' choices. The environment is treated as a static backdrop for the summary rather than a lived-in space that pressures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=3.4)
    The setting suffers from "white room" syndrome, relying on high-concept abstract descriptors ("nexus," "reality sutured to possibility") rather than concrete sensory details. The environment lacks tactile grounding; apart from the "cold floor" and "ultramarine" paint, the space is defined by vague nouns that distance the reader. The atmosphere is told via oxymorons ("muffled clarity," "unraveled stillness") rather than evoked through specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting imagery (glass spire, frozen lake) is vivid but functions as a static, "white room" backdrop that does not constrain the character's actions. The descriptions are ornate but disconnected from the physical reality of the scene; the environment feels like a dreamscape where objects have no weight or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is generic fantasy ("glowing viaduct," "shimmering," "runes") lacking sensory specificity beyond the visual. The description of the "procedural generation" is vague, resembling shifting walls in a video game. The "darkening brightness" is stated as a fact of the world rather than established through atmospheric detail.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.0)
    The cavern setting has some concrete details (sawdust, stretched hides), but descriptions often veer into abstract metaphors ("metallic flower," "crucible of healing"). The phrase "audibly muted" is inserted awkwardly twice, disrupting the sensory immersion. The "faint rustle of turning seasons" feels like a forced refrain rather than an atmospheric grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting functions as a generic backdrop with standard descriptors ("cool air," "dim sky") rather than an active constraint. While the atmosphere is established, the environment does not pressure the character's choices or tactics. The "quiet courtyard" is a static stage rather than a lived-in space that shapes the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting is established with some vivid sensory details ("humid air," "shimmering cloud"), creating a consistent atmosphere. However, descriptions veer into cliché ("cathedral of glass") and abstract purple prose ("sanctuary of loss") rather than specific, grounded observation that constrains the character.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.4)
    The setting is functional but generic, relying on standard descriptors like "warm, earthy walls" and "cold light" that do not distinguish the space. The environment acts as a passive backdrop for the protagonist's internal monologue rather than providing constraints that force specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting imagery—the sunken orchard, the glass dome, the skeletal ships—is evocative and establishes a distinct, mythic atmosphere. While the visual description is strong ("trees reaching through water and air"), the setting functions primarily as a static backdrop for the metaphor rather than a source of physical resistance or constraint on the character's choices. The "chronic hush" is described but not felt as a sensory pressure that forces tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.0)
    The "amber grotto" provides a visual backdrop with some sensory detail ("translucent walls," "static electricity"), but it fails to exert pressure or constrain the character's choices. The setting acts as a passive stage for internal monologue rather than an active force that shapes the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=2.4)
    Setting details are generic ("quiet streets," "starlit sky") and repeated without gaining sensory depth or constraining action. The "breezy library" serves as a static backdrop rather than an environment that pressures the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is visually vivid ("crystalline orchard," "obsidian arbor") but functions primarily as ornamental backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure. While the descriptions establish a tone, the environment does not force tactile choices or impede the protagonist's goals in a meaningful way.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.1)
    The concept of a rooftop canal system atop a sleeping giant is imaginative and visually distinct, providing a strong surreal atmosphere. However, the description often relies on generic similes ("stretching like taffy") and summary ("weaving between towers") rather than specific, tactile interactions that constrain the protagonist's movements. The setting frames the action but rarely forces Elara to improvise.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.1)
    Specific elements like the "cloudy orbs" and "glowing fruits" show imagination, but the setting remains a static backdrop. It does not exert pressure or constrain the protagonist's choices, serving only as a container for the action.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the "sapphire hush" and "cold metal ducts" are established, the setting relies heavily on repetitive adjectival labeling rather than sensory interaction that constrains choice. The description is static and ornamental, failing to evolve with the narrative pressure or influence the protagonist's tactics beyond providing a location for the tape player.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is grounded with specific sensory details ("emerald carpet," "petrichor") that support the mood. However, the connection between the environment and the character's choice is somewhat overstated symbolically rather than functioning as a tangible constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is functional but relies on generic post-apocalyptic tropes ("dwindling resources," "scarred by conflicts") rather than specific, tactile constraints that force choices. While the "rain trails" and "mud" offer some sensory grounding, the "water wars" backstory serves as distant window dressing rather than an immediate pressure on the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is established clearly but relies on generic fantasy signifiers ("symphony of light," "crystals that chimed") rather than specific, tactile details that constrain action. While the cave functions as a stage, the environment does not offer resistance or shape the tactics beyond providing the magical tool. The imagery leans on abstract descriptors like "bright darkness" rather than grounded sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.2)
    The "ivory harbor" offers a distinct visual anchor, but the description leans on generic clichés ("dust motes dancing," "fragile as morning mist"). The setting functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraint or resource that shapes Elara's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on vague, purple descriptions ("swirling vapors," "frozen tears," "shimmering doorway") rather than tactile, grounding details. The "fortress" functions as a metaphorical abstraction rather than a physical space that pressures the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting anchors the scene intelligibly but relies on generic fantasy tropes ("salt-laced wind," "dimming sky") that do not constrain the protagonist's choices. The "sculpted space" remains an abstract concept rather than a concrete environment that pressures the narrative. The tower provides atmosphere but not distinct physical obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting relies on visual abstractions ("living crystal," "impossible colors") and the repetitive tag "prismatic escondite" rather than tactile, grounded detail. The use of "escondite" (Spanish for hiding place) feels like an arbitrary thesaurus substitution that distracts rather than adds cultural or atmospheric depth. The environment remains a backdrop of "colored light" rather than a physical space constraining action.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.2)
    The funeral home setting is established with specific sensory details ("embalming fluid," "stainless steel"), providing a grounded atmosphere. However, the setting remains largely static and does not deeply constrain the tactical choices beyond providing a venue for the meeting.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.2)
    The surreal imagery of a bonsai labyrinth lit by a fluorescent lamp is vivid and specific, though the setting functions more as an atmospheric backdrop than a source of constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.5)
    The atmosphere is vivid and specific, with strong sensory details like "slime-covered pilings" and "metallic canyons" grounding the noir tone. The setting effectively mirrors the protagonist's isolation, though it serves more as a backdrop than a source of tactical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is functionally established with standard atmospheric tropes ("wind howled," "shattered glass"). While the environment is clear, it serves as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established with functional sensory details ("fried dough," "defiant magenta," "damp from sea spray"), anchoring the reader efficiently. However, the "raft city" concept remains largely atmospheric; the environment does not physically constrain the character's movement or choices, serving merely as a backdrop for the action.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is functional and anchored, but descriptions often lean into generic adjectives ("profound silence," "stark shadows") rather than sensory specifics unique to the POV's expertise. While the visual of the sunrise is clear, the environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices or tactics, serving merely as a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.1)
    Setting details are generic and cliché-heavy ("mist-coated," "ghostly shroud"). The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than forcing tactical adjustments or constraining action.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is functional but generic ("rusted outpost," "frozen lake," "white desert"), lacking sensory specificity or grit. The environment serves as a static backdrop rather than a force that pressures the protagonist; the "metallic decay" and "icy hush" are standard tropes that don't constrain the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy signifiers ("ancient archway," "cobblestones," "dust devils") rather than specific, lived-in details. The "ghost town" remains an abstraction, failing to ground the reader in a tangible geography or atmosphere beyond the repeated "wild hush" tag.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting contains standard underwater tropes ("phosphorescence," "fractured beams") without specific, tactile details that constrain action. While atmospheric, the description remains generic and visual-heavy, missing the claustrophobic pressure of the deep.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse prison is atmospheric, effectively blending physical danger with the metaphysical labyrinth. However, the explicit naming of the tone ("coated in the tone of copperlight repose") breaks immersion, treating the atmosphere as a labeled inventory item rather than an organic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting provides a functional atmospheric backdrop but relies on generic descriptors ("luminescent fruits," "twisting branches") rather than specific, grounding details. The "alchemical" nature of the greenhouse is asserted but not demonstrated through distinct tools, smells, or processes that constrain the characters. The environment remains a static stage set rather than an active force.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.2)
    Setting details are largely generic ("red canyon," "ancient stone") or abstract ("rubble," "faded symbols") and do not constrain the protagonist's choices. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the prompt elements rather than a source of friction or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "catacomb orchard" is an evocative concept that grounds the piece, though execution leans on generic adjectives ("gnarled," "ancient") rather than specific sensory friction. The setting feels static and cooperative, waiting to be solved rather than exerting pressure on the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is established with list-like descriptors ("golden," "brass," "futuristic") but feels static and unconstrained. The "arcade" serves as a passive backdrop rather than an environment that pressures the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.4)
    The observatory setting is atmospherically established with "echoed silence" and the "Eternal Candle," creating a solid mood. The environment effectively anchors the scene, though the transition into the metaphysical space of "adjacent possibilities" slightly unmoors the physical grounding of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is atmospherically described but largely functional, serving as a passive backdrop for the magic system rather than a source of constraint. Sensory details often lean into generic fantasy tropes ("singing spirits," "gloom," "veil") rather than specific, grounded textures.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "mist-clad atrium" and "bruised purple light" provide a cohesive atmospheric vibe, though the imagery leans heavily on standard dream/liminal tropes. The brain coral offers a welcome tactile anchor, yet the setting ultimately feels like a passive backdrop that does not constrain the protagonist's options or force a tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is atmospherically consistent, utilizing the fog and ruin to create a distinct visual mood. However, descriptors often lean into cliché ("branches like bleached bones," "centuries-thick blanket"), and the environment serves as a passive canvas rather than an active constraint on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting is described with abstract, synesthetic purple prose ("melodies bloomed," "sonic flora") rather than grounded sensory detail. The "central crystal" appears abruptly as a convenient prop (teleportation) to facilitate the magic, lacking prior establishment.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is vividly described with sensory details ("iridescent beetles," "humid jungle"), anchoring the scene physically. However, the descriptions often feel like a list of adjectives ("unassuming pod," "malicious intent") rather than constraints that shape the tactical choices. The "warp" visualization is standard but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=3.5)
    While the "gargantuan shell" provides a distinct visual, the setting remains static and ornamental, failing to constrain the character's actions or choices. The description relies on flowery abstractions ("pearlescent arches," "liquid silence") rather than tactile, lived-in details that anchor the scene in a concrete reality.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "opal library" is visualized with competent but standard ethereal tropes ("frozen milk," "shimmering"), creating a pleasant backdrop that fails to constrain the character. The setting functions as a static container rather than an active source of pressure on choices.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting consists of standard genre tropes (crumbling scrolls, dusty tomes) that provide a backdrop but do not constrain the protagonist's choices. The "whispers of dead tongues" add slight atmosphere but remain ornamental. The environment feels static, serving only as a container for the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.7)
    The concept of a breathing amphitheater within a dormant volcano is vivid and spatially grounded, providing strong atmospheric potential. However, the setting drifts into pathetic fallacy near the end, responding to the protagonist's mood ("softness," "gentle hum") rather than maintaining its geological indifference.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.0)
    Setting details are generic ("dusty attic," "vintage bookshop," "aged paper") and lack a specific POV filter or sensory hierarchy. The environment serves as a passive backdrop for the summary rather than a constraint that shapes tactics or forces choices. The "dust motes" image repeats without deepening or changing meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the descriptions of the "drifting prism terrace" are visually evocative, the setting remains an abstract "white room" that fails to constrain the character's choices. The environment acts as a passive backdrop for philosophical musing rather than a pressurized space.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is the strongest element, with some grounded details ("hum of generators," "curved glass") establishing a functional stage. However, atmosphere often leans on abstract telling ("overwhelming darkness," "canvas of black") rather than sensory specificity that constrains the protagonist's options.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy adjectives ("iridescent," "shimmering," "glowing") rather than tactile, grounding details that constrain choice. The environment functions as a static backdrop for the light show rather than a pressure cooker for the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "tidal arcade" offers a distinct atmospheric concept, but the description relies on stock imagery ("velvet sky," "crimson snow") rather than concrete, textured detail. While the setting provides props for the performance, it does not exert pressure or constrain the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting relies on generic atmospheric markers ("sanctuary of silence," "damp grass," "ancient") rather than concrete, grounding particulars. The "twilight garden" feels like a stage set, and the sensory details are filtered through heavy adjectival abstraction rather than immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sensory details are vivid ("cool, curved glass," "salt-tinged air") and the atmosphere is consistently rendered. However, the atrium feels somewhat static, like a museum exhibit the character visits solely to trigger a thought, rather than a space she must navigate with urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=2.8)
    The setting consists of generic placeholders ("moonlit ridge," "dark forest," "stars") that fail to constrain the character's choices or mirror specific internal states. Sensory detail is filtered through heavy abstraction, resulting in a "white room" effect where the environment feels like a stage backdrop rather than a lived-in space. There is no specific interaction with the terrain that alters the pacing or outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.5)
    Atmospheric details like "wet light" and "luminous kelp" are vivid, establishing a consistent tone, though the setting functions as a passive resource cache rather than a source of pressure or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=4.5)
    Setting details are generic ("damp earth," "moss-covered stone") and lack specific, constraining sensory texture. The optical mechanics of the film negative strip—revealing a clear narrative sequence in dim ivy light—strain credibility and break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting provides a lush visual backdrop ("prism parapet," "blooming jasmine") but fails to exert pressure on the protagonist. The environment facilitates the magic perfectly rather than offering constraints or obstacles that would force Lyra to adapt her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is established with functional but generic high-fantasy descriptors ("ancient terrace," "worn stones," "silvery runes"). The "ebony clipboard" is an incongruous object that is not harmonized with the archaic aesthetic, reading like a forced prompt element. The environment provides a stage but does not constrain the character's tactics or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is successfully integrated into the plot, particularly the "crack-map" which transforms the salt flat from scenery into a necessary tool. Sensory details like the "crystalline crust" and "crunching" knees ground the abstract quest in physical reality, though some descriptors ("vast, white expanse") lean toward the generic.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.0)
    The atmosphere is cohesive and fits the high-fantasy tone, utilizing the silver and snow motifs effectively. However, the setting operates largely as a static backdrop ("silver courtyard") rather than a source of constraint or pressure; the physical reality is often dissolved into abstract description ("shimmering nexus").

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.8)
    The "decommissioned radar dome" offers a distinct and promising container, but the description relies on the repetitive label "meteor hush" instead of varied sensory details. The external world ("seedy bars," "neon-lit streets") remains generic and abstract, failing to exert pressure on the interior sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.3)
    The setting is established but relies on generic fantasy tropes ("emerald moss," "ancient stone") without specific, grounding textures. The phrase "blushing stillness" is semantically opaque and feels forced/ornamental rather than organic to the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "icebound sanctum" provides a vivid, if standard, fantasy backdrop that reacts to the magic (dripping, glowing). Sensory details are present ("brittle" paper, "frigid air"), but the setting functions largely as scenery rather than an active constraint on Elara's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    Setting is the story's strongest asset; imagery like "concrete bones strangled by green life" and the "scent of wet earth and ozone" creates a vivid, tangible atmosphere. The environment actively pressures the character (the storm, the decaying bunker) and grounds the metaphysical plot in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.7)
    The setting descriptions are colorful ("lavender sky," "unblinking tile eyes") but function primarily as a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker. While the visuals are distinct, they do not constrain the protagonist's choices or force tactical adaptations. The atmosphere feels constructed to serve the prompt's tone rather than the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting suffers from "white-room syndrome," described in abstract terms ("serene void," "non-light," "reality itself was shifting") that fail to ground the reader physically. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the magic system rather than a tangible space that constrains action or forces adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting uses standard atmospheric tropes ("gnarled skeletons," "thick fog") that serve as a passive backdrop rather than constraining action. While visually consistent, the environment does not force trade-offs or shape the characters' tactics beyond providing mirror shards.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting concept (orchard in cathedral rafters) is vivid and imaginative ("blooming apples and decaying stone"), providing a strong atmospheric backdrop. However, the setting remains static and does not constrain the protagonist's tactical options or force a trade-off. It serves as scenery rather than an active pressure cooker for the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "astral orchard" and "crystalline bathroom" are visually distinct, offering some vivid imagery ("fruit pulsed with a rhythmic glow"). However, the setting serves largely as a backdrop for the prompt elements rather than a pressure cooker that forces choices.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.2)
    The Glimmering Stack is described with standard fantasy tropes (floating books, endless corridors) that provide a backdrop but rarely constrain the characters' tactical options. While the verticality is established ("piled high into the misty peaks"), the setting functions mostly as a container for the plot rather than an active force or atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.6)
    While the setting has atmospheric potential, descriptions rely on standard genre tropes ("skeletons of joy," "shroud") rather than specific, tactile details that constrain the protagonist's choices. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the character's internal monologue rather than an active pressure cooker that forces tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is described with generic steampunk/fantasy tropes ("labyrinth of brass," "silent stone") that serve as a passive backdrop rather than a pressure cooker. While the visual of the door is clear, the environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices or offer resistance. The mechanism room functions merely as a container for the props.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is described through abstract, adjective-heavy phrases ("chaotic resonance," "balanced frequencies") rather than concrete sensory details. The environment serves as a passive backdrop for the magic system rather than a source of constraint or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory details like the "humming pavilion" and "fused silica" establish a distinct, vivid atmosphere. However, the "shard of hush" functions more as a decorative label than an integrated environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "solid fog" and "whispering forecourt" are imaginative visual concepts but function as static backdrops rather than active constraints. The setting is described in "postcard" terms and does not force tactical shifts or obstruct the protagonist's progress.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is described with pleasant but generic fantasy imagery ("ancient stones," "creeping jasmine") that serves as a passive backdrop rather than a pressure cooker. While the visual details are coherent, the environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices or offer obstacles that force tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting functions as a generic backdrop for thematic projection rather than a pressure cooker. Descriptions are often abstract ("canopy of stars," "ancient and star-lit") or utilitarian, lacking the sensory specificity that would constrain the characters' choices or ground the scene in a tangible reality.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.0)
    The sensory details regarding the "flavors of silence" are evocative and ground the abstract concept effectively. The visual of the inverted world is strong, though the "xenial trellis" itself feels somewhat vague and generic compared to the gritty specificity of the bunker.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.6)
    The setting ("drifting prism terrace") is abstract and decorative, failing to constrain the protagonist's choices or offer tactile resistance. While the visual concept is established, the environment functions as a static backdrop rather than an active force that pressures the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting relies on generic, adjective-heavy descriptors ("kaleidoscopic," "luminescent") rather than specific, sensory grounding. The mechanical interaction with the "peeling paint" feels contrived and physically implausible as a method for rapid map discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=3.9)
    The setting is atmospheric but entirely abstract, functioning as a "void" populated by generic signifiers ("charcoal," "starlight," "shadows") rather than a specific, lived-in place. There is no sensory specificity beyond the visual aesthetic of "ash," and the environment does not constrain the character's choices in a logical way. The lack of concrete grounding makes the "sanctuary" feel like a stage set for a monologue rather than a world.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting relies on visual descriptors ("ethereal," "bioluminescent") that create a generic atmospheric backdrop rather than a specific, tactile environment that constrains choices. The transition to the university lab offers a "sterile" space that feels interchangeable and fails to ground the metaphysical events in a gritty, observable reality.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=2.4)
    The setting is established through repetitive, abstract descriptors ("sepia reading room," "golden shadows") that appear 4–6 times each without deepening. There is no sensory engagement beyond visual filters and a generic "whir"; the environment does not constrain the character or shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is established with standard fantasy tropes ("void," "luminescent fruits") but lacks tactile specificity that constrains the character. The repeated use of the clumsy phrase "factually mystical" actively undermines the atmosphere and breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is sketched with generic tropes ("towering shelves," "wooden desk") that fail to ground the reader in a specific, lived-in reality. While the "dust" is a central image, it functions more as a magical plot device than a sensory detail that constrains or pressures the character.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=3.0)
    The setting is generic and lacks sensory grounding; the transition from city library to "decaying urban outskirts" happens in a vacuum. The "auric lagoon" and "puddle map" feel like floating magical concepts disconnected from the gritty reality implied by the "tyranny." Orientation is vague, serving as a backdrop rather than a constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is established, but descriptions are repetitive and generic ("radiant grotto," "prism atrium" repeated often). The environment does not constrain the character's choices or offer resources; it serves merely as a backdrop for the performance.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.0)
    The "ashen skyborne arbor" is an evocative concept but remains spatially vague; the reader cannot visualize the scale or mechanics of this world. Sensory details are repetitive (constant mentions of "moss," "grey," and "glinting") and do not constrain the protagonist's choices or deepen the atmosphere. The setting functions as a generic backdrop for the prompt elements rather than a lived-in environment.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=4.3)
    Settings like the "neglected greenhouse" and "subterranean waterfall" are visually distinct but function as generic backdrops rather than sources of constraint or pressure. The sensory details ("perfume of rot," "dim light") are functional but standard for the genre. The environments do not force the protagonist to adapt her tactics in a meaningful way.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    The atmospheric details of the "rain-washed foundry" and "thin, gray light" effectively mirror Elara's internal state. The setting actively supports the mood, though some descriptors feel like obligatory insertions (e.g., "factually mystical") rather than organic observations. The sensory environment is cohesive, focusing well on the cold/wet contrast with the forge's heat.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is established with generic descriptors ("whispering walls," "amplifying silence") that do not constrain the protagonist's choices. The environment serves as a passive backdrop rather than an active force that pressures the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest element; "glass-barked trees" and "violet light" create a cohesive, oppressive atmosphere. The sensory details effectively mirror the protagonist's internal "ultraviolet penance," though the environment remains largely static.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.8)
    The "alchemist's market" is described with standard fantasy markers ("glowing elixirs," "ozone") but does not constrain the protagonist's choices or tactics. The setting functions as a static backdrop rather than an active pressure, failing to integrate with the urgent need for "anchors."

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sensory details like the "sickly glow" and "buzzing" are functional but often generic, and the atmosphere relies on "told" adjectives ("sorrowful," "thick") rather than concrete particulars. While the specific dust patterns are a strong detail, the setting largely serves as a static backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.6)
    The "glass orchard" provides striking visual imagery ("knowledge hung like ripe fruit"), creating a cohesive atmosphere. However, the setting remains a static backdrop rather than an interactive environment that constrains the protagonist's tactical choices or creates physical obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.5)
    The concept of "visible time strands" and the mirror mechanic are imaginative and specific, grounding the fantasy elements well. However, much of the setting remains abstract ("ornate structures," "fragments of the past"), functioning as a backdrop for the thesis rather than a constraint on movement or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is established through abstract, "purple" descriptions ("symphony of potential," "oil and starlight") rather than grounded sensory details that constrain the character. The "resonance chamber" feels like a generic white room filled with magical jargon rather than a lived-in space. The environment does not exert pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.1)
    Atmospheric description is competent, though marred by clichés like "stone icicles" and "obsidian water." The setting is weakened by the verbatim repetition of the phrase "resonant hush," which breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory details are vivid ("salt grime," "ancient stone groaning"), and the setting is physically grounded. However, the atmosphere often tilts into purple prose ("oceanic violence"), and the specific prompt phrase "turbine-hum" feels forced into the natural landscape rather than organically integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is descriptive ("amber," "golden") but static; the "etched glass" mechanic is the only element that constrains attention. The environment generally serves as a backdrop for introspection rather than a source of pressure or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.4)
    The obsidian lagoon is described with some visual clarity ("sheet of black glass"), but the floating zeppelin library acts only as wallpaper without constraining action or providing tools. The setting details are largely static and do not evolve to pressure the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.1)
    Setting details are functional but rely on generic descriptors ("sustainable," "bustling workshops") rather than specific, lived-in sensory experience. The transformation of the cove is told in overview, distancing the reader from the texture of the environment. The "paper-lantern" imagery is consistent but static.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.3)
    The setting effectively grounds the narrative, with the "ancient orchard" atop a "skyscraper" providing a strong, specific contrast that supports the theme. The physical details of the garden and the phonograph are vivid, though the "foghorn" acts mostly as an atmospheric bookend.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "icebound atrium" is visualized with clear, if standard, fantasy imagery like "frosted thick" glass and "silver glow." While the setting provides a cohesive backdrop, it remains largely decorative and does not actively constrain the protagonist's movements or tactical options during the crisis. The sensory details are pleasant but static.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is functional but relies on generic descriptors ("windblown sanctuary," "stone parapets") that establish a backdrop rather than a pressure cooker. The environment does not actively constrain the protagonist's choices; it serves merely as a stage for the moral lesson.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=3.6)
    The setting is generic and lacks sensory specificity; terms like "pristine floors" and "station's dome" are placeholders that do not constrain action. The environment feels like a stage set for internal monologue rather than a lived-in space that pressures the character. Sensory details are abstract ("raw beauty," "celestial wonder") rather than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the "abandoned beekeeping oasis" offers potential, the setting remains a generic backdrop of "scorched wasteland" and "crumbling" ruins without distinct sensory specificity. The environment functions as a stage set rather than a pressure cooker, and details like the "contextual clues" are referenced abstractly rather than shown as concrete, tangible elements of the world.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.1)
    The "emerald silo" and "green metal" offer a basic visual anchor, but the setting is largely static and decorative. The environment does not pressure the character or constrain choices; it functions merely as a backdrop for the exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.2)
    Setting details are vivid but purely ornamental, serving as a postcard backdrop ("cobalt lagoon," "deep, vibrant blue") rather than constraining action. The environment functions as a mood board rather than a physical space that forces trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting details ("living stone pillars," "temple orchard") are evocative but remain somewhat static and concept-heavy. The environment acts as a backdrop for the summary rather than a pressure cooker that constrains Elara's choices. Sensory details like "hummed with a low, ancient energy" border on generic fantasy tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.0)
    Atmospheric details like the "rainwashed tower" and "motes of dust" effectively establish a reverent tone. However, the setting operates largely as a static backdrop for the ritual rather than offering constraints or resources that force adaptation. The sensory environment is vivid but does not sufficiently pressure the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is visually established with some competent imagery ("thin finger of stone"), but often relies on telling rather than sensory immersion ("narrow vastness" is labeled, not felt). The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.5)
    The scrapyard setting is established with some vivid, if occasionally purple, imagery ("eviscerated train cars"). However, the environment functions mostly as a backdrop until the final exit; it rarely constrains Baron's actions during the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is established through generic sci-fi tropes and repetitive adjectives ("dead machinery," "echoed silence") rather than concrete interaction. The concept of time dilation is asserted as "temporally stretched air" but does not constrain the protagonist's actions or perception in a specific, mechanical way.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.6)
    Setting details like the "violet smears" and "blue ice" provide a coherent visual backdrop but remain largely decorative. The environment does not constrain the protagonist’s tactics or force adaptation; the spire is a passive stage rather than an active pressure on the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the "whispering gallery" mechanics are functional, the setting is rendered through high-level abstractions ("luminous absence," "echoes of old power") that lack sensory friction or concrete grounding. The "interregnum" remains a vague atmospheric concept rather than a specific temporal anchor that pressures the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is established with generic fantasy tropes ("forgotten books whispered") rather than specific, tactile details that constrain choice. The environment serves as a static backdrop for the summary rather than an active force.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting is generic ("silent streets," "stone pedestal") and relies on the repeated prompt phrase "woven hush" instead of sensory specificity. The "time-frozen" nature of the village is told but does not mechanically constrain the character's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "Canyon of Endless Echoes" and "towers of bone" provide a vivid, atmospheric backdrop that supports the theme well. The sensory details of sound and mist are effective, though the setting functions largely as a static stage for the monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.1)
    The acid sea provides effective physical constraints (corrosion, breath holding) that pressure the action. However, the "gears-and-cogs" workshop description relies on generic steampunk markers rather than unique, lived-in details.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is functional but relies on generic coastal signifiers ("crying gulls," "sea's breath") and standard "hidden cave" tropes ("light filtered... like fleeting dreams"). While the environment is established, it serves as a passive backdrop for internal monologue rather than a source of tactile friction or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is vivid, particularly the olfactory details of the garden and the visual of the cobalt lighthouse. However, the descriptions occasionally drift into pathetic fallacy ("lighthouse... seemed to sigh") and the environment functions more as a backdrop than a source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the "patina bronze censer foot" offers a specific visual anchor, the station itself reads as a generic "white room" with convenient resources ("bits of scrap") appearing on demand. The setting functions as a backdrop for the metaphor rather than a tangible place that pressures choices.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the ravine and storm are necessary for the lightning ritual. The physical grounding of the "gnarled branches" and "terrace shelves" effectively constrains the action.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is atmospheric but generic ("mist," "sea's whisper," "gleaming like a pearl") and functions as a backdrop rather than a constraint. "Nautical twilight" is used as a recurring marker but does not impose a specific time pressure or visibility constraint on the action. The environment does not force choices; Elias moves through it without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.5)
    The "blooming cavern" and "rising creek" provide concrete, atmospheric constraints that pressure the character's movement. Specific details like the "17th-century atlas" and the "matrix chip" ground the fantasy in the character's trade.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=3.9)
    Spatial logic is confused; the nesting of the "ember grotto" within the "cobalt grotto" is unclear. Descriptions lean heavily on generic fantasy tropes ("eyes as old as the mountains," "liquid mercury") rather than specific, grounding sensory details that constrain the character.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is established through visual abstractions ("soft, dying light," "swirling colors") rather than tactile, grounding details. The "ember nexus" lacks spatial definition or specific constraints that affect movement or choice. Tools like the "palette of resolve" feel like ornamental props rather than integrated parts of a working world.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.4)
    Specific props like the birch bark and charred stick effectively ground the scene in a tactile reality. Conversely, atmospheric descriptions often lean on stock phrases ("silence so profound," "broken teeth," "bruised sky") which blunts the sensory impact.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is atmospheric but generic ("cave of ticking shadows," "windows beaded with condensation"). While the water clock elements are mentioned, they function as set dressing rather than constraints that shape the action. The environment feels static and does not exert pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting is established ("floating tea ceremony platform"), but descriptions often veer into generic fantasy abstractions ("ancient magic," "impending storm") rather than concrete, tactile details that constrain choice. The environment functions largely as a pathetic fallacy mirroring the protagonist's mood rather than a distinct place with resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.4)
    The atmosphere of the archive and the "profound hush" of the orchard is evocative and anchors the scene well. However, the "dew-like script" on the petal pushes the specific reality of the setting into stylized whimsy that clashes with the established "medical device" grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting relies on generic "ancient" tropes (dust, scrolls, darkness) without specific, lived-in details that constrain the character. While the "softcover dictionary" offers a brief tactile anchor, the surrounding environment is vague and abstract ("ceiling lost to darkness," "unseen source").

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting ("horizon measurement station," "granite outcrop") is described with generic adjectives ("intricate," "peculiar") and functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraints or resources. While the "hydraulic clock" concept is distinct, the sensory details are repetitive ("razor edges" appears four times in different contexts) and fail to ground the scene in a specific, tactile reality that influences the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.4)
    The bioluminescent farm provides a vivid visual backdrop, but the setting operates largely as wallpaper rather than a source of constraint or tactical resources. While the "permeable barriers" are mentioned, the specific physics of the environment do not force difficult trade-offs in the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.4)
    The use of a candle lantern on a modern subway creates a significant verisimilitude break that is not addressed by the text's tone. While the library setting is functional, the descriptions remain generic ("serene," "cool air") and do not constrain the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.7)
    The atmospheric interplay of the subterranean setting and the specific, tactile "glass harmonica" is the story's strongest asset, grounding the fable-like tone. However, the environment remains largely a backdrop; the "utility tunnel" does not exert physical pressure or constrain Leo’s tactics in a way that forces a unique choice.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.1)
    Sensory details are functional but generic ("white petals," "salt-tinged air," "cry of gulls"), serving as passive decoration rather than constraining action. The setting does not force the character to adapt her tactics; the jetty is merely a stage for the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is atmospheric, with "crumbling brick arches" and "chaotic greenery" providing a solid backdrop for the fable-like tone. However, the environment serves mostly as a static container for the dialogue rather than actively constraining choices or offering tools that shape the outcome. The personification of the ivy "seeming to listen" leans heavily into pathetic fallacy.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ultrasonic forest and "psychic dew" create a distinct, synesthetic atmosphere that grounds the abstract quest. However, reliance on intangible descriptions ("ghostly understanding," "vibration in the earth") sometimes distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.3)
    The "dried-up pen" serves as an effective, tactile anchor in an otherwise abstract environment. However, the anomaly itself is described with generic sci-fi shorthand ("warped space," "impossible curves") rather than specific, novel sensory details that constrain the character's physical actions.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting relies heavily on visual clichés ("liquid silver," "moonbeams kissed the water") and abstract metaphors ("tapestry of music") rather than grounded, tactile details. The environment feels like a generic stage backdrop for the dialogue, lacking specific constraints or sensory textures beyond the visual.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting acts as a generic backdrop of "dust-laden corridors" without constraining the protagonist's tactical choices. Sensory details are standard ("crumbling walls," "silent air") and do not create a distinct atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting consists of high-concept adjectives ("ethereal gold," "luminous, depthless") that lack tactile grounding or constraint. The environment acts as a passive backdrop for the light show rather than a physical space that pressures the character's choices. There is no sense of specific spatial choreography or sensory limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=5.6)
    The atmospheric setup of the geomagnetic storm and container labyrinth is serviceable and visually clear. However, the setting feels generic ("steel canyon," "emerald pulses") and lacks the specific, lived-in texture that would ground the fantastical elements in a tangible reality.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.1)
    The interplay between the dental mirror, the shutters, and the water provides a specific, tangible geometry that grounds the scene. However, descriptors like "spiralingly calm" and "stillwater tension" are abstract moods imposed on the setting rather than sensory details derived from it. The cobalt dock is established, but the atmosphere relies too heavily on abstract adjectives.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.8)
    The "cobalt library" and "magnetic grotto" are described with heavy ornamentation ("shimmering like deep ocean") that creates a generic fantasy aesthetic. While vivid, the setting functions more as a backdrop than a source of constraint or pressure on the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting is functional, utilizing the required "sublittoral fringe" and "docks," but lacks sensory specificity that would constrain the character's choices. The "Great Pacification" is a compelling concept left as background exposition rather than a physical reality that alters how the docks operate or how characters interact.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=4.2)
    Setting details rely on familiar dystopian tropes ("shadows... like bars") and abstract interpretations ("sound of nature suppressed") rather than concrete, tactile interaction. The environment provides atmospheric window dressing but fails to exert specific physical pressure or constrain the character’s tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting (cobalt atrium, frozen lake) provides some distinct visual imagery, though the "lantern-moth hush" repeats without deepening. The environment dissolves conveniently in response to the protagonist's will, lacking the tangible resistance or friction that characterizes a lived-in world. Specificity is often undermined by abstract explanatory labels.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting features generic fantasy descriptors ("shimmering glass," "living tapestries") that lack sensory specificity, particularly for a POV focused on texture and form. While the "cracked glass fountain" offers a glimpse of concrete detail, the "labyrinth" remains abstract and does not constrain the protagonist's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting contains specific sensory details like "silvery disks" and "crystalline alloy," establishing a clear atmosphere. However, the specific phrase "golden shadows" is repeated six times in a short space, turning a potentially evocative detail into a repetitive drone that dulls the reader's immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "timeless observatory" provides a distinct backdrop, but the setting details often feel like static set dressing rather than constraints that shape choice. Specific elements like the "dusty table" and "velvet curtains" are functional but generic. The setting does not exert pressure on the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.7)
    The setting is established with sensory details like "rain-beaded," but it remains a static backdrop that does not constrain the character's actions. The environment fails to evolve with the narrative pressure, serving only as atmospheric window dressing.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=3.4)
    The setting consists of generic fantasy tropes ("bronze prism pagoda," "ancient stones," "dust") that do not constrain the character's actions or shape the outcome. The physical space feels like a backdrop rather than a tangible environment affecting the ritual's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting blends ethereal fantasy ("blooming library," "crystalline shelves") with tech ("video footage") competently but relies on familiar tropes without distinct specificity. The imagery is vivid but safe, and the "dusk" atmosphere feels static until the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.0)
    The atmosphere is effectively established with "mist," "stars," and "shimmering stillness," creating a consistent mood. While the workshop details are somewhat generic, the specific focus on the chameleon and its injury grounds the scene, though the descriptions occasionally lean into heavy-handed "literary" adjectives.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sensory details regarding the damp earth and the ivy are vivid and grounding. However, the "quiet tower" setting remains somewhat generic, lacking specific orientation in time or space (e.g., era, location) that would raise the stakes or groundedness of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is atmospheric ("dust-moted silence") but largely ornamental; it does not constrain action or force choices. The "spatial" description overlays the physical space rather than utilizing it to create obstacles or opportunities for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=2.7)
    Setting details are generic high-fantasy tropes ("aurora-lit archway," "velvety darkness") that fail to constrain action or ground the reader in a specific physical reality. The sensory experience is filtered through abstract adjectives rather than concrete, tactile interaction with the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=4.7)
    While imagery like the "glowing dune" is visually distinct, the setting fails to pressure the protagonist's choices; her ability to be "occasionally everywhere" renders geography and travel constraints irrelevant. The environment serves as a passive backdrop for the "healing" plot rather than an active force that demands adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting is visually distinct with "interlocking brass plates" and "mercury waterfalls," but functions largely as a "museum tour" rather than a source of pressure. While the description is vivid, the environment offers no resistance; the protagonist navigates it effortlessly, and the "translocation" bypasses the terrain entirely rather than forcing an engagement with it.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting consists of generic fantasy signifiers ("mist-shrouded," "ancient," "pines like sentinels") that provide mood but do not constrain the character's tactics. The "ridgeway" is described in standard terms without specific, sensory details that would ground the allegory in a lived reality.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is established with some evocative imagery ("cobalt fortress," "blue-metal walls"), anchoring the atmosphere effectively. However, the description often leans on abstract adjectives ("implacable," "relentless") rather than concrete sensory details that Elian interacts with directly. The specific physical anchors—the bolt, the dusty step—are the strongest elements, grounding the otherwise ethereal environment.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.3)
    The setting is rendered through high-fantasy clichés ("shelves curved like sleeping dragons") rather than tactile details that constrain the character. While atmospheric, the environment serves as a passive backdrop rather than an active force shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.7)
    The setting is competently drawn with sensory details like "salt air" and "mechanical tendrils," though some phrasing leans toward cliché. While the atlas page serves as a good prop, the environment functions mostly as a backdrop rather than a pressure cooker that constrains Kaelen's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is functional but generic, relying on standard tropes of dusty ruins and shadows without sensory specificity that constrains the character. The introduction of &quot;ancient stones&quot; into a spaceport is a jarring juxtaposition that feels like a prompt insertion rather than an integrated part of the world’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting features standard fantasy descriptors ("warm mist," "glowing moss") that serve as a passive backdrop rather than a pressure cooker for choices. While the geothermal elements are mentioned, they do not constrain Elara's tactics or force trade-offs in the moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting is functional but depicted through somewhat generic, postcard-like descriptions ("wind whispered," "salt-scorched earth"). While the arboretum and lighthouse serve as adequate metaphors for the theme ("endurance mirrored her own slow healing"), they lack the specific, tactile details that would make the environment feel lived-in or constraining to the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting provides a cohesive, albeit heavy-handed, atmosphere ("salt of the sea," "groaning stone") that supports the mood. However, the "forgotten library" functions primarily as a static backdrop for introspection rather than a physical space that constraints the character's tactics or forces interaction with concrete objects beyond the cards.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.0)
    Descriptions are vivid but rely heavily on standard adjective-noun pairings ("bruised purple," "frozen waves"). The setting functions primarily as an atmospheric backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure on the protagonist's choices. The "crisis" (a distant landslide) feels abstract and disconnected from the immediate environment.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=3.0)
    The setting consists of generic descriptors ("echoing," "vast," "frozen") that act as a backdrop rather than a constraint on action. The "cryogenic" and "library" aspects are nominal; they do not force specific tactical choices or offer distinct sensory details beyond standard tropes of cold and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=3.6)
    The setting relies on generic descriptors ("chaos," "glass-domed enclosure") without sensory specificity or atmospheric density. The environment acts as a static container rather than a source of constraints or resources that shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.3)
    The "sound wave garden" offers vivid, surreal imagery ("audible ripples shaped themselves into floral forms") that grounds the fantasy elements well. However, the setting primarily functions as a backdrop for the action rather than an active force that constrains choices beyond the need to "zigzag." The atmosphere is consistent but lacks the tactile specificity to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    The observatory setting is vivid and purposeful, creating a strong atmospheric contrast between the "uncaring stars" above and the "crypt of newsprint" below. The rosewood pen nib serves as an effective tactile anchor, bridging the empire's history with the protagonist's modern agency.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is atmospheric but ungrounded, relying on abstract metaphors ("meteor hush," "folding time") rather than sensory specifics. The "laboratory" lacks spatial coherence, functioning more as a container for concepts than a physical space where characters interact with constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.5)
    While details like the chalk and sand are tactile, the setting relies heavily on the pathetic fallacy, with the mist's color shifting from "lilac unease" to "lavender clarity" to mirror emotions. The "Unlearning" remains a vague abstraction that fails to impose specific, physical constraints on the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting contains specific elements like the "minaret mosaic tessera," but the atmosphere relies on the repeated oxymoron "warm coldness" which loses impact through redundancy. The physical environment (ancient plaza) is largely static and serves as a backdrop for internal monologue rather than a pressure cooker for action.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.3)
    The setting is vivid but largely ornamental, leaning heavily on "purple" descriptors ("moonlit fruits," "silver apples," "weeping violets") that decorate the scene rather than constraining action. While the "mystic orchard" is established, the geography is fluid and bends instantly to the protagonist's will ("trees bending to form a natural proscenium"), reducing the environment to a passive backdrop rather than a source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is established with functional nouns ("camera," "LED wand," "pedestal") but lacks sensory depth or atmospheric pressure. The environment feels like a sterile stage for the action rather than a lived-in space that constrains or influences the protagonist's choices. The description focuses on visual abstractions ("swirling colors") rather than concrete, grounding details.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.1)
    Setting details are largely generic ("labyrinthine," "soft, golden light") and serve as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint. The "factually mystical" nature of the cave is told to the reader rather than shown through sensory evidence that affects the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting of the amber warehouse is atmospheric and the specific detail of the fossilized insect button grounds the abstract magic well. However, the environment functions mostly as a container for the props rather than a source of constraint or pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=3.4)
    The setting is rendered through melodramatic abstraction ("mist coiling... like forgotten secrets") rather than concrete, sensory grounding. The environment feels like a generic backdrop; the "silver hush" and "peculiar formation" lack the specificity needed to make the location feel real or dangerous.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is functional but generic ("fog-bound river," "abandoned shack") and relies on "telling" the atmosphere ("spindrift serenity") rather than evoking it through sensory particulars. The environment does not constrain the character’s choices beyond the imposed waiting period.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.6)
    The juxtaposition of an "abandoned" oasis with "chimney smoke" creates spatial confusion—is the smoke local or distant? If distant, its connection to the local timeline break is unclear. While some sensory details work ("dry as bone"), abstract descriptions ("fractured nature of time") often replace concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting is atmospherically consistent but generic ("sheet of silver," "mossy patches"). While visually clear, the environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint or resources that forces specific tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is imaginative ("books floating," "obsidian pedestal") but operates merely as a backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure. The "tidal forces" and "air currents" are described but do not affect Elara's movement or choices. The descriptions drift into abstraction rather than grounding the scene in sensory specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory details like the "sodden path" and "white petals glistened" create a cohesive visual atmosphere. However, the setting remains largely decorative; the "lotus temple" functions as a static backdrop rather than an environment that constrains choice or forces adaptation. The "prismatic quiet" acts more as a mood label than a palpable, lived-in condition.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "waterfall display" and "humming consoles" provide adequate grounding in the radio station. However, the atmosphere often relies on abstract adjectives ("ethereal," "otherworldly") rather than concrete sensory details that would heighten the pressure. The setting serves as a backdrop rather than an active constraint on the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is abstract and generic ("walls shifted," "floors curved") with little sensory specificity beyond visual warping. The environment feels like a placeholder for the concept of "spatial mutiny" rather than a lived-in space that constrains the protagonist's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.5)
    The atmospheric details of the quarry ("mist clung," "wet stone") are competent and set a moody tone, though they remain somewhat generic. The setting serves as a backdrop for internal reflection rather than providing physical constraints or obstacles that force specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting is sketched in broad, functional strokes ("skeletal structure," "thin, charged air") without sensory texture or grounding. The deep-sea sequence lacks basic physical plausibility, ignoring the decay of wood and metal to serve the plot's convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting (mountain pullout) is established, but the details often serve as metaphors (fence as a diagram) rather than a grounded physical reality. While the "scaffold wrap" is a specific visual, the environment acts more as a stage for the epiphany than a constraint on the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting provides a functional backdrop with some sensory detail ("faded lion," "broken boards"), but the "territorial markers" operate more as convenient plot devices than grounded constraints. The atmosphere relies on stated mood ("stillness so complete") rather than environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.1)
    The observatory is described with generic cues ("lonely peak," "humming") that function as a passive backdrop rather than constraining choices; the setting fails to exert pressure on the action.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.6)
    The sensory details are vivid ("froth of petals," "ozone and rotting fruit"), but the setting lacks functional pressure. The "flesh-eating plant seeds" are explicitly described as "dormant," negating the immediate threat and turning the environment into a passive backdrop rather than an active constraint. The "vortex" pulls at her cloak but does not force tactical changes.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "cobalt glade" provides a basic atmospheric anchor, but the setting dissolves into abstraction quickly. The "future arrived early" is a fascinating temporal constraint that is told rather than shown through specific environmental details or physics. The glade feels like a static backdrop for a ritual rather than a pressure cooker forcing choices.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "catacomb orchard" provides a vivid, atmospheric backdrop with strong specific imagery (roots, femurs, ribs). However, the setting functions primarily as a static stage set rather than a dynamic environment that forces specific tactical choices; the "half-lit glow" and "ancient remains" paint a mood but do not constrain the protagonist's physical options.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.2)
    The "dusty quarry office trailer" is established but operates as a generic container; the connection between an antiques appraiser and a quarry is unexplained and unused. The setting does not constrain the protagonist's choices or pressurize the action.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.4)
    The magnetic arbor provides a distinct visual backdrop that integrates well with the plot's central analogy (magnetism/spirit). However, sensory details often lean into generic fantasy tropes ("pulsating seed," "metallic vines") rather than specific, grounded textures that constrain the character's movement.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.8)
    The "tidal atrium" and "titan-gears" provide vivid, atmospheric imagery, but the setting operates as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint. The environment does not force the protagonist to adapt his tactics or make trade-offs, leaving the "lived-in" quality superficial.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=4.4)
    The setting is functional but relies on generic tropes ("living rock," "natural throne") that facilitate the plot rather than constraining it. While sensory details like the "chime of distant water" are present, the environment feels like a standard fantasy backdrop that does not exert specific pressure on the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established with vivid, albeit heavy-handed, imagery ("green shroud," "bleeding with sunset"). While the atmosphere is coherent, the environment functions as a passive backdrop for projection rather than a source of resistance or specific constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.0)
    The setting is a generic abstraction ("swirling mists," "glowing library") lacking sensory specificity or tactile grounding. The environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices; it serves merely as a backdrop for the abstract explanation of the cipher mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "Velvet Observatory" is a vivid, atmospheric setting that provides sensory contrast (heat vs. ice, velvet vs. sound). The environment actively pressures the ice violin, making the setting integral to the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is visually described with adjectives but fails to constrain action or choice; the "skyborne grotto" provides atmosphere but no physical obstacles. The physics of the cloud environment are decorative rather than tactical. Sensory details rely heavily on sight and abstract energy rather than grounded, tactile interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is described with generic fantasy tropes ("ethereal mosses," "misty expanse") that lack tactile specificity. The "vineyard hush" descriptor clashes logically with the grotto environment and feels inserted by force. Spatial choreography is vague; the transition from climbing a tree to carving stone lacks grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is established but functions as a generic backdrop for the allegory rather than exerting pressure on the characters. Sensory details like the "breezy lighthouse" are functional but lack the specificity to constrain choices or ground the fable.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "magnetic grotto" effectively constrains the physical experience of the trance and adds a specific texture to the "dissolution" beat. However, the "floating rock" setting is a standard genre staple that doesn't uniquely pressure the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.1)
    While "towers of bone" is an evocative image, the setting is largely static and serves only as an amplifier for the plot's needs rather than a source of constraint. The phrase "centuries of layered dust" is repeated verbatim multiple times, reducing the setting to a tagline rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.1)
    Setting details are present but largely abstract ("brilliant dimness," "sacred light") and fail to exert pressure on the character's choices. The "automated clamor" is mentioned but never manifested in the scene to create genuine atmospheric tension or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.1)
    Description relies on clichés ("practiced hand," "frozen in time") rather than specific sensory grounding. The physics of an "air-filled chamber" accessible by free-diving a deep submerged wreck break suspension of disbelief and lower the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.0)
    The "ambered observatory deck" is established visually but remains a static backdrop that does not constrain the protagonist's choices. While the atmosphere is described ("stellar doubt"), it functions as a declared mood rather than a sensory reality that pressures the character. The setting details are generic ("void," "obsidian table") and lack specific, lived-in texture.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.4)
    The observatory setting is atmospheric, utilizing prisms and dust motes well to support the central image. However, descriptors like "bruised purple" rely on familiar tropes, and the space feels more like a static backdrop for the ritual than a tactile environment that constrains the character.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is established with visual descriptions ("sapphire viaduct," "crystalline structure") but functions only as a passive stage. The environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices or push back against his efforts, leaving the atmosphere static.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=3.1)
    Setting details are generic ("bustling street," "market square," "soft, dusky light") and do not constrain the protagonist's choices. The environment serves as a passive backdrop for the theme rather than an active force that exerts pressure on the levee warden.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is described with generic, adjective-heavy prose ("kaleidoscopic," "prismatic") that creates a postcard effect rather than a tactile environment. The "kaleidoscopic waterfall" and "ancient freshness" are repeated verbatim, reducing their impact. The environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "nocturnal arbor" provides a distinct visual backdrop, but descriptors often veer into decorative, abstract territory ("distant rumor," "vacuum of silence") rather than grounding the reader in sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.1)
    The floating rock dojo is a generic fantasy backdrop that offers no specific constraints to the action. The "rewriting history" element functions as atmospheric wallpaper rather than a tactical hazard that forces difficult choices or alters the environment meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is established with generic descriptors ("mossy stone," "damp earth," "tranquil night") that do not constrain the character or shape the action. The environment serves as a passive backdrop for reflection rather than an active element of the narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.2)
    The echo chamber tunnel is established with some sensory detail ("curved, resonant space"), but the "household" remains an abstraction, distancing the stakes. The setting serves as a functional stage for the ritual but lacks the granular materiality that would ground the surreal premise.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=2.5)
    The setting comprises generic placeholders ("frozen garden," "mist") that fail to constrain action or provide sensory grounding. The environment functions as a vague metaphorical backdrop rather than a physical space with distinct rules or geography.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting description ("vast, bowl-shaped depression," "violet and charcoal") is functional but leans on generic fantasy tropes without specific sensory anchoring that constrains the character. The environment provides "golden light" as a convenient magical solution rather than acting as a source of friction or distinct atmosphere. The reagents (powdered silver, rose quartz) read like a standard checklist rather than materials grounded in a specific world logic.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.4)
    Visuals of the "silent antennas" and "rusted grating" effectively ground the high-concept premise. However, atmosphere relies heavily on the repetitive telling of the "serenely electric" descriptor rather than sensory evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting provides some functional imagery (light beams, dark water), but relies on generic descriptors like "spectral" and "void." The environment feels like a static backdrop for the puzzle rather than a pressure cooker that constrains the character's options. "Clocks ran sideways" reads as a prompt insertion rather than an integrated atmospheric rule.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting consists of generic surreal descriptors ("walls shifted," "floors curved") that fail to constrain the protagonist's physical movements or tactical choices in a tangible way.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.0)
    The benthic setting is vivid and thematically integrated, effectively contrasting the abyssal pressure with the holographic stars. The sensory details ("living coral," "translucent corridors") ground the scene well, though the interaction with the environment is mostly navigational rather than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting consists of atmospheric clichés ("ethereal light," "shifting shadows") that do not constrain the protagonist's choices. While the "mist" is present, it acts as a passive backdrop rather than an active force or tool that shapes tactics. The sensory details are often abstract ("chill of twilight") rather than concrete and grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is functional, though the logic of "dust" on a control panel in a facility with walls shifting to mist and water pressure concerns is wobbly. The description relies on standard sci-fi ruin tropes without distinct, sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting feels like a "white room" with isolated props; the "opal observatory" and "spilled ink" are visually described but lack spatial grounding or functional interaction. The environment does not constrain the character's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is atmospheric and integral to the plot, with the acoustic properties of the canyon constraining the protagonist's actions. However, specific descriptors lean on familiar tropes ("silent witness," "sky the color of dried blood") which dulls the potential for unique sensory specificity in a story about texture and sound.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is described with abstract adjectives ("strange blossoms," "ancient and new") rather than concrete sensory details that ground the reader. While the "gravitationally playful" element is mentioned, it functions as set dressing rather than a constraint that forces the protagonist to adapt his physical actions. The environment feels like a backdrop rather than a participant in the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=3.5)
    Setting details are generic fantasy tropes ("pulsating crystal," "gears and wires") that serve as window dressing rather than constraints. The environment fails to exert pressure on the protagonist's choices; the "Enchanted Orchard" is a passive backdrop waiting to be fixed, lacking specific, lived-in texture.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting anchors the scene but consists of generic dystopian markers ("neon signs unlit," "faded pinball machine") that do not constrain the character's tactics. The "cobalt" lighting and "brittle hush" function as atmospheric decoration rather than pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.6)
    While the atmosphere is cohesive, the setting relies heavily on "abandoned carnival" clichés (rotting velvet, skeletal oak, peeling paint) rather than specific, fresh observation. The "misting hush" functions as a repetitive atmospheric marker rather than a dynamic environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting offers vivid imagery ("stained-glass atoms") but remains an atmospheric backdrop that does not constrain the character's choices. The environment feels dreamlike and malleable rather than a physical space with distinct rules or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.5)
    While visually distinct ("moss-covered jetty," "streaks of gold"), the setting serves primarily as a static, decorative backdrop. The "murmuring secrets" provide atmosphere but do not constrain the protagonist's choices or force tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=2.8)
    The setting is a classic "white room" disguised by high-concept adjectives ("shadowed nexus," "cosmic possibility") that fail to ground the reader in a concrete physical space. Sensory details are limited to visual abstractions (light, shadow, mist) without texture, smell, or spatial logic. The environment does not constrain the character's choices; it merely provides a backdrop for the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific imagery ("sweet rot of apples," "skeletal hulls"). However, the spatial logic is slightly list-like, and the environment serves more as an atmospheric backdrop than a source of physical obstacles or constraints that force tactical changes.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.5)
    The sensory details of the shard's "permanent slice of fading light" and the "lonely rhythm" of the swing effectively anchor the atmosphere. The physical environment actively pressures the Archivist's nerves, integrating setting with character state.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on generic high-fantasy descriptors ("verdant," "luminescent," "ethereal") that do not constrain the protagonist's actions or choices. The parapet and waterfall serve as a static backdrop rather than an interactive environment that shapes the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is visually established with "crystalline walls" and "starlight," but relies on generic high-fantasy aesthetic markers ("glimmered," "refracting"). The "fisherman's net" smelling of salt provides a brief tactile anchor, but the environment mostly serves as a passive backdrop rather than pressuring choices.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=3.5)
    Setting details are delivered through the verbatim repetition of the phrase "rain-scoured fresco vault" (five times) rather than varied sensory exploration. The environment functions as a passive backdrop that yields instantly to the protagonist's tool, failing to constrain choice or generate atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.4)
    The sunken library is atmospherically described ("shelves stood like skeletons"), but the physical reality breaks suspension of disbelief; a working speaker and bold ink after decades underwater undercut the setting's credibility. The sensory details often lean into purple abstraction ("aqueous silence") rather than grounding the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is atmospherically consistent but relies on generic fantasy tropes ("misty courtyard," "ancient machinery") without distinct, grounding details. The spatial relationship between the character, the bench, and the storm is vague, treating the environment as a mood board rather than a physical space that constrains action.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is described with decorative adjectives ("brass," "icebound," "prismatic") but remains an ornamental backdrop rather than a source of constraint. The cold and altitude do not impact Elara's physical state or choices. The environment functions as a passive container for the reading scene rather than an active force.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.1)
    Setting details are generic ("thin air," "cumulus," "stratus") and do not constrain the character's choices. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the cataloging action rather than a source of pressure. Physics are waived (writing in a journal while drifting into thin air) without establishing a specific atmospheric logic.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting of the hollowed tree library is evocative and tactile, grounding the story effectively. The atmosphere of "profound hush" and impending destruction is well-maintained and pressures the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting consists of generic steampunk tropes ("brass fittings", "creaking timbers") that act as wallpaper rather than constraints. While the murmurations provide a visual anchor, the environment does not pressure the character's choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is visually described but inert; the "frozen library" offers no physical constraints (the cold does not affect her dexterity), serving as a passive backdrop rather than a pressure cooker. The imagery is occasionally incoherent, such as "driftwood nostalgia" appearing in a high-altitude glacial environment.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "orchard planet" and "floating rock arches" offer some visual interest, but the setting lacks tactile interaction. The "nebula of respite" is an abstract concept that functions as a Deus Ex Machina rather than a grounded element of the world.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies heavily on repeated abstract phrases like "pane of hush" rather than concrete, tactile interaction. While the lighthouse and clock are visualized, they serve as static backdrops for the ritual rather than dynamic environments that constrain the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the "gnarled trees" and "mechanical birds" creating a solid gothic backdrop. The sensory details of the orchard and the frost effectively ground the reader, though the "labyrinth" itself remains somewhat abstract beyond the cliffside interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting serves as a passive container for symbolic harvesting (chrysalis, foam) rather than a source of constraint or pressure. Sensory details are generic ("wet stone," "damp soil") and do not reflect a scientist's specific POV until the explicit mention of surfactants, which feels like an expository insert. The environment does not force choices; it merely provides answers.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.8)
    The "glass orchard" and "frozen dew" provide a cohesive, if generic, high-fantasy aesthetic that anchors the scene visually. However, the setting behaves largely as a static backdrop (a "white room" with clouds) rather than an environment that pressures choices or constrains the protagonist's physical actions.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=3.8)
    The forced inclusion of "tidal pool formations" in a desert courtyard breaks immersion and logic. While the fortress setting is established, the prompt-driven elements clash with the environment rather than deepening it.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting is established with atmospheric descriptors ("stone belly," "borrowed starlight") but remains static and scenic rather than constraining. The physical environment of the tower and the concept of "silos" function as backdrops and metaphors rather than tactile realities that force specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=3.6)
    The setting is rendered through generic, "ethereal" adjectives ("ancient rock formations," "shimmering echoes") that fail to ground the scene in physical reality. The environment provides no friction or resources; the moon and canyon serve merely as a passive backdrop for the internal light show. Sensory details are abstract and visual-heavy, lacking the tactile specificity that would make the "quaking" felt.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.1)
    While the gravity inversion offers a functional spatial mechanic, the setting relies on generic fantasy markers ("perpetual mist," "pulsing nodes") rather than sensory specificity. The environment acts as a passive backdrop for the character's transit rather than an active source of pressure or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.8)
    The description of the porcelain insulator and its stress cracks is specific and vivid, grounding the story's abstraction. However, the grove itself relies on clichés ("cathedral of stillness," "silent sentinels") and the atmosphere is marred by the repetitive insertion of the phrase "intensely quiet." The setting functions as a backdrop rather than a source of pressure or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.2)
    Setting descriptions are abstract summaries ("humming with invisible forces," "stark landscape") that fail to ground the scene in sensory reality. The magnetic nexus serves as a generic plot device rather than a distinct, pressure-exerting environment that constrains the character.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is a generic collection of "workshop" tropes (dusty windows, strange devices) that never constrains the protagonist's tactical options. The sensory details are broad and functional, lacking the specificity needed to ground the abstract themes.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.2)
    Sensory details like "wet stone and ozone" work well, but the setting often feels like a generic backdrop for the moral. The clinical description of the protagonist as "olfactorily sensitive" distances the reader from the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.1)
    The inversion setting is visualized clearly with specific sensory details ("silver ribbon," "glowing moss") that ground the high-concept physics. The environment actively constrains movement, though the "whirling silence" refrain leans slightly toward purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.1)
    The physical logic of the container labyrinth creating wind vortices is the story's strongest element, grounding the crash in specific environmental causality. However, sensory descriptions often lean on clichés ("silence... thick blanket," "metallic canyon") rather than fresh, POV-specific details.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting relies on abstract labels like "sculpted hush" and "domain of sculpted hush" rather than concrete, sensory details that constrain the character. While the imagery is consistent with high fantasy, it remains generic ("shimmering facets," "golden translucence") and does not create atmospheric pressure or tactile grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting consists of generic high-fantasy tropes ("memory of every storm," "light bent like liquid") that fail to constrain the character's choices. While the "thunder-echo range" is named, the environment acts as a passive backdrop rather than an active pressure on the narrative. The sensory details are often abstract metaphors rather than concrete, grounded particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is integral and functions as a ticking clock; the fading stars visually map the story's progression, creating a tight "liminal space." The topaz workshop provides a distinct, atmospheric container that grounds the abstract magical operations effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.0)
    The ridgeway and aurora provide a functional, atmospheric backdrop but remain static, never constraining the protagonist's tactics or forcing a trade-off. The setting serves as a stage for the dialogue rather than an active force that interacts with the relic or the pendant's mechanics in a consequential way.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting feels like a stage set with props listed to satisfy requirements rather than an immersive environment. "Mist-shrouded" and "crystalline structures" are generic descriptors that lack sensory specificity, and the spatial relationship between the arbor and the car is underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting suffers from a jarring tonal clash between the high-fantasy "skeletal sentinels" and the mundane, modern "rummage sale box." This incongruity undermines the atmospheric intent of the "raveling silence" and pulls the reader out of the story’s reality.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=4.1)
    Setting details like "floating rock arches" and "shimmering silk" are generic fantasy tropes that serve as passive backdrops rather than constraining constraints. The environment does not pressure the protagonist or shape tactical decisions in a specific moment.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established with standard genre descriptors ("derelict starship skeletons," "gloom") that lack unique sensory specificity despite the protagonist's profession. The "sensory map maker" premise promises a unique textural experience but delivers mostly visual and auditory abstractions ("murmur," "hum," "luminescence").

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is established with decent sensory details like the "tidal polish" of the glass. However, atmospheric descriptions occasionally veer into abstraction ("luminescent ache") rather than grounding the supernatural elements in concrete, visceral experience.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the lighthouse imagery is consistent, the setting feels generic and unlived-in, functioning more as a backdrop for keywords than a constraint. The "age after the last print newspaper" is stated as a timeline marker but lacks concrete physical or social texture in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is picturesque but functions largely as a static backdrop; the "floating rock" and "valley mist" provide atmosphere but do not constrain the character's choices or tactics. The environment is observed rather than navigated or utilized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=4.2)
    Setting details are generic ("vast, green maze," "silver light") and act as a passive backdrop rather than constraining the character's options. The "labyrinth" aspect is largely irrelevant to the specific action in the tower.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.0)
    Setting details ("alchemical orchard," "phosphorescent plants") provide a visual backdrop but fail to constrain action or pressure the protagonist's choices. The environment remains a static stage rather than an active force that complicates the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is functional but relies on genre clichés ("vast chamber filled with ancient tomes," "hidden in plain sight"). While the location is anchored, the description lacks specific, sensory details that would ground the "enlarged tranquility" in physical reality rather than abstract assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.0)
    Atmospheric details ("mossy stones," "wild roses") are competent but rely on standard "forgotten garden" tropes without specific constraints. The setting functions as a passive backdrop for contemplation rather than an active force that pressures the protagonist's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.4)
    The frozen library provides a cohesive atmospheric backdrop, but the setting remains largely static and decorative rather than pressuring the protagonist's choices. The "quartz hush" and "dying light" set a mood but do not act as constraints or resources that alter the tactical flow of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with sensory details like "damp wood" and "smell of salt, decay" effectively grounding the scene. The market's location beneath the pier is well-integrated into the action, though the "tide rising" deadline feels more like decoration than a pressure forcing immediate trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    Setting details are vivid and specific, with the "lavender bluff" and "ozone" taste grounding the speculative elements well. The sensory environment effectively supports the atmosphere, though the "forest elections" feel somewhat detached from the immediate action until the exposition ties them in.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.5)
    The "subterranean crystal cave" is a generic backdrop described with standard adjectives ("glittering," "prismatic") that offer no specific constraints or tactile grounding. The setting functions as a white room for the protagonist's monologue rather than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting anchors the story with standard post-apocalyptic tropes ("toxic sky," "greenhouse city") but lacks unique sensory specificity or lived-in texture. The environment serves as a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker that forces adaptation or distinct tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.2)
    Imagery is vivid ("fragment of an iceberg," "bronze surface"), but the setting functions largely as an ethereal backdrop rather than a source of friction. The environment supplies the wind and materials but does not pressure the protagonist's choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=3.9)
    Setting details are abstract and repetitive; the phrase "strangely organic" appears three times, acting as a placeholder rather than a specific sensory detail. The environment feels like a static backdrop for the summary rather than a lived-in space that constrains the character.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting relies on generic descriptors ("vibrant," "golden," "rose") and functions merely as a backdrop rather than a pressure cooker. While the "sandstorm calm" is mentioned, it feels like an inserted label rather than an atmospheric reality that constrains the character's physical experience or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.2)
    Atmospheric details ("green light," "algae") are functional but do not constrain the protagonist, who explicitly ignores the environment's pressure. The setting serves as a passive backdrop rather than an active force shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The gravity pockets act as a strong environmental constraint, forcing Elara to anchor herself and creating tactile interaction with the setting; the salt chamber is vividly realized.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=2.3)
    The setting is a generic "nocturnal haven" defined by abstract labels rather than concrete, constraining details. Descriptors like "terrestrially cosmic" are used as placeholders for actual sensory observation, failing to ground the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, establishing a lush, "silver and shadow" mood that fits the premise. However, the description leans heavily on romanticized tropes ("celestial fireworks," "night-blooming jasmine") rather than specific, tactile grounding that would heighten the reality of the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=2.9)
    The setting consists of generic fantasy tropes ("velvet garden," "soft moss") that provide no constraint or specific sensory grounding. The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than an active force shaping the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is decorative rather than constraining, offering a generic "marble sanctuary" backdrop that does not pressure the character's choices. The spatial logic is slightly confused, mixing a "polished" sanctuary with a "cavernous ceiling" and dripping stalactites without clear grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=2.3)
    The setting is abstract and generic ("serpentine nexus," "winding paths"), lacking sensory specificity or spatial logic. The environment does not constrain the character's choices or interactions, serving merely as a static backdrop for internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=3.2)
    Setting details, while descriptively competent, are static and fail to constrain action or generate pressure. The shrine and port towns serve as visual backdrops for a summary rather than inhabited environments that shape the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.1)
    Setting details are vivid but strictly ornamental, failing to constrain the protagonist's choices or generate friction. The use of "whispering parapet" and similar phrases feels like set-dressing rather than a lived-in environment that pressures the character.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting offers specific, functional details like the "precise geometry of branches" and "unblemished fruit" that support the paradox theme. However, atmospheric descriptors often lean on wasteland clichés ("bruised sky," "radioactive dust"). The transition to the "silent sphere" of the stillpoint effectively creates a sensory contrast at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting consists of generic fantasy tropes ("cobalt glass," "stormlit") that function as backdrops rather than constraints on action. While the imagery is consistent, it lacks the sensory specificity required to ground the reader in a physical reality or influence character tactics in a moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is established with vivid but ornamental description ("ragged cavity," "salt-crusted air"). The mechanics of the "feral loft" and the sound-capturing process remain abstract and dream-like, failing to constrain the protagonist's choices or offer concrete physical resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=4.2)
    Setting descriptions rely on heavy adjective stacking ("fleshly ethereal," "golden sunset") rather than concrete details that constrain action. The environment serves as a passive backdrop rather than an active pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.8)
    Sensory details like the "hum of energy" and "frozen lake" create a consistent, if static, atmosphere. However, the setting primarily serves as a backdrop for abstract assertions rather than interacting physically with the character's choices. The "magnetic viaduct" is an intriguing image but remains functionally vague.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting consists of generic descriptors ("gloom," "decay") and fails to utilize the specific sensory constraints of a subway tunnel to pressure the protagonist. The presence of an antique brass lantern in a modern maintenance environment strains verisimilitude and functions purely as a heavy-handed symbol rather than a practical tool affecting the scene's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is established with some evocative sensory details ("smell of oil and old wood," "brass components"). However, the atmosphere leans towards the melodramatic ("cathedral of forgotten melodies") and the specific phrase "vibrant hush" is repeated three times, diminishing its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.4)
    The setting (acid sea, gear workshop) provides a functional backdrop but operates largely as window dressing rather than a source of pressure or constraint. While the imagery is consistent with a steampunk aesthetic, the environment does not force Elara to alter her tactics or adapt. The corrosive nature of the sea is mentioned but remains an ambient detail rather than an active threat.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.3)
    The specific detail of the patch—frayed edges, bright repair thread—is excellent and effectively grounds the investigation. However, the broader setting relies on generic tropes ("vast, humming servers," "graveyard of moments") without unique sensory texture.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on generic descriptors ("silver-barked," "smelling of dust") that serve as backdrops rather than constraints on action. The vintage store is a convenient repository for the solution rather than a specific, pressured environment that forces a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with tangible sensory details like "icy slurry" and "splintered wood" grounding the scene. However, the environment serves largely as a backdrop for the character's internal monologue rather than presenting active obstacles or resources that force choices.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.5)
    The amber pavilion and vineyard provide a functional visual backdrop but operate largely as pathetic fallacy, mirroring internal states rather than constraining action. While atmospheric, the setting does not force trade-offs or shape the protagonist's tactics beyond serving as a canvas for projection.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting relies on abstract nouns ("murmuring," "whisperfield," "echoes") repeated frequently rather than concrete, sensory grounding. The spatial relationship between the pavilion, the dunes, and the parapet remains vague "white room" geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting relies on "postcard" clichés ("purple blooms swayed," "gentle breeze," "bees hummed lazily") that do not constrain the character's choices. The "rusted factory ruins" serve as a thematic backdrop rather than a physical environment that exerts pressure or presents obstacles. Sensory details are generic and lack specific, gritty texture.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting relies on generic, adjective-heavy descriptors ("towering shelves," "dust of unread books") rather than specific, grounded textures. The description contains a significant logical error—a tautology describing a "chandelier" hanging "like a skeletal chandelier"—which breaks immersion and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "fog sculpture garden" offers strong atmosphere, though phrasing like "fog mimicking broken clocks" blurs the line between literal object and metaphor, making the physical space difficult to visualize. The setting serves the mood well but lacks tactile grounding in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting details contain a significant verisimilitude break for a story using physics concepts like "escape velocity": placing "lunar clouds" below an observatory on the airless moon. The environment is otherwise generic, functioning as a "white room" backdrop for the prompt elements rather than a constraining physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting creates a generic "white room" atmosphere ("above the clouds," "jasmine") but lacks functional specificity. The environment serves as a passive backdrop rather than constraining choices or influencing tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "spoons bending reality" detail adds a specific, quirky texture to an otherwise standard fantasy setting. However, the environment functions mostly as a static stage; the floating isle and observatory do not actively pressure the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.5)
    The garden serves as a generic container ("verdant walls," "ancient magic") rather than a pressure cooker that forces choices. While the imagery is consistent, the setting does not constrain the protagonist or offer specific resources that shape the outcome beyond the tooth itself.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is visually distinct, with the "serpentine grotto" and "wet stone walls" grounding the action. However, the descriptions often lean on generic atmospheric adjectives ("swirling mist," "relentless caress") rather than specific, tactile details that constrain the protagonist's physical work.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "skeletal remains" of servers becoming a "cathedral of green" creates a vivid, specific atmosphere. Sensory details like the icicle tracery effectively ground the abstract themes.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting is an abstract &quot;white room&quot; filled with vague nouns (&quot;void,&quot; &quot;chaos,&quot; &quot;potential&quot;) rather than concrete sensory details that constrain the character. The environment feels like a passive backdrop that aids the protagonist (&quot;nexus itself awaited her success&quot;) rather than a source of genuine friction.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=3.6)
    The setting is described with generic, high-level abstractions ("emerald leaves," "silver dew") that lack sensory specificity or grit. While the location is clear, the environment does not constrain the character or shape the action; it serves only as a passive backdrop for the magic. The "gathering hush" is repeated as a label rather than established through atmospheric detail.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is visually distinct ("withered orchard," "subarctic crater") and establishes a cohesive atmosphere. However, the environment acts largely as a backdrop rather than a constraint that forces specific tactical adaptations; the cold is mentioned ("chapped hands") but does not impede the ritual or force a trade-off. Some descriptions rely on generic fantasy markers ("forgotten tales") rather than specific, lived-in details.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is defined by abstract metaphors ("cellar of reason," "wounded season") rather than concrete sensory details that constrain action. The "marble cavern" acts as a generic backdrop without specific physical geography that influences tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.2)
    The bronze grotto is visually established with some evocative details (starlight, damp earth), but the setting remains a static backdrop that facilitates the protagonist's success rather than applying pressure. The environment does not constrain action or force adaptation, serving only as a container for the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=5.2)
    The loft and kettle anchor the scene functionally, but the sensory details remain generic ("soft, diffuse glow," "rain tapping"). The physical reality of the ash wood is glossed over with abstract adjectives ("smooth," "straight") rather than concrete textural resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "kinetic lagoon" and "carousel" provide a surreal backdrop, but the setting feels like a static dreamscape rather than a place with physical rules that constrain the protagonist. The "cloud-like ground" is vivid, but the environment rarely forces Elara to adapt her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting imagery is vivid ("aqueducts mimicking constellations," "cracked domes"), effectively grounding the concept. However, the summary mode prevents the environment from exerting immediate, tactile pressure on Kaelen's choices during the repair process.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sensory detail is vivid and establishes the atmosphere, but the description is marred by excessive repetition of stock phrases ("glacial hush," "soundless sanctuary"). While the setting triggers the plot, the atmosphere feels static and overly adjectival.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.7)
    The "twilight barge canal" provides a functional atmospheric anchor, though it largely serves as a backdrop rather than a constraint. While the imagery of "mossy stones" and "silent sentinels" is competent, the setting does not force specific tactical choices or shape the narrative outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.4)
    Atmospheric details ("fresh snow," "scent of salt") establish the scene, but the setting relies heavily on generic high-fantasy abstractions ("ancient forests," "sacred caves," "timeless endurance") rather than specific, grounding particulars that constrain action.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.5)
    Atmosphere is consistent but relies heavily on generic markers of melancholy (autumn leaves, shadows, chill). The setting functions as a mood backdrop rather than a constraint that shapes tactics; the "damp stone bench" and "skeletal trees" are standard furniture for this genre rather than specific, active elements.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=3.4)
    The setting relies on generic steampunk and fantasy tropes ("whir of engines," "gears and pistons") without specific sensory grounding. While the stalactites provide a resource, the environment mostly serves as a backdrop for the theme rather than a pressure cooker for the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the "black sand" and "lagoon" are used as tools, the setting is established through repetitive phrases ("migration of clouds" appears three times) rather than sensory texture. The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=4.4)
    The setting is functionally described but relies on generic fantasy tropes ("weeping woman," "dry marbled lips") without specific, lived-in sensory details. The environment serves as a static backdrop for the puzzle rather than a source of pressure or constraint. "Smog-choked" contrasts oddly with the "luminous" aesthetic without being integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is visual but abstract ("swirling hues," "crystallized flora"), lacking the tactile specificity or constraints required to ground the scene. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the character's movement rather than a physical space that forces or complicates choices.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting details (greenhouse, ivy, glass) are competent but function largely as ornamental backdrop rather than constraining choice. The atmosphere relies on oxymoronic telling ("thundering calm") rather than sensory pressure. Spatial anchoring is adequate.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=3.2)
    The specific phrase "tidal obsidian ridge" is repeated four times, acting as a static backdrop rather than a constraint on the action. The setting details (brass gears, spiral stairs) are generic and do not shape the protagonist's choices or the story's outcome. The environment feels like a container for prompt phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.0)
    While the "cobalt silo" provides a specific anchor, the setting description suffers from repetitive, prompt-heavy phrasing ("velveteen gloom" appears three times). The atmosphere feels constructed from adjectives rather than sensory interaction, and the magical elements ("echoes") remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting of the obsidian spire and frozen lake provides a functional atmospheric mirror to the theme of stagnation, but remains largely visual and symbolic. While the environment reacts to the climax (the thaw), the interaction lacks tactile engagement; Kaelen observes the setting rather than being physically constrained or pressured by it.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "ember alcove" and "story famine" create a consistent, albeit somewhat generic, atmospheric backdrop. However, the setting remains static and visual-only; it does not constrain the protagonist's choices or exert pressure on the narrative action beyond functioning as a stage set.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.7)
    The "vanishing point gallery" offers a striking visual, but the setting largely acts as a passive backdrop for the internal monologue. Sensory details are often diluted by abstraction ("resin of regret and hope"), preventing the physical reality of the ash and porcelain from fully grounding the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "sedimentary layers" concept offers some specific texture, but the setting largely relies on generic descriptors ("damp stone," "decay"). The logic of finding paper nautical charts fused in sewer clay strains credibility and feels like set-dressing rather than a grounded environment.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.8)
    Sensory details ("velvet library," "crimson leaves") are present but lean heavily on generic autumn tropes without constraining the action. The setting provides atmosphere but does not pressure the protagonist's tactics or force a trade-off; it functions more as a backdrop than an active element.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is established with functional descriptors ("rusted," "skeletal iron frame") but remains generic. While the greenhouse provides a backdrop, it does not constrain the protagonist's choices or offer resistance to her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is described with pleasant but generic sensory details ("gleaming," "amber and violet") that do not pressure the characters' choices. The logic of "spraying water" to simulate rain in a blackout—presumably without a powered pump—is glossed over. The environment serves as a passive backdrop rather than an active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.8)
    Setting details are generic ("pink snow," "golden haze," "cobblestone streets") and heavily adjectival rather than specific and grounding. While the atmosphere is cohesive, it lacks the distinct sensory particularity that constrains choice; the environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than an active force.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is descriptive ("iridescent coral," "drifting seaweed") but functions largely as decoration rather than a source of constraint or pressure. While the "structural weakness" in the stonework is mentioned, the environment yields to the protagonist’s will without friction. The "forgotten" nature is told rather than felt through the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting acts as a generic allegorical void; "cold stone" and "infinite" are repeated without specific, grounding sensory details. The intrusion of glowing symbols weakens the established gritty atmosphere of the climb.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting provides atmospheric contrast (smog vs. sanctuary) but does not constrain the protagonist's choices or tactics. While sensory details like "acidic haze" are present, they remain backdrop wallpaper rather than active elements that pressure the narrative arc or influence the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is vivid and specific, with the "grotto city" and "rosewater dread" establishing a strong atmospheric baseline. Sensory details like the "muffled roar," "sickly green light," and the tactile failure of the "sad, hard loaf" ground the fable-like quality in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the "slow exhale of low tide" and the "bruising" storm creating a vivid, atmospheric container for the action. The final image of rain falling upward is a striking, specific reconfiguration of the environment that anchors the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.1)
    The funhouse atmosphere is cohesive and mirrors the internal distortion, but relies on standard tropes ("gaping maw," "rotten cotton candy"). Specificity is functional, yet the setting feels like a generic backdrop for the magical confrontation rather than a unique pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid, distinct, and integral to the narrative; the "improbable orchard" on the open sea creates a strong, specific atmosphere. Environmental details like the "blue hour" and "driftwood" effectively ground the fantastical elements. The setting actively provides the obstacles (silence, wave) that drive the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.3)
    The concept of the city on turtles is central and grounds the cartography element well. However, atmospheric descriptors like "sunwashed dread" are repeated as static labels rather than deepening through sensory variety. The physical reality of the "crack" provides a decent focal point for the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.5)
    Atmospheric descriptions ("green shroud," "scent of damp earth") are competent but ornamental. The setting feels forced by a prompt rather than integrated into the narrative logic, actively undermining the credibility of the archival work being described.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    The submerged pavilion is a vivid, constraining environment that effectively shapes the action (working on the "lowest step" as water rises). Sensory details like the "gaunt ribs" and "scent of iron gall" anchor the scene well, though the atmospheric "hushed blaze" feels slightly imposed rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.2)
    Sensory details regarding the stamp and the salt scent are vivid, but the constraint of "total blindness" is applied inconsistently, as Elara navigates too easily to specific seams. The "sunken" aspect provides atmosphere but barely impacts the mechanical choices of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting (floating island, glass basilica) is visually distinct but functions largely as ornamental backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure. While the descriptions are vivid ("crystalline spires," "perfumed earth"), the environment rarely forces the protagonist to adapt her tactics or make difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    The observatory and the geode are described with decent sensory detail ("faint hum," "sharp, perfect quartz"), establishing a solid atmosphere. However, the setting remains somewhat generic ("Stellar Resonance Chamber," "console screens") and does not deeply constrain the protagonist's choices beyond providing the window of opportunity.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is anchored but relies on generic "ancient ruin" tropes and abstract adjectives ("silent mechanisms," "latent energy"). The specific prompt phrase "brilliant dimness" feels inserted mechanically rather than arising from the atmosphere. Sensory details are predominantly visual and lack tactile grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting creates a distinct mood with the "cobalt terrace" and "forgotten shore," though the physical logic of the driftwood cache is tenuous. Sensory details like the "metal cool" watch hand help ground the scene, but atmospheric descriptors occasionally drift into purple prose ("cacophony of the city died").

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is functional but relies on generic atmospheric tropes ("mist clinging... like a shroud," "mist parting like a curtain"). While the "neutral territory" concept is present, the environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than an active constraint on the characters' tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is functional but generic, relying on standard tropes like "salt air" and "grey sky" without specific, grounding sensory details. While the utility poles serve a plot function, the environment lacks the texture or constraint necessary to deepen the scene beyond a basic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=4.3)
    The setting is visually described but lacks physical consequence; the "labyrinth" behaves like a straight hallway with no spatial constraints or wrong turns. Sensory details are generic ("damp and cool," "ethereal light") rather than specific to the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy tropes ("liquid silver," "shimmering light") that serve as decoration rather than constraints on the character's choices. The environment feels ethereal and detached, offering no physical resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is lush and atmospheric, with vivid details like "silver grass" and "whispering ferns" establishing a strong mood. The saucer functions effectively as a micro-setting that anchors the magical elements, though the imagery leans slightly into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sensory details like the "crystalline traces" on photographs are vivid, but the recycled spaceship environment generally feels like a generic backdrop rather than a pressure cooker. The "lighter when happy" attribute creates a nice micro-setting interaction with gravity, offering a rare moment of physical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is described with generic markers ("loomed," "smoldering," "whispering hush") that serve as a passive backdrop rather than constraining choice or exerting pressure. The environment feels like a stage set for a fable rather than a specific, lived-in place with tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.4)
    While the "luminous fort" and "armory" are mentioned, spatial choreography is vague; the mechanics of reading a shadow on a sundial by moonlight during a pitch-black night feel contrived for convenience. The setting acts as a passive backdrop rather than an active pressure cooker that constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting details ("tidal bluff," "painted rocks") defy the core physical premise of frictionlessness; objects and bodies behave as if in a normal world, breaking immersion. Sensory descriptions are functional but rely on standard fantasy tropes ("shimmering," "hummed") without leveraging the unique constraints of the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting provides some functional visual grounding ("glass dome," "forks of lightning") but operates largely as a melodramatic backdrop rather than a source of constraint. The storm mirrors the internal state in a clichéd "pathetic fallacy" manner without forcing specific tactical choices. Sensory details are visual-heavy and lack tactile immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established early but leans on generic descriptors ("crystal cage," "marble pedestal") and pathetic fallacy ("brook... murmured of time slipping away"). While the atrium is visually clear, the environment does not pressure the characters; the sunlight and brook are treated as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraints that shape the duel or the puzzle solving.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.8)
    Atmospheric descriptors ("silver glow," "skeletal frame") establish a visual mood but remain generic to the "ruined library" trope. The setting functions as a passive backdrop for symbolic action rather than a source of constraint, friction, or discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "tidal arbor" provides a visually distinct backdrop, though the "strange flora" and "brass pillars" remain largely decorative rather than constraining action. The transition to the monochrome film world is effective, yet the sensory details often lean on generic descriptors ("vast," "soft") rather than tactile specificities that would ground the fantastical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=3.6)
    Descriptions rely on generic fantasy abstractions ("vibrant bloom," "soft light," "magical essence") rather than specific, grounding sensory details. The setting accommodates the protagonist (the tree bends to assist) instead of offering resistance or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established with competent but standard atmospheric markers ("soft, grey sky," "wet earth") that set a mood without constraining the action. The environment offers no resistance to the protagonist's journey; the "cove where tides had washed up fragments of the past" appears conveniently to stage the resolution rather than existing as a grounded, tactile place. The "breezy" quality is mentioned but does not pressure the character's movement or choices.

    Stormlit observatory vividly selective (thunder trembles dome, lightning flashes reveal face in telescope), mirroring turmoil and charging scar-constellation realization. Sensory hierarchy POV-biased to poetic immediacies; setting guides telescope approach constraining epiphany. Environment evolves with intensifying storm, affecting emotional choices.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sundial grooves and needle constrain decoding choice, charging final witness image; glass walls amplify "prismatic shards" mirroring internal chaos; brook evolves from mocking urgency to harmonious path, filtering through Kaelen's priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rusted frame/debris constrains rebuilding choices; moon bookends charge final image ("moon... fading into dawn"). Sensory selective (whistling wind, waterlogged spine) via poet bias; spatial coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.3)
    Tidal arbor flora pulses constrain escape timing, mirroring internal longing; mist curtain as screen enables projector door. Final ballroom piano recharges prior motifs. Sensory selection (light ebb, whirring projector) narrows with urgency, no white-room vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Blooming ridge with humming air and pulsing ground constrains planting site choice; evolving weather from scents of petals to whipping winds charges the final ark placement.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sensory details (wet earth, salt, breeze) selective and purposeful, mirroring tides of memory; islet constrains walk to shores post-rain, charging final "testament to renewal." Bonsai and lace tactile, integrated into action without stalls. Micro-setting (cove fragments) shapes climax discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Micro-setting triumph: the butterfly-wing scale functions as both environment and tool, constraining attention and charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through Aris’s astrophysicist bias—she clocks “microscopic scars” and “iridescent dust” before emotion. Spatial tracking of glass shards and settling dust remains coherent. The greenhouse is not backdrop but apparatus, evolving beat-to-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Frost patterns function as micro-setting: they physically constrain decoding of the ledger and mirror glass technique, charging the final image. Canyon stars supply tonal vastness but do not affect tactics; still, the frost alone satisfies the 9+ gate. Sensory selection stays tight—cold stone, scorched paper edge—filtered through glass-artist eye. Spatial anchor holds: she sits, stands, pockets strip; no geography drift.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Winterglass panes, frost-etched flora, and dye-ripple physics are specific, tactile, and filter every action. Bench, piano, and fork case act as micro-settings that constrain choices (cut strings prevent acoustic escape). Final shimmer of mapped frost recharges opening lattice—environment directly charges the RR image. No spatial drift; cold consistently slows motion, matching reflective tempo.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    Submerged city and library are sketched with sharp, selective sensory cues—“marble columns standing defiantly against the currents,” “pages floating like ghosts”—that stay inside Elijah’s solemn gaze. The moonlit air-pocket is physically dubious but accepted as taught magical rule. Spatial choreography stays clean; environment supplies the final stage but does not constrain tactics earlier, capping it at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Terra-cotta arbor is sketched with heat-stroke economy: “weathered arches” echo footfalls, dust, muted clinks. Sensory hierarchy favors hush—moonlight, sweat, soft chime—so the ridge becomes a resonating chamber for secrecy. Micro-setting works: the arbor constrains acoustics and hides parcels, charging the final raised-bell image. More tactile navigation (hips brushing clay, flakes on palms) would lift it to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    The viaduct’s wisteria-draphed stones act as both cathedral and camera-darkroom: proximity dictates where she can stand to focus, while ivy-clefts literally hide the tear. Twilight color-shift mirrors her internal fog-to-clarity arc, and the “silvery strands” between stones supply the only path she can walk to ignite stored love. Micro-setting (camera box, tear) constrains each next move; no static postcarding. Final spark-drift is charged by the place itself, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    The living bridge garden is not backdrop but tool: the willow arches and crystal streams are the physical substrate Elara bends to twist time. Hyperbolic geometry is signaled through spatial detail—paths that “coil into infinite regress”—and paid off when those same curves channel the disintegration wave. The fading photographs function as micro-setting, their slow vanishing mirrored in her dissolving memory, anchoring the stakes in tactile objects. Spatial choreography is clean: the oldest bridge is tracked from woven ivy to unraveling motes, its position relative to Elara’s feet and the halo fragment’s pulse never wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    Carnatial detritus—faded banners, dusty shelves, grime-caked piano—are economically sketched through Elara’s goal-directed gaze. Spatial logic holds: arrow found at ticket booth, bench inside redemption center, vault behind false wall; distances track. Selective sensory focus (moonlight, clink of chains) mirrors mood without catalogue bloat. Environment enables the climax: bench literally contains the map, qualifying for 9+ micro-setting gate, but the description never rises to constraint-level influence on tactics, capping at low-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Environment-as-constraint: knee-deep silt slows every step, salt-burned apple taste reframes regret, forge slab literally supports the imprinting act—setting charges final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys synesthetic POV—colors heard as chimes—so detail is filtered, not touristic. Spatial choreography clean: from orchard perimeter to forge center without drift. Micro-setting (the ash-covered slab) is the pivot object; its cold grit under fingers is tactile right before imprint beat. No exposition dump; world rules (saltwater trees) learned through bite.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    Emerald tiles refract the moonbeam’s glow, literally coloring every stealth decision; the station’s floral pillars double as map and lock, constraining route. Body-as-setting is absent, but the jar’s shrinking weight in her palm tracks tension. Spatial choreography is flawless: alcove → portrait wall → jasmine corridor. Micro-setting (jar, flowers) charges the final image, meeting 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.1)
    Setting is evoked through cold-metallic specifics—console dust, furnace clink, slush at the sill—that constrain body movement and tool use; the control room’s dereliction doubles as emotional sounding board. The cracked bookmark functions as micro-setting object, charging the final image. Sensory layering favors touch and sound over visual catalog. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rusted library, oxidized metal, ivy, star-pierced roof—selected sensory details mirror Leo’s corrosion-to-light arc and constrain movement (leaning shelves force cautious steps). Micro-setting rule satisfied: the shell-as-object is repeatedly handled, its pearlescent cracks echoing roof-starlight in the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; Leo kneels, leads Eli out, walks to tower without impossible jumps. Environment never evolves (no weather, no shifting debris underfoot), keeping it just shy of 9-level constraint-on-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Storm-tossed ridge fort, ancient stones, and the singular star create an immediate, tactile stage; the body-as-setting is evoked through her chilled bones and robe whispers. The gold booklet’s flaking leaf is a micro-setting that literally charges the final image when it glows. Selective sensory economy (no taste, no smell) keeps the lyric register intact without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.1)
    Frozen courtyard, twilight light, and ice sculpture are economically re-used as reflective surfaces for the violin’s glow; the cold is not just atmosphere but a constraint that justifies the robot’s immunity and the ice instrument’s peril. Spatial choreography is clean; the single bench-to-sculpture move is tracked. The violin functions as micro-setting and final-image charger, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.1)
    The rain-slick crystal forecourt is continuously filtered through Elara’s ears and feet; crystals “whisper” ambient sound that literally lets her “eavesdrop” on past conversations, so the setting becomes an active forensic tool. Wet crystal surface as impromptu projection screen is an elegant, place-specific payoff that fuses atmosphere and mechanics in one image.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.1)
    Garden is rendered through selective sensory cues—vine sap on fingers, hedge walls parting just enough—so setting acts as responsive character rather than backdrop. Marble cracks map labor history onto space, turning micro-object into lived geography. Weather and spatial scale remain absent, but at this length the pruned vine and clearing suffice to ground every move.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Gas-giant twilight, magnetic nexus, and leathery-wing dormancy are tightly filtered through Kael’s mechanic gaze—tools, spires, holographic console—so environment constrains timing and tool choice. The “mechanically warm” air becomes a micro-setting that mirrors emotional thaw after the proof. Spatial choreography is flawless: corridor → deck → console → window view → external nexus, all tracked without drift. One hairline slip: “embrace” is metaphorically pushed a sentence too far, softening the precision edge.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Flooded opera house is not backdrop but tactical terrain: every wade, ripple, and echoing drip constrains movement and timing. The flickering lanterns double as unstable reading light and ghost spotlight, charging the final calm glow. The antique program’s evolving stains act as micro-setting that literally rewrites the score she must play. Spatial choreography is immaculate—half-drowned piano, submerged seats, black pit—bodies and objects stay tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    The station’s isolation, cold machinery, and auroral light are filtered through Elara’s perceptual fatigue; wind hum and sweat-soaked blanket ground us in body. Spatial tracking is clean: bed → wall → console → window → console again, each move tethered to sensory stimulus. The Bloom illustration functions as micro-setting that constrains her attention, but its microclimate link is asserted, not discovered through tactile exploration, so environment never actively pressures choice.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    Tunnel’s crumbling bricks, silt under boot, and brass wheel glint are selective, tactile, and filtered through Kaelen’s ruin-lust. Cold air and metallic clank escalate threat without catalogue. The beaded wheel reappears as the charged final image, constraining his choice to restore it. Spatial track is flawless; no white-room moments.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.1)
    Library, obsidian walls, and paper swan are tactile, odor-rich, handled onstage; they constrain movement (must fold to travel) and frame the final image. Selective detail—moss, dust, river hush—mirrors the thematic hush without cataloguing. Micro-setting (swan = portal) charges closure when it is refolded, sealing the altered stance.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sage Ridge is summoned with economical natural anchors—oak roots, hush, slope echo—never over-toured. Micro-setting matters: the oak’s buried roots serve as the literal and symbolic stage where wonder is transacted, ultimately charging the final image. Sensory balance favors hush and touch over visual clutter, matching the musical theme. Place-names stay sparse yet memorable, meeting the 9-band gate even if environmental constraint on tactics is gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Immediately microlocates: “bronze quiet,” “concentric levels,” “heat-cracked stones,” all filtered through Elian’s archive-attuned eye. Silo curvature guides his spiral descent; the fireplace’s ash constrains how he handles pages, a tactile micro-setting. The tapestry is not merely seen—its threads encode celestial data, becoming the story’s pivot-tool. Final image recharges “bronze quiet” with voices now stored in stone, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Fog-sliced beam, salt-rusted lantern room, tide-slapped rocks—selective sensory triangulation keeps bodies oriented and choices limited: the rowboat is the only exit, the light the only way to signal allies. Microdot films function as mobile setting-objects; their physical handling (held to lamplight, scratched, buried) alters next moves. Weather and night-time curfew (“after last orders”) act as clocked environment that gates every cookie drop.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dimensional anchor is never described in tourist detail; instead, the stone floor, pedal, and single ultramarine operate as micro-setting that literally constrains every tactical move—Elian must kneel, mark, and draw within the pigment’s reach. Spatial choreography is immaculate: thumb → floor → line → dissolving silence. The “unraveled stillness” is sensory-hierarchical: first auditory vacancy, then tactile vibration, then visual blue bleed—each sense recruited only when the beat demands it.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Glass spire and frozen lake are more than postcard: the prismatic dawn light and cracking-ice bass note actively supply the symphony’s final timbre, charging the closure image. Nautilus shell functions as micro-setting, its spiral chambers constraining the sequence of memories she “plays.” Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—sound memories dominate,嗅觉 of rain translated into adagio notation. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glowing rain-slick viaduct functions as micro-setting: its shifting bridges are procedurally generated by tablet runes, directly constraining every footstep. Spatial choreography is crisp—gap leap, shudder, platform convergence. Sensory hierarchy narrows to raindrop interval and tablet warmth, mirroring internal stakes. Final steady glow reconfigures meaning with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Drum-maker’s cavern functions as micro-setting: every tool, hide, and wood curl constrains Elara’s access to vibration and thus her choices. The broken needle’s glint and clay imprint act as tactile “places” that charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys a deaf POV—vibration, rustle felt through soles, sight of seasons—never resorting to tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and distances track across the single room.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    Courtyard functions as micro-setting: rain gauge, ivy wall, stone bench constrain movement and supply props for beats. Light, coo, cool air—selective sensory triad mirrors internal shift from vigil to alliance. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible pigeon or gate positions. Tool-as-setting test met (gauge, tube) but bench could have pressed flesh harder in final image; caps at 7.9.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Greenhouse, UV lantern, and perfume vial all constrain tactics and charge the final image—each object’s physical state changes (lantern on, vial empty, blossom fluoresces). Sensory selection skews to scent and filtered light, mirroring Elara’s professional bias. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. World rule (extinct flora revived) is learned through action, not lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    The grotto’s warm earthiness and the rope’s fiber-memory are returned to tactile life during the spiral ritual, letting setting constrain the magic act. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV—poet notices color, sound, metaphoric resonance rather than mineral names. Spatial choreography stays continuous; no impossible moves. Energy beings serve as living sky-prop whose departure reconfigures the grotto’s light, a textbook example of environment charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    Glass dome, half-drowned trees, and shipwreck wood are tactile and bias-filtered; the bowl’s warming surface anchors the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate by constraining her release decision.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Amber grotto is not backdrop; its translucent walls emit static that she reads like a seismograph—setting as tool. Micro-setting (blotter petal) is handled twice and recharged at closure when it turns to dust, constraining her next move. Spatial choreography is clean: she waits → examines → inhales → drops → steps out. Dusk light evolves with her shift, mirroring without overt symbolism. Missing 9-band: no environment or object directly shapes the final tactical decision beyond symbolic discard; hence 8.6 capped.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.7)
    Seaside port, cliff cottage, and star-scented library are sketched with selective salt-air and breeze detail that mirrors internal shift. The library’s repetitive “under the stars” tag becomes a scaffold loop, dulling specificity. No object or environment constrains a pivotal choice; the locket is emotional prop, not tactical. Thus fails 9+ gate for constraint-on-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.1)
    Crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are not postcard scenery; they refract light that cues Elara’s discovery and later host the communal rites.  Spatial choreography holds across multi-day walks; distances and group positions remain trackable.  Reed medium and reflective stone echo the theme of fragile fragility→resilient unity.  Weather and crater acoustics are filtered through Elara’s artisan ear, never tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rooftop canals and infinity pendant function as micro-settings that literally constrain how time can be borrowed and steered; spatial choreography is crisp. Sensory detail is selective and biased through Elara’s illustrator eye; light on sound until the final release, which is deliberate. Environment charges the final image: the canals shimmer under a sun that has literally shifted because time was harvested. No orientation drift; world rules (giant’s nap = clock, pendant = valve) are discovered through action.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cavern orchard is not backdrop but instrument: stalactite drips supply the rhythmic input that drives the emotional feedback loop. The chipped mosaic stepping stone literally maps frequencies and later holds the glass eyes as a permanent sensor—environment as apparatus. Sensory hierarchy skews to kinaesthetic and auditory (damp soil, drip cadence) fitting a scientist’s attention economy. Final image recharges the same tiles now hosting the eyes, yielding micro-setting closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “sapphire hush” is not decorative; its shifting tint tracks Kaelen’s internal clock and dials the final image. Micro-setting—the cold lip of the duct, dust on the reel—constrains his finger choreography and charges the closure beat. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies enter, listen, depart while Kaelen remains anchored behind the panel. Early signal → payoff met; environment reweights meaning at end.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mossy trellis functions as micro-setting: its shift from rigid structure to absorptive support mirrors and constrains her choice to bend rather than brace. Rain-soaked sensory detail is filtered through nursery-owner priorities—pH, light, petrichor—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean across the single scene; the leaf’s spiral away provides a crisp final camera move that recharges the trellis image.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    Tidal island is more than postcard: slick rocks, sucking mud, interior “damp outcrop” constrain footing and force proxemic intimacy between Kaelen and Elara. Rain trails function as micro-setting, literally guiding footsteps and charging the final painting. Sensory hierarchy obeys Kaelen’s painter eye—light on amber, mud’s palette—while weather affects action (rare drizzle motivates trek). Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible object jumps. The environment’s fragility mirrors internal parchedness, yet avoids overt symbolism by anchoring in bodily navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cave geometry is tracked cleanly: mouth → crystals → deep orb; bodies never float. Crystals are used as both light-source and sound-source, pressing choices (Kaelen rises when timbre changes). The “bright darkness” tone is sustained via shimmer-rain that is both luminous and shadow-casting. Pearl-as-micro-setting constrains the final gesture, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.1)
    Ivory harbor’s post-rain slickness constrains movement—boots click, crate used as podium—integrating setting into action rather than postcard backdrop. Sensory hierarchy reflects archivist’s bias: ledgers’ salt-stained pages, gull cry missed “deeply,” trumpet’s metallic chill. Micro-setting (trumpet valve) evolves from silent relic to charged amplifier, directly shaping climax. No occupational-system depth required; selective detail keeps scene breathable at 748 words.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is the story’s star: the city’s cracked pavements, fog-thick alleys, and starlit vault are sensuously particular and filter through Elara’s cartographer gaze. Sensory selection stays tight—visual fissures, cold metal punch, echoing footfalls—mirroring her narrowing focus. The vault’s spatial logic is dreamlike yet internally consistent; distances and bodies never drift. One penalty: the punch’s physics (piercing illusions) is declared, not discovered through setting interaction, so the world rule feels author-granted rather than environment-tested.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.3)
    Salt-laced wind and whale song anchor when & where inside 50 words; body-as-setting (cold tile against palm) constrains the choice to keep holding it. Tower open to sky is returned to at closure, now charged as “a beacon for future seekers,” satisfying the 9+ object-as-setting test. Sensory selection stays urgent—sound of whales narrows to “silent rhythm” matching her pen strokes. No spatial drift; choreography clean.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prismatic escondite is not postcard scenery: folding crystal light becomes tactical when it coalesces into “silent origami” that Kaelen navigates with dimensional sight. Magnetic field lines and obsidian fragment anchor spatial choreography; the cave’s collapse into a “single point of light” charges the final image. Sensory economy favors visual refraction, but other senses are logically muted inside crystal. Meets 9+ gate: setting constrains tactics and reconfigures closure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prep-room micro-setting (embalming fluid, steel table, casket polish) constrains every tactical choice; proximity to bodies makes patience plausible. Sensory hierarchy is mortician-biased: chemical smells, label typography, metallic clinks. Spatial track is flawless: pot travels from shelf → pocket → table → shelf, states tracked. Weather absent but irrelevant; environment mirrored in “deathly vitality” tone; qualifies for 9-band but lacks one added constraint in final image, hence 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bonsai labyrinth is not backdrop but instrument: its “gnarled branches holding stories” is the literal archive Elian mines. The single fluorescent lamp on a mountaintop is implausible tech, yet its hum is the diegetic tuning fork that lets time split, so the setting is simultaneously surreal and rigorously functional. Spatial choreography is micro-precise—the flat stone, the notepad angle, the lamp sway—each prop constrains gesture. Weather is absent, but the cool air and starlight are sensory enough; the final nodding blooms echo the closing of the book, recharging the earlier “tiny leaves glistened” image.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Container labyrinth functions as micro-setting that constrains movement and metaphor—paths physically dead-end as memories do. Tide levels dictate search tempo; slime on pilings mirrors the story’s submerged truths. “Metallic canyons” and “rusted steel boxes” are selective, POV-filtered, never tourist catalog. The poison label’s return as tactile relic charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    Observatory-cliff micro-setting charges every beat: wind through shattered glass, salt scent, broken telescope as cradle. The half-finished cello’s rough wood and missing scroll physically mirror her incomplete understanding, constraining her method and final stance. Spatial choreography is tight—objects stay tracked (compass, seashell, cello) and their states evolve. Environment mirrors interior without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    Carnival lights on salt-slick boards, magenta spray misting sea-damp wall, child’s sticky fingers—selective, sense-leveraged details that mirror urgency. The perpetual-carnival raft city is more postcard than constraint until the final image when the raft motif is reclaimed in paint; thus environment charges closure but not tactics mid-scene. Spatial choreography clean: wall → spray → child → retreat trackable. Missing one tactile prop-use beat (stone only pocket-rubbed) prevents 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Mons Huygens summit is not a backdrop but a life-support puzzle: low-g slow-motion, suit hum, lethal shadow geometry. The grain and the color-vials operate as micro-setting that constrain timing and posture; camera tilt is literally dictated by crater rim angle. Final image—“grain catching new light”—fuses body, tool, and terrain into one charged poise. No slack description survives; every detail is filtered through inspector-trained eyes that read slope, albedo, ticking light.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mist, drip, and rail-yard echo stay filtered through Elara’s non-visual senses, anchoring orientation early. The water-bowl refractor is a tactile micro-setting that directly enables the climax; its cool surface and shifting heat gradients constrain her diagnostic moves. Depot geography stays stable; distance to the Aethel is tracked by receding anchor chain. Environment does not force a trade-off, so the 9+ gate is missed, but sensory specificity is strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rusted outpost and frozen lake are not backdrop but instrument: the lake’s former-spring legend pressures Elias onto the ice, the fissure’s geothermal warmth literally melts the way to discovery, and the metallic decay echoes his fear of obsolescence. Sensory economy is severe—visual cold, tactile “stinging skin,” and the audible “cry” of the falcon—mirroring an editor who attends to cartographic essentials. The condensation micro-map on the windowpane functions as a hand-held tool, constraining his route across the lake; its pattern is spatially tracked and never contradicted. Only one anachronistic detail (“pallid sky”) edges toward cliché, otherwise specificity is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “ancient archway” and cobblestone rhythm function as micro-setting: their physical response to vibration literally enables the revival, charging the final image. Selective sensory triangulation—dust devils, gleaming stones, low hum—keeps description lean yet atmospheric. Spatial choreography is pristine; every footfall and fork-strike is locatable. Environment constrains the only possible tactic—keep pacing—so the 9+ gate is met.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    Underwater temple gains tactile specificity—“vaulted ceiling,” “soft phosphorescence,” “crystalline rods frozen by centuries”—all filtered through Kaelen’s urgent, narrowing attention. Spatial choreography is clean: gear-turns, door-groan, rising through halls track believably. The vial as micro-setting charges the final image. Light/beam motif never over-declared; quietly mirrors the “fractured” hope he carries out.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.0)
    Copperlight repose evolves from atmospheric tint to tactical resource—its metallic warmth masks Kaelen’s silhouette from spectral wardens and charges the final image of purified beam. The reef’s jagged geometry is felt in calf muscles and salt-slick palm, the beacon chamber’s lens-grating clicks under his fingernails. Setting constrains every step; without the copper glow the hover would spot him, without the reef there is no escape skiff.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.1)
    Glass greenhouse under endless night is more postcard than crucible, yet the bead-as-micro-setting finally constrains Elian’s future ritual, nudging the score high. Sensory selection favors luminous fruit and chill air—purposeful, not catalogic—though spatial choreography is lightly tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Red canyon walls, damp hollows, and tide-pool afterglow are viscerally anchored; the labyrinth’s narrowing corridors and central rubble chamber are spatially tracked. Sensory economy is good—sound is muffled, light is post-tidal, stone is breathing—so atmosphere grows without inventory bloat. The micro-setting of the glazed plate doubles as tool and mirror, charging the ending when it is left as beacon. No world-rule inconsistency, no white-room lapse; the setting could constrain her stride or thread supply more aggressively, but it still shapes her ritual path.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    The catacomb orchard is never a static backdrop; roots, bones, and light constrain every shovel stroke and shadow alignment. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and temperature during excavation, then widens to sound when prayers are spoken, mirroring Elara’s expanding attention. The sundial itself becomes micro-setting that dictates the final dig—an irreplaceable environmental pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    Golden arcade at dawn is rendered with selective sensory detail—brass catching light, cool tiles under fingers—and the body/clipboard dyad acts as micro-setting that constrains every micro-choice. Description is woven through action rather than delivered in blocks. The nostalgic futurism is evoked by light and material contrast, not exposition. Environment charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Eternal Candle operates as micro-setting: its niche-height and wavering shadow dictate what Elara can and cannot be seen stitching, directly shaping stealth tactics. Autumn leaves “skittering across stone” are filtered through her need to hear footfalls; sound replaces postcard visuals. Spatial choreography is clean—hoop, niche, doorway form a straight sight-line the captain’s gaze can travel. Final image of absolute darkness is charged by its earlier role as sole source of permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mangrove labyrinth is not backdrop but navigable pressure: roots twist into a chamber, spirits coalesce, moonlight angles through canopy to activate the shard—environment directly shapes tactics. Micro-setting extends to the shard and the translucent leaf “window,” both of which constrain or enable critical choices. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s medium-perception—sound-first, then touch, then visionary condensation. One decimal off 9.0 only because spatial choreography could be fractionally cleaner in the root-chamber moment.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mist, bruised skylight, and coral fragment create a coherent micro-setting that constrains perception—vapor softens edges, twilight limits vision—while the humidifier hiss mirrors anesthetic diffusion; setting is not mere backdrop but filters every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sensory selection stays urgent—damp walls, porous clay, glow of algae—filtered through painterly perception. The skeletal apple tree and fresco fragment serve as micro-setting that guides her next action. Spatial cues hold; fog density and temperature affect visibility and emotional temperature. Environment constrains choice and charges the final projection.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Garden, mural, coin, and crystal function as micro-settings that constrain every action; the coin’s warmth and the crystal’s hum dictate when and how Elara moves. Sensory hierarchy obeys her restorer’s eye—pigment, fracture, glint—never tourist-catalog. The reflected-sound mechanic is taught early and charges the final image when the mural repaints itself. Spatial choreography is clean: coin pried → tapped → tossed; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    Greenhouse is not backdrop but weapon: humidity crickets drown speech, vines physically warp under tax-tech, beetle iridescence camouflages allies. Gourd rattle doubles as micro-setting—its dry whisper cues revolution—charging every shake. Spatial choreography survives raid: three allies emerge behind broad-leaves, distances maintained, no impossible positions. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s scholar eye: she notes pattern misalignment before color, selects thyme over showier bloom for cipher fidelity. Final image of alleys swallowing her is earned environmental answer to greenhouse compression, narrowing world to fugitive scale. Setting constrains and gifts in same breath—publish-level specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Shell interior as micro-setting constrains every move—echoes pool, wind sighs through fissures, starlight reflection charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors auditory/visceral over visual catalog, matching insomnia’s narrowed attention. Spatial choreography stays coherent: retreat deeper into niche → echo return → shell hums. Kelp-parchment, postcard tattoo, reef-shadow light are tactile, lived-in details that evolved with action; shell’s resonant cavity literally amplifies the lullabies, feeding climax.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    “Opal library above the clouds” is more than panorama: its fragility directly constrains action—cracked chime threatens collapse, forcing Elara’s archive search. Sensory triangulation (visual opal shimmer, hush of absent wind, tactile trace of crack) is selective and filtered through her caretaker priorities. Spatial choreography is tracked cleanly up spiral stairs to spire and back to orchids. The wind chime’s bamboo acts as micro-setting/object that charges the final image when knitted whole by song—meets 9+ gate, but global cap not exceeded elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glass ink well is micro-setting that constrains choice—its glow/pulse literally guides when and what she can write, charging the final image when it overflows. Archive is sketched with selective sensory hits (dust, whispers, candle flicker) rather than catalogued, keeping economy. Spatial choreography is clean: desk → scroll → shelves → door, no impossible positions. Weather is absent but irrelevant; the candle’s flicker substitutes for environment-in-motion.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    The breathing volcano-amphitheater is vivid, tactile, and specific: ash exhalations, shifting basalt benches, thermal vents. The antique chain is handled twice—unspooled, then packed—marking the arc and charging the final image. Environment directly constrains action: tremors dictate when Elara can safely adjust the gates. One notch down from 9 because the “hidden compartment” and glue-analysis beat verge on convenient archaeology; still, the setting’s sensory authority dominates.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    The attic’s skylight-etched dust, meteorite chip, and paper strata are used as tactile instruments of balance and memory; they physically constrain how Elara calms herself and how the songs are stored. Sensory economy is disciplined—smell of paper, swirl of motes—each detail tied to her perceptual filter rather than catalogued. Micro-setting (chip as cipher, dust as map) charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate, though the exterior city remains a blur, acceptable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    The drifting prism terrace functions as both environment and micro-setting: its rainbow shards literally illuminate the final threshold, charging the closure image. Wood-grain “swirls like frozen rivers” is tactile and POV-filtered, anchoring abstract metaphysics to sensory detail. Spatial choreography is dreamlike yet coherent; no impossible positions. Weather-code logbook acts as tool-as-setting, its cryptic numbers constraining perception the way altitude constrains pilots.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    Underwater city, curved-glass control room, and black water canvas are sketched with economy; the feather and holographic star projections function as micro-setting that constrains her attention. Bioluminescent bloom is timed to emotional crest, charging the final image. No spatial drift; generator hum and metal creak keep the facility alive. Sensory palette is narrow (mostly visual) but selective, matching her astronomer bias.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    The iridescent geode is viscerally anchored through Kaelen’s tactile handling of seeds and glass; light-scent-texture details are filtered by his professional gaze. Spatial anchors arrive early and stay coherent, but the environment never actively constrains his choices—he could leave or stay without consequence—so the setting enriches atmosphere more than stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.9)
    Salt-laced wind, damp ledge, lighthouse beam: sensory triangulation is tight and POV-filtered. The arcade’s echo and petal drift are woven through action, not catalogued. Micro-setting qualifies: the ledge’s dampness determines where the bishop is placed, a tactile constraint. Final starlight reprises opening, earning resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.0)
    Garden, star-gaps, moonstone vial supply tactile anchors that constrain the ritual; body-as-canvas micro-setting is handled throughout. Selective sensory detail (“hum of obsidian grace”) sustains atmosphere without checklist overload; final image recharges the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pearl Bay’s salt damp, prism atrium, and pocket pebble are rendered through Elara’s glazier eye—angle, warp, refraction—so every tactile detail also reveals vocation. The fogged glass that “hangs dull and expectant” later flares into rainbow storm, charging the final image. Environment directly constrains perception and supplies the metaphoric engine; no other setting swap would keep the ripple-to-spectrum logic intact.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    The tide-polished grotto is evoked with tactile economy—“wet light,” “sea-smoothed stones,” “luminous kelp”—and the micro-setting (mandala floor) directly constrains every adjustment Elara makes. Spatial choreography stays clean within the single cavern; no impossible props or geography slips. The environment’s gleam mirrors the soft brightening of the timelines, but the sensory palette leans heavily visual; a salt-taste or acoustic drip could have sharpened immediacy without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ivy, ash, cold stone, and film emulsion are viscerally anchored to Elara’s perceptual bias—“echoes” as tactile, olfactory, visual data. The fireplace-as-archive constrains discovery mechanics and provides the negative that recharges closure. Spatial choreography is clean: boot-scuff, kneel, extract, hold to light. Environment mirrors internal shift from “damp decay” to “hopeful hum,” but the ivy itself never actively impedes or enables; it’s mood rather than material constraint, keeping it under 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prism parapet is handled twice—first as palette, finally as the surface whose rainbows are relinquished when bells ring—so it constrains her canvas and charges the fade. Droplet-lenses, jasmine scent, and echoing stone are filtered through Lyra’s painterly bias, never tourist clutter. Spatial choreography stays clean; no world-rule gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.1)
    The terrace is sketched with selective sensory strokes—warm stone, violet sky, cracked mosaics—each mirroring the theme of resilient imperfection. Spatial choreography stays coherent as representatives step into circle, clipboard drops at exact moment of Elara’s fade. Weather (midsummer, twin-moon convergence) functions as ritual clock, directly constraining when the final act can occur. Micro-setting qualifies via clipboard and terrace cracks; both re-appear in final image, charging closure. Tiny slip: “ancient songs” is auditory placeholder, but it is fleeting.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    The salt-flat itself is protagonist-grade: its crystalline crust guides footsteps, its map of cracks steers the ritual; the cracked egg-shell literalizes the land’s fracture. Sensory hierarchy stays tight—visual white, tactile crunch, auditory hum—filtered through Vane’s guilt-narrowed attention. Weather evolves causally: drought bakes the map, the approaching storm supplies final urgency. Spatial choreography is clean—kneel, open palm, light flows outward—no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    Snow-silvered courtyard is both stage and snare; every sensory pick is filtered through courtesan training (noticing reflection, silence, footprints). The prism light at the end re-illuminates earlier “spectral threads,” recharging the setting image.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dome is sketched with spare, sense-driven strokes—curved metallic skin, acoustic oddities, star cracks—each enlisted to mirror Elara’s internal shift rather than freeze the scene for postcard beauty. The campfire stick operates as micro-setting: handled, turned, re-inked, and finally re-weighted at closure, so it earns the 9+ gate test even at short length. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no impossible moves. Occasional atmospheric abstraction (“meteor hush” repeated) edges toward mood-labeling, but the setting never stalls action and repeatedly constrains her acoustic alertness and creative process.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.1)
    The grotto’s misty breath and cloud-filtered glow constrain every motion; altitude limits how long the arch can stand. The moth wing’s iridescent veins map literal flight paths, charging the final image when the monarch brushes it. Spatial choreography is flawless—no impossible positions. Environment is indispensable to the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    Ice dome, aurora, hemp-and-silver rope, brittle punch-card—each detail is tactile, cold, and filtered through Elara’s caster-eye. The rope doubles as micro-setting and tool: its stiffness dictates her slow re-weave, and its final glow is inseparable from the closure. Spatial choreography is clean; distance from altar to dome never drifts. Aurora shifts mirror stakes without overt symbolism. Meeting 9+ gate: the rope’s material state directly constrains the final luminous braid.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    Bunker-as-micro-setting constrains light, sound, movement; vines scrape metal door at exact moment of internal shift, marrying outside storm to inner flip. Concrete dust + ozone + wet earth triangulates sensory space. The seal-as-threshold object is handled in three tactile beats (vision, pulse, dust) and charges the final image. Spatial choreography clean—no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    The palace corridors, observatory cupola, and mosaic floor are not backdrop but instruments whose spatial relations dictate where Aris can step; the final image is charged because the tile becomes literally inseparable from the floor he stands on.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    The soundless sanctuary is anchored early and used tactically: silence forces mental dialogue, giving the scene a staging logic. Reality shifts become a visual mirror of Kael’s emotional flux, integrating setting with theme. Sensory economy is strong—"non-light," "silent vibration"—but spatial choreography is vague: bodies never move, distances untracked. Still, the environment functions as both crucible and metaphor, cleanly supporting the speculative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Fog-bound orchard and mirrored light construct an accumulative texture that tightens around the breathing beat; twilight frost supplies both ticking clock and refracting surface. Mirrors act as micro-setting that literally bends choice—each angle decides how much dream is let in. Final mirror object charges the closing image by compressing the whole glass mountain range into a palm-sized shard.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cathedral-orchard is sensory and specific, roots in beams guiding Elara’s climb and echoing the theme of growth from decay. Apple scent and rotting stone constrain her mood and later frame the dawn reunion, qualifying for the 9+ gate. Spatial anchors remain steady; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    The astral orchard is rendered through filtered perception—luminous fruit, ozone scent, bark etched like forgotten language—each detail steering her inquiry. The crystalline bathroom micro-setting supplies the breakthrough beat, and the cameo blank as recurring object constrains her final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mountain bookstore breathes: stone shelves, mist, floating tomes humming. Diary as micro-setting constrains choice—pressed leaves, fragile pages guide每一步. Spatial track stays clean; no floating props. Final image of glowing hall recharges earlier “glimmering” motif, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clock-tower guts are rendered through lived motion—cogs groan in sympathy, brass towers around her—so the mechanism becomes an active agent, not backdrop. The seal’s warmth and the rope’s “fibers thick with age” supply micro-setting that directly constrains finger-placement and knot tension. Spatial choreography is flawless: we track her pocket-draw, palm-press, two-handed re-braid without ever losing axis. Only the ghost-study lacks a sensory anchor beyond visual, a hairline gap that keeps it from full 9-band tactile charge.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Harmonic caves function as micro-setting: ice fractures become readable maps that literally constrain her next move; echo chamber stone’s glow guides hand and eye under gloom. Sensory economy—cool stone, frozen tears—mirrors internal quest for calm without overt symbolism. Final image of dancing energy beings re-codes the space itself, passing 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Glass ribs that hum in wind and slice moonlight into spectral needles function as micro-setting; their vibration literally guides the angle at which Elara sets the fragments. Star-path brass instruments, fused-silica dust, and the violet sky are filtered through her goal-biased perception, never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is tight—no impossible body-to-lens shifts—and weather (rising wind) is causally looped into both the pavilion’s song and the final beam alignment, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Crystal forecourt, obelisk shadows, and bench micro-setting all constrain movement and charge the final image; the bench’s shortest shadow literally seats the epiphany. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—archivist notices rain-woken whispers before sky-color, reflecting archival priorities. Selective detail avoids tourist catalog; stormlit clouds mirror internal turmoil without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible body or prop drift.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    Selective sensory economy is exemplary: we smell kerosene, hear gravel crunch, see jasmine veins, all filtered through Elian’s pyrotechnic eye. The fortress micro-setting (phoenix mosaic) literally constrains tactics—he must read its harmonic resonance to know where to drop the ember—so the 9+ gate is met. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible distances as sparks race pre-laid trails. Atmosphere of “serious play” is sustained without purple drift; every descriptor serves ignition logistics or emotional lift.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Grotto, cicada, and starlight are used as micro-setting: cicada’s cool surface against skin constrains Elara’s tactile focus; tidal pools carve literal channels that mirror time’s texture. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sight filtered through her chronicler bias. Environment does not merely echo mood—it supplies the metaphor that reframes the conflict. No anachronisms; spatial choreography tracks cleanly as they circle the pools.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bunker’s “slowly closing fist,” the inverted sky’s churning landscapes, and the trellis’s “lattice of glowing strands” are selective, sensory, and POV-filtered. The porcelain doll functions as micro-setting: its changing temperature and perceived gaze constrain Elara’s emotional stance and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless—tether length, ascent vector, descent timing remain legible. Weather/environment (gravity inversion) directly determines every tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    The drifting prism terrace is not postcard scenery: its light-shards directly cue the vial’s reactions and the timetable of silent zones, thereby constraining when and where Elara can act. Crystalline platforms, pastel shift, and twilight glow are filtered through her practiced eye, integrating sensory hierarchy with occupational need. Spatial choreography is clean—gondola, vial, echo, silence—no geography drift. The final image of glowing terrace under twilight recharges the opening prism, cementing setting as active participant.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.1)
    Kaleidoscopic waterfall and silver orchard are sharply sensed and refracted through goal-directed attention (“air hummed with latent energy”). The domed star-throne ceiling recurs as final image, reconfiguring the opening nostalgia into live responsibility. Setting constrains her path—she must physically peel paint and climb the spiral—earning micro-setting credit.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    Starlit charcoal sanctuary is evoked with selective sensory hits—starlight casting silhouettes, dust underfoot—each filtering through the keeper’s caretaker bias. The doorknocker ring functions as micro-setting: its tremble without a hand rewrites the spatial rule, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clean across the single move from threshold to seated dust. While no environmental detail literally blocks escape, the ashen ground and fading threshold metaphorically constrain the choice to stay and breathe together, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.9)
    The fungal grotto’s glow is sensory, selective, and instrumental—its light literally powers the experiment, so the setting constrains the climax. Spatial anchoring is clean; lab shares a wall with farm, no teleporting props. The bolt functions as micro-setting/extension of body; its rust and weight charge the final image. No generic cyber-punk filler; every named detail (blue-green spectrum, shadowseam) recurs in the diamond’s facets.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sepia reading room is sketched with quick, atmospheric strokes—gramophone, golden shadows, armchair—enough to orient. Micro-setting works: the crank handle becomes the tactile pivot. Spatial tracking is clean; no clutter. The room never exerts new constraints, so the setting remains backdrop rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    Greenhouse void, silver branches, and luminescent fruits create a tactile micro-setting that charges the final orb image. Detail is selective: gauntlet removed to feel paper, brass clasps, fading program—each object constrains the next action. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no floating props. The “endless night” remains atmospheric shorthand rather than a lived obstacle, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    The foster-care file room functions as micro-setting: dust thickness becomes the tool that guides choices. Selective sensory triage—brittle paper, brass chill, gray film—mirrors Elara’s tender precision. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drift. The button as recurring object charges the final image, satisfying the 9-band gate, yet environment does not actively constrain a high-stakes decision, keeping score just sub-exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Selective sensory detail—“shimmering water,” “rust-rimmed phone booth,” “weeping willows”—is filtered through Kael’s archivist gaze and stays economical. Weather and urban decay subtly guide route choice, meeting the 9+ gate that environment constrains tactics. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. The lagoon’s gold glow reappears at closure, charging the final image, though the city’s geography outside the reflection map remains schematic.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.1)
    Selective sensory triangulation—cool brass, dew on ferns, refracted dawn—keeps the grotto vivid without cataloging. The prism atrium functions as micro-setting: its flicker against Elias’s pauses is the only gauge of success, so environment drives tactic. Spatial choreography stays crisp as he moves from path to atrium to departure. One minor template loop (“dewdrops formed” repeated every paragraph) slightly dulls freshness, preventing 9-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    “Ashen skyborne arbor” is vividly particular; grey heavens versus mossy green creates visual tension. Micro-setting—leaf inscriptions, twig shrines—constrains Elara’s ritual and is tactile on every page. Spatial track is clean: leaves fall, monuments are built, speck transferred. Environment directly mirrors internal shift (grey → green), but symbolism borders on neat; still, it charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    Selective sensory focus—rot perfume, wet stone slips, glowing moss—mirrors Elara’s narrowing attention from cluttered workshop to womb-like cavern. The greenhouse glass and waterfall mist function as micro-settings that constrain motion (cut ankles, soaked boots) and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: trackable distances from falls to niche to grotto. The compass rose itself becomes a tactile setting-in-miniature, its star-etched surface the last “map” she touches.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rain-washed foundry is evoked through soot-scrubbed windows, cold forges, and the tactile sizzle of gold entering silver; environment doubles as crucible, literally constraining her workspace and metaphysically framing the “mending.” Meets the 9-band gate by charging the final image with this micro-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    Echo Gorge is sketched with acoustic immediacy—“whispering walls,” “amplified every sound”—and the harp’s warped notes give the place an agency that bends the spectral interface. Sensory layering is selective and POV-filtered; the chill, the shimmer, the golden sunrise all mirror internal ache without sliding into postcard cliché. The crocodile tooth functions as micro-setting anchor; its coolness in Elara’s palm at the end gives the final image a tactile, charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    The forest is not backdrop; its violet burn narrows perception, forces the mask memory, and supplies the strap artifact that reconfigures meaning. Glass bark, black water, and UV glare are filtered through Kaelen’s enhanced proprioception, constraining every step. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible moves. The setting’s micro-shifts mirror his internal calibration, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rooftop rope-market is sketched with airy, selective strokes: ozone, parchment, swaying planks—each filtering through Elara’s translator-eye. The lighthouse cliffs arrive as sensory override: rain-whipped hair, beam slicing dark, lens fragment heating—environment becomes body. Spatial choreography stays clean across the slip between worlds; no floating rooms. The twilight-to-storm palette mirrors the twilight of erased histories, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Setting supplies tactile micro-details—erratic fluorescent, thin dust patch, drop-ceiling rafters—that guide Leo’s hands and eyes. The circus office never exerts active resistance or limited resource; it’s backdrop rather than crucible. Still, the specificity of the dust analysis and the crack above the plaster cleanly anchors spatial logic.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Glass orchard library is not postcard scenery—its crystalline branches chime under stress, constraining Elara’s movements and later twisting in response to the rupture. Sea-of-clouds exterior provides scale and constant motion, charging the final image. Sensory economy is tight: sound (chiming), touch (cold bottle), sight (frost vectors) all serve the beat. Meets 9+ gate: the setting’s metamorphosis directly shapes the closing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.9)
    “Baroque asteroid” and golden time-strands are vivid, selective, and quickly anchored; the shard-as-micro-setting reappears to charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate, while mirror-covering ritual integrates with cultural logic, though spatial choreography inside the study is skimmed.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    The resonance chamber functions as both micro-setting and amplifier; its acoustic properties directly shape how the chip’s song can “tether” light, so environment constrains tactics. Sensory detail is selective—humming, oil-and-starlight fingers, crystalline notes—keeping momentum. Spatial choreography is clean: entrance of townsman, gear tarnish visible, Elian’s coaxing response. World rule (covenant of rust) is learned through observable consequence, not lecture.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Limestone dome and obsidian water are not postcard garnish—they narrow her options (no vials, no north). Compass-as-micro-setting charges the final image when its needle spins toward water. Sensory hierarchy obeys her vocation: scent > sight > sound. One hairline slip: “granite-quarry factory” reads as tell; a sensory cue would have nailed 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    Storm-arch’s turbine-like resonance and the salt-stiff slide function as micro-setting objects that literally steer tool angle and interior cadence; selective auditory detail (groaning stone, hum seeping into bones) mirrors Elara’s entrainment without tourist clutter. Irreplaceable environmental constraint: the arch’s drone paces her carving rhythm, charging the final polished spiral.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Amber pavilion, autumn leaf drift, and cathedral glass are economically re-used; each new slant of light changes what Elara can see, so setting directly enables discovery. Sensory balance favors visual, but the visual is plot-functional, not decorative. Spatial choreography is clean—bench, postcards, window angle track logically. The pavilion’s filtered glow returns in the final image, charging the mural’s starlit flowers with remembered light, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Obsidian lagoon and floating library are not postcard backdrops; both constrain action—lagoon supplies the cipher medium, library supplies the archival mission. Sensory economy is disciplined: “grains of sand between her toes” and “zeppelin humming” are filtered through Elara’s archivist attention, anchoring body and tool while charging the final image of clouds that now “contain” the hidden dunes.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    Paper-lantern cove is signaled early, anchors every beat, and charges the final image: lanterns retrofitted as solar capacitors glow over workshops. Spatial choreography is tight—bench, square, gardens track cleanly. Setting constrains choice: wind/sea resources dictate the new engineering. Micro-setting (the bottle as town-square monument) fulfills 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rooftop orchard is micro-set as a living archive—roots writhing through steel—so the garden constrains Elian’s posture and supplies the ancient energy that seeds the prophecy. Twig-snaps and wax petals anchor every beat; no description is mere postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    Icebound atrium is more than backdrop—frost thickens glass, starlight refracts onto seeds, spatially constraining how Elara kneels and sows. The micro-setting of her gloved palms cradling the egg functions as tactile “room” that charges the final image when the cap leaves her hand.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.1)
    “Windblown sanctuary above the clouds” is tactile—stone parapets, frayed rope, pressure drop—yet the environment never physically constrains or endangers Elara; it’s backdrop not crucible. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, but the setting’s only causal role is acoustic (bell carries), so the 9+ gate on constraint isn’t met.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    The station dome, glass shard, and meteor streaks function as micro-setting objects that constrain attention and finally charge the closing image; spatial choreography stays clean (viewport-to-console-to-swept corridor). Sensory selection favors visual motion and haptic warmth, filtered through Kael’s janitorial bias—dust, gleam, swept floors—so environment guides his ritual pacing. No overwrought sky-catalogue; each stellar detail is routed through his empathetic projection, keeping economy tight. Only minor slip: “primal elegance” is named twice, slightly abstract, but the final golden pool literalizes it, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Beekeeping oasis is sketched with sparse but sensor-targeted detail—crumbling honey-house shade, phantom hive hum, scent of honey and dust—each filtering through the recluse’s attention. The stained glass box functions as micro-setting: its warming panels and stillness interior constrain the final gesture and literally hold the covenant’s essence. Spatial choreography is minimal yet coherent; bodies track cleanly. For 9+ the environment would need to constrain tactical options more aggressively—e.g., threaten dehydration, collapse, or social intrusion—but here it mainly colours mood.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    Emerald silo’s green metal hum is tactile from line 1 and constrains every beat—light filters, rain timbre, garage-sale table placement—earning micro-setting status. Spatial choreography is pristine: debris pile → display table → stranger’s pointing finger all tracked in continuous motion. Object-as-setting (urn shard) is handled twice, its cool curve altering Elara’s stance and later cradled in closure, qualifying 9-gate. The only bar: world-rules of “numbers changed meaning” stay abstract, never tested by a concrete calendar contradiction, so environment stops just short of shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cobalt lagoon, rain-wet sand, and drifting kite supply tactile, shifting anchors that mirror the poet’s loosening grip on completion. The feather’s iridescence is re-seen in the final image, reweighting the premise. Environment never blocks action, but its mutability quietly enables the turn toward acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    The temple orchard is not backdrop but actor: the pillars’ slow hum and crystalline veins literally grow the interface Elara seeks. Copper glints, sap scents, and stone warmth are filtered through her caretaker gaze—practical, reverent, measured—so every sensory pick serves the remodel goal. Spatial choreography stays crisp: she begins at center, spirals outward, and the stag’s final bow occurs at a pillar she wired weeks earlier. The “living stone” premise is bold; its biological impossibility is left uncued, but because the story commits early and uses it to constrain choices, it passes the plausibility bar under lyrical rules.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rain-washed tower stones “dark and gleaming” are tactile and mirror the fresh internal reflection Elara undergoes. Overgrown sculpture path constrains her gait, forcing slow pilgrimage tempo that paces revelation. Fly amber operates as micro-setting/prop hybrid: its placement on the pedestal literally triggers the closure hologram, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible jumps from valley to tower chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    “Blooming jetty at twilight” is vividly particular: salt-laced dusk, glowing alien flowers, stone finger against black ocean. Sensory choice is POV-driven—he listens, kneels, handles pods—so setting evolves through动作. The reef’s silence and barren shore contrast the new blooms, charging the final image; environment steers where seeds will take. Micro-setting (pod powder, rail-perched birds) constrains the sowing tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.1)
    The scrapyard is sketched in selective, lived strokes—“between two eviscerated train cars,” “rusted remembrance”—that guide Baron's movement and echo his eviscerated memory. The leaf functions as micro-setting: its veins literally overlay the sound-grooves, constraining how he decodes the message. Cracked earth and wild hush remain consistent, never catalogued; each detail is filtered through a tracker’s eye for sign.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Deck, dead machinery, and liquid-drift starfield are sketched with sensory economy; body micro-setting (gilded cuff warming) doubles as emotional barometer. Time-dilated silence is environment and tone engine, narrowing perception to breath and hum. Tools—datapad, stylus, auxiliary sensors—are handled in goal-directed motion that charges the final image. No spatial slippage; world-rules stay consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    The spire is not backdrop but tool: ice face dictates handhold tactics, thin air narrows perception to “sickly green halo,” summit pedestal demands the lid-click that reweights the sky. Micro-setting—pocket sundial lid—literally recalibrates cosmos, satisfying 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but violet smears and resonant chime compress color-sound into a single beat. No white-room syndrome; geography stays coherent across ascent-descent.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.1)
    The whispering gallery is not backdrop; its acoustic feedback loop literally deciphers her foot-written archive, constraining how she can “unbind” stories. The chessboard’s missing pawns evolve from plague metaphor to open field, recharging the final image. Sensory triage is POV-true—she attends to marble resonance, light-shift of penumbra, tactile wood edge—rather than tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography holds: she orbits the board, finger trace is logged, echo returns from predictable arc.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mountain-bookstore is evoked through vertical motion—“shelves shifting as if acknowledging her intent”—so setting actively constrains choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s seer bias: mercury shimmer, obsidian texture, feather vane silk dominate over sound or scent. Spatial choreography is clean; the same niche, pool, and corridor reappear in altered states, preventing geography drift. Micro-setting (feather, stone) charges the final image when their texture becomes the conduit for self-reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    The time-frozen village is not postcard scenery—it actively withholds wind, breath, motion, forcing Elian to confront memory without temporal escape. Micro-setting inside the central hall (dusty tapestry, stone pedestal) constrains every tactile move; the loom-tight border literally decides his next finger placement. The platinum labyrinth’s weight in pocket vs. hand charges the final image when he sets it down. Sensory hierarchy obeys his tutor’s eye: pattern before sound, threads before sky.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is not backdrop but resonance chamber: canyon “echoing throat” literally bends language into new stakes. Bone towers and misty spire return with reweighted meaning after each poem, constraining listener interpretation. Sensory economy favors sound and touch—echo, sigh, tear—over visual clutter. Final image of air “thick with echoes” makes environment the container of cost, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    The acid sea is not backdrop; its vapor eats the workshop walls and forces the breath-clock that dictates every underwater beat. The brass gears, green-tinged brine, and weeping-goddess texture are filtered through Elian’s alchemical gaze, constraining his tool choice and dive time. The final image of the now-golden charm re-weights the corrosive setting: the same acid that threatens also literally gilds the repaired memories. Meets the 9+ gate by charging the closing image through environment.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    Coastal textures are vivid but selective—“salt-stung,” “peeling wood,” “scent of brine and ancient stone”—all filtered through Elara’s painterly eye. The cave’s shimmering roof and rock shelf directly enable the shell discovery and later relinquishment, fulfilling the 9+ micro-setting test. Weather and geography stay consistent; no tourist-catalog excess. Dock and cave anchor two discrete sensory palettes that mirror before/after emotional states.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    Cobalt walls refract sunrise into “serene blue haze,” anchoring color and mood; the spiral stair and lens room are spatially tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.1)
    Starlit metal island is sketched through action—etching floor-circle, crawling under dead consoles—rather than catalog. Bronze foot’s cool weight and green oxide serve as micro-setting that constrains every alignment choice. Sensory economy favors touch and kinaesthetic scale over visual spectacle, matching claustrophobic grief. Environment silently scripts her只能用 scrap and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hanging orchard is not backdrop but tactical hazard—slick paths force her to secure the basket one-handed while climbing; lightning-slick stones dictate the copper-rig timing. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound: truffles’ scent = promise of future, storm’s metallic tang = immediate threat. Micro-setting (stone hut table) hosts the ritual; the orchard’s root-grip mirrors her new internal “wall.” Final image reweights the setting: ravine becomes home, not prison, charged by the earned silence.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    The opal dock is not backdrop but perceptual filter: planks slick with mist, beacon rhythm, sea glass sorted by tide—details chosen to mirror Elias’s narrowing attention. Micro-setting triumphs: the dried Edelweiss’s velvet nap against salt-cracked fingers makes alpine memory tactile. One over-cranked phrase—“softly gray orb”—veers toward poetic inflation, but the enviro-object nexus passes the 9+ gate by forcing the final decision: only when fog lifts can he mail the letter, ending borrowed memories.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Bioluminescent fungi, midsummer flowers, and type-metal odor ground the cavern in sensory hierarchy filtered through a map-dealer’s eye; typography carved into stone literalizes his world. Micro-setting triumph: the matrix chip-as-key is *environment* here, not prop, and its click charges the final image. Spatial choreography clean from shop→fields→crevice→cathedral-sized chamber; no impossible positions. Visual dominance edges toward 8.8 but scent + touch compensate; still, one non-visual beat (echo-location click of water droplets) would have secured the last 0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Micro-setting rules: the ember grotto’s pulsing orange ceiling and dripping silver mercury physically constrain her epiphany; no other locale could supply this revelation. Cloud-sea and thinning air are filtered through her bodily strain, not travelogue. Fireflies reappear as barometer—alive at shared exhale, dead at descent—charging the final image. Cobalt/ashen color palette is consistent yet never catalogued.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cabin, body, and scroll function as micro-setting: the scroll’s pulsing light constrains the final act of inscription, turning artifact into altar. Selective sensory detail (charred stick, bruised sky) mirrors internal erosion without cataloguing. Spatial coherence is maintained across dream shards by returning to the table; environment never overwhelms the single-scene window. The grave-clearing itself is implied, not staged, so the setting’s fullest constraint is conceptual rather than tactile—enough to meet the 9+ gate but not exceed it.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)
    Fog and condensation serve as micro-setting that constrains visibility and echoes Elara’s occluded sense; water-clock drip supplies tactile rhythm she can feel. Details are filtered through her professional eye (she notices proximity, temperature, not visual tourist items). The birthing screw is a “tool-as-setting” handled twice, charging the final image. Small slip: “ticking shadows” clashes with water-clock mechanism—sound cue slightly muddled.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment–as-constraint is vivid: the levitating rock limits motion, the storm supplies temporal pressure, and the tea steam acts as micro-anchor that charges the exhalation image. Sensory selection stays urgent—crow-quill tactile detail, crystalline auditory fragility—filtered through rune-scholar POV. Selective economy keeps world-rules implicit yet consistent; no static catalogue. Final image would lose resonance absent the aerial precarity, satisfying 9+ gate.

    “Ancient temple library lost in time” is vivid but static; dust, darkness, and infinity repeat without evolving. The dictionary’s frayed spine is the one tactile anchor, yet its physical state never constrains a choice. Spatial choreography is impossible to track—aisles, mural, pedestal float in white-room sequence. Atmosphere serves as mood wallpaper rather than obstacle or resource.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    The granite outcrop, low sun glints, and water-channel gurgles are filtered through a man who reads the world as chronometry; every tactile detail (worn-smooth key, metal flash inside the clock) doubles as metaphysical evidence. Horizon line as micro-setting constrains the final insight: its perfect edge dissolves, forcing the conceptual flip. No orientational debt; anchors are clear by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.0)
    Farm, body, and laser button jointly constrain tactics: beam refraction dictates frequency shift; soft earth demands silent stride; mushroom glow times the pre-dawn clock. The same triad charges the closure image—“the laser pointer button felt lighter”—making the tool’s re-weighting the final cost. Sensory economy is exact: one smell (damp earth), one color range (blue glow / red beam), one haptic reduction. No extraneous breadth; every detail either tightens choice or reconfigures at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    Rain-slick stone, damp-paper scent, and the mica pane’s fracturing glow are selectively filtered through Elara’s probability-trained eye, charging the final image.

    Jetty-as-body functions as tool: splintered planks, salt-slick grain, and night-blooms constrain where Elara can crouch, steep, and write. Sensory hierarchy is archivist—visual fades first, touch and scent dominate—so every jasmine breath or silver chill is also data. Spatial choreography is flawless: satchel, bowl, ink bottle, locket move in clean sequence with no teleporting props. The blooming twilight itself charges the final image, glowing as the covenant’s new parchment.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    Station-plus-ivy is not backdrop but tactile constraint: mossy bench dictates seating ritual, crumbling arch echos “structural integrity” gag.

Environment forecloses the option to stay, forcing Elara’s exit.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ultrasonic forest functions as micro-setting: frequency-trees supply the musical trail that guides every step; gully’s sudden hush supplies the final reconfiguration. Spatial choreography is immaculate—staff taps, note-dew, ring pressed into soil—no floating bodies. Sensory economy favors touch and bone-conduction, perfectly tuned to a blind POV. Environment directly constrains the climax: the stillness of the gully is what allows the earth-chord to become audible.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    The gravitational anomaly is not backdrop but active antagonist: it swells, churns, then softens in direct response to her signals, guiding her tactical choices. Micro-setting object—the dried-up pen—constrains the climax: its uselessness forces her to transmit via console, not ink, charging the final image when she still clasps it. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: warped light and “time felt thin” are filtered through interpreter training, not tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: console, pen, transmission array remain consistent across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.3)
    Harbor moonlight, lapping pilings, and salt-sigh breeze are filtered through Elian’s lonely attention, guiding his choice to “compose the void.” The camera-as-frame and the dock’s spatial logic remain coherent; bodies track cleanly. While the wider world is sketched, the micro-setting of dock, tide, and lens constrains the final perceptual shift, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dust-laden corridors and slashed canvas are selective, pressure-filtered details; the tapestry itself becomes the micro-setting that constrains the final act of mending.

Synesthetic detail filters through Elara’s urgency—trumpet-blast gold brushes skin—so environment and body merge. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible moves. World rules remain consistent: coin governs echo navigation, garden answers song with light.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Light studio anchors every tactical choice—darkness required for long exposure, LED wand as brush, pedestal placement refracting geode layers; environment directly constrains how recall is translated into image. Micro-setting (geode sliver) doubles as tactile tool and optical prism, charging the closure image. Sensory selection skews visual, but it matches the profession and stakes; other senses enter via somatic markers (warmth of hand, cool shade). No spatial drift; body–camera–pedestal positions track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    Coastal cave network is more than backdrop: saline drafts narrow perception, mineral veins literally light the path, constraining Kaelen’s route and charging the final image. Micro-setting (floating fossil as lantern) fulfills the 9+ gate. Sensory selection skews to tactile and thermal, reflecting the heat-map vocation. One minor drift: “labyrinthine” is repeated twice, a small plaque on otherwise razor-sharp specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    The amber warehouse is not backdrop; its “towering shelves of preserved time” literally supply the buttons that enable the tactic. Micro-setting objects—petrified-wood bench, canyon-echo jar—are handled in successive beats and constrain how she can listen/sort. Spatial choreography is clean: she opens drawers, handles buttons, steps back; no geography drift. Final image charges the same setting as it “seemed to breathe,” reweighting the warehouse from archive to living possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Mist-cold air, snow patterns, and engraved pillbox texture are filtered through Elias’s spy perception; the pillbox acts as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean from bluff to cabin to ridge. Weather both cloaks and reveals, directly shaping stealth choices. “Silver hush” motif risks over-saturation but is saved by final reweighting at the bleeding close.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fog, river, mud, and ticking gutters are not backdrop but constraint: the coachman must wait until the gutters fall silent before he can move. Yarn needle as micro-setting recharges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—he notices frog croak and mist density shifts because his trade is reading ambience. Deduction: no weather effect on body (cold, wetness) is woven into the final beat, keeping it just under the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Desert, hives, smoke, and glass are filtered through a potter’s tactile eye; each detail performs double duty—world-building and interior state.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.0)
    Harbor, moon, and cliff crevice are filtered through Elara’s gardener eye; the polished mirror and slick dock-post are tactile, choice-guiding objects. Spatial choreography is clean—fire-escape descent to rowboat to cliff-shadow—and the setting’s silver sheet directly enables her light-instilling tactic. The mirror-as-tool satisfies the 9+ gate: it constrains the final image by literally directing the beam that reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    Tidal library is not backdrop but tactical resource: floating books physically deliver forgotten pages to her after her stance shift, proving environment rewards her decision. Micro-setting (body + sundial) constrains every beat—she can’t read history until brass surface catches the hum, so setting gate is satisfied. Sensory economy is tight: cloud-swell, obsidian pedestal, bone-borne hum all filtered through her Aetherian-biased perception. No spatial drift; geography remains legible across the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.3)
    The thrush-nest twig functions as micro-setting that literally dictates the labyrinth’s architecture; the lotus temple’s rain-beaded petals supply the prismatic refraction that mirrors the final emotional spectrum. Spatial choreography remains clean as visitors circle inward. Weather (recent cloud burst) affects footing and mood, causally linking to the soft earth that yields beneath her feet. Sensory selection is POV-filtered: Elara notices spiral patterns, not tourist landmarks.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    Console hum and bone-felt subsonic thrum act as micro-setting; the outdated transmitter knobs constrain tactics and are handled twice, charging the final image of the room as shield.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    The nexus is evoked with kinetic, sense-driven specifics: “walls shifted and floors curved rebelliously,” “starlight pierced the darkness,” drafts tasted of “cold iron.” The compass is handled twice, its pivoting leg charging the final blueprint beat. Spatial choreography stays coherent as passages narrow; the keeper’s organ loft is economically placed. Weather and occupational detail are absent, but the micro-setting (body + tool) constrains choice sufficiently for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    Quarry mist, wet stone, and snagged quartz are tactile, selective, and filter through Elara’s non-visual bias. The ribbon operates as micro-setting: its frayed velvet against granite constrains her reconstruction of the fall.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Weather-station micro-setting is sketched with tight, purposive sensory picks (whirring sensors, thin charged air) that constrain access to data and dive tech. The submerged coffin plank is a textbook micro-setting-as-object that charges the final image. One clarity slip: spatial ground between archive console, lab, and storm window drifts during the probe coordination beat.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.1)
    The pullout’s scaffold wrap, glass flake, and shifting cloud-shadows are tactile, bias-filtered through Elias’s musician-eye; the fence fabric literally maps the decoding action, satisfying the 9+ gate of constraining choice. Spatial choreography is clean—body, violin case, and shard positions track. Weather and altitude stay consistent, subtly affecting breath and sound carry. One minor over-adjective moment (“stark beauty”) is POV-plausible and does not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    The circus train is textured through Leo’s robber-eye: scuff marks read as territorial grammar, dust smells like old sawdust and crime. Micro-setting works—the foreign bills function as both map and mirror, constraining the final choice to leave them behind. Spatial choreography stays coherent; light through broken boards evolves with dusk, charging the exit image.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.5)
    The swirling orchard-vortex is never a postcard; its churning petals and ozone tang constrain movement and supply the ritual energy Elara harvests. Micro-setting objects—the ice shard, the flesh-eating seed—are handled tactilely and charge the final image (seed crumbles to dust as price). Spatial choreography is clean: concentric circles widen logically from eye to roots. A hairline slip into emblematic symbolism (“echoes of past failures”) keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cobalt glade breathes, pulses, pricks: selective sensory triad that mirrors Elara’s narrowing attention under pressure. The clipping functions as micro-setting and tool; its thorns literally break skin to open portal, satisfying 9+ gate. Weather/ozone scent deepens twice then exits, avoiding checklist cycling. Spatial choreography keeps her feet, roots, portal and light-path in consistent positions; no impossible geography.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Catacomb orchard is not backdrop—root-bone lattice literally grips the card, constraining her final gesture. Sensory economy obeys POV: amber-gray glow narrows to card, ribs, soil under fingers. “Soil woven with ancient remains” teaches the world rule early; no exposition dump. Micro-setting (rib cradle) doubles as altar, charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.5)
    Quarry trailer is sketched with dusty specificity and body-in-space cues; the grille cloth functions as micro-setting that finally charges the wall. Sensory selection stays tight to Leo’s audio-tuned eye. No object or place constrains a choice in real time, so 9+ gate fails. Environment is atmospheric but passive.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Magnetic arbor above clouds functions as both macro-setting and micro-tool: its lattice constraints dictate Elian’s every experimental move, while the levitating stones become the charged final image. Sensory hierarchy favors magnetic hum, metallic scent, and vertiginous chill—filtered through a philologist’s bias for pattern over spectacle. No tourist catalog; every vine and pulse is touched or adjusted. The environment literally reconfigures in closure, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tidal atrium is evoked through motion and sound—brass gears clicking, water sheeting back—rather than catalog. The bamboo creel functions as micro-setting: its weave literally contains volatile identities, constraining how Elian acts under full moon. Sensory economy is high; every detail either guides choice or mirrors the “storm-and-calm” paradox, charging the final image of the empty creel swaying.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Crystal caves function as micro-setting and final throne; iridescent shell, stalagmite, and pearl are tactile objects that constrain placement and ritual. Sensory triage is POV-driven: distant chime, lift of light. Spatial choreography is crisp. The caves mirror internal thaw without overt symbology. Setting allows the final illumination without breaking plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ivy-choked platform and shattered waiting-room glass constrain movement and echo internal decay, forcing her to the graffiti wall. Accordion-as-micro-setting charges closure: its taped scars mirror the station’s rust and her own mended guilt. Sensory hierarchy is biased to her chronicler eye—faded ink, scuffed tile—rather than tourist catalog. Environment guides the final choice to play; setting is indispensable to the turning.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mist, glow, and echo times create a tactile micro-setting that directly constrains her navigation method. Spatial choreography is clean: footsteps, delays, and threshold shimmer track without drift. The library’s grandeur is glimpsed only at climax, keeping economy. No environment or tool charges the final image beyond the watch’s stillness, capping 8.8 per gate.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    The velvet-lined case, sweat-slick glass, and frost-cracking sound form a tactile triad that pressures the final choice; the violin’s cold literally burns her palms, making renunciation visceral. Midsummer heat is not backdrop but antagonist—droplets condense, ice melts, time drips. Spatial choreography is flawless: case → desk → window → horizon, each object handled and altered. The observatory’s fabric swallows echo, so the propagated seeds fly in pre-dawn hush—environment as final image.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto, clouds, cliffside trees, and hairpin form a tight micro-setting that constrains action: height grants perspective, stone demands carving, hairpin literally unlocks the alcove. Sensory range is narrow (cool silver, rough stone, mist) but POV-filtered and purposeful; spatial choreography stays consistent across three tree ascents. The “vineyard hush” metaphor is over-leveraged yet functions as tonal glue rather than static decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lighthouse grasses, wind-rung chimes, and the hollow shard form a micro-setting triad that actively constrains choice: the chimes dictate Aris’s next line, the shard mediates every revelation. Dawn breeze is not backdrop—it strips Elara’s conviction in real time. Spatial choreography clean: bench→tower→sea movement tracks without drift. One marginal near-generic: “weathered bench” could be sharper, but the shard and cloak compensate.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Magnetic grotto doubles as micro-setting: its pulse limits dialogue length, forces inward focus, and recharges the final image. Starlight on mist is filtered through Kael’s narrowing perception, not catalogued. Spatial choreography is tight—floating rock, forest canopy, downward tug—no impossible drift. Environment constrains the trance depth; thus meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    The canyon of bone towers functions as both acoustic instrument and metaphysical compass; their hollow resonance directly enables the final anchoring of the pulse, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory selection is biased to Elara’s quest—sound, dust-weight, stone texture—creating an atmosphere that guides the stillness goal without tourist excess.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    “Brilliant dimness” and “icebound spire” are vivid, selective, and thematically apt; sensory balance skews visual but justifies the POV’s mage-aesthetic. Micro-setting (the loose rune-etched stone) constrains discovery and thus choice, meeting 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clear; no geography drift. Weather/light remain static but intentionally so, reinforcing stasis theme.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sensory economy is superb: “meteor hush” and “gas lamps push back darkness” filter through a man who works by smell of salt and creak of planks. The sunken-library micro-setting constrains the climax—air pocket, waterlogged shelves, stone pedestal—all tactile, no tour-guide lists. Recurrent lantern light refracts through water onto library walls, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless: row, dive, surface inside hull, orb drawer opens without impossible motion.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ambered deck, obsidian table, and foreign coins supply tactile micro-setting that constrains ritual motion. Spatial logic stable; sensory detail selective (clink, static crackle, amber light). Coins as recurring object charge final map image, satisfying 9+ gate. Slight repetition of “ambered” and “static” without fresh sensory twist keeps score sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    The observatory dome acts as a lens-tuned crucible; the dusty prism array is handled, turned, breathed on, so the setting itself is the tool that constrains tactics. Dusk’s bruised light is not backdrop—it is the raw material the method consumes, making time-of-day inseparable from action. Spatial choreography is spotless: the unrolled atlas receives the first beam, the shards settle in a “delicate, permanent pattern” that can be walked around but not removed. The final image keeps the observatory alive, scattering light forever, so the place becomes the memory engine he bequeaths to future seekers.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sapphire viaduct is never static backdrop: its surface cools the shards, its crystalline hum amplifies the spell, its dawn glow times the final cadence. Dew-drop intervals translate directly into spell rhythm—setting becomes tool. Spatial choreography clean: fragments, blood, bell, river all track. Sensory hierarchy respects Elian’s narrowing attention: visuals (gleam, light) dominate, touch (cool stone, warming bronze) anchors magic beat. No excess; every detail either constrains choice or charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.5)
    Midnight Ridgeway’s twilight hush is atmospherically potent and filters consistently through Elias’s vigilance. The resurfacing architecture (mud-bleached town hall, clutch of photographs) is sketched with selective sensory strokes that guide his discovery without stalling momentum. Micro-setting—the sapphire label in hand—charges the final memorial image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; only the reservoir’s recession physics is accepted without question.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Floating rock dojo is not backdrop but tool: its precipitous edge forces the literal risk of falling during ritual, constraining Kael’s stance. Mist-shrouded valleys and shifting wars are filtered through his narrowed attention, keeping description urgent rather than scenic. The jar’s amber glow and brain silhouette recur with shifting valence, charging the final merge image. Spatial choreography is clean: jar placed before him, hands positioned, energy lines mapped—no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    Nocturnal brook, mossy stone, damp earth—selective sensory triad mirrors quiet ideation. Micro-setting functions: brook’s “flow” patterns the puzzle structure she envisions. Setting never constrains a live choice, so 9-band gate fails; seed is the object that charges closure, not environment. Still, atmosphere is vivid, consistent, and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tunnel is not backdrop but instrument: curved stone vibrates, amplifies, and re-prices sound into felt cost. The pull-cord handle operates as micro-setting—its warming wood and frayed rope literally transmit will and constrain grip under crescendo. Spatial choreography is immaculate: blowers positioned, angles calculated, distances tracked. Weather is replaced by off-key wind whose temperature the stone registers—an environment that alters tactical sound-weaving. Final image: the cord cools, releasing the reweighted laughter into stone memory—setting charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Frozen garden, skeletal branches, shifting mist, and the pendant’s evolving temperature are returned to in almost every paragraph, constraining stance (cannot rush, must absorb). Micro-setting rule satisfied: pendant-as-tool charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy narrows to cold/hum/ice-glyph visual under crisis. No spatial drift; geography stays coherent across the single slow step.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ember nexus is not backdrop; its eternal coals supply the literal heat that fuses silver fragments and forces Elian to act before twilight fades. Bowl-shaped depression traps smoke and sight, making the explosion-to-reform visible only to him—setting as stage and witness. Micro-setting inside the crozier’s splinters (cracks “spider-web”) mirrors his internal fracture. Final image of nexus burning “brighter, as if in approval” recharges the place with agency.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tower grate under her boots, the dish’s metallic hum, and the shard’s sound-absorbing dark are tactile micro-settings that constrain every motion she can make. Weather (lunar perigee wind) is not backdrop but literal sway-force that times the tuning beat. Spatial choreography stays pinned—no impossible reaches or floating props—so the setting charges the final image of the gorge as cradle, not abyss. Meets 9+ gate: the shard-as-tool literally focuses the closing insight.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.1)
    Spectral grotto is more than postcard: starlight angles determine hourglass rotation, stalactites become tether points for timeline threads. Micro-setting (hourglass, radio) constrains every tactical move. Spatial choreography is crisp—pools, planks, beams of light track cleanly. Sensory palette is narrow (cold, damp, silver) but purposeful; tight focus fits 700-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.0)
    The optical gallery is rendered through motion—walls melt, ceilings open, floors curve—so setting constrains Elara’s every step and literally shapes her loom-side stance. Light absorption by the loom, the sinew’s heartbeat-pulse, and the forest of memory-trees are sensory specifics that evolve with causality, not decoration. Spatial choreography stays clean: the tapestry erupts → she steps back → gallery settles into new form; bodies and objects never teleport. Environment charges the final image: the gallery’s new “beautifully chaotic tapestry” is both physical space and metaphorical mind-state, reweighting the stake without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Compressed sensory triad—low resonance hum, translucent coral corridors, holographic star bloom—anchors benthic life without itinerary clutter. Anchor-link micro-setting recurs, finally charges closure image. Spatial choreography clean: Elara’s pocket draw, laser pointer arc, student semi-circle tracked. Weather not needed; pressure is intellectual. Nano-ceramic phrase is lone tech splinter, quickly subsumed by coral tactility—does not obstruct.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Glass-domed atrium, mist, and marble bench are sketched with chilly acoustic specificity; the hearing-aid-as-micro-setting constrains every tactical move; final image of warming photo crystallizes the stake—no excess geography, all pressure-filtered through Elara’s tuned perception.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sub-ocean facility, sparking cables, phase-shifting corridors, and the codex’s gold fleck are rendered through Elara’s urgent senses—sound of spark, feel of mist-wall, sight of glowing path. Spatial choreography is clean: tunnel → corridor → cable hall → core chamber; bodies and distances track. The gold fleck itself acts as micro-setting, guiding movement and charging the closing light. Weather/tide are external timers that reshape access, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Opal dome, snow, and ink pool function as micro-setting objects that constrain tactics: only the ink surface can organise data, and the ice-quiet allows the ritual. Shard temperature, ink shimmer, and dome glow are tactile and POV-filtered; no tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean—shard moves from floor → hand → drawer, anchoring the arc. Weather (falling snow) returns in the last paragraph to reinforce stillness, charging the final image; meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.5)
    The canyon of bone towers is not backdrop; its acoustic properties create the only possible crucible for her translation task, and the final harmonics are shaped by its walls. Micro-setting extends to her glowing veins and the diamond’s flaw, both of which constrain how sound can travel. Spatial choreography is immaculate: flock, tunnel mouth, pedestal, pressure wave all tracked without drift. The setting evolves—bone absorbs, then reflects, then channels the new silence she births.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Underground garden is no backdrop: levitating herbs and anchor-stones actively constrain how Aris plants the arrowhead and how bodies reshape. Gravity trait is taught early, paid off in climactic weightless dance. Sensory hierarchy favors scent and kinesthetic drift, mirroring emotional buoyancy. Micro-setting (arrowhead as portable lodestone) charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sky-bridge, crystalline arches, and stone patrol paths are sketched with economy; spatial choreography remains coherent as Elara descends.

Micro-setting (locust shell in railing) constrains her attention and seeds the plan, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.1)
    Cobalt arcade at twilight is economically sketched through neon, pinball machine, and drone whir; sensory choice mirrors Elian’s furtive mood. Micro-setting (the bottle’s hum) almost acts as character, but the arcade itself never constrains exit routes or supplies resources—its role is decorative, not tactical. Spatial choreography is clean; the hush deepens convincingly, yet the environment stays static across the scene.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Stated stakes—“broken promises heal”—remain abstract; no concrete letter or family name is risked, so the cost never localizes. Pressure plateaus: surveillance gaps are named, not tested; the thunderstorm bottle is inserted without obstacle or price. Escalation is a single smooth drone descent rather than a narrowing of options; the moment qualifies as micro-turn but not meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Environment, body, and tool (halo fragment) constrain choices: the fragment literally guides rebuild and finally crowns the carousel. Peeling circus cars, misting hush, and wind-bell chimes filter through carpenter’s priors—sound and wood and metal. Spatial choreography clean as he moves car-to-car; weather (mist) affects visibility and tempo. Micro-setting (the brass halo) charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    The curved reading room, stained-glass atoms, and scarf-as-key are tactile, choice-constraining micro-settings; negative-curvature geometry is learned through her finger-tracing action, anchoring the impossible doorway in lived detail rather than tourist-catalog listing.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    The watercolor palette functions as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice; its dwindling light directly shapes when Elara can shoot. Archipelago whispers act as environmental pressure, timed to crescendo at the shutter release. Sensory selection favors shifting light spectra over visual tourism, keeping detail urgent. Spatial choreography is clean—jetty, tripod, horizon line remain consistent—so the final image charges prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “shadowed nexus” is kept micro: shifting shadows, starlight pierces, an archway etched with dread—details are few but atmospheric. Sensory range is narrow (mostly visual) yet selective, matching the parable mode. Spatial choreography stays loose, acceptable for a mythic space; no impossible moves. The lock of hair functions as the sole tangible object-setting and is handled on-page, satisfying the micro-setting gate for 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sunken greenhouse + shipwrecks aren’t backdrop—they’re the encryption lock: mast angles = star map, glass shards = fractured sky; setting actively constrains every tactical move. Mushroom clusters function as micro-setting that must be physically rotated to unlock memory—environment becomes tool. Final image of water receding and hulls sighing recharges every prior nautical ruin. Salt-rot apple smell threads through beats, anchoring POV bias.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    The forgotten library is rendered through tactile micro-setting: dust under shuffle-steps, cool glass against skin, tea-stain angles measured by finger. Shard-mirrors function as both archive and mirror—literal tools that constrain how memory can be handled. The swing’s creak off-page is the only auditory anchor, tightening the hush until its final silence lets the visual deepen. This environmental pressure directly shapes the mentor-pupil stakes and charges the closing image of the archivist finally walking forward.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    Waterfall mist as bridge, seed glowing in response to mist, sapling drinking spray—environment actively supplies the method and reagents. The parapet’s edge acts as threshold object, constraining where she can plant and forcing her to balance between torrent and soil. Sensory economy is tight: no visual catalogue, only the shimmer-color that matters. Meets 9- gate: setting charges the final image (sapling’s gold-blue leaves echo waterfall mist) but lacks a hard constraint that would block an alternate choice, so caps at 8.4.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prismatic starlight and salt-crusted net fibers give tactile immediacy; the crystals refract tension onto the actors. Spatial ground is clean—needle, net, masks form a single ritual station. Setting never constrains or endangers; it decorates more than it pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rain-scoured vault, mossy henge, damp stone under fingertips—details are selective, body-close, and directly guide the reopening action. The frescoed celestial map inside the chapel reprises Elara’s own torn parchment, charging the final image with pinpoint specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sunken-library micro-setting is tactile—aqueous pages swollen like tumors, captain’s desk fissure—and directly supplies the hidden drawer / globe that catalyzes the final reweighting. POV-filtered sensory triage (pressure gauges, silt breath) keeps detail purposive; environment mirrors interior without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography holds as she enters, lifts, writes, ascends; no anchor drift.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.8)
    Flower press bolt plate functions as micro-setting: its grooves direct pigment flow and literally stamp the sigils—tool choice alters outcome. Misty cloud-courtyard is not generic backdrop; altitude affects how storm electricity activates the graffiti, turning environment into co-protagonist. Sensory hierarchy favors sound (tinkersong chimes) and electro-static scent, mirroring the data-ghost’s arrival. Setting detail is selective, not touristic; final image recharges the same bolt-plate and mist, meeting 9+ gate.

    Gondola, telescope, and thin-air sensation anchor every beat; brass chills the hand, deck sways underfoot, cloud types filter through professional gaze. Selective meteorological diction keeps the sky from becoming mere backdrop, though the environment never physically constrains or endangers Elias enough to charge the finale.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    The hollowed tree-library is evoked through lived motion—curved shelves, oak-ink scent, lectern compartment—rather than postcard catalog. Micro-setting objects (warm-spined book, crystalline lenses, crushed quartz) constrain tactics: she chooses them, grinds them, refracts light through them. Spatial choreography is clean; the safe opens at a reachable lectern, never teleporting. Weather enters only at the end when the external sky survives, sharpening the thematic counter-image.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Brass fittings, creaking timbers, and the etched hopscotch grid give tactile specificity; the starling strands supply a luminous, kinetic counter-texture.

    “Glacial blue” arches, frost-laden shelves, and the velvet-lined gear case give tactile, POV-filtered detail that constrains movement (cold slows fingers, ice must be chipped). The hall of mirrors functions as environment-as-antagonist, forcing the uncap action under ethereal light; its reflective logic reconfigures Elara’s perception, charging the closure image. Micro-setting (gear case, vial embedded in mirror frame) doubles as plot hinge, satisfying the 9+ gate. One slip: “misty stairs” and “frosted stone” echo familiar winter catalogues rather than fresh sensory idiom.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.1)
    Floating rock arches function as both geography and resonant amplifier; their mineral veins literally constrain the final tactic. The bell-as-blossom object and butterfly cocoon provide micro-setting anchors that charge the closure image. Sensory hierarchy favors sound (chime) and light (nebula) over visual catalog, fitting crisis-narrowed perception. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from derelict garden to highest arch without impossible jumps.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    The lighthouse lantern room, the porcelain head’s internal glow, and the thickening pane of hush are not backdrop but tools that constrain how Elara can act (she must whisper, not shout, because the hush absorbs sound). The cracked-to-golden head literally recharges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is immaculate: spiral stairs → pedestal → beam pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Micro-setting (nut, quartz, copper twist) functions as charged tool that constrains assembly pace and final dismantling. Cliffside labyrinth and mechanical birds supply immediate spatial pressure; birds’ grinding gears tighten threat. Sensory balance—visual arrows, cool shell, wind-borne whispers—filtered through Elara’s caretaker bias. Environment directly shapes tactics: duck outcrop, timed projections; setting charges final image of frost on gnarled trees.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    The braided ravine is tactile and chemically read: wet stone, surfactant poetry, micro-eddies that literally seed the polymer idea. Foam micro-morphology becomes the crucible object that constrains the final scientific choice; environment charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.9)
    “Glass orchard library” and “cloud-wood counter” are vivid coinages that stay consistently handled; the transparent branches and floating architecture constrain movement and supply visual stakes. Sensory economy is biased toward sight, but the cool droplet of moonlight on the palm supplies a tactile anchor. Spatial choreography is ghost-light—no floorplan, yet the circle traced on glass and the starlit path are tracked without contradiction. The setting never fully pressures tactics (no time limit, resource scarcity, or social friction), so it charges theme more than choice.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.1)
    Desert fortress, rain-slick stone, and emergent coral pavilion are rendered with sensorial economy: “gleaming under a bruised sky,” “icy coral walls shimmering with captured tears.” Micro-setting (chef’s fingers on cold coral) functions as tool that channels emotional contagion—environment directly constrains the decisive touch. Spatial choreography is clean: ramparts → courtyard → archway → pillar → exit. Weather affects action—rain ceases as grief is absorbed, mirroring softening of frozen remorse—charging the final image.World rules (memory-taste, contagious touch) are learned through action without exposition dump.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    Star-mottled sheet-music dust and brass weight etched with constellations supply tactile specificity; the circular library and frozen gears are sketched with economical strokes. Space stays coherent as Elara climbs. No object or place constrains a final choice, so the 9-gate isn’t cleared, but atmosphere supports the choral-textural design.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    Moonlit canyon, broken mirror, and Elara’s own body form a single micro-setting that actively refracts choice; the cracked glass literally re-angles what memories can enter. Sensory hierarchy is tight—visual spectrum, cold stone, bone quake—mirroring internal states without overt symbolic nudging. The mirror’s final silent state recharges the opening image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    Inverted-gravity logic stays consistent and is discovered through boots-on-sky touch, not exposition. Mist, stalactite-floors, and manuscript radiance work as micro-setting that directly constrains foot-speed and path-finding. Spatial choreography tracks; no floating rooms. Final image uses the doodle’s faded light to charge the “blaze” motif, satisfying the 9+ test of object-charged closure. Detail economy is high; some lines verge on purple (“dizzying cascade of stone and air”) but pattern-teaches the lyric heightening so no penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    The grove is never catalogued; instead, the alder’s bark, the porcelain’s cold gloss, and the soil’s hush are filtered through Elara’s ear, becoming the micro-setting that literally supplies the instrument’s bridge and the final sonic cavity. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no floating props—and the porcelain’s evolving texture (webbed cracks → resonant bridge) charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    The nexus is not postcard backdrop; its magnetic pull literally guides the pivotal gesture, while twilight’s shift to indigo tracks tightening time. Basalt stone operates as micro-setting, its dent locking into the lodestone ridge to enable the climax. Sensory layering is selective—hum, pulse, bent light—filtered through Kael’s strategic attention. No environmental detail is squandered, though air/humidity/temperature could have sharpened one more beat.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.0)
    “Shadowed workshop under stars” is tactile—dusty windows, soft star-glow, cluttered devices—and the spatial choreography holds as Elara moves to the desk. The diary-as-micro-setting qualifies and constrains the final choice: she closes it, not the sky, giving the object last-moment charge. However, no environmental detail ever threatens or complicates her method; the workshop is backdrop, not crucible. Hence it meets but does not exceed the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Treetop village is evoked through motion—creaking basket, swaying bridges—rather than postcard catalog. Olfactory topography dominates: soil, ozone, decay, each filtered by Elara’s professional priorities. The seed itself serves as micro-setting that constrains every beat; its changing scent-state alters her tactics. Spatial choreography is tight: balcony pot, journal on knee, wind direction tracked without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.1)
    Veridia’s floating arches, inverted river, and glowing moss are vividly sketched and filter through Kaelen’s pilot gaze. The anti-grav skiff and quartz-glint stone act as tactile tools that constrain steering choices under inversion. Spatial choreography stays clean; no white-room syndrome. Environment charges the final image: the upward spiral pool mirrors the earlier ribbon river, reweighting the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Container labyrinth, grime, rust-streaks, wayward draft: selective sensory triage filtered through investigator’s professional gaze. Wind patterns are not backdrop but tactical intelligence that will constrain future flight paths. Spatial choreography is crisp—corridors, clearing, wreck scar—no floating geography. Environment is literally the antagonist; removing it collapses stakes and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ice cavern, prism-songs, and synesthetic spectra are rendered with tactile economy; the sculpted hush functions as a micro-setting that constrains acoustics and timing. Selective sensory detail mirrors Elara’s perception without stalling momentum, and the final image of glowing ice walls recharges the opening palette.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Thunder-echo range and canyon hush are filtered through Kael’s guilt-drained perception; each sensory pick is selective (avalanche-quiet, bleached driftwood) and the driftwood micro-setting literally constrains his return path. The final image recharges the same environment as sanctuary rather than prison, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    Aurora-lit ridgeway is vivid, selective, and mirrors interior shift from jittery to tranquil; color progression tracks emotional cadence. Dragonfly pendant functions as micro-setting, constraining attention and pacing through its vibrations. Spatial choreography clean—traveler emerges, speaks, withdraws without teleport. Weather (aurora) affects mood, not tactical choice; hence stays below 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Quartz arbor and frost-car function as micro-settings that constrain method and revelation. Mist proximity dictates the slow reveal; frost patterns are tactile gateways, not backdrop. Sensory selection stays inside Elara’s mystic filter—she notices refraction angles, not license plates. The prism’s weight change in her pocket at the end is a perfect environmental echo of internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bamboo-filtered green light, skeletal orchard, and moth-eaten silence are selective, pressure-driven details that narrow perception to Elara’s loom. The amber bead functions as micro-setting: its “stoically sparkling” surface mirrors the unchanging past against the encroaching void and literally bridges the worlds at climax. Spatial choreography is pristine—loom, bead, silence, and her body remain trackable. Environment directly constrains the final choice: only by becoming thread can the message cross the raveling silence.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.9)
    Floating rock arches and orchard aromas are filtered through a blacksmith’s sensory hierarchy—iron tang against blossom scent—creating an idiosyncratic palette. The abandoned mine works as micro-setting: dark, echoing, source of literal rubble; its geography is tracked cleanly during descent and ascent. Weather and scale remain static, but the forge’s changing glow supplies temporal texture. Detail never stalls motion; it is woven through hammer strikes and lantern swings.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Fog, spiral stair, Fresnel lens, and sea-glass micro-setting all constrain movement and attention. The lantern room’s cold hum and the cairn’s tactile geometry are returned in the final image, charging the re-lit beam. Sensory economy favors touch and sight filtered through Elian’s mariner bias. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from skiff to balcony.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.3)
    Emerald stone, spiral stairs, and refracted light-beam are tactile, purposeful, and mirror Kael’s skewed joy. Lighthouse as micro-setting constrains every move; starlight and salt-spray narrow perception to the tower’s physics. The final emerald spear re-charges the opening image, meeting the 9+ object gate cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.1)
    Tea-house levitation and valley-mist are sensuously tracked and directly charge the final image of drifting witness. Micro-setting (dye-stained hands, wing on table) constrains the only action—sun-tracking—so environment shapes tactic. Selective, body-filtered detail keeps the floating rock plausible without exposition dump. Setting never forces a hard choice, capping short of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tower room, moonlit stone, and broken sextant are vividly sketched and filter through Elara’s technician gaze (“brass tarnished, mechanisms jammed”). Weather and light actively shift across beats, guiding her attention and mirroring internal softening. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The sextant as micro-setting constrains her final alignment act, satisfying the 9+ gate, yet the labyrinth itself—her daily workplace—remains off-page and thus less charged.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.3)
    Greenhouse, mica window, and phosphorescent plants are handled, not wallpaper: Elara presses flesh to stone, soil exhales fragrance under new light. The dome’s glass curvature literally focuses the dawn threads, turning setting into optical tool. Spatial choreography is immaculate—northern wall, wavering thread, communal echoes arriving from beyond. Minor over-reliance on visual, but the concluding multi-sensory burst (growth, fragrance, warmth) redeems the imbalance and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Selective sensory detail—“shadows deepened,” “enlarged tranquility” expanding with breath—filters through Elara’s hyper-sensitive POV, turning the library itself into an emotional respirator. The bookstore façade and hidden door are economically re-used, satisfying proper-noun discipline. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies track from threshold to secluded corner without drift. Micro-setting success: the corner functions as both shield and cradle, charging the final image of accepted solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.1)
    Body-as-setting is explicit: her fingertips on cold marble seam constrain the decisive discovery; the bread on the scarred table recharges the final image of impermanence. Sensory hierarchy is character-specific—she notices “mossy stones” and “brittle pages,” never tourist filler. Weather-as-pressure is implicit: geese gone = seasonal clock tightening choices. Spatial tracking immaculate: fountain base → hidden compartment → low table maintains coherent vectors. World-rules consistent; no exposition dumps. One fresh inflection: the dormant fountain functioning as both archaeological site and altar—environment that alters tactics and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    The frozen library is not backdrop but instrument: cold slows movement, dictates silent steps, and finally admits a “permanent, peaceful silence” that charges the ending. Micro-setting objects—the brass projector, the ice-crusted spines—constrain every tactical choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: dying light and crackling ice mirror internal fading. One hairline slip: “above the clouds” is stated once and never exploited atmospherically, keeping it from perfect integration.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rotting pier market is rendered through condensation—salt, drip, lantern-glow, the slap’s wet echo—each detail filtered by Elara’s hunter’s attention. Space stays coherent: crates, alcove, water distance tracked without drift. Crucially, the watch-fob micro-setting acts as both tool and talisman, constraining her stealth tactics and charging the final image; without it the story could not “seal” the sound. Environment is not merely atmospheric but materially directs her movement and the story’s recording conceit.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lavender scent thickens as she descends, anchoring altitude change in smell; the compass ring’s cool/warm pulses act as micro-setting that constrains direction. The aurora and electoral hum provide a terrestrially cosmic scale without catalogue bloat. Spatial choreography is flawless: bluff → valley → tree line meeting. Only the man’s “weather-worn face” drifts toward cliché; otherwise sensory picks are character-filtered and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Crystal cave works as micro-setting: prismatic light mirrors her fractured psyche and literally provides the canvas (smooth wall) that enables the climactic sketch. Sensory selection stays inside Elara’s artist eye—“charcoal fingers,” “dust of her craft”—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: narrow fissure descent, niche behind painting, lock left on cavern floor. The cave’s reflective surfaces charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Greenhouse corridors, rust-sorting dome, and child’s water-cache secret are sketched with three-sense economy. The lie-wilt leaves act as micro-setting that constrains conversation choices on the spot. Toxic sky stays off-stage filter until the final line where it presses against the glass, reweighting her return journey. Spatial choreography clean: no floating rooms, distances track.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    Whispering Bluff is sketched with airy, auditory immediacy—cloud-line sunset, wind-as-language, bells as architecture—so the locale feels lived-in despite minimal geography. The iceberg fragment functions as micro-setting: its cold purity sets bell resonance rules and finally refracts the restored color, passing the 9+ gate for an object that charges closure. Spatial anchors are late (no concrete body-to-bell map until sculpture movement), but the lyric drift is taught early and pays off, so orientation debt is waived. Setting never crowds the word-count; every gust and glint is tuned to Elara’s perception, keeping prose lean and atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    The glass dome’s “false breath,” roses that “watch,” and the organic-skinned box are not backdrop but tactical agents: dome weakness enables burn, roses absorb flame, box material allows compression. Micro-setting (the fear-core sphere) literally powers the escape. Final image—open desert under shifting stars—reconfigures Kael’s perceptual horizon, cementing environment as constraint-turned-catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    The courtyard is sketched with selective sensory economy—pigeons, fountain screech, lavender scent—each filtered through Elara’s curator bias for “forgotten things.” Spatial choreography is flawless: locket on cobblestones, mailbox distance, apartment door ajar all track. The “sandstorm calm” motif returns to modulate tone rather than operate as a prop, so it doesn’t quite constrain choice, blocking 9+. Still, the micro-setting of the rust-locked mailbox functions as both obstacle and metaphor, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Algae-streaked walls, green shaft-light, rusted console—details are sparse yet concretely constrain movement and tool use. The laboratory itself acts as micro-setting: water pressure and fractured viewports mirror internal compression. Final image of floating subjects re-uses the viewport light, now reframed as liberation. One hairline slip: “deep ocean outside” is told not shown (−0.1).

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    The salt chamber’s fluctuating gravity literally pins or releases Elara, constraining how she digs and finally cradles the jar; environment shapes tactics. Recurrent “gleaming silence” modulates from eerie to respectful, charging the final lantern image. Tactile halite shards, sideways tugs, and swinging lanterns ground the fantastical rule-set in sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    Brook, pouch, wing, and starlight are economically reused; the wing’s glow charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean; sensory focus narrows to sound/void, suiting the ritual. Environment does not constrain tactics—the haven is a sanctuary, never a threat—so the 9+ gate is missed.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rooftop garden, meteor shower, and brass seal are rendered with synesthetic economy; jasmine scent and “iron bones” anchor the body-as-building metaphor. Spatial choreography is flawless—no impossible reaches or drifting props. The seal’s weight and warmth are re-registered each time it changes hands, so the object literally charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Minor lapse: city architecture is evoked in lyric abstractions (“mortar veins”) rather than one concrete detail that could constrain a later choice.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    The velvet garden, moss underfoot, and resonant stones are tactile, not postcard—each constrains her steps and channels the archive ritual. The shell’s “tragically radiant” glow is micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy fits POV: scent of night flowers narrows to the vibration in her bones. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.9)
    Marble sanctuary, aurora, and stalactite drip are vividly repeated, creating a ritual cadence that charges the final image. The thorn functions as micro-setting; its gleam against aurora light is specific and re-used. Spatial choreography is stable; environment is more active than most props.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.1)
    Serpentine nexus, starlight, and seashell half are sensuously re-invoked each paragraph; the shell’s murmurs constrain Kaelen’s next move, charging the final song. Canyon echo acoustics are weaponized—his voice weaponizes corridors—so setting actively shapes tactics. No spatial drift; every object stays tracked. Tone stays reed-melancholy throughout, mirroring theme.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Glacier shrine is more than postcard: ice walls “gleam like frozen constellations” and candlelight “echoes borrowed starlight,” marrying setting to theme. The melted snow globe functions as micro-setting—its warped glass handled in at least three beats, each time re-pricing the object’s meaning. Spatial choreography stays crisp across dream shards and the final inland visit; no impossible geography or prop drift.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.1)
    Parapet, moonlit droplets, firefly lattice, and bamboo whisk compose a tactile micro-cosmos that constrains attention and ultimately charges the final image. Sensory selection is POV-driven—Kaelen notices what a net-mender would: knots of light, wet stone, tensile whisk-strokes. No spatial drift; bodies and objects track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orchard’s paradox (lush inside poison storm) is vivid, specific, and immediately tied to Kaelen’s puzzle-solving. Sensory hierarchy (radioactive glow, numb fingers, cool diamond) tracks POV priorities. Environment literally shapes choice—storm halts inside sphere—and charges final image, meeting 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stormlit observatory is more postcard than constraint until Elara repurposes its cobalt glass as a portable canopy—then the setting materially shapes the final diplomacy beat. Rain-slick glass and static hiss are filtered through her tuner-brain; every sensory note is selective and urgent. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the cloud-to-ground transition; weather remains a live pressure, not backdrop. The micro-setting (portable canopy) satisfies the 9+ gate by charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.3)
    Driftwood-and-grass loft, salt-crusted air, and scattered-gold light are vivid, selective, and filtered through the poet’s salt-stung senses; the micro-setting (music-box, jars) functions as tactile tools that constrain every micro-choice. Spatial choreography is clean—no floating props. The dunes’ whispered secrets return in the final paragraph to charge the closure, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting that reweights the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    Drift-ice marina is more than postcard: creaking dock, shattered-glass ice shards, runed lighthouse door all press back on Kaelen’s feet, breath, ears. Micro-setting (key against sternum) literally channels the absolution wave, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis—sound and touch dominate, color last—so detail never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Frozen lake and basalt sanctuary act as micro-setting that literally mirrors the sky and electrically grounds the viaduct; environment constrains foot-speed and channels energy. Single proper-noun economy (“basalt sanctuary,” “magnetic viaduct”) avoids tourist clutter. Rain-beaded metal and star-reflecting ice provide tactile, cold, visual dominance; other senses invoked only when they sharpen stakes. Spatial choreography clean—satchel down, lodestone placed, crowd gathers in legible arc. Final image re-uses mirrored lake to crystallize new stillness, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    The tunnel is lived-in: water drips echo like ghostly heartbeats, rail scrap snags cloth, cracked concrete and frayed wires guide Elara’s eye and foot; spatial choreography stays coherent. Brass lantern surfaces scar yet glow—an object-as-setting that constrains her grip and charges the exit image. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but compressed word-count justifies the lean; drought-ended city rain serves as exterior mirror without heavy weather cliché. Micro-setting success: the hidden wall compartment’s damp ledger feels discovered through bodily interaction, not plunked.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Shop is textured through oil scent, slanted light, motes, and brass glare; spatial choreography is clean. The heart itself functions as micro-setting, its jammed escapement constraining every tool choice. Light-through-clouds is a touch over-told, but it does fire the moment of hope and is later re-echoed by the final chime, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.9)
    Acid-sea hiss and gear-grind provide immediate sensory stakes; the workshop’s rocking motion subtly guides Elara’s micro-movements (bracing against cogs, slotting arrow). The kaleidoscope’s prisms act as micro-setting that literally rewrites reality, satisfying the 9+ gate. Occasional tour-guide phrasing (“a floating island of interlocking cogs…”) keeps it just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    The humming servers, “unmarked tombs,” and cool air anchor the archive as both graveyard and workspace; micro-setting succeeds. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through archivist precision—metadata, scan resolution, frequency—never tourist catalog. The patch’s frayed thread and the “echo of forgotten songs” reappear at closure, recharging the absence motif. Spatial choreography is clean; no props teleport.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.1)
    Silver-barked trees, salt-weathered boards, and the tarnished mirror frame are selective, tactile, and filtered through Kaelen’s quiet attention. The lighthouse beam failing against mist shows world-rule change without exposition. Micro-setting works: the leather pouch, the cutting crystal edge, and the orb’s pulse constrain handling choices. Final image—orb-light bathing the cliffs—recharges the opening visual of failed beam, earning high-band specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drift-ice marina is sensuously specific: groaning wood, slurry net, gull cries all filter through Elara’s loosened grip on reality. The parasol tip functions as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial anchors arrive early; no orientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Amber pavilion and autumn dusk function as micro-setting: light color counters cooling air, mirroring his warming acceptance. Vineyard cycles (ripe rot, weed/vine coexistence) constrain the metaphor lattice and charge the final image. Spatial anchors hold; sensory spread favors visual over tactile. Object-as-setting works; environment does not alter physical tactics but suffuses closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    “Murmuring pavilion,” “whisperfield calm,” and grinding stone serpent provide tactile, auditory specificity that is filtered through Kael’s attention to resonance. Sand-dune vastness is kept offstage; setting contracts to pavilion floor and parapet curve—economy that keeps choreography clean. Temperature of stone and rhythmic motion are returned to at closure, giving the kinetic parapet a micro-setting role. Early anchors (who/where/when) arrive by line 3; no orientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lavender vs. rust dichotomy is vivid and purposeful, filtering every beat through scent, color, and decay. The dove-gray map case functions as micro-setting; its final emptiness charges the ending. Spatial choreography stays clean; bodies move credibly across field and hall. Detail economy is strong—no wasteful cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    The chandelier crystal functions as micro-setting: it is handled, tapped, and finally held aloft, constraining the only possible action in a dead library. Dust, gloom, and piercing dawn-light are filtered through Elara’s scholar-attention, giving sensory hierarchy. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible object positions. The crystal’s reflected rainbows charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate, but the broader library remains slightly generic “cathedral” furniture; hence 8.3 not 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    Fog sculptures act as mutable walls that force driftwood marking; garden geography is never vague—each marker is a tactile response to shifting mist. Videotapes and chalk ground the micro-setting; chalk’s wear tracks time on the body of the tool. The throne of “accumulated years” is the single image where environment, body, and theme converge—meets 9+ quick test but appears only at the end, so capped at 8.1.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.1)
    The crystalline dome, airless silence, and quaking foundations are not backdrop but tactical constraints: tremors threaten the camera’s alignment, vacuum demands the Earth-recorded leaf sound, and the static clock after capture mirrors the stilled observatory. The astral camera itself functions as micro-setting, its gears dictating the precise choreography of Elara’s fingers. These elements converge in the final image, charging the frozen clock face with cosmic afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mountain hospice above clouds is sketched lightly—window, terrace jasmine, tea steam—but every detail is filtered through Elara’s therapeutic gaze and nudges choice (jasmine triggers Mahler memory). Spatial choreography stays clean across bed / window / recorder. The shard micro-setting constrains the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Minor slip: altitude never affects breathing or logistics, a tiny verisimilitude miss.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.3)
    The floating observatory is sketched with tactile economy—cold etched walls, residual hum, domed star ceiling—and the orrery/mosaic function as micro-settings that constrain every adjustment she makes. The “noon-shadow vanish” rule is learned through hologram, not exposition, so world-logic emerges via action. One minor spatial slip: the automaton’s “hidden slot on the back” appears only when needed, but it is redeemed by the immediate tactile click. Environment, tool, and ritual object all charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    The secret garden and hedge maze function as micro-setting: living walls whisper, plants twist into new forms under her hands—environment that literally reshapes in response to her ritual. Spatial choreography is clean; we track her kneel, press, stand. Sensory hierarchy favors scent and touch, mirroring internal shift. The tooth-as-tool charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Grotto mist, wet stone, slivered moonlight are filtered through Elara’s stargazer bias—she notices refractive angles, not biology. The sea-glass shard functions as micro-setting: its changing surface literally constrains her next move—angle it, catch light, project. Final image of colored rays on damp wall is inseparable from closure; environment charges the decision to leave. Detail is selective, never touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting does triple duty: cathedral-green data center constrains movement, supplies the icicle-drip blueprint, and mirrors internal thaw. The amber pendant as micro-setting recurs and finally charges the closing image. Sensory economy favors moss scent, sun shafts, pendant warmth—never catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.3)
    Mist, void, and swirling hush are vividly reiterated and mirror the emotional register, but the nexus never threatens or constrains Elara’s movements; she glides unhindered. Spatial choreography is fuzzy—bodies and distances untracked—yet the micro-setting (shell in hand) does charge the final image when raised aloft. Sensory selection favors sight and hush; other senses appear only in generic “salty breeze.” Setting serves atmosphere more than tactical pressure, so it stays mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is filtered through Elara’s tactile bias—cool tendril, unfurling leaves, silver dew—never a catalogue. Arbor acts as resonant chamber: the “gathering hush” deepens when songs start, literally changing acoustics and thus tactics. Micro-setting (vine-as-tool) constrains every beat; its glow dictates pacing. Spatial grounding stays coherent in a single glade; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    Crater orchard, crystal vial, flash-paper, and silver plate are handled with sensory specificity that constrains action (cold limits dexterity, vial must be unstoppered with gloved fingers). Spatial choreography is clean: kneeling in snow, items arrayed in spirals, distance to dead trees tracked. Environment charges the final image: the breeze that rises after sealing is causally tied to released energy, not decorative. Micro-setting cap at 8.8 applies because no single prop forces a tactical fork, but every environmental detail tightens the ritual; still, strong band criteria met.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marble cavern is not backdrop but instrument: the “sharply defiant” dawn echo that softens to “gentle whispers” at noon literally tunes the timer’s gears; environment constrains every micro-adjustment.  The crystalline vessels carved from the same stone extend the setting into prop, so the final image of niche-cellar is inseparable from the cavern’s anatomy—textbook micro-setting charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.7)
    Bronze grotto, kerosene lamp, and starlight are vividly filtered through Elara’s artisan eye; the metallic walls “shimmering dance” refract her inner state. Sensory triangulation is tight—cold bronze floor, burner hiss, damp earth—anchoring each beat. Micro-setting (lamp height, flame flicker) directly guides her tightening ritual. No spatial drift; environment silently partners the weave, earning its closure glow.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    Rain-beaded skylight functions as micro-setting that charges every beat—light shifts from “soft diffuse glow” to “rust-hued peace,” mirroring internal shift. Ash wood grain becomes tactile map of memory; wet scent permeates action. Tool and body substitute for broader geography, constraining choice to the carving bench. Meets 9+ gate: loft environment + tool + weather jointly shape tempo and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kinetic lagoon above clouds functions as micro-setting that literally alters locomotion: boots sink into cloud-ground, water thickens against skin, hum pulses air. Camera wheel recurs as handled object in ≥3 beats, constrains choice (can’t advance film, can’t record), and charges final image when it self-turns. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and hearing over visual, matching scavenger POV. Spatial choreography clean: island reached by wading, ghost placement unambiguous. No exposition dumps; world rules learned through immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dust motes in cracked domes, dry aqueducts mimicking constellations, and the brass sextant’s heft deliver sensory specificity filtered through an engineer’s eye.

The setting actively shapes tactics—solar geometry, pipe routes, dormant seeds—charging the final illuminated garden. Scale is kept economical; no tourism-catalog clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Micro-setting triumph: the damp crystal tiles literally change what is possible—sound generation underfoot—so environment constrains and enables the arc. Petrichor and dripping eaves are filtered through Elara’s violin-scarred perception, never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: steps absorbed → tile touched → center reached → clock face closed. Hidden sunrise light on dust motes mirrors internal shift without overt symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.9)
    Canal, barges, mossy stones, brass sundial, and radio-silence create a tactile micro-setting that finally charges the image when shadow lands on the seeping crack. Visual dominance is offset by damp, cool, and faint lap of water; industrial edges softened by twilight. Spatial choreography is stable; no geography drift. The sundial as portable “setting” constrains the final pivot. Details are filtered through Elara’s legend-hunter eye, never touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    The golden dock under snow is more than postcard: its timbers’ glow refracts through fulgurite, guiding knot-reading posture; the oceanic hush literally swallows sound, forcing Elara into hyper-attention. Fog functions as a mobile ceiling that collapses distance and time, making the dock a micro-cave for sacred exchange. Spatial choreography is clean—rope coils, snow kneeling, glass angle track without drift. The environment’s cold, salt, and silence constrain method (no rushed movements) and charge the final image (fog retreat = vow revealed), meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.1)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    The suspended palace/stalactites anchor every beat; moisture and groans tacitly mirror the prince’s trembling resolve. The crystalline core and moss function as micro-setting that literally powers the climax. No spatial drift; world-rules stay consistent. The egg’s physical fragility constrains handling and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    Black sand, obsidian lagoon, and kelp-drift calm are not backdrop—they supply the mineral paste that enables the graft and mirror the singing scar. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel, mix, smooth, press; coin passes hand-to-hand. One micro-gap: cloud migration is lovely but never tightens the clock. Still, environment constrains the medical act and charges the final image, satisfying 9-gate.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    Setting is the story’s engine: dry fountains, weak sun, smog-choked sky all filter through Elara’s priors and literally constrain her path. The micro-setting of the box-and-stars finale charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate. Occasional tourist-catalog listings (“narrow alleys… broad plazas”) nudge it back to 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    Micro-setting triumph: crystallized petals, brass gear teeth, and sonar echoes become the tactile world. Sensory hierarchy skews auditory, mirroring Elara’s non-visual ethic. Spatial choreography is dreamlike yet trackable: ark insertion, ping azimuths, falling light. Environment constrains the only possible solution—sound transmission—so setting actively shapes tactics and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Greenhouse glass, fern-wet air, monarch blur, and stone-dust skin all filter through Elara’s tactile attention; ivy fractures guide her finger-trace, bench rot decides sitting height, butterfly draft dictates whisper-timing. Ribbon colors (faded indigo, blood-rust ochre) constrain which memory-poem she murmurs, binding environment to tactic. Final recital occurs amid last swirl of monarchs—setting actively charges the closure image, passing 9+ gate. Minor slip: spatial sweep from rafters to potting table on second entrance is rushed, but never confuses later moves.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    Brass gears, obsidian black, tidal groan and moonlit receding wave are filtered through Elias’s obsessive sensory hierarchy. The tower’s spiral stairs and workbench spatial track remain coherent across the single scene. The rake handle micro-setting constrains the decisive recalibration; its tactile inscription guides the final image. One missed olfactory cue (salt-air absence in the clock room) is the only hairline gap.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    cobalt silo, dusty crate, frayed textile—objects constrain every beat; the hidden compartment’s “cool surface” charges the final image of responsibility. Night air “soft and velvety” mirrors the thinning gloom after revelation, keeping sensory hierarchy tied to her perceptual shift. Selective cemetery imagery (stones, stars, shelves) avoids tourist catalog; spatial choreography is clean from chess table to silo ladder. No world-rule inconsistency; agrarian relic feels lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Obsidian spire, kingfisher quill, and frozen lake are not backdrop but tactical instruments: spire’s gloom mirrors social stagnation, lake’s fracture is a literal feedback loop. Micro-setting objects (quill, ink of crushed obsidian) constrain the decisive act. Spatial choreography is immaculate—gaze, table, parchment, lake track cleanly. Final image of thawing water recharges every prior mention, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ember alcove + shortwave dial function as micro-setting: warmth vs. detection risk constrain her nightly returns; dust-crown reprises at closure, recharging stakes. Sensory hierarchy obeyed—copyist ear for notation filters what she notices. Mist and coals evolve with scene heat; spatial track clean. World rule (lyrics as cipher) kept consistent via on-page decoding.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    “Vanishing point gallery” is more than postcard: its receding walls mirror her infinite lack of answers and force solitary ritual. The chair’s creak is an audible clock; porcelain shards act as micro-setting that slices palms and dictates the powder method. Light/dust/charcoal triad is filtered through artist’s eye; every sensory pick serves the final monochrome image. Environment constrains—no audience, only perspective lines—so the ritual can occur.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sewer strata and brass artifacts are handled, not catalogued—every tool (trowel, cog, plate) constrains posture, pace, and breath. Spatial choreography is immaculate: distance to crack-light, sediment under nails, shelf hewn from rubble. Sensory hierarchy favors mineral damp and metallic tang, never tourist spectacle. The micro-setting of “brass cog vs. clay-fused chart” becomes the decisive arena where navigation truth is literally pried loose; thus the 9-band gate is met.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    Velvet library, autumn leaves, honeyed rosette wood—sensory triad is selective, tactile, and returned in the final image to charge closure. The “vanishing arts” motif is anchored in concrete objects (songbooks, fragile instruments) that constrain Elara’s urgency. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. Micro-setting (rosette as locus of balance) directly shapes the pedagogical tactic, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rusted greenhouse is sketched with selective sensory strokes (skeletal iron, creaking wind) that mirror internal pruning; the seed’s luminescence and the silver alignment light constrain Elara’s timing and seed placement. Spatial choreography stays clean within a single continuous scene. The setting functions as micro-scale crucible; it could reach 8+ if a structural detail (broken pane, dangling strap) physically threatened or enabled the final planting.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lightning rods, lacquer box, and nectar-dusk sky are sensuously etched and return in the final image; the tower’s metallic spine and rain-slick rungs constrain the climbing action. Selective detail favors the visual; scent of rain-honey arrives only at the tag, narrowing sensorial range. World rules stay consistent: drones reboot only when wet, no cheat.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.1)
    Bay, cobblestones, cherry petals, salt air are filtered through Elara’s slow-change lens, giving micro-setting purpose. The orris root itself functions as environment-in-hand, constraining the final move. Spatial choreography is tight: gate latch, creaking beams, interior dust all track cleanly. Weather and season mirror the theme of gentle resurgence without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    Submerged garden is tactile—drifting seaweed, bioluminescent coral, kelp “breathing”—and the fissured monument literally channels the climax. Sensory hierarchy fits a motionless observer: slow sway, shimmer, stone grain. Micro-setting (ampoule seam) directly enables the final act; environment constrains the pour.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    The staircase itself is tool and environment: its cold stone, the crack that “shatters the seamless continuity,” and the glowing symbols constrict her choices and charge the final image. Sensory selection stays urgent—visual glare of equations, tactile sharpness of the die chip—never tourist-catalog. Micro-setting success: the die chip literally tilts the roll that feeds the proof that breaks the step, so object-as-setting constrains tactics. Without the staircase’s perfect sameness the rupture would lack contrast; without the chip the random variable fails—both are irreplaceable.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The greenhouse-as-micro-setting is tactile—humid air, wooden table, moonlight on glass—and the smog outside functions as moral counter-pressure. The moon-tipped brush is handled in multiple beats and its shimmer directly enables the visions, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean; only the city’s geography remains vague, but that vagueness serves the dream-logic.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    The grotto city, waterfall mist, and succulent-studded cliff constrain movement and supply the missing honey; environment actively shapes tactics. The emerald lens micro-setting reprises with reweighted meaning at closure. Sensory selection stays filtered through Elara’s archival gaze; smell, temperature, and tactile dough work support theme. All anchors are stable; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    Environment is not postcard: the tide’s slow exhale literally expands the island, giving her physical access to the stone and pacing her work. The lighthouse interior—brass clock shuddering, air thickening—constrains the final action and charges the closing image. Sensory triage favors touch and kinesthetic detail over visual catalog. Micro-setting (yoyo, stone) doubles as tool and terrain, binding setting to plot.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Peeling paint, rust-and-candy stench, and the dead neon’s sickly pulse filter through Elara’s nausea, guiding her toward the mirror-hall; every sensory pick is urgent, not touristic. The clasp’s temperature shift from “cold metal” to “hot” constrains the decisive throw, qualifying it as micro-setting that charges closure. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: she stops before one mirror, shadow coils, throw lands—no impossible positions. Environment never stalls momentum; detail is woven through action and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.1)
    Orchard-as-raft constrains every tactic—roots tangled in driftwood dictate where he can stand, strike, or brace. Sea-glass resonator and suspended shells are tactile tools whose placement is tracked; spatial choreography survives the wave breach. Blue hour indigo melt is not mere backdrop—it supplies the chromatic void that silence will fill, charging closure. Weather (nimbus swirl) is read like notation, turning sky into sheet-music the protagonist must physically answer; environment > postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    Turtle-carapace micro-setting constrains every move; the highest point choice and hair-crack glow are charged by this terrain. Sensory economy favors heat, calcium dust, reedy timbre—never tourist catalog. “Sunwashed dread” is filtered through Kaelen’s cartographer gaze, baking fear into stone and bone. Setting directly shapes the final image: the sealed yet luminous crack is the city’s new language.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Station and ivy function as micro-setting: the decayed platform mirrors buried truth, the thorny bare rosebush supplies the final image of painful necessity. Sensory triad—damp earth, rust, gold leaf—filtered through historian’s curator eye. Space is sketched, not tracked, but single-character focus forgives choreography. Environment shapes mood more than tactical choice, capping 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment is not backdrop but antagonist: submerged tiles slime his boots, black water pulls at each seam he repairs. The inkwell’s brass weight and the pavilion’s gaunt ribs constrain stance and tool use in every beat. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s surveyor eye—angles, decay rates, precise placements—never tourist catalog. Final image reuses the water-surface ripple first seen mid-story, now reweighted as eternal witness.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Micro-setting dominates: stamp, vellum, warped drawer, salt scent—each constrains tactical choices and charges the final image. Sunken-library frame is evoked sparely (“abyssal hush,” “sunken silence”) yet never drifts into tour-guide list; details filter through indexer’s fingertips. Spatial choreography is flawless; drawer click and scroll scent are legible in darkness. Setting earns 9+ gate: the warped wood literally hides the contraband scrolls that rewrite origin—environment as plot engine.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Floating island, perfumed tea soil, twin suns, crystalline basilica—each detail is filtered through Elara’s lantern-maker eye and constrains her ritual path. Micro-setting of gem and paper cranes serve as tactile “rooms” that must be handled to progress. Spatial choreography is flawless; no static expo dumps. The basilica’s refracted rainbow light returns in the final image, recharging the luminous torment motif and satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    The observatory, breaker countdown, and geode cradle are handled as tactile instruments, never postcard backdrop. Micro-setting dominates—body, tool, and console constrain every move. Sensory hierarchy is biased by Kaelen’s engineering mindset: hum, sparks, absolute blackness. Final image of cold star-language is charged by the earlier telescope dormancy, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dusk-lit observatory stones, cold brass lever, and dusty projection screen are tactile and specific; the environment literally rotates to enable climax, satisfying the “setting constrains choice” test. Sensory layering skews visual, but the narrowed night-vision through the drone feed justifies that bias. Spatial choreography is flawless—drone arc, dome gears, star projection all track cleanly. Weather and epoch details are kept minimal, appropriate for 700-word scope, so no economy penalties apply.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cobalt terrace, driftwood, and watch hand form a micro-setting triad that constrains every move: terrace launches her, shore filters noise to “sieved hush,” carving forces confrontation. Sensory selection is POV-driven—cool metal, damp sand, etched dates—never tourist-catalog. Final image charges the terrace as mirror rather than prison, reconfiguring the color as reflective, not imprisoning.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Storm-worn parapet and clinging mist are filtered through Elara’s skin and mission priorities; the pull’s metallic cold and stone surface act as micro-setting that guides her gesture and finally charges the handshake image. Spatial choreography stays clean across the two-character pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sea-salt sting narrowing to cracked glass, cold water seeping through clothes, and the pole silhouettes against grey sky integrate setting into bodily stakes. Tool-as-setting works: compass crack and pole spacing constrain route choice. Lighthouse as final image reweights prior celestial dreams into grounded acceptance. Sensory hierarchy follows crisis: sight-lines to poles, tactile cold, diminished hearing—no static catalogue.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.1)
    Bioluminescent lake is not postcard scenery; its shifting glow directly mirrors/options Leo’s moral pulse, constraining each step. Micro-anchor baseball serves as portable setting fragment, seams carrying eras that charge the final image. Selective sensory triage—damp air, pulsing light—keeps momentum. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    The orchard is not wallpaper; its moonlight pools constrain visibility and force the spell to be performed in the clearing where lunar silver can act as catalyst. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: Elara notices scent first, then tactile crumble of resin, never visual minutiae—appropriate for a beast-whisperer tuned to olfactory cues. Spatial choreography is clean: altar → clearing → bridge → mist realm; distances track. The “moonlight pooled like liquid silver” returns as the surface on which she first sets her new translucent foot, charging the final image. Micro-setting (her own body) becomes the ultimate threshold, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.1)
    Micro-setting dominates: saucer crack and embroidered tablecloth act as portable geography that constrains ritual choices. “Silver grass and whispering ferns” supply sensory capsule without checklist, and altitude chill is filtered through breath-mist. Spatial choreography is tight—objects remain tracked as she kneels, spreads cloth, places saucer. The glade’s suspended bowl never affects tactics beyond ambience, so environment stops just short of charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ship is sketched with scavenged-metal grotty specificity—“worn metal grating,” “patchwork tomb”—and the micro-setting of her quarters (faded photographs, stone pulsing) constrains every motion. Photographs function as tactile tools, not décor: their crystalline tear-trails are harvested, filtered, stitched; without them the door fails. Spatial choreography is clean; we track her feet lifting/anchoring, hands dancing, stone held to light. The environment’s ghostly hum becomes sympathetic choir during climax, so setting actively collaborates in the rupture. Only missing a deeper sensory hit (smell of old plastic, taste of recycled air) that would cap the band.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Black sand, crater glow, and bottled bioluminescence braid into a single tactile palette that charges the final image. Environment is not backdrop: the warm granular sand under her fingers becomes the metaphor she sought, literalizing “texture of transformation.” One nit: spatial relation between beach and volcano crater is assumed, not anchored, so the rumble-to-glow transition drifts a step.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.9)
    The fort’s glow-to-dark shift is sketched sparsely but actively steers choice: blackout grants stealth, walls’ hum vanishes to silence, guiding Elara’s hush. Micro-setting (quill, sundial, armory wall) constrains tactics and reappears in the closing image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across courtyard → armory → quarters. Sensory economy favors sound and touch over visual, mirroring blackout urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tidal bluff is not postcard scenery; its frictionless slickness forces Kaelen to crawl on painted rocks for traction, making setting an active constraint. Aurora color threads into rock pigments and eel scales, integrating sensory hierarchy. “Leadwood box” and “Fibonacci spiral” are tools whose weight and geometry decide the ritual’s success. Micro-setting qualifies: the golden-spiral rock becomes the final anchor that charges the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    Storm-dome, lightning flashes, telescope reflection, and timer click create a tight sensory circuit that repeatedly constrains attention; telescope mirror scene is the pivot where setting literally shows her scar-constellation, charging the closure. Spatial choreography stays clean; no geography drift. Weather is not backdrop but dictates light, sound and emotional pacing. The observatory functions as micro-setting-plus-tool; its optic train enables the self-recognition beat. High specificity, economy-driven, final image tethered—meets 9+ gate for object/environment charging image.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Glass atrium acts as pressure-cooker: prismatic shards skid across floor during parry, forcing footwork recalibration. Quiet brook outside mirrors the internal shift from erosion to collaboration. Half-painted sundial doubles as cipher machine and clock, its blank stone a looming absence that guides the final lunge. Micro-setting (needle card in pocket) constrains tactics—only 12 needles, so each angle choice is irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.1)
    The rusted open-air library under wheeling moonlight is evoked through rust flakes, wind whistling through holes, precarious book towers—details that constrain posture and pace. The coffee tin’s false-bottom is handled twice (storage, reveal), qualifying as micro-setting that physically houses the clandestine poems. Sensory range is modest but selective: silver light on metal, bitter coffee taste, scuffed paper—economy suits the scene’s hush. Spatial choreography stays clean as they crouch, stack, and brush fingers; no impossible positions or white-room gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tidal arbor is sketched with selective sensory economy—“strange flora pulsed with a soft, rhythmic light”—and immediately pressures action: the compasses flare as storm tides rise, forcing the film gambit. Spatial choreography is immaculate: projector, piano, mist-screen, and door-in-the-film remain in traceable positions. The micro-setting of the broken clock constrains choice at the threshold, its frozen hands lighting the moment of fracture. Details never stall momentum; each image is filtered through Elian’s wistful attention to light and sea-rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ridge in bloom is evocatively sensory—petal bed, humming stones, glowing soil—and the micro-setting (circle of vines) literally dictates where the seed must go, satisfying the 9+ gate. Weather shift from fragrant bloom to storm wind mirrors stakes precisely. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single continuous scene. Occasional filler phrases (“soft light,” “vibrant bloom”) slightly dilute specificity, but environment remains active, not postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    The islet’s post-rain sheen and salt-sweet breeze are filtered through Kaelen’s regret-saturated perception; damp earth and tidal residue mirror his interior state without overt symbolism. The brass compass and seaweed-strewn cove function as micro-settings: the compass’s tarnish and trembling constrain how he holds and trusts it, while the cove’s tidal refuse literally delivers the locket. Spatial choreography is flawless—footsteps on shore, compass hand trembling, knees crouching among shells. Weather’s cleansing aftermath is not backdrop but catalyst: only “when the air was cleansed” does the needle respond, tying atmosphere to agency.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains perception and choice: broken panes frame dust accumulation, mud dictates movement, and intact glass becomes a canvas for observation. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (wet earth, iridescent dust), never touristy. The recurring object—the butterfly scale—charges the final image by embodying fragility within cosmic patience. Environment directly enables the thematic pivot, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    The canyon functions as micro-setting: frost patterns directly enable ledger deciphering, and the cold stone grounds Elara’s physical state. Sensory detail is selective—stars, scorched paper, melting frost—and filtered through her artistic perception. The environment constrains no tactical choice but charges the final image: frost melts, yet patterns remain in her mind, echoing her art’s luminous persistence. This integration lifts specificity beyond backdrop, though spatial choreography remains minimal due to solitary POV.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    The winterglass conservatory isn’t backdrop—it’s an active constraint and collaborator. Its frozen panes enable heat-mapping; its silence demands visual music. The “unshaken marvels” physically mirror Elara’s endurance, and the cut piano strings enforce the world’s rules. Every detail (velvet-lined case, frost-etched flora) serves the method and theme. The setting charges the final image: a tapestry of emotional imprints on glass.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    The broken lens functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (must be aligned in impossible air pocket) and charging the final image (its glow halts currents). Coral-encrusted spires, floating books, and moonlit shaft are filtered through Elijah’s professional gaze—noticeable only as they relate to burial and signal transmission. Sensory hierarchy shifts appropriately: tactile cold and visual murk dominate descent; silence and radiance define climax. Every environmental detail serves pressure or closure without static description.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    The terra-cotta arbor functions as micro-setting: it anchors logistics (donation drop), frames ritual (bell ringing), and culminates as sanctuary for planning. Sensory detail is selective—humid air, cool silver, dusty path—and filtered through Elara’s urgency. The ridge’s spatial logic remains coherent across movements. However, the setting doesn’t actively constrain choices beyond providing a drop point; its symbolic weight slightly outpaces tactical necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    The twilight viaduct functions as micro-setting: wisteria scent, damp stone, and arches directly shape perception and action—Elara’s breath syncs with the structure, ivy hides the tear, and silver strands cling to its stones. Sensory detail is selective (fragrant bloom, cool smoothness) and filtered through her artist-healer POV, avoiding tourist cataloguing. The environment constrains choice (she must reach into the crevice) and charges the final image (wisteria glows post-release). However, spatial choreography slightly falters—how many strands? Where exactly does she move?—but not enough to harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    The living bridge garden is exquisitely rendered with sensory specificity (woven willow, crystal streams, trembling leaves, jasmine scent) and functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—Elara must alter its geometry to break the loop. The environment charges the final image: dissolving vines become motes of light, directly enabling closure. However, while vivid, the setting occasionally veers into decorative lushness (“quaking reverie,” “ghost-light of centuries”) without always tightening pressure. Still, the garden’s evolution mirrors Elara’s internal shift, satisfying the 9+ gate for environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.1)
    The abandoned carnival prize redemption center functions as a potent micro-setting: dust, broken toys, and the grime-covered piano bench directly enable the vault’s discovery. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric (fluttering banners, clinking chains, thick air), filtered through Elara’s focused urgency. However, the environment doesn’t meaningfully constrain her choices beyond providing props—it decorates rather than pressures. The final image of green shoots against ruins charges the closure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    The sunken greenhouse, shipwrecks, and ashen forge aren’t backdrop—they actively constrain and charge Elara’s work. Salt-laden silt slows her steps; aurora hues scream as discordant chimes only she hears; bitter apples taste of regret. Every sensory detail filters through her synesthetic POV and professional focus, making setting inseparable from character and theme. The environment directly shapes the final image: peace found amid relics of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.3)
    The emerald station isn’t backdrop—it breathes, reflects moonbeams, and channels escape via jasmine. The jar of moonbeams functions as micro-setting, constraining tactics (revealing portraits, decoding flowers) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: twilight narrows perception to fire-hued tiles and silvery strands. Every atmospheric element pressures choice or deepens thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    The abandoned control room functions as potent micro-setting: its decay contrasts with Elara’s creation, and its impending collapse forces urgency. Tools, frost, slush, and wet windows are tactile and purposeful, filtered through her glassblower’s attention. The cobalt rod and portable furnace aren’t just props—they enable the central action. Only slight deduction: the setting’s “old power and control” isn’t leveraged beyond mood; it doesn’t actively constrain choices beyond providing space.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rusted library functions as micro-setting: ivy and leaning shelves constrain movement, oxidized metal scent grounds perception, and starlight illuminates the path—literally and metaphorically. The environment charges the final image: the library “stood as a witness to his rebirth.” However, while vivid, the setting doesn’t actively alter tactics beyond mood; it reflects rather than pressures choice. Still, sensory detail is selective, tactile, and POV-filtered, avoiding white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    The storm-tossed ridge fort, pebble-shore memory, and single-star sky create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere filtered through the Oracle’s perception. Sensory detail is selective—whispering robes, ambered hush, textured air—and evolves with her work. However, the setting never constrains choice or alters tactics; it serves as mood rather than micro-setting that pressures action. The gold leaf booklet functions as object-as-setting but doesn’t transform spatial dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    The frozen courtyard functions as micro-setting: ice benches, barren trees, and central sculpture constrain movement and symbolize stasis versus inquiry. Crucially, the ice violin—part tool, part environment—charges the final image and directly enables the climax. Sensory detail is selective (glinting frost, ethereal hum) and filtered through J-7’s janitorial POV, avoiding tourist cataloging. The setting’s temporal anomaly is woven into action (“de-icing pathways,” “looped timelines”), making it causal, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.3)
    The crystal whispering forecourt after rain isn’t backdrop—it actively enables the plot: crystals amplify whispers, wet surfaces become projection screens, and post-rain acoustics shape Elara’s eavesdropping. The setting constrains choice (only here can she decode the tickets) and charges the final image (projections on wet crystal). Sensory detail is selective (“slick, dark pavement,” “resonant hush”) and filtered through Elara’s professional attention. The environment evolves from site of suspicion to one of harmony, mirroring internal shifts without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.1)
    The garden maze functions effectively as micro-setting: hedges part for Elara, vines curl toward her, paths respond—environment actively reflects her bond with the space. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her profession (gnarled hands, tangled growths, polished marbles). However, while atmosphere is vivid, it doesn’t constrain choice; the setting validates rather than challenges. The recurring marble object charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate condition partially, but doesn’t alter tactics mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting is masterfully integrated: the xenobiology station isn’t backdrop but active constraint—the magnetic nexus at twilight enables the experiment, and the Mothraals’ dormancy defines the narrow window. Sensory details (“mechanically warm glow,” “icy void,” “rustle of wings”) are filtered through Kael’s professional familiarity and emotional state. The brass lever, holographic console, and vast window all function as micro-settings that enable and charge the climax. The final image ties environment to revelation: the dimming nexus mirrors the fading hologram, deepening thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.3)
    The flooded opera house isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and enables: water depth slows movement, lantern light reveals only fragments, and the half-drowned piano signals decayed artistry. The antique program functions as micro-setting, its water-damaged pages directly shaping Elara’s interpretation. Final image charges the environment as a “memorial to lost art,” fulfilling the 9+ gate via tool and setting fusion.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mountain weather station functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice: its isolation enables Elara’s marginal thinking, and its unique microclimate explains the Bloom’s rarity—a fact that directly alters her scientific stance. Sensory details (hum of machines, auroral light, slick sweat) are selective and pressure-aligned. However, the environment doesn’t *force* a physical action—it charges the final image rather than narrowing tactical options, just missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tunnel functions as micro-setting: its oppressive silence, crumbling bricks, and cold air directly pressure Kaelen’s senses and choices. The beaded valve wheel—a tool-turned-relic—constrains the climax and charges the final image when returned to the pipe stub. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (gravel crunch, rhythmic clanking), filtered through Kaelen’s fatigued expertise, avoiding tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    The overgrown library and obsidian refuge are vividly rendered with tactile specificity (moss on shelves, black walls reflecting river flow), and the origami swan functions as micro-setting that constrains access to the refuge. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding tourist cataloging. However, while the environment charges the final image, it doesn’t actively constrain a pivotal choice—the swan enables travel but isn’t a barrier with stakes. Still, the setting deeply supports tone and theme without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.9)
    Sage Ridge and the dreaming roots provide lyrical atmosphere but don’t constrain action or alter tactics—the oak is a passive stage, not an active force. Sensory detail is selective and mood-aligned, yet overly reliant on visual and auditory clichés (“eerie twilight,” “whispering trees”). The setting mirrors theme but never pressures choice; it could be swapped for any serene woodland without consequence. The baby curl and flute function as micro-settings but aren’t leveraged to shape decisions under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.3)
    The reclaimed silo library functions as micro-setting and constraint: its concentric levels, heat-cracked stones, and fireplace directly enable discovery and calibration. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (“brittle as autumn leaves,” “concrete holding vibration”), filtered through Elian’s perception. The tapestry fragment and diaries are tactile anchors that evolve from ruin to sacred tools, charging the final image where dragons “stir as if alive” amid reborn whispers.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.7)
    The lighthouse functions as atmospheric backdrop but never constrains choice or supplies resources that alter tactics—characters move freely between island and mainland without logistical consequence. Fog, tide, and “jagged island” are mentioned but don’t affect decisions. The lantern room setting is reused but inert; no spatial choreography shapes interaction. Final image of the lighthouse as “beacon of shared mystery” is thematic assertion, not charged reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dimensional anchor functions as a micro-setting that constrains choice: its “unraveled stillness” must be rewoven through specific acts (silence, color, rhetoric). The palette and loop pedal are tactile, recurring objects that charge the final image—the blue mark pulses, then bleeds into air, dimming after use. Sensory detail is selective (cold floor, soft light, muffled clarity) and filtered through Father Elian’s ritual focus. However, spatial choreography remains slightly abstract—no tangible geography beyond “chamber” and “altar.”

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, and mirrored horizon are rendered with precise, multi-sensory specificity that filters through Elara’s perceptual bias. The setting actively constrains choice: dawn’s approach forces urgency, the spire amplifies light into prismatic shards that energize her work, and the cracking lake contributes bass notes to her score. Crucially, the nautilus functions as micro-setting—its spiral literally maps time and guides her memory retrieval. However, while vivid, the environment doesn’t foreclose options beyond temporal pressure, narrowly missing 9+ integration.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glowing viaduct functions as a charged micro-setting: its reconfigurations directly constrain Kaelen’s choices (e.g., bridges forming only after rune activation), and its “darkening brightness” evolves with his inner state. Rain, puddles, and abyss are tactile and purposeful, never generic. The viaduct’s cessation of glow in the final beat charges the closure by signaling resolution. However, while vivid, the setting doesn’t quite reach 9.0+ because its physical logic (how exactly it reconfigures) remains slightly abstract, missing one beat of concrete interaction under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    The drum maker’s cavern functions as micro-setting: hides, wood grain, and the phonograph horn constrain and enable Elara’s choices. Sensory detail is selective (cool drum rim, sawdust-dusted hands) and filtered through her deafness, prioritizing touch over sound. The final image—rustling leaves as “companion”—reweights the opening’s “ghost” through environmental evolution. Only minor deduction: the phonograph’s plausibility as a vibration conduit edges toward poetic license.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    The courtyard functions as micro-setting: it anchors early (“quiet courtyard at dusk”), supplies the rain gauge and stone bench, and evolves from sanctuary to operational hub. Its “layered tranquility” charges the final image, now “enriched with alliance.” Sensory detail is selective (ivy wall, cool air, dim sky) and filtered through Elara’s professional attention. Weather and tools constrain choices—storm data drives investigation—but the pigeon’s perch could be more spatially integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    The greenhouse functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: its humidity, extinct flora, and UV-dependent Lumina Blossom necessitate Elara’s lantern expertise. The “crystal shadows” and filtered light aren’t backdrop—they charge the final image when UV reveals pollen synced to her tears. Sensory hierarchy reflects her profession (light) and trauma (scent), avoiding tourist description. Every detail serves the closure’s revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    The terra-cotta grotto functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges the climax: its earthy walls absorb light, reflect released energy, and ground Elian’s tactile search. Rope, stars, and auroral beings form a cohesive sensory ecosystem filtered through poetic perception. Description is purposeful—warm clay vs. cold starlight mirrors internal tension. Deduct 0.1 only because weather/environment don’t actively alter tactics beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse and shipwrecks function as micro-setting that actively shapes tactics—Elara plays violin to strike wrecks and catch echoes in water-refracted acoustics. Sensory detail is selective (glass dome submerged, skeletal ships, lapping waves) and filtered through Elara’s acoustic perception. The environment charges the final image: greenhouse as sanctuary, shipwrecks as listeners. Only minor deduction for slight overreliance on visual metaphor without deeper tactile or olfactory grounding during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    The amber grotto is masterfully integrated: its translucent walls, residual emotions, and persistent glow directly shape perception and theme. The setting functions as both environment and micro-setting—the static charge emanates from it, and its pulse mirrors Elara’s shift. Crucially, it charges the final image: the lingering amber light reflects her inner change. Every sensory detail serves POV bias (a fragrance chemist noticing molecular nuance) and avoids tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.1)
    The “breezy library under the stars” recurs atmospherically but never constrains choice or alters tactics—it’s backdrop, not micro-setting. Sensory detail is selective and tonally consistent (saltwater stain, symphony echoes), yet environment remains decorative. The port town setting informs occupation but doesn’t pressure decisions. Final image uses stars symbolically without grounding them in embodied consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.1)
    The crystalline orchard, shimmering crater, and obsidian arbor are vividly rendered and deeply integrated into character action and theme. The arbor doesn’t just describe—it constrains choice (as a destination) and charges the climax. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“air vibrated with echoes,” “branches chimed softly”). The setting evolves causally and culminates in the final gathering space, fulfilling the 9+ gate by shaping both tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rooftop canal system functions as micro-setting: it constrains navigation, reflects temporal distortion (“wavered like a mirage”), and charges the final image (“canals now buzzing with liberated sound”). Sensory detail is selective—water ripples, pendant hum, frozen birds—and filtered through Elara’s professional attention. The infinity pendant and canal intertwine physically and thematically, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cavern orchard is vividly specific—not just backdrop but active micro-setting: stalactites drip to nourish roots that “twisted like ancient scripts,” directly enabling Elian’s method. The mosaic stepping stone constrains his ritual and charges the climax when patterns resonate with water drops. Final image ties setting to theme—fruits brighten “in sympathy”—making environment inseparable from emotional calculus. Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “sapphire hush,” ferromagnetic tape, and crawl spaces form a micro-setting that constrains and charges every choice. Sensory detail is selective (cold metal ducts, dust-coated reel, static crackle) and filtered through Kaelen’s tactile familiarity. The library isn’t backdrop—it supplies the intercom, the dawn light, the audience. Final image of soft dawn light over lingering voice ties setting directly to closure’s emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mossy trellis functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—it transitions from structural prop to symbol of flexible support. Rain-soaked sensory detail (petrichor, beaded veins) is selective and POV-filtered, never decorative. The environment actively shapes tactics: wind dictates movement, dampness informs touch. Final image of Elara soaked in rain charges closure by merging character and setting.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tidal island isn’t backdrop but micro-setting: slick rocks, mud, and rain trails physically shape Kaelen’s trek and discovery. Weather actively guides action—the drizzle unmasks the convergence—and the brooch’s amber hue “catching faint light like captured sunlight” ties environment to theme. Final image of dawn water-land balance charges closure. Only minor deduction: the island’s tidal mechanics aren’t leveraged beyond mood, missing a chance to constrain choice more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.9)
    The musical crystal cave functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: crystals chime at disturbance, shadows overlap to manifest forces, the cave pearl pulses centrally.

The environment directly charges the final image: bright darkness illuminates their new roles. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ivory harbor after rain functions as both setting and micro-setting: wet stone, dust motes, sea-stained ledgers all constrain Elara’s actions and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., missing gull cries), avoiding tourist cataloging. However, the harbor never actively *pressures* choices beyond mood—it enables reflection but doesn’t force tactical shifts, missing the 9+ gate for environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “starlit vault in mist” functions as a potent micro-setting that constrains choice—it demands the phantom punch to reveal pathways—and charges the final image with glittering, crystalline echoes. Sensory detail is vivid yet selective: mist swallows sound, cracks pulse, metal hums. The environment evolves causally (mist deepens, then dissolves at dawn), and spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. The tool (punch) and setting merge to shape tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    The stargazer’s tower functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: its openness invites wind and whalesong, its archives house the tile, and its elevation becomes a literal beacon. Sensory detail is purposeful—salt-laced wind, cold tile, brittle scroll—and filtered through Elara’s historian POV. The whale migration isn’t backdrop but environmental pressure that tightens the timeline (“before the migration peaked”). Final image of the open tower recharges the setting as sanctuary, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prismatic escondite isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and enables. Its living crystal walls fracture light, vibrate with energy, and collapse into a point of light, directly shaping the spatial mutiny’s mechanics and closure. Sensory detail (humming air, deepening hues, sickly glow) is filtered through Kaelen’s dimensional awareness and urgency. The setting charges the final image: an “ordinary cave” underscores loss and transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    The funeral home prep room functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: its silence fosters patience, its tools (caskets, embalming bottles) ground Leo’s moral contrast to his father, and its “deathly vitality” fuels his clarity. The ink pot—a recurring object—charges the final image by being placed back on the shelf, now empty but purposeful. Sensory detail is selective (tarnished silver, dried crimson, warmth seeping into bones) and filtered through Leo’s professional gaze. The setting never stalls momentum; it’s woven into every beat of decision.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.0)
    The bonsai labyrinth and mountaintop aren’t backdrop but active micro-setting: their miniature grandeur mirrors Elian’s work, and the fluorescent lamp—a jarring modern intrusion—constrains his method and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., “tiny leaves glistened under starlight”), avoiding tourist cataloging. The setting evolves with the dawn, directly shaping perception and notation. Crucially, the lamp and trees jointly enable the core action, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.3)

The recurring object (arsenic label) and tidal timeframe charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Every environmental cue serves pressure or perception, never stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    The abandoned observatory functions as micro-setting: its broken telescope, shattered glass, and cliff-edge perch constrain Elara’s physical and emotional space, reinforcing isolation and finality. Sensory details—salt, decay, wooden floor vibrations—are filtered through her myth-buster lens and heighten thematic resonance. The cello and seashell act as environmental extensions that charge the final image. Only slight deduction for atmospheric richness occasionally bordering on ornamental without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    The raft city’s carnival setting functions as micro-setting: sea-spray-damp walls enable paint adhesion, fried dough and salt anchor sensory immediacy, and chaotic beauty shields subversion. The perpetual carnival isn’t backdrop—it pressures Elara’s method (graffiti as camouflage) and charges closure (laughter masking reorganization). Foundation stone chip ties environment to legacy. Only slight overreliance on visual description in mid-paragraphs prevents 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.3)
    The lunar summit isn’t backdrop but active constraint: low gravity slows movement, cold necessitates chemical timers, and terminator light dictates the photo’s timing. The sand grain and vials function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (gray light, suit hum, iridescent quartz) and filtered through Elara’s professional gaze. Every environmental element tightens stakes or enables tactics, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mist-coated rail depot functions as a micro-setting that charges atmosphere and subtly pressures choice (urgency via ship’s departure). The water bowl and light refraction are tools that constrain Elara’s method, directly shaping her actions. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—oil, metal, temperature shifts—not touristy. However, the setting doesn’t actively foreclose options or alter tactics beyond mood; thus, it falls just short of the 9+ gate requiring environmental constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.3)
    The rusted outpost and frozen lake aren’t backdrop but active constraints: the condensation on glass becomes a decipherable map, the ice hides the geothermal source, and metallic decay mirrors Elias’s fraying certainty. The micro-setting (glass pane, phrasebook, bedrock fissure) directly shapes choices and charges the final image—steam rising from stone reconfigures “river origins” from myth to physics.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ruined orchard and fog aren’t backdrop—they actively suppress sound/sight, making Elara’s light-display an act of defiance. The fresco fragment and prism function as micro-settings that constrain her method. Final image charges the fog itself as a responsive canvas. Sensory hierarchy (tactile chill, visual grayness) reflects her emotional state without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.3)
    The Sound Wave Garden is not backdrop but active agent: sonic flora bloom visible patterns, the central crystal resonates, and reflected sound alters perception. The hobo nickel (micro-setting) constrains choice—it must be pried, tapped, tossed—and charges the final image as it spins in a web of sound. Sensory detail is vivid yet selective (warmth of coin, pulsing light, bewitching hum), filtered through Elara’s professional attention. Environment directly enables the climax and embodies the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    The vintage bookshop attic is vividly rendered through scent (aged paper), light (single skylight), and texture (paper trails), functioning as a micro-setting that constrains choice—Elara’s work and healing occur only within its bounds. The meteorite chip and pigeons are tactile extensions of this space, grounding abstraction in physicality. However, while atmosphere supports tone, the setting doesn’t actively pressure decisions beyond providing refuge; it enables but rarely complicates. Final image charges the skylight with earned meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate threshold narrowly missed due to passive spatial choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.5)
    The drifting prism terrace isn’t backdrop—it refracts memory, distorts time, and culminates in a luminous threshold that Elara must cross. The oak bench’s grain constrains her method of understanding, and the logbook’s weather codes become atmospheric metaphors. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: the terrace stabilizes only after she honors necessary distances. Every sensory detail (crystalline planes, frozen rivers in wood) serves the thematic core without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    The underwater facility functions as both macro- and micro-setting: pressure groans, black water, golden sunrise—all shape Elara’s perception and emotional arc.

    The iridescent cave functions as both setting and micro-setting, actively constraining and enabling Kaelen’s work: its crystals store echoes, its light nurtures seeds, and its “cheerful gloom” modulates emotional tone. Every sensory detail—shimmering hues, glowing shoots, transliterated light—is filtered through Kaelen’s perception and directly fuels plot mechanics. The crater glass and seeds are tactile extensions of the environment, culminating in the final image where the walls “brighten, embracing his mission.” This integration earns the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tidal arcade is far more than backdrop—it functions as a micro-setting that actively enables Elara’s performance: stone arches echo sound, ledges hold props, lighthouse beams cue timing. The environment constrains and catalyzes her art, culminating in the final image where “stones hold echoes of past enchantments.” Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (salt-laced wind, damp ledge), avoiding tourist cataloging. The bishop and rose petals gain meaning through environmental interaction, charging the closure with irreplaceable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    The twilight garden functions as a micro-setting that supplies obsidian grace, damp grass, and celestial gaps—all essential to Elara’s method. The body becomes setting too: her forearm is the parchment. Sensory detail is selective (damp grass, pulsing dust, rustling leaves) and filtered through her tide-dancer perception. However, the garden never actively constrains choice—it accommodates rather than pressures—missing the 9+ gate for environmental agency.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.4)
    Pearl Bay, the mist, the atrium, and the pond function as a unified micro-setting that constrains and charges every beat. The prism atrium’s dullness in fog versus its chromatic eruption directly shapes Elara’s realization. Sensory detail is selective (salt air, cool glass, plop of stone) and filtered through her glazier’s attention. The environment actively participates in the climax—without this exact interplay of light, glass, and water, the closure fails.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    The moonlit ridge functions effectively as micro-setting, its silvered path framing Elara between forest and sky—a visual metaphor for her liminal state. The porcelain box and charred pine cone serve as constrained “environments” that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (cool porcelain, gravel scuff, tingling scars) and filtered through Elara’s firefighter POV. However, the setting never actively constrains a choice—it reflects but doesn’t pressure, missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.3)
    The grotto functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables choice: its stones, kelp, and sea glass are tactical resources, not backdrop. Sensory detail is purposeful (“wet light,” “luminous kelp”) and filtered through Elara’s observational bias. The brass gauge and pearl are tactile anchors that evolve in meaning, culminating in the pearl’s placement as the final act. Crucially, the environment charges the closure—the grotto’s hum and stilled tide embody the transformation it facilitated.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ivy-veiled passage functions as micro-setting that charges every beat: moss-covered stone, damp decay, and trembling ivy directly shape Elara’s perception and movement. Crucially, the environment constrains choice—the fireplace’s debris hides the diaries; filtered light enables the film’s revelation—and culminates in the ivy’s “final, gentle sigh,” which embodies the corridor’s released memory. Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.3)
    The echoing terrace, prism parapet, rain droplets, and jasmine-laced dusk are not backdrop but active constraints: the parapet refracts light into Lyra’s palette, the mirrors require precise acoustic codes, the hush enables focus, and the bells impose a deadline. Every sensory detail serves the central act—painting with light and sound—and culminates in the final image where environment and theme fuse. The setting charges the closure: mirages persist “for a breath longer” because the terrace’s acoustics and moisture held the moment. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography is precise and tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    The terrace functions effectively as micro-setting: its cracks mirror “flawed beauty,” and the mosaics of unity contrast present division. Moonlight interacts with the clipboard, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent—participants form a circle, hands nearly touching. Yet the setting doesn’t constrain choice; it’s a passive stage rather than an active force shaping tactics or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    The salt flat functions as micro-setting: its cracks form a navigable map that guides Elias’s steps and channels the released echo, directly constraining choice and charging the climax. Sensory detail is selective (coarse salt crunching, ethereal light) and filtered through Elias’s guilt-ridden perception. The environment mirrors his soul—“beautiful, broken”—without overt symbolism. Weather (approaching storm) tightens the timeframe and culminates in rain that feels like absolution, tying setting to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    The silver courtyard under snow functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image: its “alarming serenity” shifts from threat to testament as Elara transforms. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—starlight, snow, spectral threads—all serving the central ritual. The environment constrains no physical choice, but it embodies the thematic tension between surface calm and inner fracture, directly shaping the closure’s emotional valence.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    The decommissioned radar dome functions as a potent micro-setting: its acoustic oddities, metallic skin, and meteor-hush atmosphere directly shape Elara’s introspection and creative choices. The dome isn’t backdrop—it’s a crucible that enables her reversal, and its sensory specificity (whispers echoing like meteors, stars through cracks) is filtered through her calligrapher’s attention. The setting constrains nothing physically, but it charges the final image by reflecting her “inner resolve,” satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting via the story stick’s tactile presence.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    The verdant grotto functions as micro-setting: its isolation enables witnessing, its height aligns with “proximity to the heavens,” and its mist clings to skin during construction—tactile integration. The moth wing and arch are charged objects that constrain choice (only temporary materials used) and reweight the ending when the butterfly brushes the wing. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., “blushing stillness”). Lacks a decisive environmental constraint that alters tactics beyond mood, narrowly missing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.3)
    The icebound sanctum isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and enables. Cold stiffens the rope, demanding “technical gentleness”; auroral light filters through ice to charge the card’s perforations; melting drips mark sonic vitality. The micro-setting (rope, card, ice) functions as environment, tool, and symbolic lattice. Final image—“sanctuary of sonorous light”—reconfigures the space from prison to cradle via embodied cause.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.3)
    The vine-draped bunker functions as micro-setting and active constraint: its concrete bones, dust, and central wall directly shape the protagonist’s ritual and final act. Sensory details (ozone, wet earth, scraping vines) evolve with the storm, narrowing perception to immediacies under pressure. The setting charges the closure—the wall becomes a gateway only because it was once a prison of duty, now draped in living green. Environment, object, and body cohere to reconfigure meaning at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    The reimagined Babylonian palace functions as micro-setting: corridors map planetary paths, mosaics mirror constellations, and the observatory’s twilight gradient charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (lavender sky, tile eyes, golden smoke) and filtered through Aris’s astronomer POV. The setting constrains tactics—the schematics only work because the palace encodes celestial logic—and evolves causally as symbols rise from the floor. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.1)
    The “soundless sanctuary” is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting, but its silence is underutilized—no sensory deprivation consequences affect choice or perception. The music box cylinder constrains nothing; it’s a passive symbol. While the broken pin reappears meaningfully, the setting itself doesn’t pressure decisions—it merely hosts them. Atmosphere is strong, but environment doesn’t shape tactics or charge the final image beyond visual metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ruined orchard, twilight frost, and fog aren’t backdrop—they shape tactics (clearing placement, mirror angles) and charge the ending (fog returns, but hope lingers via the mirror). The sextant and mirrors function as micro-settings that constrain choice: broken tools must be repurposed. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (Elian notices glass-like frost, brittle branches as bones). Final mirror recharges the opening’s “glass and silver” motif with earned emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cathedral’s orchard is not backdrop but active micro-setting: roots in beams supply fruit-scented air that soothes Elara; mossy altar receives the offering; rafters echo laughter. This environment constrains and enables—decay mirrors her brokenness, growth signals renewal. Sensory details (bloom vs. rot, dew on leaves) filter through Elara’s grief and hope, never generic. The setting directly charges the final image: Lyra arrives at dawn amid thriving trees, symbolizing adaptive wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.3)
    The astral orchard functions as both macro- and micro-setting: its luminous fruits, pearlescent paths, and twilight sky aren’t backdrop but active constraints that shape Elara’s inquiries and eventual acceptance. The pistachio shell cameo—a tool-object—charges the final image when returned to the roots, embodying the theme. Sensory detail (ozone scent, drip of reclaimed water) is selective and tied to emotional beats, never stalling momentum. Setting evolves causally: disquiet brightens into curiosity, then peace, mirrored in the orchard’s unchanging yet responsive light.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.9)
    The labyrinthine bookstore functions as active micro-setting: shelves carved in stone, floating books, misty peaks—all constrain navigation and charge the climax. Sensory detail (fragile pages, humming tomes) is filtered through Elara’s professional attention. The botanical diary and floating chamber directly enable plot turns. Only minor deduction: the mountain’s scale occasionally verges on decorative rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned carnival ship functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (nowhere to go but inward) and charges the final image—the “skeletons of joy” contrast with the luminous tapestry of the garden. Sensory detail is selective (damp wood, peeling paint, scent of rain and roses) and filtered through Elara’s longing. However, the bay/fog remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure; it muffles but doesn’t alter tactics. The emerald card’s glow is the true environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.0)
    The clock tower isn’t backdrop—it supplies the rope, the pendulum, the very rhythm that syncs with Elara’s work. Brass, iron, dust motes “like tiny stars”: sensory detail filters through archivist’s familiarity, not tourist gaze. The door’s hum and wood grain shift under touch, making setting an active participant. Final image charges the space: wall restored, yet history permanently altered—setting constrains and enables the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.3)
    The harmonic caves function as a dynamic micro-setting: ice cracks guide decisions, vibrations dictate survival, and spatial acoustics shape tactics. The echo chamber stone and ice patterns are not just described—they constrain Elara’s method and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful, filtered through her trained perception, avoiding tourist cataloging. The setting evolves causally—from storm to bloom—and directly enables the resolution, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.0)
    The glass humming pavilion functions as micro-setting: its song guides alignment, its fused silica constrains action, and its resonance harmonizes with the rekindled beam. Sensory detail is selective (wind through “fragile ribs,” “cloudy” prism edges) and filtered through Elara’s retrocognitive perception. The environment directly charges the closure—light and hum coalesce into a “remembered song.” No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent across the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.3)
    The stormlit observatory, solid fog, and crystal forecourt aren’t backdrop but active constraints: the fog’s transformation triggers the hush that pressures the archivist’s work, while the rain-awakened crystal directly supplies the collective memory he seeks. Crucially, the recurring object—the crystal whispering forecourt—charges the final image when its chorus validates his epiphany. Every sensory detail (eerie light elongating shadows, damp stones steaming whispers) filters through the archivist’s professional bias, avoiding tourist cataloguing. The setting’s rules remain consistent and tactilely integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.3)
    The blooming fortress functions as both setting and active participant—its jasmine-veined stones and night-blooming cereus constrain Elian’s movements and charge his perception. Crucially, the mosaic phoenix directly enables the climax: its tiles shimmer only when illuminated by the kerosene flame, making the environment indispensable to the resolution. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., “smelling of fuel and memory”), avoiding tourist cataloguing. The final image—“the night… hummed with the memory of light”—ties setting to theme with irreplaceable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ancient grotto functions as micro-setting: tidal pools constrain Elara’s attention, starlight modulates perception, and spatial choreography (her turned back, Kael’s echo) grounds tension. Sensory detail is selective—gritty sand, fluid tide, cool jade—and filtered through Elara’s professional gaze. The setting charges the closure: the cicada’s “pulse” under stars merges environment with insight. However, the grotto never actively pressures choice beyond mood; it enables reflection but doesn’t foreclose options, narrowly missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    The xenial trellis functions as micro-setting that charges the climax: its “warm stillness” enables collection of the gilded hush, directly shaping Elara’s final act. The bunker’s “reinforced walls” and inversion’s floating debris constrain movement and perception early, while the doll and vial serve as tactile extensions of setting. Sensory hierarchy shifts appropriately—from oppressive hum to sky-born quiet—and the recurring porcelain doll reweights the closure. Every detail serves pressure or theme without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    The drifting prism terrace is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail—crystalline platforms refracting light into rainbows, pastel-hued sectors—and functions as micro-setting that shapes atmosphere and theme. The storm glass vial acts as a tool-setting hybrid, constraining Elara’s actions and charging the final image (its clarity signals success). Spatial choreography is clean, and sensory hierarchy favors visual and auditory cues appropriate to a silence-focused narrative. However, the setting never actively pressures choice—it enables but doesn’t complicate.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.1)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall, silver trees, and luminescent fruit create vivid, selective sensory detail that reflects Elara’s reverence for lost knowledge. The hidden orchard functions as micro-setting that enables discovery, and the ruby flake’s glow interacts with environment.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.3)
    The alchemical orchard functions as both setting and micro-setting: luminescent fruits, silver branches, and glass panes directly enable and constrain Alaric’s ritual. The “endless night” isn’t backdrop—it pressures his withdrawn nature and frames the stakes. Sensory detail is selective (cold paper, humming air, flickering light) and filtered through his alchemical-knight POV. Crucially, the greenhouse charges the final image: its stabilization mirrors his internal poise, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    The foster care file room functions as a potent micro-setting—the brittle files, wooden desk, and accumulated dust directly constrain Elara’s actions (slow movements, careful handling). The infantryman’s button charges the final image, embodying the “examined unknown.” Sensory detail is selective (tactile grime, crackling paper) and filtered through Elara’s professional bias. However, the setting doesn’t actively pressure choices beyond atmosphere—it enables rather than compels, missing the 9+ gate for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.1)
    The auric lagoon and puddle-map setting are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (glowing gold water, rain on cobblestones), and the phone booth functions as micro-setting. However, the environment rarely constrains choice—the lagoon supplies voices effortlessly, and the map requires no interpretation or risk. Descriptions are atmospheric but static, serving mood over tactical pressure. The recurring key and reflections charge tone but don’t alter outcomes in a causally legible way.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    The radiant grotto, prism atrium, and morning fog form a cohesive micro-setting that actively shapes tactics: fog enables coded light, dewdrops absorb silence, the atrium’s refraction demands musical countermeasures. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Elias’s ritual focus. The saxophone functions as tool-as-setting, its brass and breathy tones integral to the conflict. Final image charges the setting: mist thins as threat recedes, proving environment constrains and reflects stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ashen skyborne arbor functions as both setting and micro-setting: its branches, leaves, and moss directly enable and constrain Elara’s actions. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (“mossy delight,” “grey heavens”), filtered through her orderly perception. The environment evolves causally—monuments trigger greening—and charges the final image where blooming branches and dewdrops embody thematic unity. This specificity earns high marks, though the setting never imposes a hard constraint that forecloses a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting functions as active constraint and emotional mirror: the cluttered workshop, rotting greenhouse, and subterranean waterfall each shape Elara’s choices and charge the final image. The compass rose’s warmth and the glowing moss grotto are purposeful, not decorative. Crucially, the environment directly enables discovery (key in greenhouse, box beneath ashes) and culminates in the compass guiding her through tunnels—proving setting constrains tactics. Sensory detail is selective, tactile, and filtered through her tinkerer’s perception, avoiding tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rain-washed foundry functions as micro-setting: cold forges and slick anvils constrain Elara’s solitude and ritual, while scrubbed windows admit gray light that illuminates both space and realization. Sensory hierarchy reflects her alchemical focus—gleaming silver, shimmering heat patterns, powdered gold. Weather (rain) scrubs soot but also mirrors internal cleansing. The zodiac coin, as object-as-setting, charges the final image through its repaired, glowing state.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.1)
    Echo Gorge functions as micro-setting—the whispering walls amplify sound, enabling spectral confessions—but this feature is stated, not exploited in action. The crocodile’s tooth and misaligned harp are handled, yet the gorge itself doesn’t constrain choices or evolve with events. Descriptions are lush (“luminous ache,” “golden rays”) but atmospheric rather than tactical; the setting decorates rather than pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ultraviolet forest is not backdrop but active crucible: its glowing bark, black stream, and UV burn shape Kaelen’s perception and pain.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alchemist’s market is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail—glowing elixirs, whispering artifacts, ozone and parchment—that filters through Elara’s professional attention. The lighthouse lens functions as micro-setting, constraining perception and enabling the vision. However, the market itself doesn’t pressure choices; it’s atmospheric backdrop rather than active crucible. The final image gains resonance from the lens fragment’s warmth, satisfying the 9+ gate partially but not fully constraining tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    The abandoned ticket office functions as a micro-setting that actively pressures choice—the buzzing light dictates timing, the boarded window hides the compartment, and the drop ceiling conceals evidence. Sensory detail is selective and profession-filtered (dust analysis, ladder use). The ceiling itself constrains the climax and charges the final image (“he would always be drawn to such places”). Minor deduction: posters and circus debris verge on generic, but are redeemed by functional integration.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.5)
    The glass orchard library isn’t backdrop—it constrains and enables: branches hold knowledge like fruit, walls receive frost glyphs, and the sea of clouds reacts to temporal rupture. The letterpress imprints directly onto negotiable reality, making tool and setting co-extensive with plot. Final image of “ever-changing frost” reweights the entire premise, proving environment charges closure. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Elara’s cryptic professionalism.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    The baroque asteroid functions as micro-setting through recurring tactile details—the crystal shard, ion storms, covered mirrors—that constrain choices and charge the ending. Time strands as visible golden threads are integrated into action (swirling around the shard, avoiding covered glass), not mere backdrop. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara’s poetic focus: light, reflection, and texture dominate, narrowing during storm tension. The shard itself becomes environmental anchor, fulfilling the 9+ gate by constraining the experiment and illuminating closure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    The resonance chamber functions as micro-setting: it amplifies sound, enabling the tinkersong to tether light, and its acoustics directly shape tactics. The music box, brass gears, and philosopher’s stone chip are tactile, recurring objects that constrain and enable action. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—oil-stained fingers, wilting brass, shimmering air—but leans heavily visual; other senses are underutilized. The setting charges the final image: the chamber echoes triumphantly as light returns, fulfilling the 9+ gate condition.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.3)
    The subterranean lagoon isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains choice (no vials opened) and charges closure (water’s stillness mirrors her surrender). Sensory detail is selective: petrichor’s scent, cold water, brass compass—all filtered through Elara’s profession and obsession. The limestone cliffs, factory siren, and obsidian water evolve causally with her descent, never static. The compass-as-micro-setting shapes tactics and final image irreplaceably.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    The storm-tossed archway functions as micro-setting: its vibration guides Elara’s trance, its debris yields the slide, and its silence marks completion.

The cathedral window’s mechanics matter, but the pavilion functions more as mood than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    The obsidian lagoon constrains choice—it’s the only site where debris arrangements unlock truth—and charges the final image as Elara gazes at dunes from above, now knowing their hidden weight. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (grains of sand, cool air), filtered through archivist precision. The zeppelin library grounds the present frame without distraction. Only minor deduction: the floating library’s potential as micro-setting isn’t fully leveraged beyond ambiance.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    The paper-lantern cove is vividly rendered through selective, sensory details—the crunch of leaves, sagging lantern frames, amber light—that evoke desolation and potential. The setting actively shapes tactics: wind, sea, and reeds become resources; lanterns are repurposed for solar energy. The amber bottle functions as micro-setting, charging the final image as a civic monument. Yet the environment doesn’t *constrain* Elian’s choices so much as illustrate them, missing the 9+ gate where setting must narrow options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.1)
    The ancient orchard atop a skyscraper is not backdrop but crucible: its roots intertwine with steel, merging nature and urbanity to enable the prophecy’s emergence. The wax cylinder, apple tree, and willow are tactile anchors that constrain Elian’s ritual and charge the ending—his descent from this liminal space feels like leaving an oracle’s shrine. Sensory detail (wax curls like petals, city hum beneath chanting) is filtered through his archivist sensibility, avoiding tourist cataloging. The setting directly enables the climax: only here, amid ancient roots and dead languages, could fate be recorded.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.1)
    The icebound atrium under starlight functions as micro-setting that actively pressures choice: frost limits visibility, cold heightens urgency, and starlight guides ritual precision.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    The windblown sanctuary functions as micro-setting: its height enables storm observation, its stone parapets hold instruments, and its cathedral bell rope becomes both tool and symbol. Sensory detail is selective (wind’s whisper, glue-dried rope, pressure drop) and filtered through Elara’s professional attention. The setting constrains choice—only from this vantage can she detect microclimates—and charges the final image: the bell’s chime carried on the wind. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    The shooting star tracking station and the yellow lantern glass function as micro-settings that charge the atmosphere and reflect Kael’s inner state. Descriptions are vivid and selective (“primal elegance,” “golden pool of light”), filtered through his spiritually curious POV. However, the setting never constrains choice or alters tactics—it remains a passive canvas. The glass illuminates thoughts but doesn’t enable or prevent action, missing the 9+ gate for environmental agency.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.0)
    The abandoned beekeeping oasis functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its green isolation enables ghostly manifestation and covenant logic, while the scorched wasteland outside frames stakes. Sensory details (dust, honey scent, heat shimmer) are vivid, selective, and filtered through the recluse’s perception. The stained glass box charges the final image, its warmth cooling as ghosts fade—environment directly shaping closure. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    The emerald silo functions as micro-setting: its humming metal, green light, and labyrinthine relics constrain Elara’s actions and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—“verdant, aged metal,” “sound of rain on the roof”—evolving from prison to sanctuary. The urn fragment, handled repeatedly, becomes environmental extension. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cobalt lagoon after rain is vividly rendered and filters all perception—the wet sand, ripples, scent of earth—but it remains atmospheric rather than constraining. The feather and kite interact with the setting, yet the lagoon never pressures a decision or alters tactics. Still, sensory hierarchy aligns with the poet’s calm focus, and the final image blends kite, water, and sky cohesively. Misses 9+ by lacking environmental constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    The temple orchard functions as a dynamic micro-setting: living stone pillars constrain and enable Elara’s remodel, directly shaping tactics (e.g., choosing central oak between “vibrant” pillars). Copper wire and diary charge the final image—tools that become part of the ecosystem. Sensory detail is selective (humming stone, dappled light) and filtered through Elara’s caretaker POV. However, the setting doesn’t impose hard physical limits beyond thematic resonance, narrowly missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rainwashed tower, overgrown sculpture path, and fly amber function as micro-settings that actively constrain and charge choices—the footprints guide, the amber triggers revelation, the tower houses the beacon. Sensory detail (wet stone, bronze quiet, drifting motes) is selective, POV-filtered, and woven into action. Only minor deduction: spring setting feels slightly generic despite strong integration.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    The blooming jetty at twilight is vividly rendered with sensory specificity—glowing flowers, rattling pods, bird calls—and functions as micro-setting that directly enables the action. The “narrow vastness” motif constrains spatial perception and charges the final image. Environment actively shapes tactics: soil patches are chosen via avian guidance, linking ecology to agency. However, the dead reef remains atmospheric rather than causally active, slightly limiting full 9+ integration.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    The scrapyard functions as micro-setting: rust, cracked earth, and train-car cabin constrain movement and mood. The phonograph and leaf are tactile tools that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (hiss of cylinder, blaze of leaf hues) and filtered through Baron’s grief. However, the wasteland remains atmospheric rather than actively pressuring tactics—setting mirrors but doesn’t shape choices beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    The time dilation observation deck functions as a potent micro-setting: its warped temporality directly constrains action (“each adjustment magnified by the stretched time”) and charges the final image (footsteps echoing in silence). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—Kaelen notices breath, dead machinery hum, liquid-star drift—not tourist cataloging. The gilded compass rose and datapad are tools that evolve into symbolic anchors. Only slight deduction: the station’s physical layout beyond the window remains vague, but not detrimental at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.3)
    The icebound spire isn’t backdrop—it constrains every move: sheer faces demand sacred playfulness; blue-ice summit enables the pedestal; thin air heightens stakes. The pocket sundial lid functions as micro-setting, its celestial etchings directly enabling the climax. Sensory detail is selective (violet smears, green halo, cracking-ice voice) and filtered through Kaelen’s wonder. Final image of glowing ice and humming spire charges closure with environmental reciprocity.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    The whispering gallery isn’t backdrop—it actively shapes tactics: acoustics decode Elara’s steps into whispers, making the setting a co-archivist. The pawn-less chessboard evolves from metaphor to charged object she touches, then reinterprets as a “clean slate.” Spatial choreography remains precise (center of hall, marble floor), and the nomadic penumbra interacts physically with light and memory. Every detail serves the final image: luminous absence made tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.3)
    The labyrinthine bookstore isn’t backdrop but active crucible: shelves shift in response to intent, corridors mirror inward journey, and the mountain’s “hidden thunder” vibrates with transformation. Crucially, the feather—a micro-setting—constrains choice: its silk-like texture sharpens focus, enabling activation of the stone. Every sensory detail (whispering books, mercury’s shimmer, obsidian’s coolness) serves Elara’s emotional arc, avoiding tourist cataloging. The final image of her walking shelves recharges the setting as sanctuary, not prison.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    The time-frozen village functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice: its silence forces focus, its stasis mirrors Elian’s internal paralysis, and its eventual “gentle breath” signals transformation. The platinum labyrinth and tapestry are tactile, recurring objects that evolve in meaning—from symbols of shame to tools of redemption. Sensory detail is selective (no rustling leaves, suspended air) and filtered through Elian’s professional attention to pattern and texture. The setting charges the final image: redemption held in “quiet streets.”

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)
    The canyon, bone towers, and pale spire aren’t backdrop—they actively shape tactics and charge the ending. The “endless echoes” enable Elara’s method; the towers lean in to amplify syllables; the spire’s silence becomes a contested monument. Sensory detail is selective (spectral glow, whispered syllables, tears as part of the poem) and filtered through Elara’s artistic perception. The setting culminates in the final image: air “thick with the echoes of everything it could mean,” proving environment constrains choice and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.1)
    The acid sea, gears-and-cogs workshop, and submerged statue form a micro-setting that actively constrains choice: the corrosive environment limits dive time, dictates protective measures, and threatens structural collapse. Sensory details (green-tinged waters, creaking floor, stinging eyes) are filtered through Elian’s urgency and profession, never decorative. The setting charges the final image—the charm’s golden glow against acid-dripping robes—and evolves causally (workshop groans as statue crumbles).

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.0)
    The coastal cave network isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choice. Light “casting shifting patterns like fleeting dreams” mirrors Elara’s thematic struggle; the pool reflects both ceiling and her fractured self. Crucially, the setting charges the closure: she places the shell on a “natural shelf,” letting go within this sanctuary where “time itself paused, yet moved on.” The quay, gulls, and brine establish a sensory baseline that evolves coherently into the cave’s damp intimacy. Every detail serves POV bias—she notices peeling wood, crying gulls, fissured light because they echo her state.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cobalt lighthouse, dawn light, and post-heat-wave air are rendered with sensory specificity that serves theme and action. The lamp room’s circular ledge, the open window, and the garden below all function as micro-settings that enable the ritual. However, while atmosphere is immersive, the environment doesn’t actively constrain Elara’s choices—it facilitates rather than pressures, missing the 9+ gate requiring environmental constraint on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    The starlit signal station functions as a potent micro-setting: its stranded metal-island quality pressures Elara’s isolation, while the control room floor becomes both canvas and ritual space. The patina bronze censer foot acts as object-as-setting—its coolness, glow, and lunar sync directly constrain and enable action (e.g., aligning with Polaris). Sensory detail is selective (groaning hydraulics, jarring phone bell, fluctuating light) and filtered through Elara’s ritualistic focus. However, the environment doesn’t actively impede or alter tactics beyond mood; it’s atmospheric rather than agential, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.3)
    The hanging orchard and storm-battered ravine are not backdrop but active constraints: slick paths shape navigation, lightning enables the ritual, and the orchard’s resilience mirrors Elara’s arc. The stone hut, copper wire cradle, and truffle basket ground the world in tactile specificity. Crucially, the setting charges the final image—the orchard as witness—and the glass eye functions as micro-setting, its transformation echoing environmental volatility. Every detail serves pressure, choice, or thematic resonance without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    The opal dock, mist, and nautical twilight aren’t mere backdrop—they constrain perception and mirror Elias’s liminal state. The Edelweiss functions as micro-setting, its mountain origin clashing with the sea to charge thematic tension. Sensory detail is selective (damp air, crunch of snow in memory) and filtered through Elias’s habits. The final image of the dock “gleaming like a pearl” reconfigures the setting from prison to sanctuary, fulfilling the 9+ gate by charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    The blooming cavern is vividly rendered with bioluminescent fungi, midsummer flowers, and echoing creek—sensory details serve mood and theme without stalling momentum. Crucially, the setting constrains the climax: rising water forces the final choice, and the carved wall requires the chip’s imprint. The shop and fields are economically sketched but sufficient. Misses 9+ only because the cavern’s magic isn’t fully integrated into world rules before the climax, risking slight tonal rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cobalt and ember grottos are atmospherically potent and directly charge the climax—the bleeding starlight manifests only within this specific space, making setting essential to revelation. However, the environment doesn’t constrain tactics; Elara moves through it unimpeded. The fireflies and clouds serve mood more than mechanics, missing the 9+ gate requiring environmental constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ember nexus, twilight, nautilus shell, and pocket sun form a tightly interwoven micro-setting that actively constrains and enables choice. The nautilus isn’t just described—it channels energy; the nexus’s “dying light” sets the initial stakes; twilight’s deepening marks temporal pressure. Sensory detail (smoldering heart, shimmering air, cool shell) is selective and POV-filtered. However, the setting doesn’t *force* a difficult trade-off—it facilitates transformation without tangible resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mountain ranger cabin functions as micro-setting: maps and supplies lean in as silent witnesses, the charred stick from the fireplace becomes the writing tool, and spatial choreography remains coherent during the dream uplift. Crucially, the birch bark scroll constrains choice—it demands non-linear inscription, shaping the narrative method. Final image charges the setting: the cabin’s silence lifts “just a little” after the scroll is filled, proving environment modulates internal stakes. No white-room syndrome; every detail serves pressure or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.1)
    The water clock shop functions as a micro-setting that actively charges the narrative: condensation-beaded windows, “ticking shadows,” and the hum of time constrain Elara’s perception and catalyze her insight. The birthing clamp screw—a tool repurposed—constrains choice by becoming her new methodological anchor. Fog and wet pavement aren’t backdrop but active filters that shape tone and perception. Every detail serves the theme without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    The floating platform, crow quill, and storm-laden air function as micro-settings that constrain and charge every action: the quill’s tip shapes rune precision, the platform sways with emotional stakes, and the “saturated hush” modulates tension. Sensory detail is selective (steam, gem-like crystals, ceramic cup) and filtered through Elara’s scholarly yet vulnerable POV. Final image of runes glowing on stone reconfigures the setting as archive of resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sheet music archive functions as micro-setting: shelves bow under scores, aged paper scents the air, and the sonata lectern anchors action. The orchard outside isn’t backdrop—it breathes, remembers, and is scheduled for destruction, tightening time and raising stakes. The perfume bottle and apple blossom charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (Elara notices ink, minor keys, orange blossom), never tourist-like.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ancient temple library is vividly rendered with sensory texture—dust, hush, fading ink—and functions effectively as a micro-setting. However, it never constrains choice or supplies resources that alter tactics; it remains a static backdrop. The dictionary and mural are described but don’t interact causally with spatial logic. Still, the “resounding hush” and muted mural create a cohesive, immersive atmosphere that supports the thematic aim.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.0)
    The fjord, granite outcrop, and hydraulic clocks aren’t backdrop—they’re active constraints. The horizon measurement station forces precision in observation; water clocks dictate the ritual’s rhythm; light off the fjord triggers squinting, which modulates perception. The mantle clock key functions as micro-setting, its weight and use shaping tactile engagement. Final image charges the setting: silence and stillness become truth-bearers only because the environment was rigorously established as a site of measurement.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (damp earth, blue pulse, quiet wildfire hum) that reflects Elara’s professional attention and emotional state. Crucially, the setting constrains choice: permeable barriers dictate detection methods, and the pre-dawn timeframe pressures action. The laser button and mushrooms function as micro-settings that directly enable the climax. However, the environment doesn’t impose physical stakes (e.g., terrain hazards), slightly limiting its causal pressure—hence just below 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rainwashed library, mica lantern, and subway seats form a cohesive micro-setting that charges the final image—the damp paper scent, gleaming stone, and kaleidoscopic shadows all reflect Elara’s internal state without overt symbolism. The lantern functions as tool and symbol, constraining no physical choice but deeply shaping thematic resonance. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, especially the tactile brush of book spines. However, the setting doesn’t actively pressure decisions—it receives rather than resists.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    The subway utility tunnel isn’t backdrop—it’s a pressure chamber that enables Leo’s role and isolates him from the world above. The glass harmonica disc functions as micro-setting: its spin constrains the loop, and its fading melody charges the closure. Sensory detail (hum of streetlamps, smudged glass, static-frayed voice) is selective and POV-filtered. The recurring object directly shapes tactics and final resonance, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.1)
    The blooming jetty at twilight functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges every action—the jasmine, salt air, and wooden pilings are woven into Elara’s documentation and emotional state. The environment directly enables the covenant’s regeneration (petals glowing, flowers trembling) and culminates in the final image where the jetty “blooms in twilight, guarded by its stories.” Sensory hierarchy reflects her archival focus, avoiding tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    The disused station isn’t backdrop—it constrains choice (mossy bench seating, leaf-choked acoustics) and charges closure (ivy “listening” as strangers gather). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: Elara notices structural decay humorously, Leo hears echoing vulnerability. The moon rock functions as micro-setting, its warmth contrasting the cold brick. Final image ties ivy’s growth to human connection, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.6)
    The ultrasonic forest isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and enables: its drone guides, its history downloads, its stillness thresholds. The platinum ring and Elara’s skin function as micro-settings that charge the final image: hands on earth, ring pressing soil, translating vibration into emotional syntax. Sensory hierarchy (touch/sound over sight) reflects POV bias without exposition. Setting evolves causally—from singing trees to silent gully—and culminates in the earth’s chord resonating in bone.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.1)
    The gravitational anomaly isn’t backdrop—it’s active pressure that warps light, thins time, and swells unpredictably from Elara’s error, directly shaping her isolation and methods. The dried fountain pen functions as micro-setting: its exotic nib constrains her final choice (tracing air before transmitting), charging the closure image. Sensory detail is selective (bent light, hum vs. roar) and filtered through professional bias. Environment and tool jointly enable the ending’s recalibration.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    The luminous harbor is vividly rendered through selective, sensory-rich detail (“waters gleaming like liquid silver,” “lap of waves against pilings”), all filtered through Elian’s melancholic POV. Crucially, the setting functions as micro-setting: the moonlight enables visual framing, the dock positions bodies, and the sea’s rhythms supply the “percussion” for the advisor’s method. The vintage camera—a tool embedded in the environment—constrains and charges the final image when Elian aims it at the horizon, sensing “not a picture, but an emotion.” This integration lifts description beyond atmosphere into narrative function.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    The archive’s dust-laden corridors, cold air, and shafts of light are selectively rendered to mirror Kaelen’s internal shift from desolation to purpose. The setting constrains choice: crumbling walls force tactile navigation, and the secluded alcove’s lighting isolates the tapestry as sacred. However, while atmosphere is strong, the environment doesn’t actively pressure tactics beyond mood—it’s backdrop more than crucible. The recurring tapestry fragment qualifies as micro-setting but doesn’t evolve spatially to alter movement.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.1)
    The sound wave garden and auric lagoon are masterfully integrated as micro-settings that actively shape the narrative: the flora responds to rhythm, the lagoon stores beats, and both constrain and enable Elara’s rebellion. Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through her fractured perception—gold light, resonant bark, trembling hands. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: the lagoon’s persistent glow becomes a beacon, fulfilling the 9+ gate by constraining future possibility. No white-room syndrome; every detail serves theme and action.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.3)
    The shipping container labyrinth isn’t backdrop—it actively disorients, constrains movement, and reflects Elara’s internal order amid chaos. The geomagnetic storm alters perception and disables tech, forcing reliance on analog tools (map, coin, key). Sensory detail is selective and profession-filtered: she notices seams, walks, charged air—not generic “green pulses.” The hidden relay niche and shifting hues charge the final image, making environment inseparable from theme and tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cobalt dock, rain-washed air, and abandoned warehouse form a vivid, tactile micro-setting that directly enables Elara’s method. The dental mirror and shutters function as environmental tools that constrain and charge her actions. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her perception (e.g., “black mirror hiding forgotten things”). However, the setting doesn’t impose meaningful limitations—it facilitates without resistance, missing the 9+ gate requiring constraint or tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cobalt library, magnetic grotto, and mist-shrouded town form a cohesive, sensory-rich world where setting actively shapes tactics: the grotto amplifies intention, the library hides dissent, windows become canvases. Minerals tugging metal and lodestone pieces constrain choice (only magnetic-safe objects work), charging the final image. However, while vivid, the environment rarely imposes *physical* cost—more atmospheric than tactical—keeping it just below the 9-band threshold for constraint-driven setting.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sublittoral fringe functions as micro-setting: its liminal wet stones shape Elara’s path and symbolize her threshold state. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—splintered wood vs. smooth scrimshaw, cool water vs. grime—filtered through her laborer’s POV. The scrimshaw charges the final image, dissolving into sea foam as she steps ashore. Only minor deduction: the docks lack specific geographic or temporal anchors beyond generic “port” cues.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.3)
    The wind turbines are not backdrop but active pressure: their shadows “fell across her like bars,” their hum replaces natural silence, and their scale dwarfs her existence, directly charging the final image of swallowed stillness. The farmhouse, knife, and bouquet function as micro-settings that constrain choice—whittling is her only permissible outlet, the bouquet her sole relic of mourning. Sensory detail is selective (brittle petals, rhythmic scrape, manufactured hush) and filtered through Elara’s numb perception. Every atmospheric element tightens thematic stakes without ornamental drift.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt atrium and frozen lake are vividly rendered and function as micro-setting that charges the final image—the merging of inside/outside mirrors thematic dissolution. Sensory detail (lantern-moth hush, quartz hum) is selective and purposeful, filtered through the poet’s aesthetic sensibility. The environment constrains no choice but deeply shapes tone and closure resonance. World rules remain consistent, with setting evolving causally as boundaries blur.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glassblower’s courtyard functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: cracked fountains, molten glass, and living plant arrangements shape choices and charge the ending. Sensory detail is vivid yet selective—Elian perceives light, texture, shadow, not color—filtering description through his POV. The glass reed tongue and bonsai roots are purposeful, recurring details that evolve in meaning. Only slight overreliance on visual metaphor (despite protagonist’s blindness) prevents a 9.0+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.3)
    The miner’s lens functions as micro-setting, constraining Elara’s methodology and charging the final image when repurposed as a bridge. Sensory detail is exquisitely selective—“golden shadows,” “fractured light,” “audible light”—filtered through Elara’s acoustic expertise. The laboratory evolves causally: static archive becomes resonant organism, mirroring her internal shift. Every object (silvery disks, crystalline bell) serves tactile and thematic purpose, avoiding white-room syndrome while maintaining poetic economy.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    The observatory functions as both setting and micro-setting: its dome shafts light that charges the stencil’s shadow, directly enabling Elara’s epiphany. Tools (engraving implements), objects (vellum stencil), and spatial choreography (velvet curtains, forgotten corridor) constrain choices and evolve causally—dust gives way to illumination, sealed rooms open. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (silence echoing emptiness, crisp paper), avoiding tourist cataloging. The environment actively shapes the climax and closure, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.1)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft functions effectively as micro-setting, its shifting light and enclosed sanctuary shaping Elara’s perception and ritual. Sensory detail is selective and mood-aligned (dim light, metallic gleam, hushed gloom), filtered through her cartomancer’s attention. The measuring tape and tarot cards are tactile extensions of the environment. However, the setting never constrains a choice—it atmospherically supports but doesn’t pressure action, missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bronze prism pagoda functions as micro-setting: its reflective surface and twilight glow constrain Elara’s ritual and charge the final image. The archive breathes in acknowledgment—a subtle personification that avoids cliché. Sensory detail is selective (fractured light, whisper-like atoms, evening breeze) and filtered through Elara’s historian POV. However, the setting never actively pressures choice beyond atmosphere; it enables but doesn’t complicate.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “blooming library” functions as micro-setting: its petals unfold in response to Elara’s act, directly charging the climax. Sensory detail is selective (crystalline shelves, luminous screen, cool stone) and filtered through Elara’s professional gaze. The cloud-bound locale isn’t generic—it enables the thematic contrast between grounded reality (stone) and ethereal dreams. Final image of stars ties setting to emotional resonance without over-description.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.0)
    The misty workshop functions as micro-setting: its “shimmering stillness” mirrors Elara’s internal recalibration, while tools/jars enable her wildlife work.

Sensory detail (silver shroud, muted colors) serves urgency without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tower functions as micro-setting: its stones, ivy, and flagstone directly enable the tunneling action. Sensory detail (wet clay, frosted glass, leafy sighs) is filtered through Aris’s telepathic perception, never touristic. The hourglass and coffee rings are recurring objects that constrain interpretation and charge the final image. Environment actively guides choice—the loose flagstone is revealed through plant-thoughts, making setting instrumental, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    The projection booth functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges the climax—it’s both reliquary and launchpad. Sensory detail (“dust-moted silence,” “hushed thunder”) is filtered through Elara’s spatial perception and profession. The crystal at her neck and the film strip evolve from props to thematic anchors. Final image (“vintage palace seemed to breathe”) ties setting to closure, though it narrowly misses 9+ by lacking a direct tactical constraint during the vision sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    The aurora-lit archway, orrery, and celestial backdrop are vividly specific and filtered through Elara’s perception. The orrery functions as micro-setting, constraining and charging the final image—it’s both tool and companion. Sensory detail (cold brass, shimmering green) is selective and purposeful. However, the setting doesn’t actively pressure choices; it’s a stage, not a crucible, limiting its causal role despite strong atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glowing dune functions as micro-setting—its warmth, pulse, and breath directly mirror and enable Elara’s emotional arc, culminating in its “joy” radiating post-ignition. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (sand “alive beneath her boots,” flowers “pulsing like slow heartbeats”), filtered through Elara’s tactile, dreamless perception. The ruined library and dead cities are evoked economically yet concretely. However, while the dune charges the final image, it doesn’t actively constrain choices—it responds rather than pressures, narrowly missing 9+ integration.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.3)
    The mechanical rainforest is masterfully specific: brass trees sigh, mercury waterfalls reflect, wire vines glow—all filtered through Elara’s sensory bias. Crucially, the setting constrains choice: wind harmonics guide navigation; the gear fits only one slot. Final image charges the titanium tree’s whistle and bronze willow’s gong as cognitive markers. Every detail serves theme or tactic—no postcard tourism.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.9)
    The veiled ridgeway, mist, pines, and shoreline are rendered with sensory specificity that serves tone and theme—not postcard backdrop. Crucially, the setting constrains choice: the crumbling trails and hidden streams force reliance on the guides and embody the “indirect routes” philosophy. The star stamp on skin functions as micro-setting, charging the final image. Salt air, damp earth, and pine whispers evolve with emotional states without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cobalt fortress, snow, spiral staircase, and piano bench function as micro-settings that constrain and charge choices: the bolt’s absence destabilizes the bench; the discoloration guides discovery; the cold blue walls mirror “frostbitten hope.” Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—Elian notices rust, dust, instability—never touristy. The setting evolves causally (dusting reveals clue; repair alters perception) and culminates in the charged final image where environment and internal state fuse.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.4)
    The ancient temple library functions as micro-setting and active agent: its silence is Lorian’s “canvas,” its books weapons, its floor inscribed with the decisive rune. Iron gall ink, dew, parchment—all constrain and enable his method. The final image of Lorian “small yet immense in the settling dust” charges the setting with thematic weight. Every sensory detail (scent of aged paper, blooming ink) serves pressure or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sea level station functions as micro-setting: its hum, sensors, and console anchor action and constrain Kaelen’s choices (e.g., data assembly). Sensory detail is selective—salt air, metal desks, glass screens—and filtered through a marine biologist’s attention. The torn atlas charges the final image, transforming from relic to benchmark. However, the environment doesn’t actively obstruct or enable tactics beyond mood mirroring.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.1)
    The abandoned spaceport functions as both macro- and micro-setting: gantries, loader, concrete floor, and twilight all constrain and charge Elara’s movements. Sensory detail is selective (cool dust, low hum, glowing stones) and filtered through her stargazer sensibility. Crucially, the environment directly enables the climax—the stone circle is discovered *because* she walks barefoot, scanning walls—making setting causal, not decorative. The “margin of daylight” evolves into night, tightening the emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    The volcanic hot springs function as more than backdrop—they supply warmth, steam, minerals, and sacred space that directly enable Elara’s quest and later communal rituals. The glowing moss, scorched branches, and geothermal vents are tactile and purposeful, constraining navigation and charging the final image. However, while vivid, the setting doesn’t actively foreclose options during key decisions—its role is permissive rather than pressuring.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    The arboretum, cliff, wind, and lighthouse are not backdrop but active forces: salt-scorched earth challenges growth, the beam marks time and abandonment, brine scent grounds memory. These details constrain Elara’s actions (grafting resilience into harsh soil) and charge the final image—her work glowing at dusk as the lighthouse sweeps. Sensory hierarchy shifts appropriately: crisis narrows perception to breath and chill; calm admits bloom and breeze. The setting functions as micro-setting, body, and tool all at once.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.3)
    The lighthouse library functions as both macro- and micro-setting: stone walls press inward physically and psychologically, while the tarot box and oak table constrain choices (e.g., Elian must sit to untangle threads). Salt, dust, and lamplight aren’t decorative—they shape perception (“luminescent ache”) and charge the closure when the light softens into “internal radiance.” Every detail filters through Elian’s artist POV: he notices cracks, fading pigments, spatial compression. The setting actively pressures his descent and rewards his breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    The wind-carved encampment isn’t backdrop—it’s micro-setting that reflects Kael’s identity (“sculpted by centuries of relentless gales”) and supplies the stone tablet for the experiment. The drone, ink, and stone are tactile tools that constrain choice. The bruised purple sky and thick silence establish tone while mirroring internal stakes. Crucially, the disappearing ink’s transience charges the final image—its vanishing parallels memory’s fragility, fulfilling the 9+ gate by constraining both method and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “echoing library under snow” functions as micro-setting: its silence amplifies Elara’s actions, its dormant networks enable her rebellion, and its icy terminals constrain her physically (“fingers trembling over icy controls”). Snow deepens thematic hush while pressuring the mood. Final image of drifting snowflakes recharges the opening, making environment integral to closure. Vivid, selective, and purposeful across senses.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glass-domed desert rose farm functions as a potent micro-setting that constrains and enables: it shields Elara yet broadcasts hope. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—thorny stems, vibrant colors, pollen carrying values—all filtered through her perception. The airship scrap’s integration into the root zone charges the final image. However, the setting doesn’t actively pressure a pivotal choice; it supports rather than compels.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.3)
    The sound wave garden functions as a dynamic micro-setting that actively pressures choices—collapsing structures demand zigzags, dissonance shatters space, floral ripples shape navigation. The rail spike and constellations are environmental extensions that constrain tactics. Final image is charged by the setting’s restoration, now “forever changed.” Sensory detail is selective, vivid, and filtered through Kael’s fisher-instincts, avoiding white-room syndrome or generic lyricism.

    The echoing observatory above clouds functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its isolation enables private reckoning, while its celestial detachment mirrors Elara’s yearning for truth beyond earthly corruption. The rosewood nib—tool-as-setting—is handled in three distinct beats and fused into the tablet stylus at closure, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective (smell of newsprint, tap of keystrokes) and filtered through journalistic bias. Clouds parting for her resolve ties environment to agency without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    The laboratory of lost sounds functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice: its haunted firmware dictates what Elara hears, and its acoustic fields become her canvas. The amber, escritoire, and meteor hush are tactile, recurring, and charged—each altering tactics (e.g., using furniture as temporal conduit). Final image of glowing constellation tattoos on lab essence directly reconfigures the setting’s meaning from prison to sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.0)
    The grotto isn’t backdrop but active crucible: mist softens edges and absorbs sound, acoustics amplify anxiety, damp sand enables the mandala. These environmental features directly constrain Elara’s method and charge closure—the mist’s shift from “threatening veil” to “soft dawn grey” mirrors thematic transformation. Recurring sensory details (lilac haze, chalk-stained fingers, rustling sand) evolve with pressure, avoiding static description.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ancient plaza functions as micro-setting: its debris, cobblestones, and mosaic fragments constrain Elara’s actions and charge the climax. The “shattered sky” and “warm coldness” aren’t backdrop—they mirror internal states while shaping perception (e.g., ash-heat vs. void-cold). The tessera and stepping stone are handled tactically, not decoratively. Crucially, the setting enables the renaming ritual, making it indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mystic orchard garden isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choice: silver apples evoke greasepaint, trees form a proscenium, fruits brighten as footlights. The hedge maze’s magic enables the ritual; the tarot coin’s prismatic shadows interact with spatial choreography. Sensory specificity (tart citrus dusk, whispered sonatas) filters through Elara’s synesthesia, making setting inseparable from perception. The garden charges the final image—its approval seals her redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    The light painting studio functions as a micro-setting that actively shapes tactics: long-exposure photography translates neural pathways into visible light, and the geode refracts this light into branching patterns that mirror memory. Sensory detail is selective—tingling skin, cool shade, warm sun—and filtered through Alex’s urgency. The muscovite sliver and LED wand are handled tactically, not decoratively. Final image charged by environment: swirling colors become a “tapestry of light” that embodies their bond.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.1)
    The coastal cave network functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: saline drafts, echoing chambers, and mineral veins respond to emotional heat, directly shaping Kaelen’s path and final revelation. Sensory detail is purposeful—stone pulses, air thickens, light emanates—not decorative. The environment charges the closure: the fossil’s glow syncs with cave veins, revealing hidden passages that lead to the inner chamber where truth concentrates. This reciprocity between setting and action meets the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.0)
    The amber warehouse functions as micro-setting: its drawers supply resources (buttons), its silence frames cognition, and the cliffs outside serve as silent witnesses that charge the final image. Tools (canyon echo jar, petrified bench) and recurring objects (amber button with fossil) constrain and enable choices. Sensory detail is selective—dust motes, bone coolness, liquid gold sands—and filtered through the turner’s ritualistic attention, avoiding white-room syndrome or generic description.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zephyr Bluff functions as micro-setting that constrains tactics: mist enables stealth, snow preserves codes, ridge enables broadcast.

Environment directly charges the final image—mist clearing as spring accelerates honors his sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    The fog-bound river crossing functions as a potent micro-setting that mutes sound, slows time, and mirrors internal stillness. The yarn needle (tool-as-setting) charges the final image, and the rain gutters provide temporal pressure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—frogs, wind, mud—but avoids tourist cataloging. However, the environment doesn’t *constrain* choice beyond mood; he could wait anywhere, weakening the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.0)
    The oasis isn’t backdrop—it pressures choice. Dry channels and crumbling hives signal decay Kael must interpret; the lantern glass emerges from dust as a tool that enables vision. Final image charges closure: the gentleness he witnessed reshapes his craft. Sensory detail is selective (smoke, grain, thrum), filtered through a potter’s tactile attention, avoiding tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    The harbor isn’t backdrop but micro-setting: its silver surface enables the mirror’s function, its cliffs create the darkness she combats, and the fire escape garden frames her vulnerability. Sensory detail is selective—sea-damp rope, iron steps’ echo, skeletal rosebush—and filtered through Elara’s purpose. The lockmaster’s tool and rowboat are tactile extensions of place. Only minor deduction: the “luminous harbor” risks generic lyricism, but specificity (cobblestones, northern cliffs) grounds it. The setting directly constrains her method and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.3)
    The tidal library isn’t backdrop but active constraint: its celestial tides dictate book movement, spatial choreography, and emotional rhythm. The brass sundial functions as micro-setting—its atomically reflective surface enables projection of memories, directly shaping Elara’s choices. Cloud-suspended architecture mirrors her liminal state, and the stone circle’s hum physically vibrates through her bones, grounding abstraction in sensation. Every detail serves pressure or closure; no tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lotus temple and post-storm pond are not backdrop but active micro-setting: raindrops on petals mirror withheld tears, damp earth yields underfoot as Elara softens, and the spiral’s location near the temple sanctifies the act. The thrush’s nest twig constrains her method (public art must echo its form), and the prismatic mist charges the final image. Every atmospheric detail filters through Elara’s perception, avoiding tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    The university radio station functions as a potent micro-setting: its outdated equipment enables the subsonic gambit, and spatial choreography (hunched over consoles, door swinging open) remains coherent. The astronomical charts and humming consoles are tactile, recurring objects that constrain choice—Aris cross-references them before acting. Sensory detail is selective (static hiss, bone-deep thrumming) and filtered through Aris’s professional urgency. The final image charges the setting: it becomes a “shield,” fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “shadowed nexus under starlight” functions effectively as micro-setting, with shifting walls and narrowing passages directly pressuring Elara’s claustrophobia. The blueprint compass and organ are tactile anchors that constrain choices—she maps sound waves, correlates frequencies. Starlight piercing at the node charges the final image. Yet some descriptions verge on ornamental (“spatial mutiny intensified… structures warping violently”) without altering tactics, slightly diluting environmental causality.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.3)
    The quarry isn’t backdrop—it’s active crucible. Mist “clinging like a shroud” and “furrowed hush” aren’t decorative; they constrain perception, mirroring Elara’s face-blindness while enabling her tactile focus. The ribbon’s frayed edge and quartz snag point directly shape her deduction. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: the “snagged ribbon” against brutalist rock becomes the story’s emblem. Environment, object, and body (her boots on wet stone) function as integrated micro-setting that alters tactics and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    The experimental weather station functions as micro-setting: its data banks enable research, its probes facilitate the dive, and its alarms mirror Elara’s dread. The shifted jet stream isn’t just backdrop—it generates the anomalous storms that heighten tension and frame the final exoneration. The copper nail, as object-as-setting, charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (spongey dread, glint of metal) and filtered through Elara’s urgency, avoiding white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mountain scenic pullout functions as micro-setting: wind, aspen tremors, torn safety fence fabric—all actively shape Elias’s interpretation and choices. The scaffold wrap flutters aren’t backdrop but catalysts; their patterns become “a living diagram” that guides his realization. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., “minute tremors in the aspen leaves”), avoiding tourist cataloging. However, the setting doesn’t impose physical constraints or irreversible stakes—it enables insight but doesn’t force sacrifice, slightly limiting its charge on the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    The abandoned circus train functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: its decayed state limits movement, its history pressures interpretation, and its territorial markers become narrative tools. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—dust, animal smells, broken light—not decorative. The recurring object (foreign bills) charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Only minor deduction for slight over-reliance on visual tone (“dusky harmony”) without deeper tactile evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    The celestial mapping observatory functions as micro-setting: telescope adjustments, parchment transcription, and starlight directly enable decoding and healing. The daylily-pressed telegram constrains emotional stakes and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (petals fused to paper, humming instruments), though tactile specificity occasionally yields to lyrical abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.3)
    The cursed lake, swirling orchard vortex, and flesh-eating seeds aren’t backdrop—they actively constrain and enable action. The vortex pulls at Elara’s cloak; brittle seeds litter her path; the roots cradle the confession. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: post-revelation tranquility replaces warlike serenity, proving environmental stakes were real. Sensory detail (ozone, rotting fruit, marble-veined seed) is selective, POV-filtered, and never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.3)
    The cobalt glade isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choices: roots bind Elara, ozone scent signals temporal fracture, moss tracks shadow movement. The maze topiary functions as micro-setting, its thorns drawing blood that enables “linking through scars.” Crucially, the setting charges the final image: the glade’s sigh and softened glow confirm balance restored. Every sensory detail serves the Accumulative lens, with tactile specificity (wet earth, gnarled roots) avoiding generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.3)
    The catacomb orchard isn’t backdrop but crucible: roots embracing bones constrain Elara’s movement and dictate ritual placement; the half-lit glow narrows perception to amber-gray textures that mirror her moral ambiguity. Every sensory detail serves pressure—soil “woven with ancient remains,” the card’s blistered surface—and culminates in fresh roots curling around the offering, charging the final image. The setting functions as micro-setting and active agent, shaping tactics and closure with irreplaceable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    The quarry trailer functions effectively as micro-setting—its dust, silence, and isolation mirror Leo’s emotional state and pressure his retreat into facts. The speaker grille cloth serves as object-as-setting, anchoring memory and later symbolizing renewal. However, the environment doesn’t actively constrain choices beyond mood; it remains atmospheric rather than instrumental. Vivid sensory detail (dust, frayed weave) grounds the space without over-description.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.3)
    The magnetic arbor isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and catalyst: levitating stones respond to the seed, fields adjust, and the lattice must be reestablished. Metallic vines, pulsing seed, and cloud-swirls are filtered through Elian’s cuneiform-trained perception (“symbols for ‘journey’ resembled magnetic fields”). The setting charges the final image: clouds swirl in new patterns because understanding has altered reality. Every detail serves the physics-of-transition theme without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tidal atrium isn’t backdrop but active micro-setting: seawater rhythms polish stone, tides recede and return, moonlight triggers volatility—all directly shaping tactics (timing smelts to moon phases). The bamboo creel, a tool-as-setting, constrains choice (only it calms volatile identities) and charges the final image (swaying empty, ready). Sensory detail is selective (glistening floor, resonant gear clicks) and filtered through Elian’s professional calm. Crucially, the environment’s tidal logic mirrors the story’s thematic core, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    The crystal caves function as micro-setting that actively constrains and charges the climax—the stalagmite throne enables the crowning, and crystals amplify the pearl’s radiance. Sensory detail is selective (chiming droplets, iridescence) and filtered through Kaelen’s professional yet awed POV. The seashell’s oceanic incongruity deepens thematic contrast. However, the caves don’t pressure early choices—only enable the final act—missing full 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.0)
    The disused railway station isn’t backdrop but active micro-setting: ivy-clad decay mirrors Elara’s internal state, and the bathroom’s graffiti functions as an oracle precisely because of its squalid anonymity. Crucially, the accordion (a tool-as-setting) constrains her final action—its patched bellows dictate the wheezing sound that becomes her confession. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (grimy tiles, sunset bleeding through arches), filtered through her river-chronicler POV. The station charges the final image: it’s both tomb and sanctuary, framing her transformation without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mist, glowing library, and veiled perception form a cohesive micro-setting that actively constrains choice: propagation delays dictate navigation, luminescence demands focus via the veil, and the watch’s rhythms sync with environmental energy. Sensory detail is selective (tactile veil, auditory echoes, visual shimmer) and filtered through Elara’s urgency. The library’s arches “radiating with unspoken stories” charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Minor deduction: spatial choreography remains slightly abstract, but the setting functions as both obstacle and reward.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.3)
    The Velvet Observatory isn’t backdrop—it actively swallows sound and starlight, shaping Elara’s isolation and the plants’ thirst. The midsummer heat presses physically (“air thick and heavy”), the ice violin weeps in response, and velvet transforms from stifling to cradling post-choice. Crucially, the setting constrains the climax: humidity melts the violin, making propagation irreversible. Every detail serves pressure or closure; even coffee stains become a micro-setting that maps fate.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    The skyborne grotto and aurora are not mere backdrop—they actively shape the ritual’s possibility and tone. Static electricity, floating cloud, and celestial light constrain and enable Elara’s method. The emerald chip and obsidian slab function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and integrated into action, avoiding white-room syndrome or generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    The umbral grotto, clouds, and vineyard hush create a vivid, selective atmosphere filtered through Elara’s reverence. The antique hairpin functions as micro-setting, constraining choice when used to scallop stone and charging the final image.

The environment directly shapes the ritual action and epiphany, fulfilling the 9+ gate despite minor overreliance on visual texture.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.3)
    The lighthouse isn’t backdrop but crucible: its breeze animates chimes that “speak,” its gallery hosts the bench where doubt is seeded, and its silent beacon mirrors Aris’s unneeded guidance at dawn. The hollow mirror shard functions as micro-setting—constraining choice when Elara must “look through it,” then recharging closure as she sees “a spectrum of choices.” Weather actively shapes action (wind whipping cloaks, carrying resolve away), and spatial choreography remains precise (bench, sea-facing stance, pocketed shard).

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is vividly specific: magnetic grotto, sycamore hush, floating rock—all filter through Kael’s perception under pressure. The grotto’s unseen force tugs thoughts, directly enabling the lesson’s mechanics. However, while atmospheric, the setting doesn’t *constrain* a choice—it facilitates but doesn’t force. Still, starlight and mist charge the final image, satisfying 9+ proximity without quite hitting constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    The towers of bone, canyon of echoes, and layered dust aren’t backdrop—they actively constrain and enable: bone amplifies sound, dust holds memory, arrowhead channels resonance. Sensory detail is purposeful (e.g., “skimmed the arrowhead against a bone surface” produces plot-critical echo). The setting charges the climax: bone towers respond to Elara’s hum, making environment causal. Final image (“dust settled gently”) ties closure to place with tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    The icebound spire functions as a micro-setting that constrains and charges the final image: its “brilliant dimness” evolves into a living sanctuary, directly shaped by the keystone’s magic. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—weak sun through ice, frost-kissed petals—and avoids tourist cataloging. The environment actively guides choice (mists carry Elian, luminance illuminates paths) and reconfigures at closure, fulfilling the 9+ gate. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent despite ethereal movement.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is masterfully integrated: the pier, lantern-lit water, and sunken library function as micro-settings that constrain and charge choices. The rowboat, waterproof lamp, and fissure in the hull are tactile and necessary; the library’s air-filled chamber defies expectation yet feels earned through atmospheric buildup (“scent of salt and decay,” “aura of preservation”). Crucially, the environment shapes the climax—the lantern reflections guide Elias, and water transmits sky-light onto library walls, merging above and below. This interplay charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.1)
    The ambered observatory deck functions as a potent micro-setting: its golden haze, obsidian table, and ancient speakers directly constrain Elara’s actions and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—the clink of coins, crackle of static, long shadows—filtered through her ritualistic focus. The setting evolves conceptually (from relic to beacon) without physical change, mirroring her internal shift. Crucially, the environment shapes tactics (distillation requires stillness) and culminates in a charged poise where place becomes purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ancient observatory isn’t backdrop—it supplies the prisms, lenses, and spatial geometry enabling crystallization. Dusk’s bruised purple sky and crumbling arches mirror internal decay and transition, while the atlas page functions as micro-setting: its sea monsters evolve from fear-symbols to guardians through interaction with fractured light. Every sensory detail (dust motes as stars, hum of voices in shards) serves the climax. The environment directly constrains and enables the reaper’s method, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.3)
    The sapphire viaduct functions as micro-setting: its crystalline surface conducts starlight logic, enables bell fusion, and hums in resonance—constraining and empowering Elian’s ritual. Dawn’s light progression directly alters tactics (dripping rates quicken). Sensory detail is selective (cool stone, bronze warmth) and filtered through Elian’s magical perception. The viaduct charges the final image—its glow “approving” the restored balance.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Midnight Ridgeway and the receding reservoir are vividly rendered with tactile, sensory specificity—the “mirrored hush,” “water-stained photograph,” “mud-emergent town hall.” Setting pressures choice: the exposed lakebed invites descent; twilight’s intimacy enables storytelling. Yet the environment doesn’t *constrain* a pivotal decision—the trail could exist anywhere. The sapphire label charges closure, but the setting itself remains atmospheric rather than instrumental.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    The hidden orchard and kaleidoscopic waterfall are more than backdrop—they constrain choice (mossy ground slows movement, prismatic light charges the crystal) and directly shape the climax (dew-thaw nourishes soil, intensifying blooms). Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and evolves with emotion. Only narrowly misses 9+ because the setting doesn’t impose a tangible tactical constraint beyond atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    The nocturnal arbor is vividly rendered with bioluminescent vines and star-dusted canopy, filtering perception through Elara’s professional and emotional priorities. The setting functions as micro-setting: altitude isolates her, winds threaten cables, and the buckle’s repurposing shows tactile adaptation. However, while the arbor charges the final image (“watchtower of hope”), it doesn’t actively constrain a pivotal choice—Elara could perform her analysis anywhere. Strong specificity, but not indispensable to causality.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating rock dojo functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—it’s a ritual space enabling the merge—and the rewriting-history backdrop charges every beat. Sensory detail is selective (“stone surface hovering,” “biotic light”) and filtered through Kael’s dissociation. The setting evolves: unstable air calms post-merge, proving environmental causality. However, spatial choreography of the three factions on adjacent stones lacks tactile grounding, slightly softening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    The nocturnal haven beside the brook is vividly rendered and functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image—the brook’s flow mirrors narrative rhythm and thematic current. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias (“storm-born silence,” “mossy stone”). The environment doesn’t constrain choices physically, but it emotionally scaffolds her epiphany, satisfying the 9+ gate threshold through tonal and imagistic integration.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    The echo chamber tunnel functions as a micro-setting that actively shapes tactics—the acoustics amplify breath into chorus, enabling the symphony’s catharsis. The pull cord handle constrains choice (only through its activation can sound begin) and charges the final image as it cools post-ritual. Sensory detail is purposeful (stone vibrations, off-key wind), filtered through the Conductor’s ritualistic focus. Every environmental element serves the central conflict, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    The frozen garden functions as micro-setting: ice glyphs, mist, and blurred light boundaries directly shape perception and choice. Sensory detail is selective (cold pendant, hum in air) and filtered through the guardian’s homesick POV. The environment charges the final image—mist parts to reveal a reflection that collapses all dualities. However, weather and spatial choreography remain static; the garden doesn’t evolve causally, slightly limiting its constraining power.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ember nexus isn’t backdrop—it actively supplies energy for vivification, its embers brightening precisely as the ritual peaks. The crozier, as micro-setting, constrains every choice: its broken state demands destruction, and its reformation charges the final image.

The setting evolves causally—from smolder to blaze—and directly enables the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is masterfully integrated: the rusted grating, silent antennas, and gorge aren’t backdrop but active constraints shaping Elara’s quest. The Hollywood star fragment and shard of hush function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective—“serenely electric” air, creaking metal—and filtered through Elara’s professional attention. The radio tower city’s skeletal form directly enables the thematic pivot from failure to adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    The spectral grotto functions as both setting and micro-setting: its shimmering walls supply the patterns Eli deciphers, and starlight interacting with the hourglass directly enables the climax. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—Eli notices salt-cracked radio casing, sideways-flowing time—not tourist cataloguing. The environment constrains choice (only here can timelines merge) and charges the final image (grotto fading as ferry returns). One missed opportunity: the “pools of dark water” are evocative but inert; had they reflected or distorted patterns, integration would be flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    The optical illusion gallery functions as both setting and micro-setting, constraining Elara’s perception and choices—the walls melting, ceilings opening—directly mirror her mental state and force adaptation. The sinew thread and loom are tactile, lived-in tools that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (glowing thread, pulsating light, silence “like a prelude to chaos”) and filtered through Elara’s fever-dream logic. Minor deduction: the forest of altered memories at climax risks veering into generic symbolism, though it’s grounded by the specificity of grass-turned-sinew.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.3)
    The benthic city isn’t backdrop—it’s a pressure system: domes of living coral, abyssal darkness, and simulated stars constrain Elara’s quest. The chain link functions as micro-setting, anchoring memory and motive. Sensory detail is selective (translucent corridors, cold metal) and filtered through Elara’s professional gaze. Crucially, the environment charges the final image: the ocean transforms from confinement to launchpad, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting: its hush swallows sound, justifying the hearing aid’s role, while twilight’s chill mirrors emotional isolation. The marble bench anchors spatial choreography and historical weight. Crucially, the environment charges the final image—the mist parts only after Elara assures remembrance, tying atmosphere to thematic payoff. Sensory hierarchy favors auditory and thermal cues, filtered through Elara’s profession and device, avoiding tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    The undersea facility constrains every move—narrow tunnels, shifting walls, sparking cables—and the codex’s gold fleck directly guides navigation. Sensory detail is selective (hum of cables, mist barriers) and filtered through Elara’s panicked perception. The setting charges the final image: ghostly researchers materialize only when the codex is placed, tying environment to closure. However, the cables themselves remain atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.0)
    The opal observatory isn’t backdrop—it constrains choice (isolation enables reckoning) and charges the final image (dome brightens with clarity). Snow, ink, shard, and ice are tactile micro-settings that evolve with emotion. Sensory detail is selective: hiss of receiver, cold shard, shimmering ink—all filtered through Elara’s trauma. The environment actively shapes the method (ink patterns only work in this stillness).

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    The bone towers, blood-sky, and tunnel of echoes aren’t backdrop but active constraints: the canyon’s acoustics dictate access (via birds), the diamond’s flaw warps sound, and Elara’s glowing veins respond to resonance. Every sensory detail serves the core concept—sound as texture—and culminates in the final image where environment and body fuse in luminous effort. The setting charges the closure: without this specific acoustic hellscape, the thematic pivot (harmony over control) would lack physical grounding. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent even in abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.1)
    The underground garden functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: floating herbs and anchored stones directly shape the arrowhead’s levitation and the metamorphosis. Sensory detail is selective—earthy scent, static hiss, glowing leaves—and filtered through Aris’s cryptid-researcher POV. The flint arrowhead and cordless phone are tactile anchors that evolve in function. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: plants swaying “in a rhythm that felt like laughter” ties environment to theme.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    The enchanted orchard is vividly rendered—not as backdrop but as active crucible. Crystalline bridges, tarnished fruit, and stone patrols create a tactile, oppressive atmosphere that directly pressures Elara’s choices. The locust shell functions as micro-setting, constraining her courage and charging the final image when it crumbles. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though the world’s rules (e.g., how heart rhythms affect stone) are implied rather than demonstrated through prior action, slightly weakening integration.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt arcade and twilight setting create vivid, mood-saturated specificity, and the “thunderstorm in a bottle” functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. However, the environment doesn’t constrain choices—Elian moves freely, unimpeded by spatial or tactical limits. The setting reflects theme but doesn’t shape action beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the abandoned circus train isn’t backdrop but crucible—its decayed velvet, skeletal oak, and dismantled carousel directly constrain and enable Elias’s choices. The “misty hush” and wind bells aren’t atmospheric filler; they modulate time perception and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (gravel crunch, brass gleam, rotting velvet) and filtered through Elias’s carpenter POV. The environment actively participates in closure: the train transforms from tomb to cradle because of how he interacts with its specific textures.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.3)
    The scientific poetry library functions as a micro-setting that actively enables the plot: curved walls facilitate hyperbolic geometry, and the air’s hum primes the supernatural turn. The tattered silk scarf—treated as both tool and environment—constrains choice (only it holds analog memories) and charges the final image (its dissolution merges memory with myth). Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and never stalls momentum. Every atmospheric element serves the central conceit.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Whispering Archipelago isn’t backdrop—it murmurs secrets that pressure Elara’s focus, and the moss-covered jetty grounds spatial choreography. The brass-bound camera and watercolor palette function as micro-settings that constrain choice (e.g., palette’s spent luminescence). Final image charges closure: luminous absence becomes gentle radiance through environmental transformation. Sensory detail (gold/violet streaks, liquid dawn hues) is selective, urgent, and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “shadowed nexus under starlight” functions as a potent micro-setting that actively pressures choice: starlight reveals decipherable patterns, shadows shift responsively, and the archway pulses with dread. The lock of hair acts as a tactile extension of setting, its texture igniting courage and physically unlocking the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—humming strands, crystalline hints, warped vertigo—filtered through Elian’s locksmith sensibility. The environment constrains tactics (he must wait for the first star) and charges the final image (cleansed air, blazing starlight), satisfying the 9+ gate despite minor abstraction in cosmic scale.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.3)
    The sunken greenhouse and shipwrecks aren’t backdrop—they constrain Elara’s movement (knee-deep water), supply tools (glass shards, mushrooms), and embody thematic decay. Sensory specificity (“sweet rot of apples,” “cool, rubbery” mushrooms) filters through folklorist POV. The setting charges the climax: realigning mushrooms literally reshapes the environment. Final image—glowing fungi in twilight—resonates because the land’s physical state shifts with memory recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    The forgotten library operates as micro-setting: dust, cluttered tea cups, and glass shards constrain choice (annotation requires proximity to light/shadow). The afternoon shadow in glass charges the final image, its deepening mirroring Elian’s transformation. Sensory detail is selective—creaking swing, cool glass, dregs of tea—and filtered through the archivist’s anxious perception. Crucially, the setting enables the method (tea leaf geometry) and closure (shadow annotation), fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    The verdant parapet and waterfall are vividly rendered and function as micro-setting: mist bridges realms, spray nourishes the seed.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.1)
    The glass orchard library is not backdrop but active micro-setting: its transparent branches tremble when reality gaps widen, and its floating nature mirrors thematic weightlessness. The bottled moonlight and cloud-wood counter constrain action—moonlight incises air, etches floor—and charge the final image (empty vial reflecting eternal glow). Sensory detail is vivid yet selective, filtered through Elara’s poetic perception. The setting directly enables the inciting act and embodies the theme of nascent creation.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.1)
    The desert fortress post-rain and coral icebound pavilion are richly specific, with weather and texture shaping atmosphere. However, setting rarely constrains action—the tidal pools inform analysis but don’t alter tactics, and the pavilion functions as mood-piece rather than crucible. The final image gains resonance from environmental detail, but the 9+ gate fails: no object or terrain forces a choice with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    The astronomical clock tower functions as micro-setting: its gears, starlight, and spatial choreography directly constrain choices (e.g., climbing stairs, aligning weight with stars).

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is richly specific—glass dome, transmutative soil, phosphorescent flora—and actively shapes tactics: it shelters latent potential Elara must activate. The mica window constrains choice by filtering memory into light, and its northern placement grounds spatial choreography. However, the setting doesn’t evolve causally after the dawn threads appear; plants “burst” but this doesn’t alter Elara’s actions. Vivid but static post-climax, missing the 9+ gate where environment must charge the final image through change.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.9)
    The Athenaeum’s atmosphere (“enlarged tranquility”) mirrors Elara’s internal state and subtly guides her toward calm, but the setting rarely constrains choice—it’s a backdrop, not a crucible. Sensory detail is selective (frayed invitation, smudged ink, silent figures) and filtered through POV, yet no environmental feature alters tactics or charges the final image beyond mood. The hidden door functions as a plot device, not a pressure point. Strong specificity in the bookstore facade and midnight shadows, but not indispensable to the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    The courtyard functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: ivy hides the tea house, soil obscures the fountain compartment, and wild roses frame ritual. Every tactile detail (mossy stones, scarred table, brittle pages) serves thematic pressure. The setting doesn’t just reflect Elara’s psyche—it demands specific acts of attention that shape her arc. Final image recharges the opening absence with purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    The frozen library above the clouds functions as both macro- and micro-setting: ice-crusted books, frosted marble, and cooling crackles constrain Elian’s movements and charge every action.

Crucially, the environment charges the final image: prismatic light dances “like visible music,” directly tying spatial specificity to thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dome, desert roses, and fear-core function as micro-settings that constrain choice—the dome’s weakened integrity dictates escape method, roses witness with “organic awareness,” and the box’s skin-like surface informs Kael’s reverence. Final image of carved hole charges closure. Sensory detail (humming warmth, cool yielding box) is selective and POV-filtered. Misses 9+ only by lacking a single constraint that actively alters tactics beyond enabling the burn.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    The “vibrant courtyard at dawn” functions as a micro-setting that frames Elara’s solitude and later communal reconnection. Sensory details—lavender scent, cobblestones, sandstorm calm—are selective and mood-enhancing, though “sandstorm calm” borders on mixed metaphor. The mailbox and locket serve as environmental constraints that shape choices, fulfilling the 9+ gate condition. However, the setting doesn’t actively pressure decisions beyond atmosphere; it reflects rather than directs action.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sunken laboratory is vividly rendered with algae-streaked walls and green-filtered light, grounding the scene early. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered through Elara’s lyrical perception. However, while atmospheric, the setting never actively constrains her choices—it’s a backdrop, not a crucible. The recurring dice and stasis chamber charge the ending, but the environment itself doesn’t alter tactics or impose physical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.3)
    The salt crystal chamber functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: gravity pockets pin or float Elara, altering how she digs; halite walls refract lantern light into dancing shadows that mirror her fractured memory.

Final image charges the seal with legacy and loss, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Sensory detail is selective (warm wax, cool touch, starlight) and filtered through the narrator’s yearning, avoiding tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    The velvet garden is vividly rendered with multi-sensory specificity—moss, scent, twilight—and evolves from prison to sanctuary, charging the final image. The seashell and stone circle function as micro-settings that constrain and enable Elara’s ritual. The dawn transition mirrors her internal shift, fulfilling the 9+ gate by constraining the timeframe and reweighting the garden’s meaning. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, and stalactites form a micro-setting that charges the final image—the thorn merging with stone under shifting light—but does not actively constrain choices. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara’s emotional state (e.g., “pearlescent light,” “ragged edges of her heart”). However, the environment remains atmospheric rather than tactical; it reflects but doesn’t shape her decisions. For 9+ eligibility, setting must alter action, which it doesn’t here.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    The serpentine nexus functions as a micro-setting that actively shapes stakes—it’s the corrupted amplifier for false echoes. Starlight and canyon acoustics aren’t backdrop but causal: they enable perception and resonance. The seashell half charges the final image when it falls silent, its purpose fulfilled. Sensory detail is selective (hum, whisper, reed-blown voice) and filtered through Kaelen’s perception, avoiding white-room syndrome or generic description.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glacial shrine functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: ice “held eons of silence,” candles echo “borrowed starlight,” and the altar placement reweights the snow globe’s meaning. Sensory detail is selective (visual shimmer, implied cold) and filtered through Kaelen’s ghost-whisperer POV.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.0)
    The wasteland orchard isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting that constrains and charges the climax. Its paradoxical vitality (“unblemished fruit amid poison”) directly motivates Kaelen’s search and embodies the stillpoint concept. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (“radioactive dust that glowed faintly,” “cool object” of the diamond). The setting evolves causally: dust storm stills when diamond is held, then creeps back as choice looms. The orchard itself becomes the sanctuary, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stormlit observatory and cobalt portico are vividly rendered and function as micro-settings that charge the closure—the final image echoes the opening, reweighting the glass as symbol. Sensory detail (rain rivulets, static hiss, cerulean ghosts) is selective and POV-filtered, evoking isolation and revelation. Yet the setting rarely constrains choice: Elara descends freely, and the observatory’s altitude exerts no tactical pressure. The cobalt hue aestheticizes but doesn’t impede or enable pivotal actions.

    The lunar observatory functions as a charged micro-setting: its trembling foundations directly pressure Elara’s actions, while crystalline panels and airless void constrain her reliance on an Earth-recorded leaf-fall. The astral camera and spinning clock hand act as tool-as-setting, constraining choice (she must restructure the mechanism mid-tremor). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—“groans” of the dome contrast the “whisper-soft rustle” of the recording—and the final image of “cosmic fire… forever held in silver emulsion” charges closure by merging environment, tool, and theme. Every atmospheric element serves the central conflict without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Radiant Haven functions as micro-setting: its altitude (“above the clouds”) and jasmine-scented terrace shape mood and symbolize transcendence. The vinyl shard and window-framed sky constrain choices—Elara uses them as therapeutic tools. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (Elara notices rhythm, scent, light). However, the setting doesn’t actively pressure decisions beyond atmosphere; it enhances but doesn’t drive the closure, capping just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating observatory is vividly rendered with purposeful detail—the humming foundations, star-sea backdrop, cold etched runes—all filtered through Elara’s scholarly attention. The setting actively enables the plot: the orrery aligns with real stars, the mosaic floor hosts the ritual, and the dome frames the noon phenomenon.

Still, it deeply informs tone and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tidal obsidian ridge isn’t backdrop—it groans under wave assault, mirrors Elias’s internal state (“darkness no longer a shroud”), and supplies the rake handle that enables resolution. The pendulum bob functions as micro-setting: its hitch initiates crisis, its adjustment enacts redemption, and its “gleaming orb” final image charges closure. Sensory detail is selective (brass gears, calloused finger, moonlit waves) and filtered through Elias’s profession. Every object constrains or catalyzes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt silo functions as a charged micro-setting: its rough-hewn shelves, starlit isolation, and velveteen gloom directly enable Elara’s discovery and frame the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—she notices worn leather, frayed borders, pulsing threads—not tourist cataloging. The sovereign case and tapestry constrain choice (only by decoding can truth emerge), and the cemetery’s stones become active participants post-revelation. However, the setting doesn’t actively *resist* her; it yields too readily, missing a chance for environmental tension.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lightning collection tower functions as a true micro-setting: its rods, summit, and residual energy directly constrain tactics (water must be sprayed on rods; ascent is required). The recurring lacquer box and matchbox act as object-as-setting, charging the final image when closed post-resolution. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“nectar-dusk hues,” “hummed with residual energy,” “scent of rain and honey”). However, the tower’s mechanics remain slightly abstract, preventing full 9+ integration.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    The quiet bay in spring isn’t just backdrop—it supplies salt air, cherry blossoms, and cobblestones that shape Elara’s perception and ritual. The orris root shard functions as micro-setting, constraining her method and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective (scent of violets and salt, golden haze) and filtered through her noticing POV.

The lingering luminance evolves from sickly pulse to blinding white, directly shaping tactics and charging the climax. Sensory detail is selective (rust, cold metal, shifting hues) and filtered through Elara’s trauma. Final image reweights setting: it becomes “merely dark and empty,” stripped of power.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.3)
    The floating orchard isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and resource: driftwood trunks become percussion, sea-glass forms the resonator, roots tangle into buoyancy. The blue hour’s indigo melt visually mirrors the thematic void-to-harmony arc. Every object serves dual purpose: mallet strikes slate then metal; shells hang as ready instruments. Final image charges the setting: the orchard glows as a sonic beacon, its survival earned through environmental integration.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    The turtle-shell city isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and resource: Kaelen reads its whorls as text, maps its movements, and triggers revelation through its fracture.

However, the setting doesn’t actively *alter* tactics beyond providing the chamber; it’s atmospheric rather than instrumental.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ancient observatory is far more than backdrop—it supplies the lever, dome mechanics, etched symbols, and latent energy that directly enable the climax. “Brilliant dimness” evolves from atmospheric description to charged tonal motif that reconfigures meaning at closure (“comfort rather than a mystery”). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (cold brass, humming chip, pulsing stars), filtered through Kael’s technical yet wonder-struck POV. The setting constrains and catalyzes choice, fulfilling the 9+ gate—but stops just short due to minor over-reliance on visual lyricism without tactile or auditory grounding in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt terrace and forgotten shore aren’t backdrops—they’re active micro-settings that pressure choice: the terrace’s “prison” quality motivates descent; the shore’s “sieved hush” enables truth’s emergence. Sensory detail (cool metal, damp sand, whispering wind) is selective, POV-filtered, and evolves with emotional stakes. The recurring watch hand and driftwood function as object-as-setting, culminating in the carved bird that delivers the climax. Only minor deduction: “cobalt” risks slight over-aestheticizing without functional constraint.

    The parapet functions as micro-setting—wind, mist, and stone pressure choices (e.g., meeting “in the center,” the fragility of neutral ground). The drawer pull substitutes effectively as a tactile anchor that constrains and charges the final image. However, environmental details remain atmospheric rather than actively shaping tactics; the setting enhances mood but doesn’t foreclose options or enable specific moves beyond symbolic staging.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    The coastal setting is economically rendered but purposeful: utility poles, overcast sky, and rocky shore directly constrain Kael’s choices and charge the ending. The astronomical compass and kayak function as micro-settings that shape tactics—especially when the compass fails and poles become lifelines. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (salt air stinging eyes, cold seeping through clothes), avoiding tourist description. The lighthouse’s symbolic weight is grounded in spatial reality, making the final arrival tactile, not abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    The underground bioluminescent lake functions as both setting and micro-setting: its reflective paths constrain Leo’s choices, and the glow responds to his decisions, directly shaping tactics. The baseball and newspaper are tactile anchors that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—damp air, ethereal light, time-worn leather—avoiding touristic excess while deepening atmosphere and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fairy-tale orchard under permanent moonlight is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting: its glowing fruit and liquid-silver clearings directly enable the spice altar and scented bridge. Sensory hierarchy favors smell and light, apt for a ritual centered on aroma and vision. However, the setting doesn’t actively constrain choice—it accommodates rather than pressures Elara’s actions. Still, the final image of the orchard thriving because of their bond charges the closure with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.3)
    The glade functions as micro-setting that charges every choice: silver grass, whispering ferns, and cloud-sea pressure Elara’s ritual. Objects double as environment—the saucer’s crack pulses, the tablecloth’s stitched palms guide action. Final image (rose-gold dawn over sealed saucer) reweights the setting’s meaning from site of loss to locus of acceptance. Every detail constrains or enables the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    The recycled spaceship functions as micro-setting: its groaning metal and ghostly hum mirror Elara’s labor and constrain her through artificial gravity that fights her buoyancy. Kwan Yin’s tear and tear-stained photographs are tactile anchors that evolve from passive relics to active tools. Sensory detail is selective (metal grating, milky quartz glow) and filtered through Elara’s grief-lens. The setting charges the final image—the ship’s purpose fulfilled as she floats away—but doesn’t actively foreclose options mid-scene, justifying sub-9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    The black sand beach, volcano, and celestial dance are vividly rendered and sensorially specific (“cool, black sand,” “smoldering peak”). Crucially, the setting constrains the climax: only here, during planetary alignment, can the prophecy activate. The recurring jars charge the final image when emptied. Minor deduction: the volcano’s “gentle awakening” risks abstraction but is grounded by tactile sand imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    The luminous fort, twilight, blackout, and sundial form a cohesive micro-setting that actively shapes tactics: darkness enables movement, the sundial encodes directions, the armory hides pamphlets. The bronze quill holder functions as micro-setting—its hidden stone and prying function constrain and enable action. Final image of the half-painted sundial winking back charges closure with conspiratorial intimacy. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tidal bluff functions as micro-setting: its edge constrains rock placement, its slickness reflects global frictionlessness, and the aurora supplies the energy source. The painted rocks and leadwood box are tactile tools that directly enable the climax. Sensory detail is selective—cold-numbed fingers, hovering dust, glowing stones—and filtered through Kaelen’s urgency. The aurora’s green-violet tapestry evolves causally with the ritual, charging the final image where eels swim in newly comprehended patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stormlit observatory is more than backdrop—it constrains choice (isolation enables uncensored writing) and charges the final image (lightning flashes revealing Elara’s reflection). Weather actively mirrors inner state without overt symbolism. The darkroom timer and telescope function as micro-settings that anchor action. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, though “above the clouds” risks vagueness without spatial choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glass atrium functions as micro-setting: its prismatic light amplifies chaos while containing the duel’s violence, and the brook outside mirrors Kaelen’s mental carving of paths. The half-painted sundial and needle card are tactile tools that constrain decoding choices. Every sensory detail—whirring gears, skidding boots, fading numerals—is filtered through Kaelen’s philosophical urgency. The setting charges the final image: transparency becomes metaphor for achieved clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rusted library isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains action (wind whistling through holes, debris underfoot) and supplies salvaged books as both material and metaphor. The coffee tin, moonlight, and stars function as micro-settings that charge key beats. Sensory detail is selective (silver glow, bitter coffee, waterlogged paper) and filtered through Elara’s poetic perception. Final image of the library as “beacon” reweights the ruin through accumulated labor.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.3)
    The tidal arbor isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choices: its failing protection forces Elian’s escape plan, while flora pulses rhythmically with his music, linking environment to action. The mist screen, brass pillars with erratic compasses, and grand piano are micro-settings that constrain tactics (e.g., projector must cast on mist). Final ballroom emerges from film, making setting a causal agent. Every detail serves escalation or closure, avoiding white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.9)
    The ancient ridge in bloom is vividly rendered with sensory detail (petals, scent, humming air, pulsing ground), and the setting supplies key resources—the convergence point, standing stones—that directly enable the seed’s planting. However, the environment doesn’t *constrain* choice; Elara moves freely, and weather acts as backdrop, not pressure. The ridge’s magic remains decorative rather than tactical, missing the 9+ gate despite strong atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    The islet, rain-cleansed air, and tactile lace function as micro-settings that actively shape ritual and perception. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—wet earth, salt, brass tarnish—and mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. The locket’s discovery among seaweed ties environment to memory. However, the setting never *constrains* choice (e.g., tides don’t block paths); it atmospherically enables, falling just short of 9+ gate.
