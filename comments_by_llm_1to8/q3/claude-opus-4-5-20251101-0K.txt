  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse constrains on-page choices: shattered door, collapsed shelving, and broken roof panels guide Mira's movements and discoveries. The surviving orchid in the final beat charges the closure image with defiant persistence. Sensory detail (sediment crunch, "smell of drowned things," iridescent wing scales in broken light) is vivid, selective, and filtered through Mira's scientific attention. Spatial choreography remains clear across kneeling, lifting slides, standing. The micro-setting (glass slides as portable archive) functions as purposeful constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    The canyon setting constrains choices through cold ("steadily adaptive to the cold, adjusting her cloak"), and the frost formations function as micro-setting that enables the cipher breakthrough. Dawn's arrival ("sun crested the canyon rim, light poured down like molten gold") charges the final transformation with environmental pressure. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elena's glass-artist priorities (light, temperature, crystalline patterns). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the descent and climb.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    The conservatory's crystalline walls, frozen specimens, and thermal sensors function as micro-setting that constrains and enables Margaret's method throughout. Sensory detail is filtered through her silence (visual and tactile priority, no auditory cues), and the environment charges the final image: "crystalline cathedral of frozen life" mirrors her own suspended state. The workbench, sensors, and tuning fork case are handled in multiple beats, and the conservatory's "silence lived here naturally, without violence" reweights at closure when Margaret finds peace in it. Spatial choreography remains clear across specimen stations.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    The underwater library is vivid and purposeful: coral-crusted spires, bioluminescent fish, books-as-reefs, and impossible geometry all constrain Ezra's navigation and charge the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through Ezra's professional lens (mortuary workbench, faces of the dead). The lens itself acts as a recurring object that transforms from broken to whole, shaping the closure. Minor: the "impossible spaces between the shelves where geometry bent like grief" borders on metaphorical decoration rather than tactical constraint, though it does color the atmosphere effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.1)
    The terra-cotta arbor is consistently evoked (opening, midpoint gathering, final alone-moment) and its clay pillars frame the photograph discovery, charging the closure. "Salt winds," "rationed candlelight," and "back paths and drainage culverts" build a vivid exile geography. The bell functions as micro-setting, handled twice (ringing, Yusuf examining it) and returned with reweighted meaning at the end. However, the valley houses and Haddad family home remain generic; no spatial detail constrains a choice during the midnight runs, reducing the setting's pressure role.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    Twilight viaduct with jasmine, fog, and iron railings is anchored early and filters through Mei-Lin's lens-focused perception. The camera obscura constrains her method (inverted display, breath visibility) and charges the final image when she captures "luminous residue." Sensory detail—amber glow, foggy lucidity, breath fog—supports the spiritual-curiosity POV without catalog excess. Spatial choreography is clear: viaduct path, jasmine cluster, apparatus positioning.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    The living bridge garden is vividly rendered through botanical architecture and hyperbolic surfaces, and it directly enables the climactic choice by amplifying the fragment's power through negative curvature. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"saddle-shaped surfaces," "branches curving in new directions"—and the setting evolves causally when the garden grows wilder after Elara's integration. The cathedral imagery and the seven-bridge knot charge the final transformation, making the environment indispensable to closure rather than decorative backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.1)
    The carnival prize center is vividly rendered—dust motes, button-eyed toys, yellowed piano keys—and the vault's "cool darkness" contrasts effectively. Spatial choreography is clean (piano, bench, ticket counter, descent). The setting enables the key-puzzle and provides the vault resource, shaping the core choice. The arrow placed on the counter is a nice spatial anchor for the scout's decision. However, the environment doesn't constrain Mira's movement or tactics with friction; she navigates freely, so it stops short of the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sunken greenhouse is vividly particular—moss, fractured glass, kelp-threaded iron, fused shipwrecks—and the forge heated by geothermal vents functions as both workspace and resonance chamber for the aurora. The environment constrains Marina's method (pressure suit, depth, the forge's heat) and charges the final image (shipwrecks singing in sympathy, aurora filtering down). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Marina's synesthetic perception (green hum, rust-red vowels). The micro-setting of the forge under aurora becomes indispensable to the closure effect, making this environment essential rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.1)
    The emerald/jade tiles shifting from amber to silver under moonlight create a vivid, pressure-supporting atmosphere. The jar's glow through leather and the flower-vendor signals ground the heist in tactile specificity. Spatial choreography (platform, bench, vendor stations) tracks clearly. The moonbeams' warmth against Mira's chest and the station clock chime charge the final departure, giving the setting a functional role in both constraint (timing) and closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    Setting (abandoned control room, mountain bunker, melting ice) applies consistent pressure: frost-covered console, dripping water, calving ice shelves mark seasonal transition and urgency. Spatial choreography is clean; Elena moves from console to floor drafting. The red light constrains her hope and enables the restoration plan. Sensory detail is purposeful (breath visible, ice weeping) and filtered through her craft lens. The bookmark and control panel anchor micro-setting choices. Environment charges the final image: water eroding ice parallels her thawing resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rusted library under stars supplies vivid grounding ("iron bones groaned," "corroded shelves," "moldered texts") and the seashell object recurs with reweighted meaning. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choices or altering tactics; the confrontation could occur in most isolated locations without structural loss. Spatial choreography is clear (Sandra steps from shadows, Marla pulls out the photograph), and sensory detail is selective, but the stars-as-witnesses motif reads ornamental rather than purposeful pressure on the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    The storm-tossed ridge fort and flaking gold booklet constrain action—she must wait in the tower, must work fast as the star dies. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: bloodied feet, metallic fragments in wind, "ambered hush" thickening time. The final descent through darkness with sureness of pebbles demonstrates micro-setting (body knowledge) charging the ending. Spatial choreography is clean. The fort's abandonment and the oracle's bare feet recur with purpose, anchoring her lived-in relationship to stone and shore.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frozen courtyard supplies concrete constraints: crystalline pillars, frozen fountain basin, falling snow that needs sweeping. The ice violin's physical impossibility (doesn't melt, exists outside temperature) is dramatized and affects Unit-7's understanding. The courtyard's abandonment and the three-hundred-year timeline create pressure through isolation. The setting charges the final image: snow falling, silence holding meaning, the broom moving across stones—micro-setting elements that anchor the robot's ritualized existence and constrain its options to this single, eternal task.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.9)
    The crystal forecourt is vivid and purposeful: the crystalline acoustics amplify sound, which Mira uses to eavesdrop, and the forecourt "sang softly" in the closure beat, charging the final image. Sensory detail (wet stones, raindrops on crystal walls, scratch of pen) is filtered through Mira's night-registrar attention. The body is less developed—Mira walks, sits, holds objects—but the projector lens as micro-setting object constrains her gaze and is relinquished at the climax. The post-rain atmosphere supports tone. One cap: the lens must constrain a choice to reach 9+; here it mediates perception and is traded, but the trade feels more symbolic than tactically forced, so the score stays in the 6-band.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    The hedge maze functions as more than backdrop: it shelters the marbles, houses the revelation scene, and its "blooming and withering in the same moment" physicality mirrors the theme. The toolshed, clay pot, and stone bench are spatially clear and return with purpose. Sensory detail is selective (wind "that smelled of endings and beginnings," clematis dying overhead) and filtered through Esther's forty-seven years of intimacy. The Commission's new world rules remain abstract and don't constrain on-page choices as tightly as they might, keeping this below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    The xenobiology station is vividly anchored: "docking arms stretched like the legs of a sleeping spider," "icy warmth" threading through corridors, cloudweavers roosting on the hull. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered ("grease from her hands," "breath visible in the cold deck air"). The station's systems—lever, observation deck, resonance scanner—shape Mira's access and timing, and the "mechanically warm vibration" recurs to charge the final return to quarters. The cloudweavers' synchronized launch subtly mirrors the sideways-time thesis without overt symbolism, and the setting constrains the twilight window that enables her experiment.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    The flooded pit, flickering lanterns, and water-stained walls create vivid atmosphere and constrain Clara's movements (wading, holding case overhead). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through a musician's POV. The antique program and hidden panel function as micro-setting that drives plot. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting actively shapes the climactic discovery and charges the final image of water damage becoming message.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mountain weather station provides concrete setting details (barometers, anemometers, frost patterns) and the narrow cot grounds the recovery physically. The smudged illustration functions as micro-setting that charges the final image and constrains her thinking about imperfection. Mira's presence and the auroras add atmospheric specificity. Minor gap: the station's instruments measure but do not directly constrain a tactical choice on the page; the setting enriches theme more than it alters options.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The valve room operates as micro-setting that constrains and charges the closure: the wheel with beads becomes both memorial and evidence, forcing Marcus's realization. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("dust-thick air," "pipes that snaked toward the ceiling like frozen serpents"), filtered through Marcus's professional explorer lens. The three AM timeframe and underground loading dock anchor spatial choreography cleanly. The amber bead's scratched surface provides tactile specificity that charges the final touch. Minor gap: the tunnel itself remains somewhat generic beyond "gravel" and "rusted track switches," but the valve room's particularity compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.9)
    The catacomb setting is richly specific—roots threading shelves, obsidian refuge by the underground river, moss-softened spines—and the environment subtly pressures Maren's witnessing practice. The origami swan and the refuge function as micro-setting that charges her method, and spatial choreography (burrowing deeper, sitting by the river) remains clear throughout. The final image of the catacombs breathing around her ties setting to theme. Strong work; gate for 9+ not met because the setting does not constrain a choice with visible cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sage Ridge is anchored with sensory specificity (sage perfume, ancient oaks, dreaming roots) that reflects Elena's worldview. The eclipse functions as a micro-setting constraint: totality's darkness forces the vulnerable exchange and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent (climb, summit, blanket) and details are filtered through Elena's therapeutic lens without catalog excess. The roots and corona motifs recur purposefully to frame the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    The silo is vividly particular—bronze quiet, curved concrete walls, spiral staircase, storage alcoves—and its history (grain, missiles, Archive) roots the setting in lived use. The tapestry fragment constrains the final choice by providing "the first physical proof," making Maren's eastward walk causally tied to this discovery. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered: "bronze quiet," "particular bronze of ancient gold thread," "permanent twilight." The micro-setting (alcove behind crates) delivers the pivotal object, charging the closure image with spatial memory.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse lamp room, rocky island, mainland ferry, and rotating beam provide spatial grounding and constrain her isolation, which pressures the journalist decision. The microdot specs function as micro-setting (object-as-setting): they're handled in two beats (worn while writing, placed in the box) and their physical presence charges the final choice. The beam's sweep returns as a rhythmic anchor ("swept past again") and the island's "silence and fog" filters through her operative mindset. Setting details are woven through action (spread tools, looked out, removed specs) rather than static catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dimensional anchor hum and flagstone details ground the space early. The ash-gray paint mixed from "collapsed dimensions" is vivid and purpose-driven, used to draw geometric patterns that anchor boundaries—a tool constraining choice. Sensory selection (bare feet on cold stone, muffled clarity, shadows beneath skin) remains filtered through urgency. The cathedral's acoustic void is specific enough to charge Marcus's words. However, the "pocket of reality" and "void pressing against every wall" risk abstraction without tactile consequence mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glass spire and frozen mirrored horizon anchor the setting vividly and constrain the action—Li Wei climbs "before exhaustion could claim her" to witness the specific pre-dawn illusion. The nautilus shell segment functions as a micro-setting object, handled twice (pressed to glass, vibrations felt) and charging the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Li Wei's POV: "sky that seemed to fold into itself," "vibrations traveled through the shell's ancient chambers." Spatial choreography is clean and the setting directly enables the closure beat, meeting the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glowing viaduct and rain-slicked stones create vivid micro-setting that recurs across beats. The phosphorescent algae and storm progression anchor spatial coherography clearly. The viaduct's glow intensifies in step with Mira's internal progression, and the final "river of light" image charges the closure moment. The tablet as tactile object (warm, humming, shifted runes) constrains Mira's attention and shapes her retracing action, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting/object must alter tactics or charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cavern is vivid and purposeful: drums lining walls, ancient oak frame, and the autumn-winter threshold create sensory grounding. The broken needle constrains the climactic beat (she clutches it while feeling vibrations), charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the micro-setting (her palms on stone, feet on leaf-scattered floor) reinforces the sensory teaching theme.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.1)
    The courtyard, message tube, and valley setting are vivid and purposeful. The moss-covered fountain, rusted quarantine barriers, and "lavender light of dusk" create atmosphere that mirrors Mira's suspended state before action. The brass tube is handled in multiple beats and its physical presence (warm in her palm, unscrewed with a soft click) grounds the revelation. The courtyard's "cupped hands" peace charges the final image as she leaves it. The setting constrains her observation points and escape routes, shaping her tactics when followed, meeting the micro-setting test for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.1)
    The terra-cotta grotto is vividly rendered with luminescence, warm clay, and starlight fissures. The rope is handled across multiple beats, and the energy beings provide atmospheric pressure. Spatial choreography remains clear when the woman enters. The grotto functions as more than postcard description—it frames the conversation and charges the contemplative tone—though it does not constrain a specific choice or alter the closure image directly.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sunken greenhouse with cracked glass, half-submerged at the harbor's edge, constrains Marina's choice: she seeks it as refuge, and its "chronic hush" absorbs her first notes, forcing her tactical shift to play "between" sounds rather than over them. The shipwrecks function as sentinels and listeners, their water-lapping rhythm "almost resembl[ing] music," priming her eventual integration of environmental sound. The apple trees with "unripe fruit" mirror the unfinished theme and charge the final image of listening and incompleteness. The copper bowl catches sunset light "like an ember" in the closure beat, making the object-as-micro-setting choice valid. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout (greenhouse floor, overturned crate, rising tide).

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    The amber grotto is purposefully detailed—"held the dying light like honey holds time," "fractured it into a thousand burning fragments"—and the setting charges the final image when Vera tucks the petal into the amber wall as gift. Static electricity as perceptual filter remains abstract (sensing "residual emotions," "accumulated feelings") without concrete constraint: does proximity matter, does voltage rise with emotion intensity? Dusk as timeframe subtly tightens the reflective mood. The grotto qualifies as micro-setting that shapes the closure ritual, clearing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rooftop library recurs with purpose: stars, spiral staircase, retractable glass, grandmother's ledgers. The setting constrains Marina's archive work and charges the final image ("breezy library under the open sky"). Harbor dock configurations in photographs tie past to present. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Marina's broker attention. The setting exceeds postcard description and participates in closure, meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.1)
    The crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, and crater mist create a vivid, specific environment with strong sensory detail ("glass-like trees catching light in ways that made the air itself seem wounded with beauty"). The arbor serves as a spatial anchor for councils and the climactic meeting with Senna. However, the environment remains largely decorative—it does not constrain Veren's choices or alter her tactics during the search. The orchard's "strange mineral seasons" and grafting mechanics are mentioned but never pressure the plot. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Canal system, obsidian towers, courtyard suspended above city, and Aldros as mountain range provide vivid spatial anchors. Upward-spiraling water and altered sound/light during the giant's nap constrain Miriam's window of opportunity and create sensory distinction. The crystallized-sound cage is a micro-setting object that directly enables the climactic choice. Sensory hierarchy reflects Miriam's illustrator's eye (light bending, acoustic chambers, melody's incompleteness pulling at her chest). The pendant warming against her sternum functions as body-setting that tracks her time-borrowing and charges the final cooling moment.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.9)
    The cavern orchard is vividly rendered—phosphorescent moss, mineral drip rhythm, fruit nourished by stalactites—and the mosaic stepping stone becomes the functional anchor for her conjuring work, constraining her method. The dripping water serves as both atmospheric detail and a recurring structural rhythm that charges the final beats. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling, tracing, climbing toward surface) and the setting's particulars (chipped tiles, bioluminescent glow) directly enable the plot's central action. The underground/surface contrast supports the thematic arc of burial and emergence without becoming heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    The library's architecture (crawl spaces, pipe chases, reference section, basement archive) constrains Maren's movements and enables her caching activity throughout. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Maren's POV: "sapphire hush," "shadows pooling between shelves like spilled ink," "corroded copper fitting." The micro-setting of hidden infrastructure functions as both literal environment and thematic container. The tape fragment and the boxes labeled VOICES anchor recurring objects that charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across vertical and horizontal movements through the building's skeleton, and the city beyond the windows supplies atmospheric contrast without overwhelming the intimate scale.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.1)
    The mossy trellis after rain is handled with economy and purpose: moss pulses with welcome, water drips in "meditative rhythms," and Vera's bare feet on moss enable root descent at closure. The linden leaf's impossible placement (fifty feet, no wind) creates productive mystery. Sensory detail is selective—rain on face, green threading visible under skin—and filtered through Vera's botanical attention. The trellis as former living wood "remembering when it too had been alive" charges the final image by mirroring her transformation and constraining her choice to stand there during the storm.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal causeway, skeletal streets, and museum case are vividly rendered and constrain Mira's movement (twice-daily exposure, warm stones, rain pooling). The brooch in its intact case becomes a micro-setting anchor that charges the final exchange. Sensory details are selective and support urgency (diagonal rain, seaweed veils, amber glow). The water-wars backdrop and the causeway's twice-daily emergence create a tangible pressure on timing and access that shapes the story's rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    The crystal cave is vivid and functional: its song shifts "without pattern," colors bleed "from amber to violet to deep ocean blue," and overlapping shadows serve as literal doorways for the unseen forces, constraining Vera's navigation. The cave pearl's alcove and the "natural alcove worn smooth by millennia" anchor the climax spatially. The cave's acoustics and luminescence shape her emotional arc—beauty amid danger mirrors her thematic realization—and the final dawn palette ("pink and gold and the softest gray") charges the closure image with sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ivory Harbor after rain is vivid and purposeful: "particular luminescence," limestone quays, salt and aged paper. The trumpet valve as micro-setting anchors Elena's work and charges the final image (valve on desk, "testament"). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through archival priorities. Spatial choreography is clear (quay, archive, desk). The setting subtly guides choice through the valve's repaired soldering technique, which constrains her investigative path. Strong economy and specificity elevate this above postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    The starlit vault with translucent stone ceiling and luminescent moss creates a distinct atmosphere. The phantom ticket punch is handled twice (testing it, then punching the door), and the door's bronze surface covered in Clara's own cartographic style meaningfully constrains her choice—she cannot dismiss it as coincidence. The cracks forming arrows guide movement and the final chamber's shelves of journals anchor the father's long absence in physical space, charging the closure image with tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tower's circular roof opening, worn stone table, and spiral stairs are vivid and purposeful. Whale song is used as atmospheric pressure throughout, not mere decoration. The magic square tile refracts starlight onto the journal, a tactile object that constrains the transcription act. However, spatial choreography is loose—Mira's position relative to table, roof opening, and Aldric shifts without clear blocking. The setting supports mood and frames the ritual but doesn't force a tactical choice (she could transcribe anywhere once given the journal).

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prismatic escondite is vividly rendered with specific sensory detail ("crystalline walls refracting light that had no earthly origin," "colors existed here that the prismatic escondite had only pretended to contain"). Spatial choreography remains clear across the central atrium and threshold. The escondite constrains Vera's initial state and the magnetic fields carve the doorway that enables her escape, charging the closure. However, the "space beyond space" at the end remains generic ("hushed thunder," "light that held no color yet contained them all") rather than particularized, and the body/tool/recurring-object specificity that would elevate to the 8-band is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    The funeral home prep room is vividly rendered (formaldehyde, chemical perfume, steel counter, fluorescent light) and pressures the conversation through its association with death and preservation. The ink pot's physical presence (clouded glass, dark residue) charges the final exchange. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting does not constrain a tactical choice during the scene, which holds it below 8.0, but it charges the thematic resonance of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    The blooming labyrinth, fluorescent lamp, and shed are vividly rendered with sensory detail (cherry blossoms, juniper, cedar, grimy windows, gold and violet light). The mountaintop setting constrains Mei's ritual to a specific pre-dawn silence window, and the lamp's hum directly charges her paper-making process. Spatial choreography through the maze to the shed's center is clear. The bonsai as "keeping its own records in rings of wood too small to count" provides a purposeful thematic mirror. Micro-setting (the notepad, lamp, dust) functions effectively to ground the accumulative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.1)
    The container labyrinth is vividly particular: corrugated steel walls, rust and salt, towering eight stories, mud flats at low tide, sodium-orange port lights. Setting constrains her movement (tide cycles force climb/descent) and enables her method (acoustic canyons amplify smugglers' voices). The glass-pressed poison label is a recurring micro-object that charges the closure when she resolves to show it to the doctor. Spatial choreography is clear across vertical and horizontal moves, and the maze's designed erasure mirrors the thematic question without overt symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory's cracked dome and broken windows supply concrete spatial anchors and constrain the scene's mood (November chill, stars visible through wounds). The half-finished cello becomes a tactile, purpose-driven object whose incomplete body hums despite the cold, grounding Eleanor's physical contact. The painted seashell's compass pointing "in all directions" constrains her interpretive stance at closure, charging the final image when pressed to her ear. Sensory selection—rust, silence, resonant hums—reflects Eleanor's shift from debunker to listener. The cliff setting remains slightly postcard (perched "like a forgotten thought") but the micro-setting (cello, shell, dome wounds) does meaningful causal work.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    The raft city's physicality constrains action throughout: walkways, barges, rope bridges, underside passages shape Mira's movements and the graffiti's placement. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—accordion vs. steel drums, painted hulls, water reflections—filtered through Mira's familiarity. The foundation stone chip (micro-object) charges the final image by linking grandmother's platform-building to Mira's bridge-building, reweighting the closure. Spatial choreography remains clear across districts; the perpetual carnival atmosphere never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.1)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: volcanic scree, granite outcropping, orbital shipyards, crater lake. The summit constrains her ascent and provides the darkness she seeks. The vial at her throat and the chemical packets function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elena's professional and personal priorities. The moonlit summit and the dawning hush are not merely described but shape the threshold she documents. The recurring object (vial) and the environment (darkness) both constrain choice and charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mist-coated depot and converted cargo car are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (warmth patterns, displaced air, brass basin). Spatial choreography is clear, and the environment contributes atmosphere. However, setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—Elara could perform the same repair in any workshop. The micro-setting (water basin, workbench tools) functions as technique display rather than a resource that alters tactics under pressure. Solid execution but setting remains backdrop rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and ice-crystal details are vivid and purposeful. The condensation-on-glass moment becomes a micro-setting that constrains Maren's method ("moisture gathered differently where the glass was scratched versus smooth"). Spatial choreography is clear (outpost interior to lake surface), and the environment subtly guides the final choice (ice holding, passage open). Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities (she reads condensation patterns as diagnostic). The setting charges the final image without becoming a postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobblestones and archway function as active setting elements: footsteps carve frequency paths, the archway survives as the sole remaining structure, and the mountain's tremors constrain the town's existence. Sensory detail is purposeful—corroded bells, velvet-wrapped fork, cobblestones humming—and filtered through the bell tuner's mission-oriented perception. The spatial choreography across three days remains clear, and the setting's collapse is causally tied to prior imbalance, charging the final image of the granddaughter stepping onto fresh stones.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    The underwater temple setting actively constrains: oxygen timer forces urgency, depth isolates, the altar's physical presence shapes the climactic choice. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"water thick with suspended particles," "brass and leather contraption," faceted crystal scattering rainbows. The dead explorer's skeleton and the carved walls that "show" memories ground the mystical in tactile specificity. The vial as micro-object charges the final image, pressed against her heart during ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, and copperlight dusk are vividly established and the confessional's conversion from storage room grounds the setting in history. The lattice—held, gripped, spoken through—constrains Milo's final choice and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear (narrow door, diamond-shaped openings, corner scratches). The setting shapes the protagonist's tactic (using the confessional screen as both shield and amplifier) and the final image of copperlight settling "like absolution" reweights the opening mood.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    The alchemical greenhouse is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail (luminescent fruit, quicksilver streams, glass-and-iron bones) that constrains the family's work across generations. The "winter-cracked fields" and "endless night" pressure the stakes continuously. The carved beads and central tree anchor the closure beat, with the greenhouse's glass walls cracking as dawn arrives—environment directly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.1)
    The red canyon labyrinth is established early with sensory particulars (salt-crusted basins, ancient grooves) and directly constrains Meren's work—she waits for moisture to vanish, positions herself at convergence points. The illustration plate functions as micro-setting, charging the final image when held up in starlight. Spatial choreography of sleepwalkers' overlapping paths is clear and purposeful. The empty tide pools serve as both constraint and thematic anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly realized: roots threading through skulls, pale fruit, tokens on branches. The sundial base as micro-setting object constrains the central choice (rebuilding it) and charges the final image (strapped to her pack). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"air tasted of soil and sweetness and something older than memory"—and filtered through Mira's professional excavation frame. Spatial choreography remains clear across chambers and tree rows.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    The golden arcade is vividly rendered with purposeful, era-specific detail ("brass fixtures," "glass panels that had survived three centuries," "holographic advertisements"). The fountain, marble floors, and dawn light create a textured micro-setting that supports the futuristic-nostalgia tone. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image in a way that alters Vera's tactics or the ending's meaning—she moves through it without spatial friction. Strong atmospheric work, but it remains backdrop rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt observatory is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: blue-tinted walls, copper ribs, the great telescope. Autumn winds and leaves create atmospheric coherence. The worktable, scattered spools, and map table provide spatial choreography that supports Mira's intelligence-gathering. The observatory's three-century history and lamplight anchor the scene without over-exposition. The setting does not directly constrain a choice at closure, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mangrove labyrinth supplies vivid, purposeful anchors: twisted roots as platform, moonlight pooling impossibly bright, condensation forming words. The gargoyle shard functions as micro-setting, warming in her hand and refracting memory at the climax. Sensory detail is filtered through Celeste's medium lens (spirits' song "vibrated in her chest") and moon-healing mythology. The setting pressures her choice by providing the liminal space where apology can finally be voiced. Slight gap: the boatman and dock appear only in passing, limiting spatial choreography in the frame sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mist-clad atrium with fogged ceiling panels at twilight grounds early and the recurring mist frames emotional beats ("cocoon separate from the hospital's fluorescent reality"). The plastic chair and the girl's cast function as micro-setting that constrains Marina's decryption action. Spatial choreography (girl crossing atrium, mother's departure/return) tracks cleanly. The atrium's liminal quality charges the final image as Marina walks toward surgery, but the environment does not directly constrain the peak choice to reinterpret the coral; it remains more backdrop than tactical shaper.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    The fog-bound orchard district is vividly rendered with skeletal trees, crumbling murals, and perpetual mist that creates a consistent atmosphere. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Mira's artistic perception. The setting enables her escape from commercial work and provides the canvas for her light-painting, constraining her practice to this hidden sanctuary. The fresco fragment—a small object—functions as micro-setting by charging the final turn when it "seemed lighter now," meeting the 9+ gate criterion of an object that constrains choice or charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sound wave garden is vividly particular—brass horns, copper cones, parabolic reflectors, sonic-etched panels—and directly constrains Margot's tactics (she tries orchestras, birdsong, seventeen languages). The hobo nickel functions as micro-setting, its carved grooves mirroring the sonic etching and charging the final recognition. The garden's architecture (positioning between reflectors) enables the pivotal question-and-pause moment. Sensory hierarchy is well-calibrated: she feels yesterday's thunder in metal, watches mist ripple, and hears her inner ear swim from reflected sound.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    The greenhouse is vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (sweating glass, clicking mandibles, atlas moth wings). Micro-setting test satisfied: the insects and Dr. Voss's collection charge the atmosphere and underscore the theme of life resisting control. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice or alter tactics—it functions as evocative backdrop rather than active pressure. The gourd seed and notebook are handled but not spatially challenged. Strong descriptive work kept from 8+ by lack of spatial friction on decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    The gargantuan shell functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: its nacreous walls hold her luminous verses, its aperture channels her voice into wind-borne lullabies, its innermost chamber becomes sanctuary. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—"whorls that spiraled upward into darkness," "blue-green" bioluminescence, "sea-silk" nest. The reef's spatial logic remains coherent across mentions (crevices, enemy waters, coral blooms). The shell's architecture directly charges the final image when linked to the Andromeda spiral: "the spiral that mirrored her home's architecture."

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    The opal library is vividly rendered with purposeful specificity: walls of translucent shimmer, spiral corridors, moonlight staircase, foxglove section. Micro-setting qualifies—the cracked bamboo tube placed on the altar of echoes directly enables the restoration ritual and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (stacks → spiral staircase → apex chamber). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's caretaker focus (crystalline petals, colors humans stopped perceiving, the glow of sealing fracture). The environment constrains choice by requiring the climb to the restoration chamber and supplies the echoes that enable the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    The archive is vivid ("dust and forgotten vowels," phosphorescent moss) and pressures the reconciliation via its symbolic weight and the Veth'ari ink well as focal object. Spatial choreography (corridors, small chamber, pedestal) remains clear. The glass ink well constrains choice by anchoring the promise ritual and charges the final image ("empty of ink but full of possibility"). Sensory detail is selective and atmosphere-driven, though occupation-level linguistics remains abstract rather than tactile in the translation work itself.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    The amphitheater inside the dormant volcano is vividly rendered with selective, purpose-driven detail: breathing stone, obsidian walls, sulfurous light, and volcanic heat all pressure the discovery and charge the final image. The surveyor's chain as micro-setting (cold brass against volcanic warmth, warm against her chest at closure) constrains her decoding and charges the ending. Spatial choreography remains clear across tiers and the central stage. No significant weaknesses touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    The attic functions as micro-setting that constrains daily ritual (trunk, skylight, dust-mote mapping) and the meteorite arrives embedded in estate-sale clutter, grounding the discovery in tactile detail. The skylight becomes a literal lens for Elara's meditative practice, shaping her daily choices. Sensory selection is purposeful: decay and possibility, dust swirling in a single beam, the chip "dark as dried blood." The setting subtly guides the confession scene by making the attic a shared contemplative space. Spatial choreography is clean (trunk, skylight, windowsill) and the 1962 newspaper clipping roots the meteorite in verifiable history.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prism terrace is vividly particular: "crystalline platforms refracting light into whispers," a salvaged oak bench, violet threshold. These elements actively constrain Wren's existence and charge the final crossing. Spatial choreography remains clear across the drifting journey, and sensory detail (clouds "tasted of forgotten harvests," "fractured hush") filters through Wren's perceptual priorities. The terrace functions as both setting and symbolic pressure, meeting the micro-setting gate by shaping the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    The underwater facility is vividly rendered through sensory specifics (shadowseam wonder, bioluminescent algae, pressure-sealed domes) and the burnt feather functions as micro-setting, constraining her method of stellar reading. The facility's groaning "made Marina feel held rather than threatened" is an excellent POV-filtered detail. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the environment directly charges the closure image when the fish ascend through the described light.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    The iridescent cave constrains action (crystal shelf as workspace, crevices for planting) and charges the final image (light scattered through crystal becomes metaphor for paths). Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "hummed with trapped light," "fractured rainbows," moisture-gathering crevices. The seeds and crater glass function as micro-setting objects that enable the conjecture beat. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. Minor limit: the cave's beauty is described more than it pressures choice, trending toward postcard in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tidal arcade is established early with vivid sensory detail (saltwater reflecting constellations, wet stone acoustics, twice-daily tides). Setting actively constrains Marina's choices: she calculates tide effects on resonance, positions herself for moonlight timing, and uses column geometry to bounce sound. The bishop placed "where moonlight would catch its curves in exactly twelve minutes" demonstrates micro-setting charging a key beat. The environment evolves causally (receding water at the end) and the spatial choreography of columns, pools, and crowd flow remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    The twilight garden is vivid and tonally consistent—"starlight pooled like spilled mercury," obsidian pillars, jasmine. The moonstone dust and stylus function as micro-setting objects that constrain the ritual's execution. The garden's position "at the edge of the world, beyond the Magisters' reach" directly enables the forbidden choreography and charges the closure image of dancing "until dawn threatened." Sensory detail is filtered through Selene's professional and emotional priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pearl Bay at dawn is filtered through Elena's glazier priorities—light refraction, mist, glass surfaces. The prism atrium constrains her choice (it will be demolished) and charges the final image (she sketches new scattered installations). Micro-setting via the stone, water, and glass structures all serve the closure. Sensory hierarchy (light dominates, touch secondary) reflects her profession. Strong integration; reaching 8.5+ would require the environment to pressure a mid-scene tactical shift beyond the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ridge path, moonlight, planetary conjunction, and flat rock are vivid and filtered through Marcus's firefighter perception (unstable terrain, skilled footwork). The cracked porcelain box functions as micro-setting, constraining his choice to scatter or hold. Sensory hierarchy reflects his priorities: scars, box texture, celestial indifference. The mountain setting charges the final image—ashes dispersing along the ridge she wanted to climb. Strong selective detail and embodied interaction with environment.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tide-polished grotto is vividly rendered ("walls worn smooth by centuries," "water trickling through limestone veins") and the refracted light becomes the mechanism through which Marina perceives parallel timelines, directly enabling her pattern work. The glass beads function as micro-setting objects that constrain her method and charge the closure when the triangle arrangement changes her tactics. The final ascent—"saltwater misting her face"—ties body and environment to her emotional shift. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Marina's physicist lens (refractive patterns, quantum language), and the grotto recurs across the beats with evolving function, meeting the 9+ gate for setting that constrains choice and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ivy-veiled passage functions as more than backdrop: the thick growth signals temporal distance from the climate shifts, the collapsed fireplace preserves the diaries, and filtered light enables examination of the film negative. The setting constrains discovery through physical access (pushing through curtains of green, extracting from ash and root systems) and the acoustic properties of stone anchor Mira's professional methodology. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—cool stone, vibrations, evening winds—filtered through her professional perception without catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prism parapet after rain anchors the scene vividly and returns in the closure beat, refracting light onto the finished work. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric; the terrace's crystalline surfaces and "dusky harmony" color charge the final image. The body and brushes remain underdeveloped as micro-setting—handles are mentioned but do not constrain a choice. Still, the parapet's refracted light directly shapes the painting's embedded colors, giving it moderate causal presence.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.1)
    The terrace overlooking the Valley of Echoes is vivid and purposeful, grounding the ritual in shared reverence. The clipboard—handled, pressed to chest, opened—functions as micro-setting and constrains Elara's ritual choices. Wildflowers through bones and twin moons supply atmospheric texture. Spatial choreography (General arrives first, leaders take separate paths) remains coherent. However, the setting doesn't narrow tactical options at the climax; the terrace serves more as backdrop than constraint. The final descent is legible but doesn't charge the closure image with environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    The salt flat is vivid and constrains Eleanor's choice: she reads the cracks as a map to the cavern, kneels on the crystalline crust, and the rain begins to dissolve the salt around her knees, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her POV. The micro-setting (body, salt, rain) recurs and charges closure, meeting the 9+ test's spirit, but the occupational detail (geologists, acoustic resonance) is told rather than dramatically tested, capping the score just under 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.1)
    The silver courtyard under snow and the crystalline prism sanctuary are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (starlight scattering into fractured rainbows, breath visible in frozen air). The prism constrains the ritual action—Meridia kneels, arranges her body, untangles threads—charging the final image when it dims after fulfilling its purpose. The Velvet House and courtesan context remain postcard background without spatial pressure on her choices, but the micro-setting (prism, snow, body as poetic instrument) does constrain and charge the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.1)
    The radar dome's acoustic properties ("amplified every sound into whispered echoes") and curved walls constrain the scene, turning it into an arena for intimacy and confrontation. The dust floor enables the closure gesture (calligraphy and question mark), directly charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through urgency: "meteor hush," surf crash, settling structure. The setting is not ornamental; it shapes the tone and provides the material substrate for the ending's symbolic act.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    The grotto is vivid and purposeful: mist, moss-covered stone, clouds below create a liminal space that mirrors the threshold of extinction. The moth wing—a micro-object—constrains choice (using a relic of personal grief) and charges the closure when it returns to the notebook. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Vera's work: "blushing stillness," "amber quiet," hemp rope texture. The environment enables the ritual and the monarchs' spiraling acknowledgment, making setting instrumental rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sanctum's translucent ice walls and aurora current actively enable the rope's new function, constraining Elin's movements ("technically gentle… one wrong movement would shatter") and charging the closure when "the ice walls caught the sound and multiplied it." The rope as micro-setting (body, tool, environment compressed) shapes both middle choices and final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects her craft (tactile priority: "feeling the contours," "feeling for the give") and the aurora modulates from green/violet to "green deepening to gold" as pressure peaks. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bunker's fungal light, rust-choked hatch, and vine embrace create a vivid micro-setting. The wafer seal is handled twice (lifted, cracked) and the storm's electricity "singing through ancient wiring" ties environment to the moment of transcendence. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting constrains Mira's movement and charges the final image (vines "like an embrace," parting storm), meeting the 9+ gate requirement for choice-constraint or closure-charge.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    The reimagined Babylonian palace with brass telescopes and magic square tiles is vivid and purposeful. The lapis lazuli tile with silver numerals constrains her method and charges the closure when she packs it. Spatial choreography (throne room, clerestory windows, ziggurat stairs) is coherent. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira's professional filter: she notices celestial angles and mathematical objects. The interregnum timeframe adds social texture—empty observatories enable solitary work—but does not materially constrain a choice during the night's observation.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.1)
    The soundless sanctuary is vividly specific: sound refuses to exist, reality shifts like breath, movement requires "constant adjustment, a dance of accommodation." These details constrain action (Thorne's scream produces nothing, he falls to his knees) and charge the final image (the broken music box cannot play, yet its melody "exists beyond sound"). Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The sanctuary functions as both macro-setting and conceptual anchor, shaping Thorne's disorientation and Mireva's mastery, and the final threshold moment is grounded in the shifting reality Mireva navigates with grace.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fog functions as both atmosphere and constraint, shaping Elara's breath-sync method and the boundary-erasure stakes. Twilight frost and the stone apple trees ground the ruined orchard in tactile detail. The reconstructed sextant's mirrors constrain the climactic choice by making the glass mountains visible, directly charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single clearing.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    The impossible orchard on cathedral rafters is vivid, purposeful, and constraints the climb (three hours, massive branches, Gothic arches). Micro-setting details—dust centuries thick, apple trees rooted in decay, amber light through broken rose window—are filtered through Mira's mender-eye and the climbing task. The setting charges the final image (life in impossible places) and the bird's nest reinforces theme without becoming a forced motif. Spatial choreography is clear across all moves. Does not quite reach 8.5+ because the cathedral's interior layout (rafters, beams, arches) could constrain one more mid-climb choice to deepen necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.1)
    The astral orchard is vividly evoked with upward-drifting silver blossoms and trees growing from black rock. The bathroom's incongruity is noted but not leveraged to constrain a choice. The pistachio shell cameo appears in Maren's hand and returns at the end to charge the closure image, crossing the 9+ gate for this category. Spatial choreography is clean and the membrane detail grounds the impossible setting with specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.9)
    The mountain-as-library conceit is vivid and the spiral-shelf imagery memorable, but the vast scale rarely constrains a specific choice—Mira moves freely through Philosophy/Prophecy/Recursive Fiction without spatial friction. The botanical diary (pressed dream-flowers, chlorophyll coordinates) supplies concrete detail that charges the closure via the "flower that blooms when observed by someone who forgot something important." The final image of sunlight "like a question" reweights the setting's meaning, meeting the 9+ gate partially, but mid-story the labyrinth functions more as backdrop than tactical shaper.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The carnival ship supplies vivid, selective detail (rusted Ferris wheel, rotted canvas, carousel horses with "blissfully aberrant joy") filtered through Maya's search. The emerald swatch card returns with charged meaning in the final image, constraining her approach and framing the Garden concept. Fog and decay modulate throughout, shaping tone and reflecting internal states without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography remains clear across the tilted corridors and carousel.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    The clock tower mechanism room is vividly rendered with brass gears "the size of wagon wheels," the Unity Cord with fibers that "shift between gold and shadow," and spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The ceremonial rope functions as micro-setting that directly enables the climactic choice—Mira must physically work its braids to restore the connection. The environment charges the final image when "the gears turned in their ancient dance, finally complete." Strong setting work that meets the 9+ gate test by constraining choice and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    The harmonic caves constrain every choice: wall vibrations guide Vera's descent, ice formations reveal draft patterns, and the bloom chamber's geometry creates the acoustic shelter that enables her final stance. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priority—she reads caves through touch and sound before sight. The frozen-wave walls and crystalline growths emerge causally from the beings' disruption. Micro-setting (the body's ripple-marks, the stone's warmth) charges the final image when she presses palms to walls in acknowledgment.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glass pavilion constrains Mira's choice to amplify memory and charges the final image through its chord humming across distance. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: crystalline panels catching wind, starlight through transparent walls, the humming felt "in her teeth, her fingertips, the hollow of her throat." The poisoned valleys and ruined Observatory District establish post-collapse specificity without catalog listing. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from pavilion spiral stairs to distant beacon tower and back.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Observatory setting pressures the choice: solid fog seals her above the clouds, creating isolation that enables conjecture without immediate oversight. The shadow dial, crystal forecourt resonance through foundations, and storm-charged air all constrain her method and charge the ending's descent. Micro-setting (her fingertips on stone) and the forecourt's eternal whisper frame the final image. Small dock: spatial choreography inside the observatory remains abstract—we lack anchor for where she stands relative to aperture, dial, and instruments during key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The blooming fortress is vividly rendered with jasmine, mosaics, and tile details that create strong atmosphere. The kerosene knot appears multiple times and charges the final image by being "tucked back" as a relic. Spatial choreography (courtyard, tower stairs, battlement) tracks clearly. The starless sky functions as canvas, constraining the fireworks' impact. Dusk timing and sensory hierarchy (fire, scent, visual cascades) support the stakes without crowding.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto setting is vivid and filtered through Mira's professional lens (mineral deposits, tidal pools as "universes in miniature"). Spatial choreography is coherent: pools at Elena's foot, jade cicada placed "on the stone between them," starlight overhead. The micro-setting (jade cicada held toward starlight) charges the final image when Elena lifts it. Minor gap: the grotto as physical constraint could press a choice more directly; here it functions primarily as atmosphere and symbolic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.1)
    The xenial trellis is vividly particular (crystalline vines, solidified mist, gravity inversion) and the inverted-growth image constrains her final stance: she will "grow like the crystalline vines—in whatever direction felt like freedom." The gilded hush recurs as sensory anchor and charges the closure. Spatial choreography during the float is clear and the white flower opening toward golden clouds provides a resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prism terrace is vividly rendered with acoustic specificity—pockets of stillness, reflected light, faceted surfaces—that directly constrains Eris's choice of location and timing for the vial's release. The storm glass functions as micro-setting, its crystal helix pattern guiding her to the convergence point. Sensory hierarchy filters through her professional ear: cable thrums, train whistles, silence "pressing against her eardrums." The terrace's drift and geometry shape the final act, charging the closure image with environmental resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall, luminescent fruit, and circuitry-wrapped trees create vivid, purpose-driven atmosphere. The ruby flake's pulse and the tree's shimmering bark constrain Meridia's path and charge the final beat. Spatial choreography is clean—waterfall entrance, rows of trees, central trunk. The futuristic-mythic blend (holographic crown, forgotten circuitry, dimensional gates) supports tone without catalog exposition. The environment actively shapes the choice to ascend, meeting the 9+ quick test's threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ashen charcoal sanctuary, doorknocker ring, and starlight canopy are vivid and purposeful. The doorknocker functions as micro-setting: Mira's weekly polishing embodies "loaded emptiness," and lifting it in the climax dissolves the threshold—it constrains her choice and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (Sera at edge, Mira at door, both seated inside). Minor cap per Q2 orientation waiver: no penalty applied, so Q3 is not artificially limited. The sanctuary's dust patterns register Sera's encroachment, integrating setting with conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm supplies concrete sensory anchors (violet glow, seventeen shadows, cultivation rows, soil) and constrains Vera's final choice—she channels pressure through her body into the earth where her mushrooms feed. The porthole bolt's engineered precision and the farm's liminal atmosphere charge the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear (crouching between rows, doorway at chamber center, diamonds scattered across soil). The fantastical elements (concepts becoming physical) are presented with consistent internal logic and sensory specificity rather than vague abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sepia reading room is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: amber light, dust motes, botanical treatises, the moth-gray volume. The gramophone and its crank handle function as charged objects that anchor Margaret's ritual and reappear at closure. The setting does constrain Margaret's discovery (the room as a "standing wave" point, the false panel), though the constraint operates more conceptually than as a physical pressure that alters her tactics in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    The alchemical orchard with glowing fruit and eternal night creates vivid, purposeful atmosphere. Spatial details—rows of trees, loamy soil, glass panes—ground action. The armor removal is tactile and the program is handled twice (kneeling, pages turning), and the greenhouse's groaning glass at the climax charges the final image. The endless night and the newborn star function as micro-setting elements that reconfigure meaning at closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for environment shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    The file room's dust patterns function as micro-setting that constrains Eleanor's method and charges the final image: "dust would continue to settle... marking the distance between what happened and what gets remembered." The 1867 file's brittle pages and the button's tarnish ground the historical layer in tactile specificity. Spatial choreography is coherent (shelf, floor, door) and the setting subtly mirrors Eleanor's isolation. The environment does not constrain a peak choice but does frame her work and recurs in the closing beat, reaching the 7-band threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    The auric lagoon and Pacific Bell logo ground the world in specific, engineered details. The puddle-reflection navigation is vivid and purposeful, shaping her route. However, the underground vault and tunnels remain generic—"shelves," "secondary exit"—without tactile constraint or spatial cost. The lagoon recurs at the end but as postcard atmosphere rather than a charged element that alters her final stance or the reader's understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    The radiant grotto is vividly rendered with specific detail (limestone walls, embedded crystals, mist swirling in response to sound) and the setting constrains her method—she must play here at dawn when the prism atrium transforms the fog. The dewdrops function as micro-setting, recurring to mark time and charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the cave's acoustics enable the technique that drives the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ashen skyborne arbor—trees rooted in volcanic soot, mist-drunk—is vivid and consistent. Micro-setting excels: the moonstone probe, the sorting tray, the suspended walkways with tiny monuments all recur and constrain action. The arbor's grey expanse shifts to vibrant at closure, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective ("mossy and sweet," "green scent of things growing") and filtered through Wren's devotion. The environment subtly guides choice: the hush is both temporal and spatial pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    The subterranean waterfall, bioluminescent fungi, and neglected greenhouse constrain movement and charge atmosphere throughout. Sensory hierarchy is vivid and selective: "thunder, then mist, finally the impossible blue glow" filters discovery through Mira's practitioner's eye. The greenhouse's perpetual leaf-spirals and the compass pedestal anchor the closure image with tactile specificity. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the descent, waterfall passage, greenhouse interior, and digging action. The underground setting recurs in the final paragraph ("waterfall continued its eternal fall"), reweighting Mira's new relationship to time.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    The foundry functions as more than backdrop: the rain's "patient percussion," the furnace's heat, the soot-stained workbench, and the rain-washed windows all shape Mira's temporal arc and charge the ending when morning light turns "old iron beams into something luminous." Spatial choreography is clean (satchel on bench, crucible opening, coin pressed into metal). The micro-setting—her instruments, the crucible, the coin—constrains her method and charges the closure image. The zodiac coin as tactile object elevates setting past decorative detail.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Echo Gorge is anchored with selective sensory detail (pale light, striated stone throat, ghostly echo repetitions) that constrains Maren's descent and frames the harp discovery. The crocodile's tooth functions as micro-setting, charged at both opening (Vasilis's lesson) and closure (warm against her chest). The harp itself—bone-white wood, slack strings—constrains the confession mechanism. Spatial choreography is clean (descent, canyon heart, climb out). The hidden sunrise timeframe brackets the piece and charges the final image, though "hidden" remains slightly vague.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ultraviolet forest is richly imagined—bioluminescent bark, violet pulses encoding data, phosphorescent soil—and grounds Elena's sensory experience. The setting constrains her movement (exhaustion, healing wounds) and supplies the mathematical structures she decodes. The mask strap as micro-object charges the ending when buried. Sensory detail is filtered through her enhanced proprioception, creating a distinct perceptual lens. Strong integration of environment with character state and closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    The alchemist's market is vividly anchored with swaying bridges, phosphorescent lanterns, and sensory specificity ("moth-eaten velvet," "silver teeth," thread "fine as spider silk"). The fragment itself—catching light that wasn't there, bending it into colors with no names—constrains the final choice and charges the closure image when it reveals the layered city. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting does more than backdrop; it embodies the between-worlds premise and enables the climactic vision.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly rendered—peeling red paint, rusted turnstile, dust patterns—and the setting constrains Miriam's investigation (the hidden panel behind the baseboard). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her professional eye. The mainspring barrel functions as micro-setting, its weight and craftsmanship charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glass orchard library is vivid and purposeful: crystalline trees, books as fruit, frost patterns as language. The bottled whisper and letterpress constrain Maren's method and charge the closure image (shattered bottle, dissolved press, fallen type). Sensory detail is strong ("amber hour," "crack through ice," "crystal chimes and breaking ice") and filtered through a voice attuned to stasis versus change. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. Minor: the clouds and library's floating mechanism remain somewhat decorative rather than pressing choice in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    The baroque asteroid's spirals and gilded arches constrain Maren's theory (architecture as temporal sail), and the temporal storms pressure her ritual of covering mirrors. The crystal shard returns with reweighted meaning at closure, functioning as both setting anchor and tool. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered: "ribbons of amber and violet," "great waves of visible time crashing against the baroque spires." Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The quarters, observatory, and mirror are used tactically, and the final step-through integrates setting into the decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    The resonance chamber's copper walls and focal point constrain the repair work; seven music boxes arranged spatially guide the ritual. The chip's amber pulse and the rust's transformation into "copper stars" charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and tied to Elias's expertise ("sympathetic harmonics," "covenant of rust"). Minor opportunity: the chamber's small window appears only at the end without prior spatial anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    The subterranean lagoon is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail—bioluminescent organisms, limestone lace, cathedral columns—that charges the final image when the light spells "welcome." The factory-shutdown timeframe creates access (silence enables hearing water below) and thus constrains her descent timing. Micro-setting excels: the compass as tactile anchor, the collection jars as embodied tool. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the descent and lagoon encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    The archway constrains Marina physically (shelter from storm) and the slide's layered glass requires specific light conditions, both shaping her actions on the page. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered: "turbine-hum," "salt and fury," "oilcloth." The storm's subsidence allows her to leave shelter, a micro-setting shift that enables the ending choice. The final image—archway shadow stretching "like a bridge"—charges closure, earning the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    The amber pavilion is vividly anchored with honey-colored panes, hexagonal structure, and cathedral window fragments. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: copper light, melting snow, dawning hush, deep blue and silver paint. The etched glass layers constrain Mira's investigation and charge the closure—her study of how light moves through them directly enables her epiphany. Spatial choreography is clean (table, walls, eastern window). The setting's former chapel identity and the glass's layered mechanics are specific and irreplaceable, shaping both her process and the final sanctuary effect.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    The zeppelin, dunes, and obsidian lagoon are vivid and purposeful; the lagoon's "volcanic glass" and "parley marks" constrain the final encounter and charge the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (heat-ghosts, salt-crusted pillar, black water). The micro-setting of the lagoon depression alters tactics—Celeste must descend, recognize the patterns, and meet the waiting woman—elevating the score into the 7s. Minor: the "floating library" frame is scenic but does not pressure mid-scene choices beyond transit.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cove's bioluminescent algae, empty lanterns, and village square anchor space effectively. The amber bottle—warm, sealed, paradoxical—functions as micro-setting that constrains Mira's method (communion not entry) and charges the final image when its contents become lanterns. Sensory detail is selective (algae glow, swaying cords, warmth against skin) and filtered through Mira's alchemist priorities. The tea house and shrine appear as named waypoints without spatial consequence, but the square and hillside provide coherent choreography for the opening and closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ancient orchard atop Meridian Tower is vivid and specific, grounding the magical realism in concrete detail (gnarled apple trees, bruised-plum sky, sixty stories above harbor). The fallen apples function as both setting and constraint, their pattern (12-3-1) conveying coordinates that validate the prophecy. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (amber glow, windless night, velvet disquiet), and the setting charges the closure image—Maren writing on clay while the orchard "holds its breath." The tower's verticality and the orchard's ancient transplantation history supply thematic resonance without becoming postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound atrium is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (silver starlight, frost singing back, breath crystallizing). The frozen garden and vortex above the fountain supply spatial anchors that remain coherent. The acorn cap as micro-setting object constrains her method (spiral geometry as template) and charges the final image when placed atop the fountain. The setting's transformation from prison to preservation system directly reflects her internal shift and shapes the ending's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    The windblown sanctuary, cloud layer, stone floor, and tower create vivid spatial grounding with economy. The bell rope's tactile evolution (traced each morning, fresh binding, tacky glue, dried permanence) constrains the final choice and charges the closure image. Microclimate instruments and the solstice atmosphere supply concrete sensory detail filtered through Mira's professional lens. Setting details are integrated into action (she traces fibers, watches readings settle) rather than pausing for catalog description.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    The yellow lantern glass constrains perception and charges the final image ("glowed like a small captured sun"), satisfying the 9+ gate test. Spatial choreography is clean (ladder, platform, railing, dome). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "moss grew...with patient deliberation," "owls nested in the broken scopes." The station functions as micro-setting, shaping Mira's stance and crystallizing her choice to remain. Setting anchors early and modulates from cold metal to honeyed warmth, mirroring internal progression.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    The beekeeping oasis is rendered with specific, purposeful detail: "wooden hive boxes bleached bone-white," "irrigation channels filled with dust," stone cottage walls that "hold the desert's fury at bay." The stained glass box functions as micro-setting, repeatedly handled and visually charged ("threw bees of gold across the walls"). The wasteland pressures Maren's isolation and the ghosts' pilgrimage, and the box constrains her final choice by making the unspoken words portable yet withheld.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    The emerald silo is vividly rendered ("glass walls catching light," "green waves") and returns at closure to charge the final image ("emerald walls pulsed"). The urn fragment functions as micro-setting, constraining Vera's discovery and providing the key that repairs the capsule. Sensory detail is selective and supports the textural lens. The post-Reformation world (numbers as emotions, clocks displaying feelings) is consistent and integrated into Vera's work without info-dump.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lagoon grounds the opening effectively with "cobalt," "burnished hush," and "sand still cool from the storm." Sensory detail is selective and apt—eucalyptus droplets, rain-washed earth and salt—without catalog excess. The feather's iridescence ("emerald to copper") is vivid and purposeful. However, the lagoon itself does not constrain a choice at closure; it functions as backdrop rather than tactical pressure. The micro-setting (feather, kite, kelp) charges the final image but does not force a trade-off, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.1)
    The living stone pillars, spiral apple trees, and copper wire function as micro-setting elements that constrain Maren's choices throughout: she climbs the oak, wraps wire to bridge species, and the pillars respond by shifting mineral growth. The orchard's architecture is not decorative but active, guiding her work and the animals' offerings. The final image—copper threads catching morning light, Maren's palm on the oldest pillar—charges the closure with the accumulated weight of connection made tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rainwashed tower, bronze-lit chamber, and amber on the pedestal are vivid and selective. Spatial choreography is clean (worn steps, tall windows, pedestal at center). The amber functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: Mira touches its cool surface, and the fly's preservation becomes the conceptual anchor for the closure. Spring rain modulates from active to stopped, mirroring the tonal shift. No occupational or professional detail intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    The blooming jetty functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: phosphorescent flowers on every plank create the visual and conceptual anchor for the garden-in-waiting. The glowing water, rusted wire, shattered stone at the headland, and the subsurface currents the birds describe all constrain Erasmus's choices (timing, seed selection, drop point). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: he notices nitrogen content, mineral deposits, temperature gradients—a gardener's and linguist's hierarchy. The jetty's "narrow vastness" recurs and tightens meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    The scrapyard settlement is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: "towers of compressed cars," "half-buried shipping container," "compost pit...oxidizing fragments that bled orange." The compost pit functions as micro-setting, constraining Marta's search and charging the closure (metal dreams of being earth). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The autumn leaf as recurring object charges the final image, elevating the setting's thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    The observation deck's temporal dilation is vividly rendered ("stars hung suspended," "each beat a sustained drumroll") and the warped field constrains Mira's biology, making her exile both blessing and cage. The gilded compass rose applique gains tactile presence through repeated handling. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting directly enables the closure: only from this temporally stretched vantage can Mira create her unprecedented star atlas, and the deck's isolation charges her choice to continue sketching as the ship approaches.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Icebound Spire, violet sky, and cloud-ice chess pieces are vivid and purposeful. The sky-wrong phenomenon constrains the vault opening (temporal fold allows past secrets to occupy the present moment), directly enabling the climactic choice. Spatial choreography across tower levels remains clean, and the frozen environment charges the final descent with the healing draught, qualifying for mid-7s integration.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    The whispering gallery's acoustic property (amplifying absence, catching footsteps) constrains Vera's ritual and charges the final departure when her steps spell "remember" across the threshold. The chessboard's missing pawns function as micro-setting, pressuring her carving project and the thematic reconfiguration at closure. Sensory detail is selective—marble, light fragments, winter cold implied through firelight carving—without tourist excess. Spatial choreography is clean: curved walls, center table, main arch exit.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    The labyrinthine bookstore as living archive—"corridors spiraling through granite like the whorls of a shell," shelves with roots, passages that shift—constrains Vera's nightly reconstruction and charges the final climb. The stone and feather function as micro-setting, tactile and recurring, with the feather's "barbs and rachis" enabling the bodily breakthrough. The mountain-as-text realization ("the mountain itself was a book") transforms setting into stakes without ornament. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (dust, iridescence, mercury reflection). The environment pressures every turn and the upward spiral structure mirrors the bookstore's form, elevating closure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    The platinum labyrinth and frayed tapestry anchor tactile pressure: narrow paths, border threads separated by color and twist, the mirror at center. Sensory selection shifts appropriately—frozen flour cloud, silent open mouths, thunder's unchanging pulse—filtering urgency through Marcus's guilt-lens. The time-frozen village constrains his choice by offering stillness rather than escape, and the labyrinth's geometry mirrors his exile's wandering, charging the closure image when time resumes. Spatial choreography is clean, and the woven hush functions as both atmosphere and conceptual setting, though the occupational detail (chess tutor) remains lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bone towers, canyon echoes, and mist are vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography is clear (base of tallest spire, poets along canyon walls). The canyon's amplification mechanic constrains the ritual tactic (refraction through echoes), directly shaping the climax. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The towers hum at closure, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The acid sea, copper pontoons, and gear mechanisms recur across beats and constrain Vera's floating sanctuary. The workshop lurching during the statue-matching beat creates spatial consequence. The final golden veins through gears and seams charge the closure image, transforming setting into thematic payload. Sensory detail (emerald vapors, hissing acid, clicking mechanisms) is selective and filtered through Vera's alchemical focus. Micro-setting (the statue's outstretched hand) anchors a pivotal moment of temporal compression.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    The coastal cave is vivid and purposeful: stalactites, phosphorescent pools, ancient paintings, and the shaft of light all charge the moment and ground Edwin's epiphany. The painted seashell—micro-object-as-setting—constrains and charges the closure when its sunset merges onto his canvas. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The cave's tidal threat adds urgency without forcing the turn. Environment, tool (easel), and recurring object (seashell) all shape the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cobalt lighthouse, salt-crusted windows, and spiral stairs create concrete spatial choreography; the vial cork functions as a micro-setting object that constrains Mira's emotional processing and charges the final image when she holds it alongside the boy's hand. Sensory detail is purposeful: "jasmine and moonflower and wet earth" signals the supernatural call, and the shift from brutal sun to cool stone marks the atmospheric turn. The setting enables the central choice—this isolated structure is the only place "where someone might be listening"—and the final shadow across rocks roots the ending spatially.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.1)
    The starlit signal station is vividly rendered through specific details (cracked windows, corroded metal, bronze patina, salvaged mirrors) that constrain Mira's choices throughout. The setting's decay forces manual construction, the rocks provide the recovered censer, and the beacon array's spatial arrangement shapes the climactic action. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's navigational priorities, grounding both the physical work and the metaphysical stakes in concrete space.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.1)
    The hanging orchard constrains her isolation and survival calculus throughout: trees on steel cables over a ravine, storm losses tallied with detachment, the platform swaying. The glass eye's physical presence (cold, then warm, then nothing; housing pressed against temple) grounds the pivot. The ravine below "swallowing the storm's fury" and trees "roots reaching toward nothing, surviving anyway" charge the final image with embodied fragility. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (spore patterns, mycelia language). Minor deduction: the oilcloth wrapping and grafting supplies appear once without spatial follow-through.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    The opal dock's iridescence and mist function as micro-setting that charges the closure image ("gleamed behind him, patient"). Specifics ground the world: nautical twilight, Ashmore Rock, the lighthouse beam's sweep. The Edelweiss itself—alpine origin against sea—operates as symbolic constraint that Elias must decode. Spatial choreography remains clear (dock edge, lighthouse, mainland implied). Minor gap: "nautical twilight" timeframe could pressure a choice more directly; here it mostly sets mood.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    The limestone cavern with phosphorescent flowers provides vivid, purpose-driven detail that directly pressures Eleanor's timeline. The rising creek functions as both atmospheric element and constraint, creating a one-hour window that forces the choice. The matrix chip's physical properties (a casting mold pressed into stone) and the doorway mechanism are concrete and specific. The abandoned shop at closure—annotated map, embedded chip—charges the final image with tactile resonance that reweights the opening's "empty as always" silence.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grotto's bleeding starlight constrains the queen's realization (she watches the phenomenon from her dreams made real, triggering the memory), and the fireflies charge the oracle's declaration of the sign. Spatial choreography tracks clearly (base, climb, threshold, interior, descent). Sensory hierarchy reflects the queen's dual crisis: physical (slick handholds, burning muscles) and existential (luminescent ichor, lacy mist). The cobalt walls and cloudline function as more than postcard; they supply the pressure-vessel for revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ember nexus is sensory and specific (geothermal whispers, sulfurous air, magma chorus, heat shimmer) and the pocket-sun's glow modulates with Mira's emotion, charging the scene. The nautilus shell and its light-fractals constrain Mira's focus and anchor the final exchange. Spatial choreography is clean—Theo crosses into heat, his shadow falls on the workbench—and the twilight descent marks time without stalling momentum. The setting does more than backdrop; it embodies the alchemical/romantic fusion at the story's heart.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cabin's rough-hewn table, birch bark, mountain wind, and meadow with headstone create vivid atmosphere. The scroll itself functions as micro-setting, constraining her understanding across time. Sensory details like "scent of birch and snow" and the cabin groaning against wind are purposefully deployed. The meadow holding "her headstone like a secret" charges the spatial relationship. Minor cap: while setting enables reflection, it doesn't constrain a pivotal on-page choice as tightly as needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    The water-clock shop is vividly particular and the fog/droplet motif coheres. Spatial choreography is clear: workbench, chair, windows, clepsydras. The screw mechanism functions as micro-setting—it constrains Elena's tool choice and charges the final exchange. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (Elena notices oxidation she can't smell). The "Victorian era" clamp and "Welsh valleys" ground period and locale without excess. All anchors track; no floating rooms.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    The floating platform constrains choice throughout: Mira must complete the ceremony in the pocket of stillness while rain approaches, and the platform's ancient protection creates the safe zone she needs. The crow quill, porcelain cups, and tea function as micro-setting tools that enable the ritual's progression. The scar's geography becomes a literal writing surface, altering tactics when she traces the warm liquid into its branches. Final image is charged by rain meeting stone and crows settling with ink-drop eyes, grounding the closure in concrete sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sheet music archive is vivid and purposeful: "dust and forgotten symphonies," "yellowed manuscripts," and the fluorescent lights flickering in Eleanor's presence all ground the supernatural in tactile detail. The archive's "deepest corner" provides spatial progression, and the orchard outside frames the time limit. The perfume bottle and copper apparatus are handled objects that constrain action. The archive itself doesn't force a tactical choice, but the sensory hierarchy (Marcus's focus on the apparatus, Eleanor's conducting gestures) reflects urgency and profession.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    The temple library is vividly rendered with "shelves curving inward and upward simultaneously" and amber light, creating strong atmospheric specificity. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the protagonist's movement deeper into the stacks. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it serves as backdrop for philosophical revelation rather than a force that shapes decision-making. The dictionary as micro-setting object charges the final image (blank pages), narrowly satisfying the 9+ gate, but the broader setting remains ornamental to conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    The station's brass instruments, hydraulic clocks' copper tubes and water chambers, and the mantle clock key all constrain and charge choices. The "fjord quiet" functions as pressure (silence "pressing against the windows like something alive"), and the observation window frames the razor-edge reveal. Micro-setting details (workbench, floorboard, master timepiece) ground each beat. The final image of instruments "still aimed at the place where sea met sky" directly charges closure by showing what remains when the shepherd departs.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rain-soaked library is vividly rendered with layered sensory detail (greenish light, clover scent, cracked mica pane) that establishes mood and reflects Margot's melancholy. The candle lantern recurs purposefully, serving as both practical object and symbolic anchor. Spatial choreography is clean within the library; the subway seats exist only in recounted photographs, not lived space. The setting supports atmosphere strongly but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it hosts reflection rather than pressuring action.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    The utility tunnel setting is vivid and selective: steam pipes, conduits, concrete walls, fluorescent flicker, train vibrations. The subway's electrical pulse shifting day-to-night creates a temporal anchor that constrains when calls arrive. The glass disc functions as micro-setting, charging the final image when the train's vibration makes it sing. Spatial choreography is clean (booth, shelf, receiver). Minor gap: the booth's impossibility ("wedged between steam pipes and electrical conduits") is asserted but the physical logic of how Vera occupies it remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.1)
    The blooming jetty supplies a charged opening image and returns at closure, and the roses ("bloomed three weeks early") anchor the timeframe of covenant regeneration. Walnut ink, archive, and maritime museum provide occupational texture. Spatial choreography is clean during the jetty scene, though the archive interior remains generic. The setting participates in closure—Marguerite's return to her desk—but the final beat could occur in any workspace without structural loss.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ivy-strangled station is vividly rendered and functional: it houses the hidden lab, embodies the reciprocity theme through patient organic reaching, and the moss-covered trunk becomes Maya's literal seat of decision. The fox pair in the ticket booth charges the final image with companionship motif. Spatial choreography is clean (Platform 3 → stationmaster's office → lab inside). The microscope, charts, and humming equipment ground Okonkwo's operation plausibly. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (lichen on jacket, vines strangling doors).

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ultrasonic forest constrains choice throughout—Meridia must wait three years for stellar pause, must touch specific trees to absorb stories, follows musical notes only her ring can translate. The platinum ring functions as micro-setting/tool: it guides dowsing, translates frequencies, points toward truth rather than north. The clearing's absolute silence charges the closure by forcing her confrontation with emotional neutrality. Spatial choreography stays coherent (forest floor, singing pines, clearing, return path) and the constellations' pause creates genuine pressure on timing.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    The gravitational anomaly is vividly rendered with concrete sensory details (spacetime unbending, starlight shifting) and it constrains the plot—only here can time be edited. The dried-up fountain pen functions as micro-setting, charging two beats (initial mention tied to mentor, final use during transmission). Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The anomaly's recursive time effects feel specific to this world and enable the climactic choice, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for setting-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    The luminous harbor is vividly established through moonlight pooling in readable patterns and weathered dock planks that carry vibrations. The vintage camera frames the world for Mira, and the dock becomes the teaching ground where silence is mapped. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the harbor's specific features don't constrain choices or alter tactics during the overnight session. The final image of Elena against the waking harbor charges the closure but doesn't demonstrate that the environment shaped the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive's physicality—volcanic rock, carved chambers, headlamp-lit darkness—grounds the descent and charges the atmosphere. The vandalized portrait is described with scarred-eye detail that mirrors Miriam's own erasure anxiety, and the stone alcove protects the letter, a spatial choice that reflects preservation versus violence. Sensory detail is selective (temperature shifts, shadow patterns) and filtered through Miriam's cataloguing mind, meeting the micro-setting standard by constraining her route and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sound wave garden is vividly rendered through concrete sensory detail (crystalline paths, acoustic sculptures, bioluminescent lagoon pulsing gold/amber). The environment constrains choice: Mira must climb the spiral staircase to reach the observation platform where she can drum and trigger the garden's resonance. The auric lagoon returns in the final image, charged as the permanent vessel for Elias's composition. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the ascent and drumming sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.1)
    The container labyrinth is vividly rendered through sound-borne navigation, fluorescent markers flickering under electromagnetic interference, and maintenance passages. The geomagnetic storm supplies concrete sensory detail (green/violet aurora) and constrains Celia's usual methods (compass failure). The zodiac-marked container and the key's teeth aligning with map notches show micro-setting elements that directly enable the closure beat. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the journey.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.9)
    The cobalt dock, canal water, and boathouse shutters are vividly rendered and purposefully filtered through the guardian's professional bias (dental mirror, meticulous habits). The shutters constrain her method and charge the final image when "real stars…replace her artificial ones." Sensory detail (rain-pooled planks, "stillwater tension," scattered diamonds on water) supports pressure without catalog listing. Minor cap due to slight spatial vagueness regarding the boy's exact position relative to the guardian during the shutter sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cobalt library, mist, and magnetic grotto create vivid atmosphere and the grotto's iron foundations enable the chess-piece staging. Sensory detail is selective and mood-consistent (mist pressing "like curious ghosts," starlight via mirrors). The grotto constrains her method (magnetic properties) and charges the final image of hope as "fragile queen, ready for the board," lifting this above postcard description. Spatial choreography is clear across locations.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sublittoral fringe is vividly rendered ("dream caught between tides," "distant shimmer") and the scrimshaw's warming/glowing mechanic matters at key beats. The tidal pool and underwater descent are spatially coherent, and the whale + underwater mountain visually charge the ending. Dock-worker detail is gestural (seven years, fluid movements) without showing how that skill or setting constrains her final choice, keeping it from the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    The turbines' shadows sweeping "like hands of a broken clock" constrain Mira's temporal experience and charge the final image of endless turning. The dried bouquet is handled twice (kitchen touch, final cracking petals) and reweights the closure. The whittling figures and porch setting ground the ritual physically. Minor deduction: the neighboring farms' abandonment is told exposition rather than shown through sensory encounter, and the drone's single pass could be more causally integrated into a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt atrium and frozen lake anchor who/where/when by the second paragraph; the quartz colonnade constrains Mora's action (she must touch it, let its hum shape her syntax) and charges the closure when it glows and draws moths. Sensory detail—twilight-blue walls, humming crystals, lantern-moth hush—is filtered through Mora's aesthetic priorities and tied to her choices. Spatial choreography (atrium interior, windows, lake beyond) remains stable and vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.9)
    The glassblower's courtyard is anchored with sensory detail (warm flagstones, cooling furnaces, jasmine and moonflower) and the post-phoenix heat provides ambient pressure. The glass shards become a charged image at closure, their broken angles reflecting Mira's new philosophy. However, the courtyard itself doesn't constrain a choice—Mira could conduct this exchange anywhere. Spatial choreography is minimal but clear (trellis, furnace, kneeling). The phoenix residue colors the atmosphere but remains decorative backdrop rather than tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Laboratory of Lost Sounds is vividly specific (phonograph horns, oscilloscopes, glass tubes like organ pipes) and the golden light motif charges multiple moments. The carbide lens functions as both tool and recurring object, focusing sound in station beats and thrown spectrum in the climax. Spatial choreography (basement to bell tower ascent) tracks cleanly. The lens constraining her hearing and reappearing as a physical talisman at closure pushes this into the high 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    The observatory's cracked dome, timeless suspension, and brass telescope mount ground Elara's withdrawal and shape the community's formation. The stencil on vellum constrains her teaching ("traced its lines"), and the cot beneath the lens positions her physically in the timeless frame. Sensory details—dust motes, starlight pouring through damaged sections—charge the final beat without ornament. The observatory functions as micro-setting that enables her stance shift and charges the ending image of descent to meet the new visitor.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rain-beaded skylight is a persistent atmospheric anchor that charges the opening and returns at closure ("the rain kept falling"). The onyx cards, measuring tape, and worn Persian rug supply tactile micro-setting that Vera handles across beats. Spatial choreography is clean (cushion, door, spread). The loft's post-crash affordability subtly contextualizes Vera's position without exposition. The rain functions as ambient pressure rather than direct constraint, sufficient at this length but not indispensable to the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive's "chambers that defied geometry" and "shelves spiraling through dimensions" create vivid, purposeful disorientation that matches the forbidden-knowledge stakes. The bronze prism pagoda returns with functional reweighting (beacon, eight-sided chambers). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The crystalline sphere constrains the final ritual choice, qualifying as micro-setting that charges closure, lifting the score toward the 9+ gate threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    The blooming library is vividly particularized (glass petals, floating shelves, hope-lattices like luminous fruit) and the shadow's behavior—curling around lattices, pooling beneath a child's wish—constrains Vera's choice to intervene. The river stone anchors tactile memory (smooth, heavy, worn by water) and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The clouds and dusk filtering create consistent atmosphere, though the transformation of the library itself (old books to impossible garden) is told more than shown in the comparison footage.

    The misty workshop under stars functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the physical repair project (damaged enclosure frame) supplies concrete tools and tactile resistance that mirror Vera's emotional work. Sensory selection is purposeful—mist, starlight, owl hoots—and filtered through Vera's need for stillness. The vial's shifting amber-to-green color under starlight charges the final image when she places it on the shelf. Spatial choreography is clean (skylights, wooden surfaces, enclosure frame, shelf) and the setting's elements recur with reweighted meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tower at dawn is grounded through frosted hourglass, coffee-stained desk, stone floors, and garden passage—spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The hourglass constrains the final beat (sand begins to fall) and charges closure; the coffee rings enable the method that drives plot. Sensory detail (frosted glass, moss on north wall, ivy outside) is filtered through Mira's plant-attuned perception and serves pressure rather than catalog. Minor gap: the caverns beneath are declared but not anchored with micro-detail that would raise spatial vividness to the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    The projection booth is rendered with sharp sensory particulars—cork walls, the Simplex projector's cool metal, dust motes as snow. The booth functions as micro-setting, its intimacy and history shaping Vera's understanding of incubated stories. The film strip as object constrains her action (threading, loading) and charges the closure image. Environment directly enables the final planting gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    The aurora-lit archway is vivid and purposeful, anchoring the setting early and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective—frost, tarnished brass, shimmering trails—and filtered through Elara's perception. The archway "existed before anyone thought to mark time" creates atmospheric specificity, though the valley below remains somewhat generic. The astronomical instrument constrains Elara's action (she must find and manipulate it), meeting the micro-setting test for choice participation.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glowing dune shapes the encounter (summit as meeting point, flowers singing a fractured lullaby, their glow stabilizing the child) and the chess clock in Mira's pocket provides a tactile anchor across beats. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—phosphorescent sand, bioluminescent flowers, frequencies too high for hearing—filtered through Mira's professional lens as a freight guard. The "divergent archive" world-building (probability-paths, wave functions, quantum containers) remains abstract but consistent, creating atmospheric pressure without requiring technical exposition at this length. The final image of footprints filling with luminescent pollen offers a concrete micro-setting that charges closure, and spatial choreography (walking the ridge, climbing the crest, descending together) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mechanical rainforest is vivid and purposeful: copper beeches sing in minor keys, iron oaks groan, aluminum aspens chatter—each species' voice is specific and embodied. The bronze sequoia's access panel and damaged gear constrain Mira's choice at closure, making setting functionally essential. Sensory hierarchy reflects her sixth-sense filter (perceiving "hidden frequencies," feeling the tree's heartbeat). The only minor gap: spatial choreography of her movement through the grove could be tighter in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "veiled ridgeway," "mist," and "twilight" are vivid but remain postcard elements that do not constrain Mira's choices or supply resources affecting outcome. The star-punch and flames function as symbolic props rather than tactile objects with causal pressure. Spatial choreography is vague—guides "gather closer," the path "winds," but no body, tool, or micro-setting detail alters tactics. The shoreline of light at closure is atmospheric but does not charge the final image through concrete interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt fortress, frost-covered piano, and dust on the spiral staircase all constrain discovery and charge the atmosphere. The synesthetic cold-as-keening-note filters setting through Mira's damaged nerves effectively. The piano bench bolt functions as micro-setting, anchoring the mechanism revelation. The snow and fortress walls recur with evolving meaning from protection to prison, supporting the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    The library's timeless, multi-level architecture is vivid and constrains Mira's movements (descending chambers, corridors folding through time). The iron gall ink pellet, eternal spring, and reading alcove function as micro-setting elements that shape her tactics. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("dust settled on scrolls," "acid still eating into the vellum"). The library's temporal suspension charges the closure: stars shifting mark the end of an age and her intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The monitoring station as floating/moored object constrains Marina's physical isolation and charges the closure (she remains "moored to her task"). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: the torn atlas page's texture under fingertips, the station's sway, horizon drift. The ocean's "patient breathing" at closure integrates setting into thematic reconfiguration. Minor gap: the station's interior workspace and the mechanics of data collection remain somewhat generic; more tool-specific detail (console design, sample storage) would elevate micro-setting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned spaceport is vivid and purposeful: cold metal grating under bare feet, cathedral vastness, rusted cranes, skeletal towers. The stone circle constrains the climax—Maya must come here, sit, and listen for the hum that reframes the rebellion. Sensory details are filtered through her revolutionary lens (ships stripped for parts, fires in distant camps). The body (barefoot) and the stones function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    The volcanic hot springs are rendered with vivid, purpose-driven detail: steam, sulfurous vents, mineral-rich water, volcanic glass seal. The setting directly enables the climax—Mira must enter the deepest pool, the glass responds to sung frequency, the heat embraces her arthritic bones—demonstrating clear constraint and resource pressure. Spatial choreography is clean (bamboo grove, eastern crater, deepest pool). The reconstruction crews anchor the timeframe and social stakes without overwhelming the scene. The embryo in amber functions as both object and micro-setting focus at closure, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.1)
    The arboretum setting constrains choice throughout: salt-blasted soil demands specific patience, the cliff's edge mirrors precariousness, and the orchids' stress signals parallel Mariam's own. The photograph as micro-object charges both the opening ritual and the final image of seedlings as counter-ballast. Sensory detail is purposeful—fog, soil texture, hawk overhead—and filtered through trauma-attuned perception. The lighthouse keeper's ghost anchors the timeframe and thematic recursion (human witness vs. automated systems). Small friction: "black rocks, white foam, the endless gray-green water" at noon reads slightly postcard-like, but the detail recovers by connecting to "horizons she'd never see."

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lighthouse library is vividly rendered with "dust motes," "salt-crusted windows," and books "pressed spine-to-spine like passengers on a sinking vessel." The closing walls create spatial pressure that directly constrains Eleanor's work ("enough to let her breathe"). The lantern's "amber grief" and the table's physical staging of her portfolio ground the climactic redesign. Micro-setting elements (box, cards, thread, mirror shards) are handled tactilely and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    The wind-carved encampment, perpetual wind, and red sand anchor the scene with tactile specificity. Sensory details are filtered through Seren's tracker perspective (grooves in stone, ink tendrils, Needle's wing beats slowing). The encampment's impermanence and the nomads' fire circles constrain her investigation—she must track them elsewhere, a direct choice shaped by setting. The final image of wind erasing her presence charges the closure with environmental metaphor that avoids overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Archive's cold, the snow muffling sound, and the dormant terminal all constrain and enable Mira's choice; she has spent six months repairing infrastructure, a detail that makes the upload tactically credible. Spatial choreography is clean (Vance in doorway, Mira at terminal). The "dizzying quiet" charges the ending when "the silence had finally broken," linking setting to stakes. Selective sensory detail (breath visible, snow on skylights) supports pressure without touring.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glass dome functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: it filters harsh light, creates the "tranquil blaze," and houses the practice that defines Mira's stance. Sensory detail is purposeful (copper-tinted soil, rosewater, smoke curling from distant ruins) and the spatial choreography remains coherent. The dome's enclosure charges the final image—sanctuary against chaos—meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain choice or charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sound wave garden functions as more than backdrop: its hedges of crystallized vibrations, gravel that hums, and the fountain of "visible shape of sound" constrain Maren's approach and charge the closure scene. The rail spike as micro-setting object is handled twice (planting it, watching emotions bloom, retrieving it) and its spiral patterns reappear in the drifting constellations above, binding the ending image. Sensory detail is filtered through Maren's fisher perspective (boots crunching, frequencies bypassing ears to settle in bones). The zigzag path's impossible transformations reflect the garden's response to cosmic pressure, making setting an active participant rather than static decor.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory is vivid and purposeful: "copper dome tarnished green," "acoustics returned her words in ghostly echo," the view through clouds. The rosewood nib functions as micro-setting, handled twice and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting constrains Margaret's isolation and mirrors her father's solitude, directly supporting theme. The nib's burgundy stain recurs with reweighted meaning at closure, qualifying for the 9+ gate. Minor dock: some description ("star charts covered the walls like wallpaper chosen by a madman") leans decorative without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    The laboratory's "crystalline walls," "resonance chambers," and "fold between midnight and dawn" create a vivid, purposeful atmosphere that mirrors the thematic search for lost frequencies. The amber recurs across beats (found in the desk, tested against the chamber, pressed to Vera's chest, cooled at the end) and constrains her method: its "haunted firmware" translates baby cries, shaping her discovery and final action. Micro-setting objects (Victorian desk, answering machine tape, workbench) charge the closure by anchoring the letters spatially. Spatial choreography is clear throughout; the laboratory's acoustics and meteor-fall backdrop support tone without becoming postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.1)
    The grotto's acoustic properties and flaking tiles create purposeful texture, and mist operates as atmospheric pressure throughout. The tile flake in Mira's pocket warms and hums, constraining the mandala's center and orienting the whispers—a micro-setting element that charges the final image. Spatial choreography (curved walls, flat stone, proximity to the mandala) remains clear. The setting participates in closure when the grotto "gathers" whispers around the pattern, meeting the 9+ gate criterion of choice-constraint or closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    The plaza, shattered sky, and mosaic stepping stone constrain Kira's access to memory and supply the medium for her final act (carving into stone). The "fractured dome of ash and amber light" and "warm coldness" filter through her perception, grounding the post-fire setting. The tessera and stepping stone are handled tactilely across beats, and the carved name charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear (plaza → tower tile → stepping stone → departure). Minor: "warm coldness" as a descriptor appears twice but doesn't evolve; the paradox could charge more if it modulated with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard/maze setting is vivid and purposeful: "sacred ground" where "years had twisted back upon themselves" enables Madeline's magic. Sensory detail is filtered through synesthetic POV ("words tasting of copper and pine"). The apple tree functions as micro-setting, recurring from 1721 to present and charging the final image. Spatial choreography (woman beneath tree, ghost descending, voices drifting through leaves) remains clear. The maze's liminal hour—twilight after tours end—creates atmospheric constraint that allows the ghost to "taste the living world again," directly enabling the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    The light-painting studio functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: the faulty ground wire triggers the shock, the workbench holds the muscovite sliver, the hidden panel behind the light panel becomes the spatial hinge for discovery. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (amber light on mica, fiber-optic glow, cold seam). The studio's layered architecture mirrors the story's theme of hidden pathways and charges the final light-painting gesture. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    The coastal cave network is vividly rendered with thermal signatures, damp limestone, narrow passages, and the underground river. Sensory detail is purposeful: warm air guides Vera, the fossil pulses with heat, bioluminescent spheres float. The cave constrains movement (narrowing passages) and the fossil's location pressures her interpretation. The final image of lights floating and Vera kneeling at water's edge charges the closure. Spatial choreography remains clear across three chambers.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    The amber warehouse is vividly rendered with crystallized resin stalactites, fossilized crates, and amber-tinted darkness. Spatial choreography is clean: rope ladder descent, shelf locations, floor arrangement of buttons, jar lifted to light. The warehouse constrains action (she must catalog in darkness, press the jar to light) and charges the final image (silence settling "like a held breath"). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Marlowe's professional patience, though the closing "steady legs" and "amber darkness" risk becoming decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bluff's mist and snow patterns constrain Margaret's choices (reading codes, descending the eastern trail) and charge the opening and closing images with "silver hush." The pillbox functions as micro-setting, handled twice with shifting meaning. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Margaret's professional lens—melting patterns, rock suggestions, oxygen tubes. The sanatorium's white-on-white dissolution mirrors the thematic ambiguity. Spatial choreography is clean across the descent and the final room.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    The fog-bound river is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail (muffled creak, lap of current, ticking gutters). The yarn needle becomes micro-setting, constraining the coachman's choice at closure: he gives away an irreplaceable object. Spatial choreography is clean (bow, bench, rope, dock). The gutters function as both atmosphere and a concrete gauge that shapes the crossing's safety, directly affecting the coachman's pull and timing.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting constrains and charges throughout: empty hive boxes frame loss, the brass disc embedded in stone becomes the causal anchor, three living palms provide the physical center. The lantern glass functions as micro-setting—Serin uses it twice (tracing bee routes, revealing light bending to the disc) to enable discovery. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "air tasted different—not ash and mineral bite…but something older, sweeter." The oasis structures the final choice to stay.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    The fire escape garden, luminous harbor, condemned building across the alley, and the brass bitting gauge all constrain Marina's choices: she cannot leave tomatoes elsewhere, the moonlight reflection depends on harbor position, and the stranger's window location shapes the gesture. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("garbage and rain," "hammered silver" water, "gaunt" face). The body-as-setting (kneeling, trembling hand) charges the final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across five stories, alley, and opposite window. The harbor's rhythm ("oars dipping and rising") recurs to anchor the closure beat, and the environment evolves causally (bare branches at midnight, spring pruning planned).

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal library is vivid and purposeful: shelves ebb and flow, manuscripts arrive on mist currents, the central pool shows memory, and the stone circle hums with atomically reflective surfaces that fracture light into possibilities. The setting constrains Mira's choices—she must descend to the foundation, place the sundial at the circle's center—and the cloud currents carry the newborn creatures upward, charging the final image. Sensory detail (hum, iridescent scales, chirping frequency) is filtered through Mira's seven-hundred-year perspective. The micro-setting (brass sundial, stone circle) functions as both tool and environment, shaping the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.9)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, translucent spheres, and marble ledge are vividly rendered and spatially coherent. The post-storm light, water stillness, and evening lotus-closing provide sensory progression that reflects Mira's arc. The spheres function as micro-setting: their translucent membranes and dissolving notes directly enable and charge her final choice to release her own letter. Spatial choreography (perch to water's edge to temple steps) tracks cleanly throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.2)
    The basement setting (burnt coffee, old electronics, grimy window) is vivid and purposeful, grounding Mira's isolation. The transmitter and charts function as micro-setting elements that constrain and enable her choices. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her astrophysics lens. The quad procession visible through the window effectively stages external pressure without requiring a scene change. However, spatial choreography of the transmitter setup and the exact mechanics of welding the door remain slightly abstract; one more concrete anchor (e.g., specific tool, heat, sparks) would ground the action further.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting provides concrete pressure: the collapsed dome, the narrow three-foot passage, the belltower stairs all constrain Helena's movement and test her claustrophobia. The organ's preserved state and the hidden panel's resonance mechanism supply resources that affect outcome. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("dust motes suspended in the moonbeams," "teeth ache"). The compass point functions as micro-setting, charging the final lock mechanism and shaping the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    The flooded quarry and mist are vividly rendered and consistently present. The ribbon fragment and black water serve as anchors. However, the setting functions mostly as backdrop; it does not materially constrain Clara's choices or alter her investigative path. Spatial choreography (descent, sketching spot, ascent) is clear but passive.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    The experimental weather station is vivid and specific (reinforced glass, groaning structure, new winds, experimental sensors), with sensory details filtered through Mira's anxious attention. The copper nail functions as micro-setting, recurring with shifted weight at key beats. The station's isolation and the atmospheric chaos frame the stakes clearly. However, the analysis room and the spatial choreography within the station remain generic; the environment does not meaningfully constrain Mira's choices or tactics—she spreads pages, calls the intercom, organizes without spatial friction.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mountain pullout, scaffold wrap, and hidden trail through aspens are vivid and purposeful, guiding Margaret's descent and constraining her choice to follow the map. The wet-plate glass flake functions as micro-setting, stabilizing the pixelated map and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Margaret's musician's perception, though the cabin's sudden appearance and the aspens' "applause" veer toward convenient symbolism rather than earned environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    The circus train functions as micro-setting throughout: rusted cars, wildflowers, caboose windows casting "amber and shadow," faded paint of "elephants and acrobats" that witness the final scene. The setting constrains early (Elias claims territory with stones, pins currency to walls) and charges the closure (bills removed under the acrobats' gaze, "strange arithmetic of return"). Highway 47, the warehouse, and apartment receive functional mentions but don't constrain choice. Spatial choreography inside the caboose remains clear across all five visits. The Djibouti franc anchors a key beat of shared knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    The observatory setting supplies concrete constraints: the dome's rotation, the eyepiece, the cold air fogging breath, the tracking mechanism. The telescope and its adjustments anchor Mira's investigation and recur across beats with functional specificity. The telegram with pressed daylily acts as micro-setting, handled multiple times and charging the final image when pressed into the journal. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting drives the central action (charting stellar patterns) and charges the ending when Mira steps into "nascent light" with her tools gathered—environment constrains and enables her choices at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    The swirling orchard vortex, pale-bone tree, and frozen face supply vivid, purposeful anchors that shape Maren's tactical choices (casting the seed into churning water, stepping onto vines). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through urgency: "wind tearing at her cloak," "cold burned into her skin." The vines and the still tree at the center function as micro-setting that constrains movement and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear across the approach and central confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    The cobalt glade at dusk is vividly established with "sky turned the color of bruises and promises" and the overgrown hedges. The topiary clipping grows roots that entangle Mira's feet, but this physical constraint is more atmospheric than tactical—it does not visibly narrow her options or force a trade-off. Spatial choreography of the seven approaching and linking hands is clear, though the maze's miniature recreation and the shadow-door remain abstract. The glade charges the tone but does not materially alter the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly particular: phosphorescent moss, roots through femurs, moonstone apples fed by "mineral memory of lives long ended." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through descent and ascent. The setting constrains choice (skull-ledger patterns, root-bone arrangements reveal transaction history) and charges the final image (moss dimming as she ascends, emerging into "true darkness"). Micro-setting details like the burned card's smoke anchor POV perception throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    The quarry functions as both literal setting and conceptual pressure: "stages carved backward into the earth" and "pit where stone had been removed to reveal sky" charge the closure image with thematic weight. Micro-setting details (aluminum siding dulled by dust, condensation on the single window, pale walls pooling shadow) anchor Marcus's isolation without catalog excess. The speaker cloth operates as object-as-setting, constraining his perception ("coarse threads," "microscopic stress") and enabling his pivot from sentiment to physics. Spatial choreography is clean throughout; the walk from trailer to quarry floor tracks coherently and the morning light cue at the end pays off Val's earlier promise.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    The magnetic arbor constrains Elena's final choice: she plants the seed in "magnetic soil," and the environment's properties (sideways trees, lodestones, fruit that "glowed faintly blue") charge the closure image when she tastes the knowledge fruit. Micro-setting detail (clay tablets, soil that "sparkled with magnetic dust") is filtered through her scholarly attention. Spatial choreography remains clear across the platform, tree, and soil. The arbor functions as both setting and conceptual constraint, making it indispensable to the ending's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tidal atrium functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: "tidal waters rose higher, touching her titan-gear's feet, and she adjusted her stance with the unconscious grace of long practice." Wintersun light and water rhythm are filtered through Mira's professional attention and recur purposefully. Spatial choreography is clean (intake desk, lower shelves, glass ceiling). The setting constrains her work (water-resistant materials, tide schedule) and mirrors her fluctuating state. Sensory hierarchy reflects her priorities: hydraulic hum, saltwater lapping, light through glass. The bamboo creel and titan-gear exoskeleton are handled on the page with tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    The crystal caves are vividly rendered (mineral deposits scattering light, spiral chambers, concrete reinforcements merging with formations) and return at closure to charge the final image. The bunker's dormancy and the shells' physical presence (conch the color of sunset, nacre) ground the scene. The caves function as both setting and conceptual frame (bunkers built for ending become places of beginning), and the final image—crystals scattering fractured rainbows—directly reweights Elena's perception, constraining her choice to see beauty without terror.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The disused station is vividly rendered—ivy-swallowed platform, rusted gate, crooked bathroom door, graffiti-marked tiles—and these details ground Maren's journey without overwhelming the page. The bathroom graffiti ("Forgiveness flows downstream") constrains her next choice (following the map to the black stones), and the accordion functions as a tactile, recurring anchor that charges the final image. Sensory selection reflects Maren's chronicler's eye: she notices map references, the accordion's "broken chord," ivy "cascading like green water." The station itself pressures her return by being the last place she saw Daniel alive, making the setting inseparable from her stake.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glowing library with mist, luminescent shelves pulsing amber and gold, and books bound in "frozen tears" creates a vivid, purposeful environment. Sensory detail is filtered through the protagonist's awe and serves the mythical tone. The watch—physical object against her chest—anchors tactile presence, and the library's propagation-delay catalog system constrains her search method. The shelf that pulses crimson signals discovery, and the open-mouth symbol on the watch charges the final beat, making setting and object essential to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    The velvet observatory is grounded early (bruised-plum dome, acoustic focus, transparent apex) and the dome's acoustic properties enable the climactic act—amplifying and propagating the song. Midsummer's "longest light" and the three-day timeframe anchor temporal pressure. The ferns function as micro-setting, their roots holding memory and their presence constraining Mira's choice by offering counsel rooted in place.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    The skyborne grotto and aurora are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail filtered through Mira's professional attention. The emerald chip functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. However, the grotto's impossible physics ("tethered to nothing") and dissolving mechanics remain decorative rather than constraint-driven. Spatial choreography is clear; the setting enables the closure without forcing a tactical choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    The umbral grotto, silver birch, and cloudscape are rendered with specificity and atmospheric control. The moss-covered stones, translucent form, and "vineyard hush" dusk create a coherent liminal setting. The hairpin functions as a micro-setting object that constrains the ritual and charges the final beat. Spatial choreography (tree crown to grotto entrance to stone bed) tracks cleanly and the environment's twilight suspension mirrors the threshold state of the souls, avoiding postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lighthouse setting is vivid and purposeful: seventeen wind chimes function diagnostically, the spiral staircase frames ascent to counsel, and the glass crown creates atmosphere. The copper and bone chimes constrain the keeper's reading (doubt, grief, relief) and charge the method, lifting setting beyond postcard description. Spatial choreography is clean, and sensory detail (amber light, pooled shadows, sea stretching endlessly) reflects the keeper's professional calm. The setting does not directly constrain a pivotal choice at closure—Sera's decision is interpersonal rather than environmental—capping Q3 shy of the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    The floating rock, sycamores, meditation pool, and magnetic grotto beneath create a vivid, layered micro-setting. The pool actively constrains and shapes the key demonstration: dropping the stone into still water becomes the method of teaching. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("silver-bright under the stars," "sycamore hush"). The grotto's magnetic lines anchor the platform and later become the conceptual pool Vara must work with, charging the final image. No spatial confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bone towers constrain Vessa's existence and amplify her voice, directly shaping the ending's invitation. The canyon's sound-carved geography is specific and purposeful, filtering all perception through acoustic resonance. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout; the vertical relationship between Vessa and the traveler charges the final exchange. The arrowhead functions as micro-setting, its warmth signaling the wanderer's approach and priming its transfer.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    The icebound spire, impossible geometry, and the Garden of Modest Wonders are rendered with vivid, purposeful detail—"perpetual twilight above the clouds, where stars never fully emerged" creates atmosphere that charges the ending. The frozen flowers and folly architecture constrain Mara's final choice by embodying the theme of simplicity. Spatial choreography remains clean through the ascent and garden arrival. The "brilliant dimness" lighting functions as micro-setting that directly shapes the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    The drowned library's "impossible angles," bioluminescent algae whisper-light, and "meteor hush" silence create a distinct sensory signature filtered through Marcus's lamplighter's eye. The hotel key tag's physical interaction (fitting into the journal's spine slot) constrains the discovery beat and charges the closure when Marcus emerges with new sight. The vial's shifting pigments function as micro-setting that enables the climactic choice. Spatial choreography through the tilted passageways and the contrast between submerged dark and the surface lantern festival remain coherent and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ambered observatory deck functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (the amber begins to glow), satisfying the 9+ gate requirement. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (crystalline resin catching starlight, blue-shifting stars, amber-smooth navigation table) and filtered through Mira's professional lens as a cast lots decision maker. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the single-location scene, and the setting's preservation motif reweights at closure from protection-against-time to witness-to-reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    The observatory's cracked dome and brass fittings supply the scattered light that enables the crystallization, directly constraining the method of transformation. Spatial choreography is clean (spiral stairs, telescope, dome, floor). The body is present in embodied gestures (touching a crystallized wave, gathering forms, tracing outlines). The setting charges the final image: ancient/indifferent stars witness her private alchemy, and the descent from the heights mirrors her return to duty with altered stance.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.9)
    The sapphire viaduct is vivid and functional: crystalline arches scattering blue fire anchor the setting, and its ancient indifference frames Corin's modest effort. The bell's physical state (hairline fractures, accumulated silence) constrains his method. Dawn's progression marks ritual time and charges the final image ("full light of dawn"). The waters below respond to the bell's change, grounding the cosmic stakes in spatial choreography. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Corin's patient, mathematical perception.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ridgeway at twilight, exposed reservoir streets, and dripping ruins supply vivid, purpose-driven detail filtered through Martha's professional and personal attention. The wind chime's silence frames the opening, and the emerging town constrains her movement through ghost streets, charging the final descent. Sensory hierarchy (sight, sound, tactile drip) supports urgency. The micro-setting (boulder, ticket window, photographs spread) participates in the closure tableau, meeting the 9+ gate condition, but does not force a harder choice—she sits, reflects, then descends—so the score stays in the strong 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    The hidden orchard is vividly rendered with silver-barked trees, chiming leaves, and the kaleidoscopic waterfall, all filtered through Elara's alchemist-meets-mystic perspective. Sensory details (moss-covered stone, prismatic spray, slow-spiral blossoms) are selective and support the "ancient freshness" tone. The orchard functions as micro-setting: it's the ritual space that enables the transformation and the waterfall acts as threshold in both the opening and closure, constraining her final crossing. Spatial choreography is clean (palm on stone, kneeling beneath tree, stepping through waterfall) and the setting charges the final image when she carries "the ancient freshness of the hidden orchard" back through the waterfall into the world.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    The nocturnal arbor supplies a distinct spatial constraint (highest branch, cloud layer, starlight above) and the observation equipment becomes a tactile anchor for decision-making. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: the radio static, cold buckle against sternum, swaying arbor in dawn winds. The constraint test is met—Vera's perch and tools directly shape her ability to gather data and the partial-evacuation recommendation. Missing the 8+ band because the arbor itself never complicates a choice after setup; it remains a vivid stage rather than an active pressure once established.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.9)
    The floating dojo and churning void are vivid but remain postcard backdrops—history rewriting beneath them never constrains a choice or supplies a resource. The glass jar is handled twice (placed between them, then in the meditation circle) but does not alter tactics. Spatial choreography is clean (two figures, one jar, one platform), yet the environment pressures theme more than action.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tunnel's acoustics constrain Victor's choices—he must sing poorly to achieve maceration—and the curved walls, phantom congregation of footsteps, and vibrating pull cord ground the ritual in tactile detail. Spatial choreography is clean (mouth, floor, kneeling, climbing out). The estate and tunnel receive sustained, purpose-driven detail that charges the closure image. Micro-setting (the tunnel as crucible) functions well at this length, though the above-ground garden remains a postcard frame rather than a pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    The frozen garden constrains choice throughout: Maren's survival depends on becoming ice, the mist breathes with the story's rhythm, and the crystalline environment supplies the metaphoric vocabulary for her interior state. Spatial choreography is clean (fountain, topiaries, frozen oak). The garden's "decision" to welcome the woman functions as micro-setting pressure that enables Maren's final choice. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—frost in hair, thorn-curved nails, books whispering—filtered through Maren's feral-guardian perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ember nexus is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (volcanic breath, frost on eyelashes, warmth through knees) and directly constrains the transmutation through its confluence of streams. Spatial choreography is clean: obsidian steps, seven vents, convergence point. The contrast of heat and cold is filtered through Maren's trained endurance, making the environment an embodied challenge rather than postcard description. The crozier's physical transformation (unknitting metal, frozen bloom) is concrete and charges the final image, satisfying the micro-setting test for short work.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    Voxhaven's suspended gorge-city is vivid and purposeful: "rusted ladder," "perpetual mist," "cables and platforms" ground the vertical risk and isolation. The console's "dials frozen with corrosion" constrains her splice work, and the moonrise over the gorge's edge times the signal attempt. Sensory detail is selective—"serenely electric" atmosphere, "texture" of cosmic silence, warmth of the star fragment—filtered through Mira's professional priorities. The towers' shift from "abandoned" to "waiting" charges the final image, though spatial choreography of the platform summit could be sharper during the tuning sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    The spectral grotto is vivid and purposeful: luminescent water, impossible stars, walls reflecting every lost ferry. The setting constrains choice—Mara must reach the grotto to act, and the radio only works there. The hourglass warming in her hands and the phosphorescence rearranging into patterns charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear (ferry deck → grotto → harbor), and the sensory hierarchy (salt, static electricity, starlight) reflects Mara's focus. Minor: the grotto's mechanics (how it opens, why Mara can act when passengers can't) remain vague, but the effect supports the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    The optical illusion gallery is vividly realized through functional details: painted shadow doorways, tilted floors that stay level, mirrors angled to fragment identity. The sinew thread acts as micro-setting, constraining her path and enabling the final weaving. Sensory selection reflects urgency (walls "that existed only when observed directly"). The thread's presence in the closure image—creating "a structure within the structure"—charges the ending and demonstrates setting elements shaping the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.1)
    The benthic city is vivid and purposeful: volcanic stone, bioluminescent coral, crystal dome. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The observation chamber constrains the teaching moment and charges the closure by making starlight the medium of transformation. The chain link functions as micro-setting object, shifting meaning from anchor-to-bottom to relic. Minor: occupational detail (pilot training, GPS) stays general rather than specific, but at this length the balance serves momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    The atrium is vividly rendered—mist pooling "like spilled milk," marble that "had witnessed a century of final breaths"—and the sanatorium history seeds the thin-space premise. However, the environment supplies atmosphere without constraining a choice: Vera's method works identically anywhere, and the fog never narrows her options. The hearing aid as micro-object shapes the method but doesn't evolve or complicate the action. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("reeling into something sacred"), but spatial choreography (fountain, wheelchair, room 412) remains postcard staging rather than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.1)
    The flooded facility is vividly rendered (barnacled ceiling, corroded copper, cold pressure) and the codex's gold flecks recur with charged specificity, appearing first in the archives and again at surface to bookend the mission. The tidal window and undersea cables supply world texture but do not constrain a choice. Spatial choreography is clean (communications room, archives, laboratory, shaft ascent) and sensory detail is selective (weak-tea water, "crashing hush"). The body as micro-setting (suit, muscles burning) and the codex case both pressure Mira's endurance, lifting the score into the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    The opal observatory is vividly rendered with "curved walls that shimmered with trapped light" and becomes a pressure vessel for the ritual—snow muffles the world until "the observatory felt like the only place that existed." The porcelain shard functions as micro-setting, handled twice (palm, chest) and charging the final beats. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's solitary focus. The setting directly enables the defragmentation method (observation table, refracted light) and the final image of walking into snow completes the spatial arc.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bone towers, canyon of echoes, and copper veins are vivid and integral: the towers amplify her voice, the echoes preserve language, the veins channel the curse. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("frozen screams," "sand caught in honey"). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The white birds and their flight patterns function as micro-setting that constrains her method and charges the climax. Minor gap: the diamond's physical interaction (pressed against throat) could be more tactile to ground the metaphysical mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    The underground garden is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (luminescent herbs, moonpetals rising, bioluminescent glow) and directly constrains the final choice—Maren's decision to tend hope like the hardy plants around her charges the closure image. The flint arrowhead's warmth and the phone's static function as micro-setting elements that pressure discovery. Spatial choreography is clean (cellar, workbench, ceiling grates, climb to surface) and the garden's exhalation at the end reweights her departure with thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard, sky-bridge, and statues are vividly anchored with sensory detail (rotting fruit, frost, silvered planks, marble eyes). The environment directly constrains choice: the bridge's height gives her safety, the statues' proximity creates urgency, and the crystalline pulse network becomes a tactical resource. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (statue climbing ladder, Mira descending). The final image of apple blossoms falling upward charges the setting with thematic weight and makes the "enchanted orchard" rules integral to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt arcade constrains the meet by existing in disputed territory where drones don't patrol; its "brittle hush" and twilight neon charge the final image of Marcus walking into "the gap between moments." The bottle is handled twice (given, then pressed to chest) with evolving meaning. Spatial choreography (racing cabinet, overhead drone) remains clear. The piece demonstrates strong micro-setting integration: the arcade's persistent twilight mirrors the liminal zone Marcus inhabits, and its silent machines echo the severed communications he repairs.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    The abandoned circus train is vivid and purposeful: peeling paint, dust motes, wind bells, and the halo fragment lodged between zebras all ground Marcus's discovery. Sensory detail is filtered through his carpenter's eye (cracked paint, oak horses, bronze vibrations). The train constrains his choice—he stays to repair the horses—and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear across cars. The setting functions as both material constraint and symbolic container, meeting the 9+ eligibility test.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.1)
    The scientific poetry library is vividly particular (wax cylinders, punch cards, magnetic tape, hyperbolic-shelf curves), and the scarf's texture (machine oil, lavender, frayed edges) becomes a tactile anchor. The surreal geometry constrains Eleanor's path and charges the final image when the scarf reveals itself as map. Sensory selection (voices murmuring equations, frequencies felt in teeth) supports the accumulative design. However, the patrons remain postcard figures—graduate student, elderly man, sleeping teenager—whose presence pressures the tone more than Eleanor's tactical choices, keeping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archipelago's "seventeen islands" and "wind carrying sounds across impossible distances" establish atmosphere early, though these details don't constrain choices. The palette itself functions as micro-setting, its "empty wells" and light-scattering properties directly enabling the climactic photograph. The rooftop and fog are purposefully deployed at the key moment. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting charges the final image effectively but doesn't pressure tactics in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    The nexus is vividly anchored: "shadowed nexus under starlight," "standing stones," "symbols shifted." The first star's beam striking the central stone constrains Mira's approach, guiding her to the lock mechanism. The lock of hair and its ribbon texture ground her focus when the nexus tries to disorient with alternate futures. Micro-setting (the stone, the ribbon, the star's beam) all pressure choices and charge the closure when the ribbon turns silver, shot through with starlight.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    The sunken greenhouse—salt-crusted glass, petrified trees, skeletal ship hulls—constrains Elara's search to this exact location and charges the closure (the fairy ring vanishes after fulfilling its purpose). Micro-setting details (the jar beneath the mushroom, the specific alignment of void and ring's northern edge) drive the detection action. Sensory selection is purposeful: salt-and-rust smell, cold damp, faint glow of fungi anchor the accumulative pressure without catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    The forgotten library is vividly rendered through selective detail (marble floors, grimy window, dust-clogged halls) and the paperweight constrains Mira's reflective moment, anchoring memory to present tactile experience. The afternoon light slanting through the window and caught shadow create atmospheric specificity that supports the exile/reflection theme. The setting does not, however, meaningfully constrain the peak choice—the annotation could occur in any archivist workspace—preventing entry to the 8+ band. Spatial choreography (Thessaly emerging from shelves, teacup placement) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.6)
    The verdant parapet, waterfall dissolving into mist, and perpetual twilight create a vivid threshold space. The garden's trees drawing sustenance from different realms (moonlight from eternal night, volcanic warmth) provide specific constraints that shape Marek's pruning choices. The final image of the waterfall scattering rainbows through the grandmother's tree charges the closure, and the pruning blade as recurring tool anchors the work throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prism sanctuary functions spatially: starlight fractures through crystalline walls, and the geometry shifts when Mira shares her secret, grounding the metaphysical exchange in concrete setting pressure. The tapestry needle and the net are handled objects that constrain her micro-movements. Minor limitation: the sanctuary's mechanics (how it accumulates silence, why prisms store confessions) remain decorative rather than tactically essential—Mira's work would proceed similarly in any isolated space. The final image (needle catching dawn sunlight) charges the ending but doesn't depend on prism-specific properties.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rain-scoured vault, henge stones, and laptop setup provide tactile grounding. The torn map on the far wall—dividing known from unknown—constrains Elena's interpretive frame and charges the final image when the henge stones "cast shadows that seemed... to reach toward her like hands." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: damp stone chill, mold-scented crate, blue laptop glow, rain drumming. The vault's three-hundred-year erosion and the medieval painter's blank territories function as micro-setting that pressures her decision to unseal or preserve.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sunken library is vividly particular—anemones as "displaced librarians," coral-encrusted shelves, mahogany preserved by depth. Sensory detail is filtered through Eleanor's professional eye (noting chemistry, blueprints) and modulates with her emotional state. The snow globe and captain's desk constrain her choices by providing the artifact and text that reshape her understanding, charging the final image. The submersible's ascent mirrors her internal shift, making the environment integral to closure rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.1)
    The misty courtyard above cloudline is vividly anchored with sensory specifics (cold brass, eternal mist, lightning/thunder). The flower press bolt plate constrains Mira's final choice—she presses it to her heart as an anchor before singing, linking artifact to action. The graffiti-scattered old world below provides purposeful contrast. Spatial choreography (courtyard, rope ladders, warehouse walls) tracks cleanly. The monastery stones functioning as a canvas for the ghost's mural charges the setting, though occupation-level detail (balladeer craft) remains thin.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    The icebound spire, elevator mechanics, crystalline jars, and amber-lens goggles create a vivid, internally consistent world. Sensory details—frosted windows, brass gears clicking, ice walls casting rainbows through the goggles—are filtered through Mira's attention and serve the mood. The goggles function as both tool and constraint, required to decode the diary, and the observatory's jars directly enable the closure action. Spatial choreography is clear (ten floors, vertical ascent, final room layout), and the frozen setting mirrors the theme of preserved-versus-released emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sky gondola functions as micro-setting that constrains all action to observation and notation within a drifting vessel. The brass telescope appears in multiple beats, physically handled and weighted with inheritance. Atmospheric details (frost-rimmed window, barometer ticking downward, nacreous shimmer) are filtered through Elena's professional expertise and current emotional state. The setting charges the final image: her suspended position becomes the condition for her new work, making "empty spaces" both literal environment and conceptual frame.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Great Oak library is vividly rendered: "hollowed trunk," "shelves of crumbling manuscripts," "chambers where the tree's heartwood had been carved with such precision that starlight filtered through in calculated constellations." Spatial choreography tracks her movement from outer trunk to hidden hollow. The setting constrains her search (hidden panel, secret book safe carved to resemble bark) and charges the final image (condemned oak in heightened stillness). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through her tactile bias.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    The antique airship is vividly rendered (brass hull, observation windows, creaking language) and constrains Elara's situation—stranded with no descent. The hopscotch board and phrasebook are tactile, recurring objects that gate her discovery. Starling murmurations create atmospheric pressure and mirror her interpretive work. Spatial choreography is clean across decks and the Tessellated Marshlands below. The luminance rising from mist charges the final movement. Minor gap: the playroom's prior use and the ship's explorer history receive summary rather than sensory grounding, but the micro-setting (board, lantern, charts) effectively narrows focus.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.1)
    The frozen library above clouds is vivid and specific, with ice-veined doors, frost-covered shelves, and a hall where "the cold grew teeth." The clockmaker's gear assortment functions as micro-setting, constraining Mira's final choice: she must arrange gears "not as they had been but as they needed to be." The vial's physical presence (glass stopper, wax seal) anchors the pivotal decision. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (seventh floor, lectern in corner, mirrors surrounding), though the clouds "parting around her" in descent lacks concrete anchoring of how she moves through them.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    The floating rock arches, silver-barked trees, and fog establish a vivid SF setting with economy. The butterfly garden watering bell is handled on the page (Sola carries it, rings it, moths descend) and constrains agricultural rhythm, meeting the micro-setting standard. Spatial choreography is clean across the orchard grove and Mourner's Bridge. Minor slip: "twin suns crested the horizon" arrives late (final third) without earlier cues, creating a small orientation gap.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse, obsidian clock, and "pane of hush" anchor the piece with vivid, purpose-driven detail. The glass walls transforming into a window and the beam igniting inward constrain and charge the closure image directly. Spatial choreography remains clear (spiral stairs, lantern room, console). Sensory selection is strong: "amber and bruise," "dust on her cheeks," "hollow eye socket now somehow full of stars." The timeframe "dusk" and "liminal hours" integrate tightly with the threshold concept, and the broken puppet head functions as both memory anchor and ritual object.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, and frost create immediate spatial and temporal pressure. The nut's luminescent marks function as micro-setting that constrains choice and enables the rescue. Sensory details (copper warnings, green glow, ice crystals forming) are purposeful and filtered through urgency. The final valley description "graceless beauty, all sharp angles and honest ugliness" charges the ending image. Minor gap: the orchard itself remains abstract; we never see or feel the twisted hazel grove that anchors Maren's burden.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.1)
    The braided ravine is vividly rendered with functional detail: foam patterns traced for hours, three streams converging and separating, dark water and white lines in fractal geometries. The chrysalis structure's "architecture" directly informs the polymer design, making the object constrain her professional choice. The laboratory setting in the second half remains generic, but the ravine micro-setting charges both the insight and the final return, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment constrain choice.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glass orchard library is vividly rendered and integrated: transparent floors reveal swirling clouds, crystallized apple branches hold wares, and the architecture's "integrated fragmentation" philosophy mirrors theme. Micro-setting (the slates, moonlight bottle, Vera's counter) constrains her preparation ritual and the child's approach. The environment charges the final image when "inside the glass orchard library, something new had taken root" reweights the fragile, transparent space as a site of origin. Sensory selection is purposeful (cream-dissolving clouds, pearl-mercury moonlight) and filtered through Vera's vendor focus, though spatial choreography of the child's ascent and entry could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    The fortress courtyard's drainage channels and mud-softened dunes guide her path; tidal pools function as a puzzle that constrains access. The coral pavilion's impossible ice and preserved formations charge the climax through tactile interaction. "Sturdy brittle" light appears once as vivid but doesn't recur or constrain choice. Spatial choreography remains clear (courtyard → eastern gate → dunes → descent → cavern), and the chef's knife strapped to her thigh is noted early but never returns, creating minor setup debt.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.1)
    The astronomical clock tower supplies vivid, specific anchors—brass planets, oak table, glass dome—and the cuckoo clock weight functions as a recurring tactile object. The harbor geography and silo distances create clear spatial stakes. However, the setting does not constrain a choice at closure; it provides atmosphere and metaphor but does not alter Elena's tactics or charge the final image with environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.1)
    The moonlit canyon is vividly rendered with sensory specifics—calcified walls, sediment layers, mineral deposits—and the broken mirror's refracted light creates a charged visual motif. The setting supplies both atmosphere and conceptual scaffolding (earth as archive, quartz holding vibrations), and the canyon's ancient silence frames Vera's task. However, the environment functions more as backdrop than constraint; no spatial detail or physical property forces a tactical choice or materially alters the outcome. The mirror's placement "at the precise angle" and the canyon's resonance remain decorative rather than pressure-generating.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.1)
    The serpentine grotto is vividly anchored with mist, wet stone, and prismatic shadows; the seventeen-minute timer and gravity inversion create concrete environmental pressure. The chamber's ceiling carvings constrain the revelation and charge the final image when Elara leaves her own mark in the hollow. Sensory detail (luminescent mist, phosphorescent ink) is selective and POV-filtered through her prism-minded perception. Spatial choreography remains clear across descent, chamber center, and emergence. The grotto itself becomes a tool that enables the climax, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment/object constrain choice or charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.1)
    The siskin alder grove anchors early and the ancient sculpture constrains her breakthrough. The porcelain insulator functions as both object and conceptual anchor (conducting without sound). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (stress cracks traced by fingertips, vibrations through bone). The grove returns at closure when roots "drink the vibrations," charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    The magnetic nexus is vivid and purposeful: iron-rich boulders, spinning compass needles, electromagnetic hum, and the basalt worry stone all anchor the scene with sensory specificity. The setting constrains her choice to wait and document through the night, and the magnetic field's pulse acknowledges her presence at closure. Spatial choreography is clean—flat stone, boulders as sentinels, moon rising east. The worry stone functions as micro-setting, warming in her grip and charging the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint and closure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    The workshop "hunched beneath the open sky like a creature waiting to be understood" and "shadows" and "workbench" anchor the scene early. The tuning forks, though tools, shape Vera's method and constrain her approach (she cannot force the clasp). The imminent fireworks create atmospheric pressure and return at closure to contrast shattering sound against cataloged silence. Sensory detail is selective—"dusty with abandoned projects," "tarnished bronze," "the silence of the stars, ancient and indifferent"—and filtered through Vera's cataloging mission. The clasp warming "beneath her fingertips" integrates body and object, charging the final image when she pockets it "against her heart."

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    Canopica is vividly realized: platforms spiraling like frozen dancers, rope bridges, the corpse flower at the center. Sensory detail is POV-filtered (resin, smoke, decay-wrapped sweetness). The village's flower-like geometry discovered through her doodles charges the middle. The seed—dark and heavy as a promise—functions as micro-setting that will constrain future choices. Spatial choreography is clean. The treetop setting pressures her philosophy of motion versus stillness, shaping the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard planet's floating arches, inverted gravity, and silver grove are vivid and purposeful. The "whirling silence" before inversion and the detail of artifacts littered in roots ground the final beat. The environment constrains Maren's navigation (razor-sharp rock, water currents) and charges the closure image (seed planted among tokens). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    The container labyrinth is vivid and constrains action throughout: "metal walls rose seven stories high," wind funnels through "Row J and Stack 14," containers "groaned around her, metal contracting." Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Mira's investigator lens. The anemometer functions as both tool and recurring anchor, appearing in multiple beats. The environment directly shapes her work and the final image: "metal canyons" echo her father's voice, charging the closure. The port's "respiratory system" metaphor integrates setting into the story's conceptual logic.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ice cavern is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: frozen stairs, crystallizing breath, prismed light, the bell suspended in sculpted hush. The aurora overhead functions as both atmosphere and a tool that constrains Meren's method. The cavern's acoustic emptiness and the bell's position pressure her approach. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the setting charges the final image by providing the light-source for her conducting.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Thunder-echo Range and Keeper's Hollow are rendered with purposeful specificity: stone worn smooth by generations, air tasting of copper and rain, walls that absorb sound like deep water. The driftwood markers function as both micro-setting object and navigational constraint, anchoring the weaving's risk. The hollow's "avalanchingly quiet" atmosphere pressures Mira's perception and primes the flute's vibratory effect. Spatial choreography remains clear (path junction, altar center, long walk down), and the setting's silence shifts meaning at closure—from absence to potential—charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.2)
    The topaz plateau, vanishing stars, and letterpress create a vivid, constraint-rich micro-setting. The halo fragment's warmth and the press's mechanical groan anchor tactile choices. Setting charges the final image (topaz floor blazing, stars flickering) and the timeframe pressure (dissolving stars) subtly tightens urgency. Spatial choreography remains clear across beats, and sensory detail is filtered through Mira's mathematical lens without becoming a catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway supplies vivid sensory anchors (green/violet light, frost-rimed path, electromagnetic dance) filtered through Maren's professional attention. The pendant's crystalline wings vibrating with the aurora constrain her method and charge the final glow, meeting the micro-setting gate. Spatial choreography remains clear across the ridgeway platform and monastery circuit. However, the seven monasteries are summarized rather than individually textured, and the Temple of the Long Dawn is named but not reached on the page, limiting immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    The quartz arbor, mist, frost patterns, and prism create a cohesive micro-setting that constrains perception and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "mist curled between the quartz columns like breath held too long," frost as emotional archaeology. The prism functions as both tool and setting anchor, refracting meaning at the closure beat. Spatial choreography is clean (arbor, car, movement between). The environment actively shapes Elara's communion rather than serving as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    The forgotten orchard and bamboo forest are vivid and purposeful: "green spears piercing through the rotting branches" and "scattered diamonds of light" create a specific atmosphere. The moss-covered ground and gnarled apple trees provide tactile anchors for the ritual. The setting constrains choice—Mei must travel to this particular place, arrange pieces on the ground, and the orchard itself "remembers" as the ritual progresses. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The environment charges the final image when "a single thread of golden light hung in the air where she had been."

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    The floating stone arches, bioluminescent Chamber of Roots, and core-heat forge create a vivid micro-setting that constrains Oren's choices: he must descend to find the cure, channel geothermal energy for his new forge. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—azure light, petrified wood, the silk's hum. The orchard blight and abandoned mine shafts pressure tactics and the final image of blue flames charges closure. Spatial choreography in the descent and chamber encounter remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.1)
    The spaceport repair bay is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail (frozen drones, lipstick-stained cups, magnetic coupling unit) that anchors the scene and guides Mira's sensory-mapping investigation. The setting constrains her search (she must touch surfaces to read them) and the coupling unit becomes the literal portal for the vision. Spatial choreography is clean. The bay charges the closure by embodying "forgotten ambitions" that mirror the mother's hidden sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lantern room constrains choice through its abandonment (no keeper to receive the letter) and charges the final image (sea glass on the lamp's base as "remembered"). Sensory detail is filtered through Maren's professional attention (rust, bird's nest, dust motes as underwater creatures). The cairn—a micro-setting object—matters causally: she reads it, then rebuilds it with new meaning. Deduction: the "haunted" quality remains atmospheric rather than spatially specific, and the room's layout is vague during the key cairn interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    The emerald lighthouse and jade-green walls are vivid and recur purposefully. The glass lantern wick and lens mechanism anchor key beats, and the final rain ties setting to action. Sensory detail (stars pressing, dormant electricity humming) is selective and voice-filtered. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the ascent and lamp-room sequence, and the setting constrains the Herald's nightly task, grounding the otherworldly premise in tactile ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    The floating tea house, valley mist, and crystalline light formations create vivid, purposeful atmosphere that charges the ending image. The morpho wing as micro-setting object constrains the confession beat (light reaches Senna's hands, wing explodes into blue fire, words escape). Spatial choreography is clean—window, eastern light, floor progression—and the valley's depth and ancient witness quality recur to frame Senna's final commitment. Minor: the indigo-stained hands anchor the dye master's role efficiently but do not return to shape later action.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tower study—dust, cracked window, storm-washed grove—constrains the repair to moonlight and grounds the sextant work spatially. The labyrinth's trees function as micro-setting that charges the final image: specific trees (oak, willow, cypress) carry differentiated grief-loads. The sextant vibration and morning light warming her face are purposeful sensory anchors at closure. The storm itself remains atmospheric rather than choice-shaping, preventing the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    The greenhouse and mica windows are vividly established with purposeful detail (translucent panes, phosphorescent glow, endless night). The mica windows constrain Elara's tactics—she uses them as memory vessels and light conduits—and charge the final image when they become transmission thresholds. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The "mirror world" setting remains somewhat abstract; grounding one additional physical constraint (temperature, air quality, something tactile) would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.1)
    The library's impossible architecture and disguised entrance create vivid atmosphere. The leather-bound book and crumpled invitation are handled as objects that constrain Miriam's understanding. However, the midnight timeframe and towering shelves function more as backdrop than as elements that shape her choice. The setting charges the final image (utility door, humming laundromat) with modest resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tea house and overgrown courtyard are vividly anchored with sensory detail (frost on wild roses, spider's web, cold soil) that reflects Mei's priorities. The setting constrains her choices (the courtyard as hidden garden site) and charges the final image (planting near the eastern wall). Spatial choreography is clear, and the recurring tea house frames the action purposefully. The spider's web at opening and close functions as micro-setting that mirrors her patient, unobserved work and reweights the ending without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.1)
    The frozen library, cloud sea, and crystalline architecture constrain Elara's actions throughout: she cannot save all vows due to the collapsing star, the measurement apparatus guides her search, and the magic lantern slide's singularity forces her final choice. Sensory detail (frost-rimed catalog, breath forming snow, quartz chiming) remains selective and purposeful. The micro-object (magic lantern slide) charges the final image and constrains the central choice, meeting the 9+ gate test for setting participation.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    The pirate market beneath the rotting pier is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail—lanterns, eel tanks, copper cylinders—that grounds the action without catalog drift. Spatial choreography remains clear through Eliza's movement and the final beat reuses the pier setting to charge her emergence at dawn. The watch fob functions as micro-setting, constraining her grip and priming the interception moment. Minor slip: the market's "comfortable unease" is asserted more than shown through environmental pressure on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lavender bluff, aurora, and forest setting are vivid and purposeful, filtered through Vera's synesthetic perception (metallic sweetness, chlorophyll sharp as ambition). The tin compass ring's empty center functions as both object and micro-setting, used twice (framing her grandmother's promise, then revealing the converging figures) and charged at the end when she tastes tomorrow through it. Spatial choreography is clear (below/above, bluff path, canopy/understory), and the setting's magnetic fluctuations and voting forest constrain Vera's understanding. The environment charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.1)
    The subterranean crystal cave with its "curtains of translucent amethyst" and "auroral glow" is vividly rendered and constrains Maren's choice—the hidden chamber holds the grandmother's secret, and the violet light witnesses the climactic drawing session. Spatial choreography is clear (main tour path → narrow passage → corner pillar → canvas). The crystals function as both witness and blessing, charging the closure image when they "pulse with approval."

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    The greenhouse domes, toxic sky, sulfurous air, and magnetic-tape Archive create a vivid, specific world. The listening room floorboards and the six-hour descent through rust-smelling tunnels ground the journey in tactile detail. The Archive itself—"a cathedral of magnetic tape"—constrains Mei Lin's final choice by providing the closure stage and the tools (playback station) she needs. The gilding tools she brings "without knowing why" create a purposeful setup-payoff that charges the ending. Sensory hierarchy is consistent, filtering through Mei Lin's professional and personal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Whispering Bluff plateau is signaled early with vivid, voice-filtered detail ("impossible plateau suspended above the cloud sea"), and altitude affects Maren's hands ("steady despite the altitude"). The iceberg fragment functions as micro-setting: it weeps, glows, and its crystalline structure filters sound, directly enabling the closure beat when the bell rings. The cloud-parting at the end charges the final image, making the setting's transformation legible. Spatial choreography (monastery gate, bell tower throat, descent path) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glass dome and desert roses constrain choice throughout: the dome's magnetic sensors trigger her decision, the irrigation system enables the controlled burn, and the oldest rose receives the buried grain. Micro-setting (the miniaturizer device, the wooden box, the sandy paths) recurs with purpose. The magnetic shift and auroras function as both atmospheric pressure and temporal frame. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("fleshy stems," "heat distortion," "blue flame"). The environment charges the final image: "glass and sand and impossible flowers, a world built to contain life in a place where nothing should grow."

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    The courtyard is anchored with sensory detail (potted citrus, weathered benches, cobblestones, tarnished clasp) and constrains the meeting by serving as the site of accumulated stories and the locked mailbox. Dawn's "suspended moment when colors bleed from gray to gold" and the strengthening light track emotional progression. The locket's hidden catch—a physical puzzle that shapes the revelation—elevates the object-as-setting function. Micro-setting (the mailbox, the locket clasp) drives both mystery and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sunken laboratory is vivid and purposeful: "green-gray light," "porthole windows caked with decades of marine growth," steel tables and sealed journal cases create tactile specificity. The setting constrains Marina's access and charges the closure image of rising "toward the light" with the hangman's dice. Sensory detail is filtered through Marina's professional lens (cryptographer's focus on the journal). Minor slip: spatial choreography during the dance sequence remains abstract rather than grounded in the lab's physical layout.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    The salt crystal chamber is vividly rendered with tactile detail (walls glittering white, silence gleaming like polished glass, fluctuating gravity lifting hair and buckling knees) and constrains Mira's movement in the key beat. The setting's gravity pockets and luminescence charge the closure scene when the sphere cracks open. Micro-setting details (cramped quarters, harbor lanterns, lighthouse panel) are economical and purposeful. Minor slip: the whale carcass and dock-side world are established early but do not evolve or constrain later action; they serve as backdrop rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    The nocturnal haven, willows, brook, and origami wing are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (the stream "moved without sound," the wing "caught moonlight and seemed almost to breathe"). Spatial choreography is clean throughout the ritual sequence. The origami wing qualifies as a micro-setting element that constrains the ritual—Mira places it on water, tracks its journey, retrieves it—thereby charging the final image with tactile presence and fulfilling the 9+ gate for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.9)
    The rooftop garden and building itself function as active setting, constraining choices (the narrator must learn to "read" architecture) and charging the closure (tending roses, waiting for students). Sensory details are purposeful: "silver hair catching starlight," "brass surface warm despite autumn chill," "old bones settling." Spatial choreography is clean across the fire escape, rooftop, and implied apartment positions. The desk seal operates as micro-setting object that enables the teaching transfer.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    The velvet garden is vividly rendered (purple flowers, hedge maze, Archive towers, starlight) and its interstitial status—existing "between official maps" where "resonance structures grew wild"—directly enables Mirabel's plan. The garden constrains her choice to this specific twilight window when "frequencies aligned." However, much of the setting detail (flowers swaying without wind, orange sky) operates as atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure. The body and the shell itself function as micro-setting that charges the closure, elevating the score despite the postcard-descriptive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, and stalactites are vividly rendered and serve atmospheric purpose, but they do not constrain Veren's choice in a material way—he could complete the forgery in any setting. The heritage rose thorn and the key function more as symbolic anchors than as environmental pressures. Sensory detail is selective and mood-appropriate ("pearl twilight," "faint scent of heritage roses"), and the spatial anchors remain stable throughout, meeting baseline needs without elevating to the threshold where setting itself alters tactics or charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.1)
    The serpentine nexus, seven ravines, and phosphorescent moss create vivid spatial grounding. The whispering seashell functions as micro-setting, warming in her palm and delivering her mother's voice at the crucial moment—constraining her choice by providing the knowledge that changes everything. Sensory detail is purposeful (stars pulsing, canyon groaning) and filtered through Mira's perceptual priorities. The setting charges the final image: the nexus groans with hunger as she walks away, making her renunciation tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glacier shrine is vivid and purposeful: candle-lit ice serves as the literal "window of connection," and the cold is both atmospheric and functional (thins the veil, embodies sacred patience). Spatial choreography is clear—Mira kneels, places the snow globe, closes her eyes, opens them as candles burn low, then leaves. The melted snow globe itself becomes micro-setting, warm "as if Elise's hands still cradled it," and that warmth charges the final departure. The setting constrains choice (ice shrine enables ghost contact) and recurs in the closure image (candles gutter, shrine returns to silence), meeting the 9+ test for environment shaping tactics and the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.1)
    The whispering parapet is vividly realized through concrete sensory detail (gargoyles dripping in rhythm, wind through crenellations) and the setting constrains action—Mirelle must climb to observe, the rain's aftermath creates visible air currents. The bamboo whisk functions as micro-setting, its silhouette revealing invisible currents and enabling the firefly interaction. The final rain returning "softly" as she descends charges the closure image with purposeful atmosphere, and the coastal village context grounds her occupation without excess exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    The orchard setting is vivid and purposeful: mutated apples with "colors that existed nowhere in nature," the Geiger counter screaming then falling silent at the stillpoint threshold, the dust storm parting as she leaves. The radioactive wasteland pressures Maya's movements (respirator, dust storms as time constraints) and the diamond's burial beneath the largest tree provides spatial anchoring for the climax. The stillpoint itself—an absence of background radiation felt "in her bones"—functions as micro-setting that validates the premise and charges the final image of glowing fruit.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory setting constrains choice effectively: elevation creates the signal advantage and physical separation that enables her refusal of direct engagement. The cobalt portico returns twice with shifted meaning (reflection/inscription, then lightning illumination during the climactic broadcast), charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("cloud sea," "storm howled its approval or indifference"). Spatial choreography stays clear throughout. Minor gap: the radio array's physical components and Miriam's interaction with controls remain somewhat abstract; more tactile detail during transmission would strengthen micro-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    The feral loft beneath the dunes is vivid and specific, with sensory detail filtered through Marcus's POV ("smell of salt and rotting kelp"). The mason jars function as micro-setting, recurring throughout and charging the final image when he releases a captured sound. The beach environment subtly constrains action (climbing through gaps, leaving footprints the tide will erase) and supports the thematic register of transience.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.1)
    The drift-ice marina and ice-chapel are vividly rendered with purpose-driven detail: "frozen pontoons," "mournful whales," "translucent walls." The setting constrains Vera's choices (limited time before dark, physical journey through ice) and charges the final image (the azure coat left behind). The "fleshly ethereal" tone is integrated into sensory description ("air itself seemed to thicken," "frozen air"). Minor issue: occupational detail (lighthouse engineer) is declared but never shapes a tactical choice; her professional skill set doesn't visibly inform her approach to the bell or the vibrational task.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    Basalt columns, frozen lake, ice-sheathed viaduct, and the brass-and-bone instruments anchor the world with vivid specificity. The viaduct's iron rails concentrate magnetic forces, directly enabling Mira's work and thus constraining her tactics. Sensory detail (ice groaning, breath pluming, stars reflecting) filters through Mira's watchful attention. The micro-setting of instruments and the recurring frozen lake charge the final image of flow beneath ice.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    The subway tunnel setting is vivid and functional: water seepage, rusted pipes, vibrations from passing trains all ground the scene physically. The Underground Railroad lantern with its "distinctive ventilation holes" and "hand-forged handle" provides historical weight that directly constrains Margaret's next move. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (alcove, deeper storage area, maintenance ladder to surface). The rain bookending the drought creates atmospheric coherence, though the metaphoric weight ("city itself was weeping") occasionally overstates.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    The music box shop is rendered with purposeful sensory detail ("vibrant hush," "dust motes...amber light," "magnifying spectacles") that supports tone. The clockwork heart functions as micro-setting, constraining Ruth's diagnosis and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (counter, workbench, window). The storm-cloud shift outside provides environmental pressure that mirrors internal state and charges closure, though the metaphor edges toward overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    The acid sea, brass hull, and observation dome anchor setting early and constrain choice (launch port, caustic air). The kaleidoscope is a micro-setting object that charges the final image by teaching Zephyr to see probability. Sensory detail (hissing hull, corrosive mist) is selective and voice-filtered. The workshop's mechanical heartbeat and gears contribute atmosphere but do not alter tactics at closure, keeping this below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    The missile silo setting is vivid and purposeful—failing drives playing forgotten songs create atmosphere and reinforce the deletion theme. The restricted vault and geolocation data constrain Helena's investigation and force tactical choices (lying to Security). The Artemis-7 patch functions as both motif and clue, charging the final image when Helena pockets it. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Helena's archival focus, though the Nevada night at the end could use one concrete anchor beyond "stars...like distant servers."

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lighthouse orchard on a cliff above shifting ice floes is vivid and particular ("gnarled apple trees dusted with salt spray," "ice groaned and rearranged itself"). The mirrors as salvage from a drowned village root the setting in loss and transformation. The fragment warms against her hip, providing tactile specificity that anchors the present. The ice floes and orchard recur in the final image, charging the closure moment, meeting the 9+ gate criterion for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("groaned," "rising and falling," "cathedral of blue ice") and filters through Maren's altered perception. The ice constrains the volunteers' work (reading water, timing retrievals) and the parasol tip is handled across beats, charging the final pocket-touch. The micro-setting (body, object, environment) all contribute to the ending image. Minor: occupational detail (trawling mechanics) remains generic when a sharper procedural constraint could have tightened a middle choice.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    The amber pavilion's sepia light constrains perception and charges the final image, creating a memory-in-the-making atmosphere that pressures both characters toward confession. Sensory detail is selective (copper light, buzzing streetlights, falling leaves) and filtered through Marcus's fatalistic POV. The vineyard's graft metaphor ("mismatched unions") is purposeful but borders on overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean (table between them, photograph and fragment as physical anchors), and the autumn setting reinforces the theme of decline and harvest without becoming a postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.1)
    The murmuring pavilion is vividly rendered (thousand silk panels, ancestors' final breaths woven in) and the kinetic parapet beneath the dunes supplies a concrete infrastructure that enables the climactic move. Spatial choreography is clear across pavilion, dunes, and underground engine room. However, the setting functions more as backdrop than constraint—the line walker encounters no access difficulty, no resistance from the machinery, no environmental cost that alters her tactics. The micro-setting (obsidian mask, peripheral awareness) charges her perception but does not force a choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lavender field and rusted factory ruins anchor every major beat and charge the final image (vines climbing, lavender swaying as backdrop). The dove gray map case is handled across multiple scenes, signaling both archive and shrine. Spatial choreography is clear (field, factory, village). The setting constrains choices—Viktor and Mrs. Castellan meet "among the lavender"—and the vines' patient siege mirrors collective recovery. Micro-setting (window-frame pavilion) adds texture without bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    The library setting is vivid and purposeful: towering shelves, arched windows, golden dawn light, dusty floor, and the salvaged crystal all anchor Elara's spatial and emotional world. The crystal functions as a micro-setting object, constraining her methodology (she speaks words into it, records variations) and charging the final image when it scatters light across her notebooks. Sensory detail is selective—pale gray light, the crash of the chandelier, the crystal's fractured voice—and filtered through Elara's scholarly POV. The setting subtly mirrors her suspended state (the library "held its breath") without overt symbolism, and the dawn progression tracks causally across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    The fog sculpture garden is vivid and purposeful: shifting fog caught in invisible nets, driftwood as salt-bleached markers, flat stone at center. The environment constrains Marcus's search and supplies the material (driftwood, stone) for his method. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through his urgency. The fog lifting at the end charges the closure by making the sculptures dissolve into ordinary mist, mirroring his forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lunar observatory, pale tree, and courtyard are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (silver leaves, dust from beams, starlight on domes). The spinning clock hand functions as micro-setting object that constrains and charges the closure beat when it finally stills. Spatial choreography is clean across chambers. The tree's leaf directly enables the method that resolves the clock, elevating setting from backdrop to causal participant.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    The radiant hospice "suspended above the clouds" is vivid and purposeful, filtering perception through light and openness that mirrors the liminal space between life and death. The cracked guitar, the worktable, and the gold-tinted adhesive constrain the kintsugi action and charge the final image of the golden-veined record catching light. Spatial choreography (window, worktable, doorway) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating isle, twilight clouds, and brass dome create a vivid sensory frame anchored early. The observatory's telescopes "pointed not at stars, but at the spaces between them" is a strong, specific detail that supports the concept. However, the environment remains largely decorative after the opening; spatial choreography (where the key slot is, how the automaton rises, Mira's position relative to the telescope) is vague during the critical middle beats. The setting does not constrain her choices or supply obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The hedge maze and secret garden constrain Eleanor's path and charge the closure through their role as threshold spaces where certainty ends. The apple tree and grave marker anchor the scene spatially; the hollow bones function as micro-setting that reweights her understanding. Sensory detail (jasmine, honey-sweet scent, moonlight through femur) is selective and purposeful. The garden as "secret space where certainty ended" recurs at closure, and the body (bare hands digging) engages the environment tactilely, meeting the 9+ threshold of constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    The serpentine grotto's mist and acoustics shape the work—amplifying movements, catching light, enabling the cold-glow effect that distinguishes this from fire. The grotto's curved ledge is the repeated work surface, and the mist follows her out in the final image, charging closure. Spatial choreography is clear (ledge, entrance, coastal path implied). The gem-polishing tools and sea glass function as micro-setting elements that constrain her method and charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    The data-center-turned-garden is vividly particular (cooling towers wrapped in ferns, raised floor tiles channeling water, server racks blooming) and constrains the sisters' confrontation—the "honeyed hush" absorbs their words, the reclaimed space models forgiveness. The moss pattern (drip lines from melting icicles) charges the final image of growth following invisible patterns. Micro-setting (body, pendant, bench of intertwined ferns) all serve the closure. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    The feral nexus is vividly anchored—mist, twisted oaks, compressed whispers underfoot—and the setting's liminality ("inside the whisper of closing pages") directly charges the premise. The seashell fragment warms and glows, a micro-object that evolves under pressure and shapes the closure moment when Elena speaks her promise into its grooves. Spatial choreography remains clear across the mist-walk, and the bioluminescent hopes offer fresh sensory particularity. Anchor-who-where-when clarity arrives within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    The arbor is vivid and purposeful: climbing roses, grapevines, moss-covered altar, and dawn light are woven through action. The harvest moon setting as sun rises is tracked and creates urgency. The device on the stone altar and the vine tendril wrapping Mira's wrist function as micro-setting elements that constrain choice and charge the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's priorities. No spatial confusion; bodies and objects track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    The subarctic crater and skeletal orchard pressure Maren's work through microclimate and isolation; the frozen ground, dead branches, and volcanic glass are woven into her ritual. Sensory detail is selective and vivid—crystallizing breath, tarnished copper, frost scattering like spirits. The copper plate and starlight vial function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; the crater's cupped-palm walls and the spiral pattern provide concrete anchors throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    The marble cavern is not mere backdrop: its crystalline walls hold echoes differently depending on position, reflection angles govern the harvest mechanism, and Elena maps surfaces over weeks. The timer mechanism—machined, calibrated, positioned to catch light—constrains her choices (she must work peripherally, coordinate light/time/resonance precisely). The wounded season outside creates a "blank canvas" absence of noise that enables the work. Candlelight, flat stone workspace, skeletal fingers clutching prior notes—all anchor tactile engagement. The micro-setting (timer, marble geometry) charges the final image when voices emerge "like bubbles rising through deep water."

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bronze grotto functions as micro-setting with constraint: its acoustics hold the echoes Elara needs, and the "shingled hush" guides her weaving by orienting her loom toward each burden's source. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—mineral sweat, singing walls, pale geometry of starlight—filtered through Elara's craft-specific attention. The aperture's starlight and the grotto's resonance charge the final image when she presses her weaving into the stone. Spatial choreography is clear (northeastern wall, grotto's heart, climb back out). Minor gap: the kerosene lamp burner's warmth at dawn lacks spatial or causal grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.1)
    The loft's tactile details—rain-beaded skylight, weathered brick, copper pipes, sawdust in corners—anchor every beat and filter through Marguerite's grief-work POV. The ash wood blank and smallest gouge constrain her carving choice on the page, and the kettle's rising whistle structures the present window. October's "rust and amber" bleeding through glass directly charges the final image of "rust-hued peace," satisfying the 9+ gate test (environment shapes the final image). Sensory hierarchy is strong: sight and touch dominate during carving, sound (kettle, rain) marks time. No spatial drift or missed anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    Kinetic lagoon is vivid and purposeful: luminescent waters, phosphorescent spray, perpetual motion above cloudline. The camera wheel as micro-setting object charges the final image and constrains the negotiation (serrated edge worn smooth by circulation mirrors Mira's erosion). Spatial choreography is clean (edge of lagoon, ghost beside her, debris caught in currents). Minor cap: the frozen carousel horses receive descriptive attention but don't alter a present tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    The terminal is vividly rendered with selective detail (dripping water, frozen departure boards, dust patterns) that reflects Maya's engineering perspective. Spatial choreography through gates and corridors is coherent. The sextant piece and terminal infrastructure constrain her thinking and charge the final movement, though the environment doesn't force a pivotal choice. Strong atmosphere and POV-filtered specificity, but the setting remains more backdrop than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    The crystal forecourt functions as micro-setting, constraining Elara's pre-dawn ritual and charging the final image through its "whispered" sub-audible hum that survives the Silencing. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: petrichor, rain-soaked stones, amber and rose light, all filtered through Elara's memory-laden attention. The forecourt's acoustics and the Great Silencing provide a coherent environmental constraint that shapes her abandonment and potential return. Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling among stones, tracing seams, pulling out stylus), and the setting evolves causally as sunrise floods the space, syncing with her emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    The twilight canal setting constrains action—she must use her father's coordinates at the junction where four waterways meet, and retrieves the case by hand from the water. The pocket sundial functions as micro-setting, returning dark and useless in the final beat to reweight the inheritance motif. Sensory hierarchy reflects her investigative focus: tarnished brass, corroded case, amber light swallowed by water. The barge's drift and engine cut create spatial rhythm that supports the accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    The golden dock functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: fish oil and salt spray anchor the weaver knowledge, snow accumulation marks duration, fog cycles bracket her transformation. Spatial choreography is clean (dock edge, coiled rope, overturned dory). Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira's priorities: tactile rope detail dominates during decoding, visual fog stages her isolation. The fulgurite at her throat constrains one micro-choice (touching it before standing) and the dock's weathered planks echo the rope's encoded durability, but the harbor itself remains backdrop rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    The garden is vivid and particular: crumbling fountain, moss-swallowed benches, salvaged throne-room carpet, maple leaves "the color of dried blood," persimmons "left too long in the sun." Sensory detail is filtered through Elara's perceptual priorities (the weft threads, the cold seeping through her clothes, the cloud-veiled moon). The crimson thread constrains her final action—she winds it into her braid as a keepsake, charging the closure image. Autumn and the shadowed garden mirror internal state without overt declaration. The garden's past (palace, fire) adds resonance without exposition dump.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    The suspended palace anchored to stalactites provides concrete spatial choreography (observatory window, workbench, stalactite chains) and the geothermal winds introduce environmental constraint. The egg's warmth and the mechanical birds' copper wings filtering bioluminescent glow create vivid, purposeful sensory detail. The setting charges the final image when "the stalactites hummed with new resonance" and the palace sways "like a living heart," directly tied to closure. Spatial logic remains clear throughout the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The obsidian lagoon, black sand, and volcanic glass are vividly rendered and filtered through Mara's professional lens (fire/heat memory). The environment supplies the sand she collects, which will be grafted into her sculpture, creating a micro-setting constraint. Sensory hierarchy is strong (heat, texture, visual metamorphosis), and the kelp/succulents embody survival motifs without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    The City of Forgotten Fountains is vividly realized through selective detail: dry basins, crystallized recollections, amber mass at the central fountain. The stained glass box functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and charging the final image when its contents dissolve. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the environment directly constrains Mira's tactics (following breadcrumbs, finding the key slot). The setting participates meaningfully in the closure, meeting the 9+ gate criteria, though the fountains themselves remain slightly generic—carved faces "almost familiar" without sharper specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    The nebula garden is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: "celestial flowers blooming in colors that existed only in the spaces between stars," "crystalline petals...marking the timeframe of her contemplation." Sensory selection reflects Veloris's cosmic perspective without catalog sprawl. The garden constrains choice (sonar reveals dormant seeds, flowers store light) and charges the final image (the garden "bloomed brighter than before, a beacon"). Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The micro-setting (gear in palm, petals falling) functions as setting by constraining the resonance mechanism, meeting the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.1)
    The greenhouse setting actively shapes the work: gaps in panes allow monarchs through, overgrown vines house the ghost, glass catches dying light. The ribbon roll is handled across beats (pocket, measuring, wrist-tying) and its frayed texture carries history. Dusk recurs as workspace constraint. The micro-setting of cultivation and decay coexisting charges Elara's insight about grief's architecture. Strong sensory economy filtered through carver's attention.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    The obsidian ridge constrains her nightly climb and charges every sensory detail (volcanic glass, seawater mirrors, fog curling like breath). The pendulum bob and tower mechanism are handled objects that shape the ritual and the carving moment. The tidal pools function as micro-setting, holding the rake handle and promising its release. All three—ridge, tower interior, tide—pressure the closure image and make the environment indispensable to the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt silo, stars, and sovereign case are vividly rendered and purposeful. The silo's observation platform frames the untangling action and the starlight is woven into both task and theme. The tapestry fragment's physical state (frayed border, hidden colors) directly enables the decoding action. Hollowbrook Cemetery recurs as both workplace and answer, constraining Mira's fifteen-year path. The environment charges the final image without merely decorating it.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vivid and purposeful, establishing a tone of coldness and lost knowledge. The kingfisher feather quill nib appears twice (requested, then lifted) and charges the final third by embodying the contrast between sharpness and hope. Spatial choreography inside the spire is clean; the writing chamber and tools are anchored with economy. The frozen lake functions as both literal setting and thematic mirror, constraining Mira's approach by reminding her of the ancients' failure, and the spire's apex isolates her in a way that sharpens the liminal moment before creation.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ember alcove and mist function as tactical constraints: the mist's thickness determines broadcast safety, and the alcove's hidden glow enables secrecy. Sensory detail is selective (orange glow, velvet-heavy mist, fox passing) and filtered through Helena's priorities. The micro-setting (radio dial as tool, alcove as refuge) charges the final image when dawn approaches and patrols return. One slip: "thistled calm" in the shepherd tale feels decorative rather than spatially grounded, and the village/port examples (Thornwick, Sallow Bay) are named but not inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mask's sharp edges "smoothed only where the wearer's skin would touch" and the gallery's impossible perspective constrain Marina's choices—she must wear the mask to see the gallery's true function, and the vanishing point physically receives the ashes. The worktable, urn, mortar, and rocking chair are tactilely engaged across multiple beats. Sensory hierarchy reflects Marina's dual focus: visual (dust motes, paintings breathing) and tactile (grinding, powder between fingers) details anchor the ritual's physical demands.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sedimentary layers, sewer tunnels, and sunken ruins create a vivid vertical geography that constrains Marcus's movements and supplies his archive. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through his philosophical lens. The chronometer cog and other artifacts function as micro-setting elements that charge his mission, and the spatial descent/ascent pattern supports the thematic layers. The setting meaningfully shapes his choices and isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    The velvet library with its "burgundy drapes absorbing the failing October light" and "oak shelves" creates a specific container for stillness and memory. The zither functions as micro-setting, constraining Margaret's hands and enabling the final teaching moment. Autumn leaves in the closing beat mirror the theme of graceful surrender. Spatial choreography is clean (Margaret at the instrument, Darius crossing to sit, hands positioned on strings).

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rusted greenhouse is vividly rendered ("forgotten ribcage," "iron bones bleeding orange") and its decay contrasts purposefully with the emerging life. Sensory details are filtered through Maren's professional palate (scent of "decay and dormant potential"). The greenhouse's "graveyard of abandoned growth" directly shapes Maren's pruning action, and the fractured ceiling channels the three-moon convergence, making the setting integral to the climax. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lightning tower's copper spires, frozen toll gate, and phosphorescent moss-lined memory chamber create a coherent micro-setting that constrains the resolution: only the tower's residual charge can save the bees. The "nectar dusk" / "amber sky" / "thick as honey" light registers as a purposeful atmospheric frame that charges the final star-emergence image. Spatial choreography (toll counter, copper door, descent into depths, ancient vents) tracks cleanly. The matchbox and lacquer box function as charged objects within the setting's logic. Minor gap: the city below and storm fields remain abstract backdrops without pressure on Mira's immediate choices.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bay, streetlights, Whitmore house, and orris root are rendered with vivid, selective detail ("amber daydreaming," "fog-softened edges," "wood softened with rain"). The orris root's scent anchors the climactic interior beat and charges the final walk, constraining her embodied attention. Spatial choreography (porch, kitchen table, rooms) remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    The drowned garden is vividly realized with purposeful detail: coral on marble, phosphorescent algae, sediment-filled mouths, foxglove-stained glass. The structural weakness in Veris's chest—where the chisel slipped—becomes a functional constraint that enables the brother's discovery. Spatial choreography is clean (threading through archway, swimming closer, ascending). The underwater setting constrains communication (telepathy required) and charges the final image of bubbles rising toward an unreachable surface. Minor opportunity cost: could have used water pressure or limited air to add tactical urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.1)
    The infinite staircase constrains every choice: Vera grinds steps for chalk, rolls dice to choose direction, and the crack's geometry validates her mathematics. The pale stone "that seemed to absorb light" becomes warmer after the crossing, a micro-shift that charges the final image. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered ("thin as a breath," "golden, something alive"). The body and recurring objects (dice, chalk, crack) function as micro-setting elements that pressure decisions and anchor the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    The rooftop greenhouse is vividly rendered with condensation-streaked panes, tomato vines, ancient vents, and smog pressing against glass. The brush's glow and moonlight filtering through haze establish a coherent micro-setting. The greenhouse pressures no choice directly, but the moon's apex timing and the laptop tucked between seed trays provide spatial anchors that frame the email arrival. The setting charges the final image sufficiently to enter the 7-band but does not constrain a middle tactic or alter Maya's approach.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto city is vividly particularized: limestone ceilings drip spring ice, communal kitchen steam mixes yeast with "distant memory," the waterfall's roar becomes "a kind of silence." Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira's curator past: she examines pigments through the emerald lens, notes underdrawings invisible to natural light, and describes loaves with archival gravity. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from observation ledge to carved stairs to kitchen ovens. The environment constrains choice: honey stores nearly depleted, the waterfall guards their secret, cave minerals will supply tomorrow's pigments—each detail tilts Mira's decision to persist rather than despair.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lighthouse setting is vivid and functional: counter-clockwise stairs mirror Alaric's obsession, the lens ignites at the climax, and the island's skeleton imagery charges the atmosphere. The hunger stone physically glows and acts as a key, constraining the final action. Low tide functions as a time pressure and thematic anchor (desperation reveals hidden paths). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (dust on everything except the yoyo, "latent radiance"). The micro-setting of the desk and yoyo serves as the primary crucible for the central puzzle-solving action.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    The funhouse setting does work: mirrors trap screams, tilted corridors and shifting doorways externalize disorientation, "lingering luminance" charges the final image when Vera's triumph joins the collection. The opera clasp and dream dictionary function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice. Sensory details are filtered through gothic idiom ("dead leaves scraping against bone," "forgotten flowers rotting in cemetery soil") and the environment pressures Vera's choices—she must come alone, confront the mirrors. The setting's fusion of joy and horror directly mirrors the story's thematic stakes, and the final mirror-smile moment gains resonance from prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    The floating orchard is vividly anchored with concrete detail (lashed driftwood, salt-stiffened trees, wind chimes from oars) and its precarity subtly pressures her existence. Sensory work is strong—blue hour color, cumulus fractals, mallet tones—and filtered through the Prophet's professional attention. The hull fragment functions as micro-setting, its ridges and hollows shaping tonight's beat, though it does not constrain a choice or charge the final image directly.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    The turtle-shell city and rusted gate are vivid, purposeful, and constrain Mira's choices throughout. The gap in the gate becomes the literal threshold she must squeeze through; the city's "drowsy existence" pressures her departure by embodying stagnation. Sensory detail (bone-white sun, salt-corroded metal, scarred turtle backs) is selective and filtered through Mira's cartographic lens. The whistle, boat, and telescope function as micro-setting that charges the final image. The watchers on the horizon supply spatial pressure and a concrete goal.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    The disused railway station is vividly rendered with specific, purposeful detail: ivy through skylights, rusted ticket booth repurposed for research, Platform Three as the rosebush anchor. The setting provides both sanctuary and prison, shaping Vera's isolation and her methodical work. The final snow covering "tracks that led nowhere and everywhere" charges the ending image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout; the station's decay mirrors the Institute's crumbling mythology without overstating the parallel.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    The submerged pavilion is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (barnacled benches, copper roof, cold brackish water) and constrains Marina's physical actions (diving, probing the column). The setting charges the final image: Marina standing waist-deep as the moon sets, carrying treasures home. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The pavilion's hollow columns function as both setting and mechanism, directly enabling the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sunken library with bioluminescent kelp constrains Maren's investigation—the blackout's sideways glow reveals the hidden compartment. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered (dripping water, whispering pages). The stamp as micro-object charges the final image when she presses it beside her signature. The kelp dimming as artificial light returns provides purposeful atmosphere that supports closure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    The floating island tea garden, jasmine-scented pavilion, and glass basilica create a vivid, fantastical setting with consistent internal logic. Sensory detail is strong ("jasmine perfumed the air," "heat above summer stones") and the environment provides concrete resources (smuggled crystal, terrace for ritual). The setting charges the final image (lantern hung from the pavilion's eave), satisfying the 9+ gate requirement. Minor cap applied due to Q2 closure debt preventing full high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    The floating observatory is vividly particular—"clouds below churned in patterns that resembled brain tissue, folds and valleys of gray matter contemplating nothing"—and the viewport, console, and geode anchor micro-setting throughout. The observatory's groan when wind shifts and the breakers' cooling cycle create spatial and temporal texture. The geode's purple light scattering across walls charges the final image. The setting constrains Yara's choices (twenty-minute wait, isolation miles above earth) and the final sentence ties "floating observatory, suspended between stars and storms" directly to her stance, meeting the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    The observatory setting is vivid and purposeful: the fractured dome becomes a functional lens, the bronze lever and pedestal grooves constrain action, and "brilliant dimness" charges the atmosphere at the threshold moment. Sensory detail is selective (copper light, thermal display, gears turning) and filtered through Mira's professional focus. Spatial choreography is clean across the dome, stairs, and floor mechanism. The drone functions as both tool and micro-setting element, shaping Mira's tactical choices and the final star-trail projection.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt terrace and forgotten shore provide concrete spatial grounding with purposeful detail (blue tiles catching amber light, driftwood in silver piles). The carved hand functions as micro-setting that charges the final image and constrains Maren's choice—she places it on the terrace tiles as a permanent reminder. Sensory selection serves mood effectively (sieved hush, whisper of wood against wood), though the beach as "sculptor's retreat" feels convenient rather than discovered through Maren's professional lens.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.9)
    The storm-worn parapet, mist, and neutral-territory watchtower are vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography is clean: fifteen paces, opposite stairwells, moon breaking through clouds at the exchange moment. The drawer pull functions as micro-setting/object constraint: Mira grips it tighter under stress, then tucks it away when the exchange succeeds, charging the final image. Minor: the "furrowed hush of the morning" mixes metaphor (furrowed typically visual/tactile, hush aural) but the oddity is brief and does not obscure the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.1)
    Coastal setting constrains and enables: the fog softens shame, the cormorant's dive triggers the chest-knot release, the utility poles provide the reliable navigation system that replaces stars. The kayak, compass, and poles function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (shallows, bluffs, seal colony markers). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"November water biting at her calves," the brass weight at her hip—filtered through Elena's professional and emotional priorities. The hidden beach and seal colony annotations show lived-in knowledge without catalog drag.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.1)
    The bioluminescent lake is vivid, purposeful, and constrains Marcus's final choice: the algae respond to emotional honesty, directly shaping his navigation method. Sensory details—cold blue light, cracked leather, cold water—are filtered through Marcus's numbed perception and modulate as he stirs toward feeling. The seven-tunnel labyrinth functions as micro-setting that charges the closure image. Minor note: the lake's biological plausibility ("where nothing should grow") is gestured at but not developed, though this does not harm the choice mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    The orchard under perpetual moonlight is vividly rendered with specificity ("blossoms dripped moonlight like honey," "fruit glowing brighter") and the phoenix-ash origin grounds the world. The eternal-bloom setting constrains the timeline (veil thin "after the phoenix rises") and charges the final image where Mira spreads new wings beneath luminescent boughs. Micro-setting works: rare spices are handled on the page, their scent triggering the orchard's response. However, the silver soil and dragon-breath cardamom feel decorative rather than tactically constraining; they color the world without altering Mira's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.1)
    The midnight glade is vivid and purposeful—jasmine, ozone, cloud sea—filtered through Morrigan's exhausted sensory palette. The cracked saucer functions as micro-setting, anchoring memory and charging the ritual, which satisfies the gate for 9+ eligibility. Spatial choreography (silver ladder, grass, card spread) remains clear throughout. However, the glade's mechanics (why this place accumulates lost time) are asserted rather than demonstrated through environmental constraint, and the final moment places Iris at the ladder's base without prior setup of how she arrived there.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.9)
    The recycled spaceship is vividly established early and returns at closure ("cathedral ship drifted forward"), charging the ending image. Sensory detail is selective: "grated floor," "magnification array," "sacred vessel." The grandmother's needle anchors tactile presence and recurs purposefully in the final stitching beat. The ship's patched hull and observation deck constrain Mei Lin's choices (where she works, where she opens the seal), satisfying the micro-setting standard, though spatial choreography across decks remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    The black sand beach, volcano, bioluminescent water, and planetary conjunction are vividly rendered with purposeful detail ("black sand like crushed obsidian," "whispering hush"). The environment charges the final image and the volcanic setting constrains her original plan, forcing the beach as an alternate site. Sensory selection is strong and filtered through Miriam's meditative POV, though the geologist's warning functions more as convenience than true environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    The luminous fort's glass panels, the Eastern Gate, and the Astronomer's Tower provide clear spatial anchors. The blackout functions as a constraint that enables Maren's plan, directly affecting tactics. The bronze quill holder and the twin sundials are handled concretely—placement "completing a circuit" charges the final tower beat. However, the counterfeit mint beneath the Eastern Tower is told rather than shown, and the fort's interior geography (corridors, courtyards, towers) remains somewhat generic despite the premise's architectural specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tidal bluff and aurora supply vivid, purpose-driven detail: slick stone underfoot, violet-to-gold light shift, the seal-skin pouch, the eels surfacing in spirals. The aurora's false dawn charges the closure image, and the slick ground constrains movement throughout. Spatial choreography is clean (Meren on the bluff, eels below, rocks in spiral). The painted rocks and star dust function as micro-setting elements that constrain her ritual choices. Minor: occupational detail (eel herding methods, census evasion tactics) remains lightly sketched, though sufficient for the single-scene window.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stormlit observatory is vividly anchored with concrete detail (copper dome, cloudline, lightning flashes) and actively shapes the closure: Elena aims the telescope at the storm below while speaking, charging the final image. The timer, timetable, and photograph function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice and recur with shifted meaning. Sensory selection is purposeful, filtered through Elena's urgency and wonder. The setting does more than backdrop—it becomes a stage for reclamation.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.4)
    The glass atrium and brook are vividly anchored with sensory specificity ("dragonflies skated," "reflection danced on the ceiling"). The half-painted sundial constrains discovery and charges the middle section. However, spatial choreography during the duel collapses into summary, and the "shattered teacups" feel ornamental rather than tactically significant. The setting pressures one key choice (decoding the sundial) but does not recur meaningfully at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rusted library under stars is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail (prison-bar shelves, coffee tin on circulation desk, candlelight and moonlight). Sensory selection reflects the accumulative, reflective mode without tourist-catalog excess. The setting charges the final image and recurs as a spatial anchor throughout. Spatial choreography remains clear across the two characters' movements. The micro-setting (coffee tin, false bottom) functions as a tactile object that constrains one choice (revealing the smuggled poems).

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tidal arbor is vivid and purposeful: latticed walkways rising/falling with currents, cloud-break alignment at dusk creating the beacon window. Micro-setting (piano keys, mist, cloud curtain) charges multiple beats. The dusk alignment directly constrains the climactic choice—Elara must play before the window closes—and the arbor's sway modulates atmosphere without becoming postcard. The white curtain of cloud serves as projection surface, integrating setting into plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.9)
    The ancient ridge is vivid and specific ("purple starflowers cascaded down limestone terraces," "golden ferns unfurled"), filtering through Yara's trained eye ("empirically whimsical"). Micro-setting via the seed and soil anchor tactile engagement. The ridge's impossible botanical contradictions mirror the thematic tension and the monsoon's arrival pressures her window. Minor gap: while evocative, the ridge does not constrain a tactical choice as sharply as it might—she plants anywhere on the ridge without spatial consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.1)
    The wet rocks, mist, receding tide, and cerulean light filter through Mei's remembrance-focused perception and set tone effectively. The lace and compass function as micro-setting objects: both constrain Mei's choices (she follows the lace's instructions, the compass guides her to the cottage) and charge the final image (lace spread across laps, compass needle stills). The islet itself remains atmospheric but does not impose tactical constraints beyond mood. Spatial choreography is clean (beach, steps, cottage, window).

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse is vivid and specific—shattered door frame, sediment, smell of “drowned things,” broken roof panels, a single surviving orchid—and is consistently filtered through Mira’s sensibility. Environmental detail does thematic work (dust, decay, one blooming orchid) without bogging the prose. The setting also charges the final image and the practical decisions (demolition, donation), so it’s more than décor. It could constrain action a bit more overtly, but for this quiet story the integration is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    The canyon, stars, cold, and forming frost are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through a glass artist’s sensibility. Environment isn’t just backdrop: the cold forces micro-adjustments that echo her working method, and the frost becomes the literal cipher for the ledger. The final climb out through “glass-sharp light” and rainbowed frost recharges earlier images and charges the closing stance. The setting could exert slightly more overt physical constraint, but it already meaningfully shapes perception and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    The winterglass conservatory is vivid, specific, and tonally matched to the piece: crystalline walls, frozen botanical specimens, spectral light, and the alchemical preservation all feel both concrete and uncanny. Setting is not mere backdrop; the frozen-yet-living plants and natural silence directly enable her method and thematic exploration. The recurring glass, ice, and light imagery culminate in the charged final contrast between winter pressing outside and her interior, color-mapped “music.” A small limit is that environmental constraints (e.g., cold, isolation, physical fragility of the space) don’t much alter her tactical choices beyond mood and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    The settings—the mortuary and the underwater city library—are vivid, sensorial, and tightly bound to theme, with stand-out images like “books had become reefs” and “geometry bent like grief.” The environment shapes options: the library’s impossible spaces dictate how Ezra finds souls, and its records provide the means for burial. The lighthouse lens as an object-setting hybrid charges both the middle beats and the final image. A minor ceiling: the physical mechanics of moving and working in this environment are more lyrical than tactile, which keeps it from feeling utterly lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the terra-cotta arbor, salt wind, candlit valley, culverts, and patrols all feel lived-in and specific. Environment and objects constrain choices (night movement, back paths, the bell’s audibility, the sanctions regime) rather than serving as mere backdrop. The arbor and bell recur to charge the final image, anchoring both community and hope in concrete space. Sensory detail is rich without bloat, with political and physical geography tightly woven into action.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    The viaduct, jasmine, fog, and twilight light are vividly rendered and continually refracted through Mei-Lin’s eye, never reading as generic backdrop. The environment matters: the camera obscura depends on the light conditions, the fog supports the “foggy lucidity” theme, and the jasmine physically channels the luminous threads of unused love in the climax. These details are economical yet lush, and the final image of the viaduct and jasmine charged with released love reweights the whole setting. A slight sense of aestheticization over physical constraint keeps this just under the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    The living bridge garden is richly realized and thematically keyed to the story’s hyperbolic geometry and time-weave imagery; it feels like a purposeful, constraint-bearing environment rather than a backdrop. Specifics such as “saddle-shaped surfaces where parallel lines diverged into infinity” and the cathedral-like, rooted architecture both anchor the weirdness and embody the core concept. The setting directly shapes the climax—the negative curvature amplifying the fragment—and charges the final image of her face in the leaves. A slight check on a higher score is that non-garden environmental detail is comparatively thin, so the world beyond feels a bit abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    The abandoned carnival prize center is vividly evoked (dust motes, rotted ceiling, uncanny toys) and tonally matched to the story’s themes of forsaken prizes and unrealized futures. The setting is not just decorative: it houses the piano, the key arrangement, and the floor panel, and the Authority’s impending demolition of the wall structures the time pressure. The dead zones and envisioned farmland extend the physical world into the future-facing final image. Environmental details consistently feel filtered through Mira’s mission-focused perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    The underwater orchard greenhouse and ring of shipwrecks are vivid, original, and consistently filtered through Marina’s priorities, not as postcard description. Environment and tools (forge, aurora through cracked glass, shipwrecks as sound-fossil sources) actively shape what she can attempt and deeply charge the final image of her weeping amid creaking wrecks. World rules—hearing absences, geothermal forge, auroral sound—are internally consistent and learned through action. The setting doesn’t merely decorate; it is inseparable from the story’s logic and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    The emerald station and its shifting light are vividly rendered and tightly tied to the action: moonlight must replace sunset for the jar to reveal itself, and the crowded, flower-lined platform enables both concealment and coded communication. Details like jade tiles “pulsing with reflected silver” are not just pretty; they mirror the story’s obsession with captured light and freedom. The setting evolves with the clock, and the final image of the station fading as she steps into darkness gives the environment a clear role in closure. This is one of the story’s strongest dimensions.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bunker, frost, dripping meltwater, and distant calving ice are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the emotional arc. Setting is not postcard; the thawing environment directly enables travel, suggests incoming others, and mirrors Elena’s “thawing” purpose. The control room’s partial functionality (that single red light) concretely shapes her options. The recurring cold/warmth and ice/melt imagery effectively charges the final planning-on-the-floor image.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rusted, roofless library under the stars is vivid and tonally aligned with themes of decay and exposure, and details like “iron bones groaned in the wind” are well-chosen. The defunct research station context adds texture without bogging the scene. However, the setting is more atmospheric than constraining; nothing about the library materially shapes tactics beyond providing a lonely, witness-like backdrop. Still, it charges the final image of confession under the stars in a satisfying way.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the pebble shores, storm-tossed ridge fort, highest tower, and dimming sky are all filtered through her vocation and goal. The environment shapes constraints (she must climb for days; the tower offers the vantage for the last star; the storm stills as the world holds its breath), and the booklet functions as an object-as-setting in the final image. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric—wind, gales, moss, darkness—without becoming cluttered. The setting also charges the last image of her carrying a “small sun” into the void.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    The frozen courtyard, crystalline pillars, and twilight snow are vivid and tightly integrated with the robot’s perception, avoiding “tourist catalog” description. Setting is not just backdrop: the abandoned Institute, frozen fountain, and snow become extensions of memory, loss, and the question of thought’s origin; the courtyard’s “seventeen different kinds of silence” returns as a charged final image. The violin as object-as-setting is especially strong, charging both the middle and final beats. A touch more tactile interaction with the cold or physical constraints of the space (movement limits, echoes, ice underfoot) could push this toward a 9+.

    The crystal forecourt, rain, and resonant acoustics are vivid and specific, filtered through Mira’s attention in a way that feels lived-in rather than touristic. The environment isn’t just decorative: the acoustics justify her old eavesdropping habit, and the crystal walls “whisper” their moment back, charging the final image. The recurring lens, tickets, and crystal all work as micro-setting objects that support theme and mood. The setting shapes meaning more than physical options, but it does so with unusual clarity and unity.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.0)
    The garden maze is vividly evoked (iron bones, dying clematis, hedges breathing) and filtered through a gardener’s professional attention, which deepens atmosphere. It functions more as a charged, lyrical environment than a concrete constraint on action; the maze’s physicality doesn’t significantly shape tactics beyond providing a “secret center.” However, its history with Esther and the final image of the maze “knowing” her do charge the ending and align setting with theme. The world rule of measurable luck is sketched efficiently without derailing the intimate, grounded garden setting.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    The xenobiology station and Kepler-442b’s atmosphere are vividly realized and tightly integrated—details like “amber and violet” clouds, “icy warmth,” and cloudweavers roosting on the hull feel lived-in and particular to Mira’s perspective. The environment constrains options (the twilight nexus, station position, and hull-dwelling creatures make the experiment possible) and charges the final image of her walking corridors humming with that same contradictory warmth. World rules stay coherent and are conveyed through action rather than infodump. A slight further tying of physical constraints to risk would be needed to push this to truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    The flooded opera house is vividly rendered—“water had risen to Clara’s knees,” “flickering lanterns,” submerged velvet seats and gilded railings—and always filtered through her musician’s eye. Setting is not just decorative: the water stains literally carry the code, the flood justifies demolition, and the physical water level constrains her movement and endangers the documents. Recurring images (lanterns, water line, pit wall) return in the final beats to charge the closure image. A slightly broader sensory range beyond the visual (sound, cold, smell) is hinted at but could be exploited even more.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    The mountain weather station is vividly evoked through frost, instruments, and auroras, and these details consistently mirror Cassandra’s probabilistic, shifting perceptions. The environment subtly constrains options (isolation, dependence on the station keeper, remoteness from the Consortium) and charges the final image of barometers and winds as the only “warnings” the Consortium will get. The recurring micro-setting of the botanical illustration functions as a charged object-space, grounding the thematic discussion of margins and imperfection. While the weather does not force specific tactical choices, it does strong symbolic and atmospheric work without slipping into generic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tunnel, pipes, and valve room are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Marcus’s perceptions (“like a confession,” “frozen serpents”), producing a thick, coherent atmosphere. The environment shapes options—this is a hidden underground space that plausibly conceals the evidence and forces Marcus into a solitary, tactile investigation. The beaded valve wheel functions as an object-as-setting, returning at the end with reweighted meaning (especially the amber bead) and charging the closure. A slight tendency toward familiar industrial imagery is the only minor check on an otherwise excellent sense of place.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is richly realized and integral: the drowned city, root-threaded shelves, mossed spines, underground river, and obsidian refuge all shape the story’s ontology and imagery. Environmental processes (decay, roots breaching, shelves collapsing) mirror and literalize the thematic focus on regenerative dissolution. The catacombs deeply color Maren’s perception and practices rather than feeling like a backdrop, and the final image of the catacombs breathing with her is charged and memorable. The only small gap is that the environment seldom constrains a specific on-page choice; it is more metaphysical frame than tactical obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific—sage perfume, ancient oaks, birds’ confused songs, and the corona all create a strong atmosphere that mirrors the emotional transition. The “dreaming roots” motif and underground rivers subtly echo generational connection and unseen networks between mother and daughter. While the ridge doesn’t materially constrain choices, it richly charges the final image and underpins the “ordinary magic” concept. Integration of setting with perception feels organic rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    The reclaimed silo, its bronze quiet, and the post-dream twilight are vivid, selective, and filtered through Maren’s sensibility as a listener to walls. The concrete vs. brick/mortar distinction and the storage history (grain → missiles → archive) give the place a lived, thematic weight without over-explaining. Setting doesn’t strongly constrain her choices—she could likely make similar moves in any resonant ruin—but it does charge the mood and the idea of memory-bearing structures. The final image of her leaving the silo into permanent twilight is atmospherically strong if not tactically shaped by environment.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lighthouse on the rocky island, the fog, the automated beam, and the ferry schedule all create an atmospheric, lived-in sense of place that’s both literal and symbolically apt. Setting is filtered through Mei Lin’s long familiarity, avoiding tourist catalog while still feeling vivid. Crucially, the environment constrains options (isolation, dependence on the ferry, being a rumor rather than a presence) and charges the final image of the sweeping beam and “Some lights guide ships; others guide the keeper home.” This integration of environment with closure justifies a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cathedral, dimensional anchor, flagstones, and ash-gray dust are vivid and specific, and they’re used as tools rather than backdrop—the anchor and paint literally stabilize reality. The sensory palette leans visual and auditory (“silence so complete,” “bell wrapped in cloth”) but suits the muffled, constrained atmosphere. World rules around the pocket reality and collapsed dimensions are sketched efficiently and stay consistent. The environment does shape tactics at the climax, though the void-pressure could be felt a little more physically to fully maximize atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glass spire, frozen Siberian lake, mirrored horizon, and Suzhou kitchen memories are vivid and selective, not touristic, and they filter through Li Wei’s priorities. The environment meaningfully shapes what she can do and when: the seven hundred steps, pre-dawn timing, and acoustically ambitious spire all constrain her choices and charge the final image. The nautilus shell acts as a micro-setting/tool that literally mediates vibrations at the climax. Atmosphere is rich yet controlled, tightly aligned with tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.3)
    The glowing viaduct, rain, and phosphorescent algae are vivid and recur in key beats, especially when the storm turns the viaduct into “a river of light” at the end. Setting is tightly fused with tone and theme—the darkening brightness mirrors her paradoxical state and the suspended-time image of drops and ripples. The environment doesn’t deeply constrain tactical choices, but it does shape how the final realization is staged and perceived. World rules (gravity defiance, luminescent structure) feel consistent and are learned through her embodied interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cavern, drums, stone walls, and rustling leaves are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Marina’s tactile/visual perception, which deepens both atmosphere and character. The environment actively shapes the action (the wall vibrations, the drum layout, the enclosed hush) rather than serving as mere backdrop. The recurring elements—the cavern’s silence, the drums, the seasonal leaves—charge the final image of her walking out feeling the leaves “like a promise.” This integration of setting with theme and closure is strong and economical.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: abandoned textile district, rusted quarantine barriers, courtyard, broken fountain, and dusk light all support the atmosphere of decay and secrecy. Details like the moss in a dry fountain and the “lavender light of dusk” reflect her quiet, stubborn persistence. The environment subtly constrains her choices (hiding routes, need to conceal journals) and the final image of stars/rooftops/clouds ties setting directly to the thematic and conceptual stakes. It stops just short of 9+ because the courtyard itself pressures mood more than concrete action at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    The greenhouse of extinct plants, the cathedral-of-glass imagery, ultraviolet lamps, and “crystal shadows” create a vivid, specific atmosphere that’s tightly integrated with theme. Environmental details (extinct flora, last Silphium, dawn over a world with “one fewer extinction”) charge both the emotional register and the conceptual stakes. The recurring objects-as-setting—the lantern and the vial—are handled physically and visually, constraining how she moves through the space and shaping the final images. Setting isn’t just backdrop; it mirrors loss and restoration in a way crucial to the story’s effect.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    The terra-cotta grotto, starlight through fissures, and drifting energy beings above are vivid and purposeful, not just decorative. The environment materially shapes what happens: the warm clay floor, the grotto’s seclusion, and the beings’ hovering presence create a ritual-like chamber where objects can be “read” and mirrored back. The rope functions as a micro-setting object, repeatedly handled and recharged until it anchors the final sense of time as sediment. The only thing holding this just below the very top is that the grotto and beings, while atmospherically rich, don’t overtly constrain choices beyond mood and vantage.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and deeply integrated: the sunken greenhouse, twisted apple trees, shipwrecks, and encroaching tide all mirror interruption and persistence without feeling over-signaled. Environmental details (tide rising, broken panes, barnacled hulls) evolve with the scene and subtly pressure timing and imagery. The mendicant’s bowl and the greenhouse together charge the final images, making place and objects inseparable from the emotional arc. This is exemplary use of setting as emotional and thematic infrastructure rather than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    The amber grotto is vividly rendered (“held the dying light like honey holds time”) and sensorially dense across sight, taste, and touch, anchored to Vera’s electrical sensitivity. The environment isn’t just decorative: it functions as a chosen crucible for transformation and charges the final gesture of tucking the petal into the amber wall. Details remain POV-filtered—she notices emotional residues and static rather than generic cave features—and the dusk-to-dark movement supports the emotional arc. While the grotto doesn’t physically constrain options, it symbolically and atmospherically shapes what transformation can mean here.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.9)
    The harbor, rooftop library, and symphony are vivid and integrated, giving the piece a strong sense of place and mood. Details like the retractable glass ceiling and the lighthouse beam under stars recur and charge the final image of Marina compiling names. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but the library as an inherited workspace of ledgers and records meaningfully underpins her ability to act. Overall, atmosphere and specificity are strong and purposeful without feeling like tourism.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    The crystalline orchard, crater, and obsidian arbor are vividly rendered with a strong, coherent visual and tonal logic (“air itself seem wounded with beauty” is exemplary). Setting is not just postcard: the tag locations (branch splits, fallen fruit, dusk light) encode “places of transformation,” and the arbor anchors councils, revelation, and final ceremony. World rules—lost languages, crystalline trees, grafters—are suggested through use rather than exposition. The environment charges the final images and theme, though it rarely constrains concrete choices, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rooftop canal system, obsidian towers, and Aldros’s sleeping body as mountain-range are vivid, specific, and integrated into how the world behaves during the nap. World rules (water spiraling upward, altered sound) remain consistent and directly enable the search for the echo-cage. The pendant and Aldros’s nap both charge the final image, with the giant’s subtle movement echoing the world’s reconfiguration. A small further use of physical constraint from the precarious ledges could have deepened the sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cavern orchard is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Mira’s mathematical, grief-haunted attention (phosphorescent moss, mineral drips as “mathematics of sustenance”). Environmental details do real work: the dripping stalactites inspire her emotional calculus, and the orchard’s impossible fertility under stone mirrors and counterpoints her loss. The setting recurs at the end, where the orchard’s ongoing growth under falling water charges her new stance on survival and “what falls from above.” While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, it decisively charges the story’s governing metaphor and closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    The library is vividly realized—“sapphire hush of dawn,” crawl spaces, pipe chases, boiler room, archive boxes—always filtered through Maren’s lived familiarity. Environmental specifics (maintenance corridors, labeled boxes, tall windows onto a flickering city) are tightly tied to her tactics and sense of self, not mere backdrop. The setting directly underwrites the premise (a girl living in the interstices of a public building) and charges the final image of the library breathing with her. This is rich, economical world-building that meaningfully shapes the story’s possibilities.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    The nursery, mossy trellis, and post-rain atmosphere are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Vera’s botanical sensibility. Weather and plant life meaningfully charge the final image: the storm, moss “welcoming,” and dissolving linden leaf all fold directly into the metamorphosis. The setting doesn’t just decorate; it feels like the ecosystem enacting and endorsing her change. It could press her choices more overtly, but as a lyric, intimate piece, the integration is strong enough for high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and pressure-bearing: the dark lighthouse, tidal island, emerging causeway, and drowned mainland all shape what Mira can do and when she can do it. Weather and tide are not just wallpaper; the exposed causeway and closing tide literally frame the story’s window of action and its closing image. Details like “seaweed draped from broken windows like mourning veils” feel specific and tonally apt rather than generic post-apoc. The environment and recurring objects (causeway, lighthouse) clearly charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    The crystal cave is vividly rendered—musical, chromatic, quasi-sentient—and its details consistently reflect Vera’s shifting inner state. The environment supports the tone and theme (resonance, unseen forces, bright darkness) and charges the final image of the cave singing her home. However, the setting rarely constrains concrete choices; it’s more atmospheric than tactical. For top-tier, a moment where the cave’s properties actively force or redirect her behavior would help.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ivory Harbor, the rain-scrubbed limestone, the Archive of Lost Passages, and the recurring lighthouse image create a vivid, coherent atmosphere filtered through Elena’s archivist sensibility. The trumpet valve as a recurring object and the rain returning at the end charge the final image and thematically tether setting to memory and cleansing. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, but it deeply saturates mood and motif at a high literary level.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.9)
    The starlit vault, mist, crystalline ceiling, and crack-arrows create a vivid, specific environment that strongly shapes action and options—she literally cannot proceed without reading the setting. The ticket punch and the freestanding door function as charged micro-settings that constrain choice and anchor the final image. Details feel filtered through Clara’s cartographic sensibility, tying worldbuilding to character. A slight bias toward the visual over other senses is the only minor limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tower, open to the stars and saturated with whale song, is vividly rendered and deeply integrated with the premise of “sculpting space” for reflection. Details like the circular opening, worn stone table, and starlight refracting through the tile feel specific and lived-in rather than touristic. Environment meaningfully shapes the action: the architecture channels cosmic/whale energies and makes the ritual possible, and the tower’s patient silence frames the ending. A slight additional sense of physical constraint or weather impact could heighten its functional role, but as-is it strongly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prismatic escondite and “intersection of seventeen dimensions” create a striking, coherent environment whose rules stay consistent as the storm destabilizes them. Setting is not mere wallpaper: the pocket dimension’s stasis and the crystal matrix’s reaction to magnetic fields directly enable the plot and mirror the theme of rebellion against stagnation. The closing image of the reformed but empty escondite provides an effective environmental echo of Vera’s transformation. A slightly more tactile, embodied use of space during the collapse could elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    The funeral home prep room is concretely evoked (“formaldehyde and something floral, death dressed in chemical perfume”) and consistently filters Maya’s thoughts about preservation, truth, and debt. The ink pot functions as a charged micro-setting object that constrains choice and deeply charges the final image. Environmental and occupational details are selective but feel plausible and lived-in. A slightly broader use of the room’s physical constraints in the interaction could have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: the bonsai labyrinth, the cedar-scented air, the aging shed, and the fluorescent lamp all feel lived-in and tonally coherent. Details are tightly filtered through Mei’s sensibility as a stationer obsessed with texture and light, and the environment (especially the lamp and its glass) is functionally tied to her method. While the labyrinth doesn’t strongly constrain her choices, it deeply charges the premise of time as cultivated, miniature, and ancient. The closing image of the blooming labyrinth “keeping its own records” powerfully recharges the world’s role in the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    The shipping-container labyrinth and tidal harbor are vividly evoked and consistently used to shape movement, access, and mood; details like “mud flats where the oldest containers rested” and “canyons of forgotten cargo and shadow” feel both concrete and thematic. The environment constrains choices (low vs high tide routes, climbing as water returns) and mirrors the theme of lost/erased cargo and people without feeling forced. The recurring containers/tides imagery also charges the final image of her waiting above as evidence is submerged. This level of integration between world, tactic, and theme is near top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory on the cliff, the cracked dome, the November chill, and the half-finished cello all create a vivid, tonally aligned environment that feels integral rather than decorative. Setting details are filtered through Eleanor’s mindset (myth buster in a ruin of scientific wonder), and the environment subtly mirrors her internal rupture. The seashell functions as a micro-setting/tool object that charges the final image and influences her choices. The observatory could constrain tactics a bit more concretely (e.g., physical isolation affecting what she dares to attempt) to cross into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    The raft city and perpetual carnival are vivid and specific—the competing music, painted hulls, rope bridges, and under-walkway graffiti all feel lived-in and filtered through Mira’s perspective. Setting is not just decorative; the floating, communal architecture and the tourist-facing spectacle shape the stakes (privatization of platforms) and enable tactics (hidden graffiti language only raft-born kids see). The recurring foundation stone chip charges the final image by tying her personal lineage to the city’s physical precariousness. At an elite level, one or two more moments where the physical constraints of the raft (weather, instability, spatial limits) directly affect choice would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mountain, crater lake, and blazing orbital shipyards are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elena’s professional and personal gaze. Setting actively shapes the premise—the remote summit’s darkness is what’s being extinguished—and environmental details (thin air, scree, lake, moonlight) feel lived rather than touristic. The recurring objects (camera rig, chemical packets, vial of sand) charge the final image and help ground the abstract theme. At times description edges toward lushness, but it remains purposeful and never dissolves into static scenery.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.3)
    The misty rail depot, abandoned locomotives, and converted cargo car are vivid and atmospherically rich without becoming cluttered. Setting is filtered through Elara’s non-visual senses (sound, moisture, warmth), which makes the environment feel lived-in and specific to her perception. The water basin and fog both tie into her methods and the story’s stakes (navigation in mist), giving the world-building thematic coherence. It stops short of fully constraining her choices, but it strongly charges tone and method.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid, tactile, and consistently filtered through Maren’s professional gaze: the rusted outpost, frozen lake, antenna tower, and ice “groaning its ancient vocabulary” all feel lived-in and functional. Environment materially shapes options (the narrow weather window, the lake as path and threat, the outpost as last human node). The final image of her crossing the groaning lake toward unmapped territory is charged by everything we’ve learned about this place. The piece fully meets the “object/setting charges final image” gate without excess exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    Veradhen, the bell tower, the mountain, and the ancient archway are sharply drawn and thematically aligned, with details like “seventeen souls” and “cavernous silence” deepening the ghost-town atmosphere. The environment isn’t just backdrop: the mountain’s instability and the bells’ harmonization explicitly govern what’s possible and why the collapse must happen. The recurring archway and cobblestones charge the final image, where only the archway remains as the portal for rebirth. Sensory focus is mostly visual and sonic but feels selective and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    The underwater temple is vividly and economically rendered: “water thick with suspended particles that drifted like frozen starlight,” shifting faces on columns, the preserved corpse, and the altar all contribute to a palpable, oppressive atmosphere. Setting is not mere backdrop; depth, concealment, and the temple’s function as a memory repository directly shape what Marina can do and what it means to act here. The crystal vial and the environment’s “gathered hush” both charge the final image and constrain choices (this is a place built to be unfound and left undisturbed). A touch more non-visual sensory detail under peak pressure could deepen embodiment, but the spatial and tonal choreography is already very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, copper dusk, and repurposed confessional all feel vivid and integrated rather than decorative. Setting is filtered well through Milo’s concerns (reputation, silence, his father’s cell, the carved words), and the world rule about imprisoning “those who sustained impossibilities” fits the carceral-gothic tone. The confessional and its lattice directly shape his tactical choice at the climax and charge the final image. A touch more environmental interference (weather, architecture) affecting immediate options could push this into the absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.0)
    The greenhouse, endless night, quicksilver streams, and winter-cracked fields are vividly drawn and consistently filtered through Elias’s lived familiarity. Setting is not mere backdrop; the orchard’s impossible life, the glass walls, and the dead fields directly embody the stakes and charge the final image of dawn. Environmental elements like the beads in soil and the cracking glass at sunrise tangibly shape and reflect the decisive change. The specificity and integration of alchemical details and weather with theme and plot reach a high literary tier.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    The canyon labyrinth, empty tide pools, and red stone walls are vivid, tactile, and consistently filtered through Meren’s sensibility. The history of the sea’s retreat and the salt-crusted basins creates a strong atmosphere of loss that directly charges the final contrast between un-mendable ruins and a mutable labyrinth. Tools and objects (bone needle, hair thread, illustration plate) are rooted in the environment and inflect both worldbuilding and theme. While the space doesn’t physically constrain moment-to-moment choices beyond mood and vocation, it absolutely shapes the story’s logic and the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid, specific, and thematically charged—apples glowing among bones, roots threading skulls—and its rules are learned through Mira’s observation and action. Environment directly shapes options: offerings supply materials, roots carry ancestor names, seeds become what she takes back. The final image (“growing light from bone”) reweights the entire setting as an engine of transformation, not just backdrop. A hair more constraint (e.g., the setting actively complicating a choice) would push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.0)
    The arcade is vividly realized—“a memorial to velocity that now celebrated patience,” with brass fixtures, glass panels, marble floors, and a real-water fountain—anchoring tone and theme. Details feel filtered through Vera’s sensibility, especially the contrast between holographic ads above and stubbornly physical rituals below. The space functionally supports the codes (sidewalk, fountain, mail slot) but doesn’t significantly constrain tactics or options. Strong, atmospheric worldbuilding, but the environment could bear more direct pressure on choices to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory is vivid and purposeful: cobalt dome, autumn wind, lamplight, and glass all mirror the story’s focus on looking versus listening. The eternal candle and silk function as micro-settings/tools that directly shape her tactics and inflect the closing image. Environmental and atmospheric details are consistently filtered through Mira’s priorities, avoiding generic description. The setting constrains and enables spying in plausible ways, and the final return to flame and leaves gives the world a charged, lived-in feel.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mangrove labyrinth, moonlight pool, and condensation text are vivid and purposeful, consistently filtered through Celeste’s history and profession. The environment does more than decorate: the labyrinth’s non-navigability matches her suspended decision, and its parting at the end charges the closure image. The gargoyle shard and moonlight operate as micro-setting elements that constrain where and how the emotional climax happens. A slightly broader sense of physical risk or constraint from the environment (beyond mood) could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mist-clad atrium, condensation-amber light, and the plastic hospital furniture create a vivid, specific environment that feels lived-in rather than decorative. The setting’s cocooning mist and twilight tone directly mirror and support the emotional state and the “translation as healing” theme. The brain coral fragment functions as a micro-setting object that meaningfully charges the final image and Marina’s contemplated action. Weather/atmosphere are not just postcard detail; they shape the mood and enable the sense of suspended, liminal time.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    The fog-bound orchard district is vividly realized, with skeletal trees, faded mural ghosts, and perpetual mist that shapes both atmosphere and the choice to paint with light. Setting feels lived-in and thematically integrated: ruins of communal harvest art mirror her creative desolation, and the fog’s constancy turns the place into a cloistered sanctuary. The recurring objects (fog, trees, fragment, glowing mural) charge the final image of the luminous wall in twilight. While the environment doesn’t force hard tactical constraints, it meaningfully colors every choice and the ending’s resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sound wave garden is vividly realized and integral: horns, resonators, mist, and sonic panels are not just décor but the mechanism by which the art exists. World rules (sound etching, treated panels, reflected frequencies) stay consistent and are revealed through action, not exposition dumps. The environment directly shapes how Margot can seek answers and how the portrait appears. A touch more interaction between her body and space under peak pressure could push it even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.3)
    The entomologist’s greenhouse is vivid and specific—sweating glass, beetles, moths—and its atmosphere of contained, teeming life elegantly mirrors the clandestine, organic resistance they’re planning. Details are filtered through Marcus’s scholarly eye and the emotional weight of Voss’s legacy. The setting also functions as a resource and symbolic origin point for the plan, though it rarely constrains concrete choices. Overall, it strongly supports tone and theme without feeling like a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.0)
    The gargantuan shell and reef are vividly, specifically rendered and inseparable from the story’s logic: the spiral architecture mirrors the postcard, houses the glowing poetry, and becomes library/hospital. Setting is always filtered through Minerva’s perception (ocean memory, calcium prayers, reef-shadow joy) and directly shapes what she can do—cultivate algae, host refugees, project lullabies into the water. The final image (writing light on walls, feeding the dark) is charged by all this prior environmental work. World rules are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition, achieving a high level of atmosphere without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly imagined and tightly woven with the emotional and thematic fabric: opal walls, glass orchids, foxglove regret, and the museum of extinct feelings all feel of a piece. Details are purposeful rather than touristic; the environment is discovered through Mira’s tasks and ascent, not via static catalog. The geography (floating library, spiral staircase, apex chamber) is clear enough to ground the ritual and the final image, and the opal architecture meaningfully charges the ending (“refracted everything into rainbows of sound and color”). The world’s rules are consistently fantastical without needing heavy explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    The Extinct Language Archive is vivid and purposeful—“cathedral of silence,” phosphorescent moss, clay tablets—anchoring mood and premise without excess. The setting directly enables the Veth’ari device and the ink well, and the archive’s stillness heightens the emotional stakes. It doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, but it charges the thematic frame and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dormant volcano amphitheater and its “breathing” stone are vivid and thematically apt, with heat, fissures, and sulfurous light integrated into action rather than tacked-on description. The environment mirrors and charges the moral stakes—living stone holding hidden compassion—and the “breathing” motif returns at the end to deepen the sense of charged poise. The antique chain functions as a micro-setting object that bridges generations and anchors both the cipher and the final image. While the physical space doesn’t aggressively constrain tactics, it meaningfully colors every choice and the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    The attic and skylight are vividly rendered (“smelled of decay and possibility”) and consistently refracted through Elara’s sensibility, giving the piece a strong, coherent atmosphere. The micro-setting of trunk and skylight—not just seen but used as a balancing platform and meditation site—shapes her rituals and how she lets Mira in. The meteorite as an object-in-setting is exquisitely integrated, charging both the central realization and the closing image. Environmental details never feel touristic; they’re sparse, chosen, and thematically live.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prism terrace and its “clouds that tasted of forgotten harvests” are vividly rendered and filter through Wren’s agricultural/maze-inflected sensibility, giving the world a distinct texture. Setting shapes stakes and choices: the drifting terrace as an endless maze analogue, the salvaged bench as her truth-compass, and the violet threshold as the site of final action. Environmental rules (light that lies, prism gravity, drifting) stay consistent and matter for how she navigates knowledge and options. The setting charges the final image—the terrace halting at the threshold—making the environment feel inseparable from the story’s meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.0)
    The underwater facility and “shadowseam wonder” are vivid, original, and filtered through Marina’s sensibility in a way that shapes both mood and meaning. Environmental specifics (moon pool, geodesic domes, bioluminescent algae, drowned valleys) are not postcard detail; they underpin the themes of forgottenness, liminality, and alternative forms of life and attention. The setting constrains what’s possible—this research refuge below social currents—and returns, charged, in the final image of “the forgotten place where darkness and light stitched themselves together.” The phoenix hawk feather and the fish outside the curved window act as micro-settings that directly charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.8)
    The iridescent cave and crystal geode are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action (“her bare feet finding purchase on crystal formations that hummed with trapped light”). Setting and objects (seeds, crystals, crater glass, rainbows) aren’t just backdrop; they become the grammar of the story’s insight and the final image. The environment constrains and guides her choices—where to sit, where to plant seeds, how light refracts through glass and tears to reweight grief. It’s lush without feeling like a static postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal arcade is exceptionally rendered and integrated: water, columns, stars, acoustics, and tides all directly shape Marina’s tactics and the sensory experience. The environment evolves with action (child splashing, tides, reflections) and culminates in the closing image of ripples distorting stars, charging the theme. Details are selective and character-filtered rather than touristic. This is professional-grade scene-building, just shy of transcendent only because the setting doesn’t quite force a high-stakes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)
    The twilight garden, starlight on stone, ocean breath, and obsidian pillars form a vivid, coherent environment that matches the story’s lyrical mode. The setting usefully externalizes exile (edge of the world, beyond Magisters’ reach) and frames the secret ritual, though it rarely constrains concrete choices beyond providing sanctuary. World rules around the nostalgia ban and tide temples feel consistent and are learned through action and memory rather than dumpy exposition. A slightly tighter linkage between specific physical constraints of the space and the choreography or risk would deepen the integration.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    The harbor setting, mist, prism atrium, and dawn light are vivid, specific, and tightly filtered through a glazier’s eye. Environment isn’t postcard backdrop: light, fog, glass, and water directly produce the story’s key images and her method of “communing,” and the final beams gilding the fishing boat charge the ending. Pearl Bay at dawn, the abandoned pier, and the harbor infrastructure (breakwater, lighthouse foundation) all meaningfully shape what she can and will do next. Setting and recurring objects (glass, water, light) clearly constrain choices and deeply color theme.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    The moonlit ridge path, narrowing trail, and clearing with its rock are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Marcus’s body memory as a firefighter. The environment constrains him modestly (narrow path, exposed roots, climb) and more strongly charges the final image as the ashes disperse along the ridge and into the mountain she’d planned to climb. Celestial details (Saturn, Jupiter, meteors) effectively frame the human-scale grief against an indifferent cosmos without feeling like postcard description. The setting mostly supports atmosphere and theme rather than materially altering tactics, which keeps it just short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tide-polished grotto, refracted light, water sounds, and glass beads create a vivid, coherent micro-world tightly bound to the speculative conceit. The environment is not just decorative: the grotto’s reflective stone literally enables the parallel-timeline mechanic and forces this to be a clandestine, liminal space. The recurring descent/ascent (grotto to sun) charges the final image with a physicalized before/after. A touch more non-visual sensory grounding under peak beats could push this higher, but as is it’s strong and economical.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ivy-veiled corridors, repurposed megastructures, and stone humming with stored sound are vivid and integrated into Mira’s perception, not mere backdrop. The environment is inseparable from the premise—walls as living archives—and the final tactile gesture (palm against stone) charges the closing image with accumulated setting detail. The world-building around climate shifts and underground habitation is sketched economically yet feels coherent. Setting could constrain choices slightly more, but as atmosphere and thematic engine it’s very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    The terrace, prism parapet, after-rain light, and distant bells create a vivid, coherent physical and tonal environment. The setting isn’t mere backdrop: she comes specifically “after rain” for the prism light, and the bells’ impending ringing constrains her window. Environmental details (echoing children’s voices, spring softness, crystalline parapet) are tightly interwoven with theme and final image. The last beat—rainbows blessing the painting, the terrace as sanctuary—shows the setting charging the story’s closure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    The terrace, Valley of Echoes, wildflowers-through-bones, and twin moons are vivid and thematically charged without feeling like a catalogue. Setting is integrated into action and choice: the midsummer terrace and celestial alignment constrain timing and method, and the valley’s flawed beauty refracts Elara’s worldview. The ebony clipboard and dawn at the end function almost as micro-settings, charging the final image. A touch more sensory variety (sound, temperature) under peak pressure could deepen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    The salt flat, bruised sky, and approaching storm are vivid and specific, and the environment meaningfully shapes the act (dry lakebed, underlying cavern, eventual refilling with water). Details like salt dissolving around her knees and the acoustic resonance of the cavern tie setting directly to purpose and closure. The recurring weather and salt imagery charge the final image of her walking away coated in salt. Setting is not just backdrop but the material consequence of her past choices and the vessel for her memorial.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    The silver courtyard, falling snow, and prism sanctuary are vividly rendered and integrated with mood and meaning, not just as backdrop. The prism physically anchors the ritual and its dimming charges the closure image. Weather and cold contrast effectively with Meridia’s “alarming serenity,” especially when she no longer feels the snow at the end. The setting could do a bit more to constrain options or introduce risk, but it already carries strong atmospheric and symbolic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.3)
    The decommissioned radar dome is vivid and specific—“fallen moon,” “curved walls amplified every sound,” surf outside—and it strongly governs atmosphere. Its acoustics and half-light subtly support the themes of echo, surveillance, and partial illumination without being over-labored. The final image of words traced in dust inside this obsolete listening device nicely charges the setting with conceptual weight. It stops short of directly constraining physical choices, so its role is more thematic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    The grotto above the clouds is evoked with vivid, economical detail (“pocket of impossible green,” “clouds drift below her like slow rivers”) that is always filtered through Vera’s purpose. Setting and recurring objects (grotto, mist, wood, rope, moth wing) directly charge the final images of temporary cathedrals and dismantling. The environment meaningfully constrains the story’s options: the remoteness and altitude make this a singular, almost sacred corridor, justifying the uniqueness of Vera’s act and precluding witnesses other than her. This is exemplary scene-building; I’d only withhold a 9+ because the physical constraints of the space don’t significantly alter tactical choices beyond atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ice sanctum, aurora, and rope are vivid and integrated, not backdrop: the frozen fragility, centuries of accretion, and auroral energy all constrain what Elin can do and how. Environmental specifics (ice groaning, translucent walls, energy flowing through patterned objects) are consistently filtered through her craftsperson’s perspective. The setting’s rules stay stable and directly enable the memory-transcription mechanic. The final image—the fading aurora and ice singing with names—recharges the opening atmosphere with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    The vine-draped bunker, bioluminescent fungus, storm, and rewilded forest are vivid, economical, and consistently filtered through Mira’s sensibility. The setting does more than decorate: the bunker’s Latin inscription and preserved console dictate discoveries; the storm times and energizes the revelation and frames the “when the storm approaches” directive. Environmental elements evolve across the piece—the bunker “humming with approval,” vines tightening, storm parting—to charge the final image and mirror the thematic shift. This tight integration of recurring place and weather with stakes and closure earns a very high score.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and specific: Nebuchadnezzar’s palace with telescopes, lapis tiles, clerestory windows, and regime shifts creates a strong atmospheric frame filtered through Mira’s priorities. The “ancient Babylon…reimagined” idea feels coherent with the magic-square architecture and feeds the tone of palimpsest and forgotten projects. However, the environment rarely constrains her choices; it’s more an evocative stage than an active pressure or resource beyond providing solitude and the artifact. The final descent of the ziggurat nicely echoes the opening, giving the place a subtle structural role in the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    The soundless sanctuary “between moments” is vivid and conceptually integrated: the refusal of sound requires touch and gesture, and shifting reality affects how Mireva moves versus how Thorne stumbles. The music box functions as both object and micro-setting, carrying history and charging the final image. World rules around silence and liminal time are consistent and taught through action rather than exposition dumps. A slightly wider sensory palette (body sensations, textures of the shifting space) could push atmosphere from strong to immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the fog, twilight frost, dead apple trees turned stone, and the weight of the workshop stones all reinforce the boundary/erasure theme while grounding the scene. The fog functions as an active environmental force—erasing roads and horizons and synchronizing with her breath—rather than mere backdrop. Tools and micro-setting (the ruin, the clearing, the sextant) are tactically used, especially in the final image of her walking back through the frost with the sextant. The one limitation is that the physical constraints of the environment don’t significantly impede her, operating more as metaphysical than practical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    The orchard-in-the-rafters cathedral is strikingly original and consistently rendered through Mira’s professional gaze and physical navigation. Details like apples glowing “like lanterns,” trees rooted in dust, and a bird nesting in a sideways tree enrich tone and theme rather than acting as postcard description. The environment constrains and shapes action (the climb, the wedging between branches to open the bag) and charges the final sense of renewal. It could exert a bit more concrete danger or constraint to reach the very top tier, but as-is it’s a major asset.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    The astral orchard is vivid and particular, with silver blossoms drifting upward, soil-less trees, and odd structures (bathroom, kitchen, nursery) that all feel of a piece. Setting consistently mirrors and amplifies Maren’s interior state—welcoming yet wrong—and the cameo and journal are well integrated into the environment. The bathroom as micro-setting does shape action by being the designated breakthrough site, though the broader orchard rarely constrains choices so much as color them. Overall, atmosphere is strong and distinctive, just shy of using environment as a firm tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.5)
    The hollowed mountain, nautilus shelves, and living-library conceit are vivid and integral, not mere backdrop. Crucially, the setting exerts pressure: the moving, sentient Library, the recursive stacks, and the mountain’s shame all shape what’s possible and what’s at stake. The environment is filtered through Mira’s botanical/linguistic sensibility in specific ways (“root systems and chlorophyll patterns”). This setting is hard to swap out without breaking the story’s logic and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned carnival ship in the foggy bay is vividly realized—the rusted Ferris wheel, funhouse mirrors, skeletal tent, and carousel all work together tonally. Details are filtered through Maya’s stakes (the Chimera Twins poster echoing her twin-like loss, the emerald color link), and the final image of the card on the deck recharges environment and object. The setting is more atmospheric than constraining; it shapes mood and theme more than concrete tactical options. Even so, the ship and carnival logic feel integral rather than postcard-decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mechanism room is vivid and functional: brass gears, escapement, and the ceremonial rope all matter to both plot and theme, culminating in the altered rhythm of the gears and the rare bell tone. The Unity Cord as object-setting integrates history, ritual, and magical infrastructure, directly constraining what Mira must do with her archivist’s hands. The environment’s mechanical heart synchronizing with the “university’s buried heart” usefully charges the final image. This is one of the story’s most polished dimensions.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    The harmonic caves, crystalline growths, frozen waves, and thermal disruptions are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with Vera’s perception and methods. Setting directly constrains options (shifting walls, new ice, frequencies) and enables tactics (reading cracks, acoustic properties of the bloom of hush). The echo chamber stone and the chamber’s sound-absorbing geometry charge the final image. This is rich, economical worldbuilding; a minor reason it doesn’t go higher is that environmental hazard never quite bites hard enough to sharpen risk.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    The glass humming pavilion, poisoned valleys, and beacon tower create a vivid, specific post-collapse world, and details like the music of the wind and the crystal’s resonance feel integrated rather than ornamental. Setting constrains action: she deliberately goes to the pavilion because it amplifies memory, and the beacon’s visibility across the valleys matters to the survivors. The recurring visual of glass, light, and hum charges the final image when the pavilion’s chord carries alongside the beacon’s blaze. A touch more interaction between hostile environment (poisoned valleys) and immediate choices could have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stormlit observatory, solid fog, brass instruments, and crystal forecourt are richly imagined and sensorially specific, with details filtered convincingly through an archivist’s priorities. Setting and objects are thematically charged—crystals, shadows, and stormlight all echo fragmented memory and unstable truth—and the final image of the whispering forecourt below reinforces this. The environment influences method (shadow-length verification) and mood more than tactical constraints, so it reads as profoundly atmospheric rather than decisively shaping available actions. Nonetheless, the world feels coherent, distinctive, and lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    The blooming fortress, jasmine-draped ramparts, and tiled mosaics create a vivid, specific environment that’s tightly filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Setting meaningfully shapes events: the mosaic-as-message directs her to the tower, the fortress’s height and the starless sky provide the canvas and stakes for the display, and the mosaics later multiplying the light deepens the payoff image. Details feel purposeful rather than touristic, and the recurring physical world (tiles, vines, tower, sky) mirrors the internal arc without heavy-handed symbolism. The environment charges the final image but doesn’t strongly constrain choices beyond that, which holds this just under the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grotto, tidal pools, and starlight are vivid and purposeful, mirroring the theme of liminal spaces and patiently carved change without slipping into tourist catalog. Details like “each one a universe in miniature” and the grotto as “witness to countless conversations that had fractured and healed” are clearly filtered through Mira’s sensibility. The jade cicada and the pools charge the final image of “slow work of emergence” and healing, making environment and object function as micro-setting constraints on meaning. The setting doesn’t much alter physical tactics, but it powerfully shapes tone and thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    The xenial trellis, crystalline vines, and inverted golden clouds are vividly realized and strongly filtered through Mira’s sensibility, giving the piece a memorable spatial and sensory signature. World rules around gravity inversion and vine growth stay internally consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition bloat. The setting meaningfully reframes her trauma—an open, hospitable lattice above the clouds as the anti-bunker—and charges the final choice to remain and “climb higher.” The environment could drive tactics a bit more directly, but it already does solid work in tone, constraint, and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    The drifting prism terrace, crystalline towers, and auroral twilight are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Eris’s acoustically trained perception. Sound-behavior—pockets of stillness, whispered echo-corridors, cable vibrations—feels integral rather than decorative and directly informs her navigation and the story’s thematic core. The terrace’s geometry and drift are not just backdrop but the medium she alters, charging the final image of “a sky that had learned…to comfort without speaking.” World rules (storm harmonics, terraces shattering) are sketched efficiently and never contradict themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Meridia’s sensibility—crystalline paths, kaleidoscopic water, circuitry-wrapped trunks, and luminescent fruit all feel both physical and thematically charged. The environment meaningfully constrains choice: the hidden orchard’s seclusion explains the empire’s limbo, the murals embedded in structures dictate her route, and the tree-doorway plus dawn deadline shape when and how she can act. World rules (like the holographic crown and monitoring circuitry) are introduced with just enough clarity to feel coherent without expository drag. It stops just shy of a 9-band because weather and terrain rarely push back against her, serving more as enchanted backdrop than active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ashen charcoal sanctuary, burned letters, indifferent stars, and dust patterns create a strong, lived-in, tonally unified space that mirrors Mira’s inner state. Objects like the iron doorknocker and the charcoal floor are not mere décor—they frame key actions (threshold dissolution, shared sitting) and charge the final sense of a modified sanctuary. World rules around “shadow keeper arts” and thresholds are consistent and learned through action and brief explanation. The environment affects emotional options more than physical tactics, which is effective but keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    The underground bioluminescent mushroom farm, the liminal-hour physics of concepts, and the pressure-bearing bolt are vivid, specific, and integrated with action rather than postcarded. The environment meaningfully shapes what’s possible—her practiced channeling into the earth and the mushrooms is what allows pressure to become diamonds. A minor limitation is that sensory range leans heavily visual and conceptual; a touch more tactile or bodily immediacy in the highest-pressure beat could have deepened atmosphere further.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sepia reading room and its objects are rendered with rich, selective sensory detail that supports tone and theme: amber light, leather spines, dust motes, the moth-gray volume, and the gramophone all feel concrete and filtered through Margaret’s sensibility. Setting is not just backdrop—the room is built on a standing-wave “resonance point” and functions as the necessary environment for her revelation. The recurring light imagery (amber to golden to purple dusk) and the room as sanctuary meaningfully charge the final image. Description occasionally leans lush, but it remains controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    The alchemical greenhouse and wounded sky are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Aldric’s perceptions, with strong images like “glass panels rippling like water” and glowing pomegranates charging the atmosphere. Setting is not postcard-only: the permanent night, the glass enclosure, and the phosphorescent fruit directly shape what is possible and culminate in the new star image that reweights everything. World rules (endless night from the star conjunction, vanished alchemists) are sketched efficiently and stay internally consistent. A minor limitation is that physical constraints (e.g., temperature, tactility of the threads) are more symbolic than materially binding, which keeps this just shy of fully immersive embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    The file room, dust patterns, manila folders, and the single button create a vivid, tactile micro-world that feels lived-in and thematically charged. Details like “dust patterns” and shelves “stretching toward the ceiling” do double duty as atmosphere and metaphor for neglect and memory. The environment constrains what’s possible—quiet, solitary, archival work—and it directly charges the closure image of her returning to those same shelves.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    The auric lagoon, the bioluminescent gold, the puddle reflections, and the buried Pacific Bell infrastructure create a vivid, specific environment that is clearly filtered through Mira’s perspective. Setting meaningfully constrains and enables action: the puddles provide the map, the concrete pillar hides the Vault, and the lagoon’s engineered beauty thematically contrasts with erased history. The final return to the glowing lagoon charges the last image with a sense of what has been obscured, not just scenic prettiness. A bit more multisensory or texturally lived detail under pressure could have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through her musical and emotional focus—mist, crystals, dewdrops, and brass all feel lived-in rather than decorative. The radiant grotto and prism atrium are not just backdrops but thematically charged, mirroring the breaking and scattering of the prophecy. Environmental details (fog responding to sound, dewdrops forming) are woven into action and climax, charging the final image. The cave doesn’t quite constrain her tactical options so much as echo them, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ashen skyborne arbor, soot-cloud trees, mist-drinking roots, and suspended walkways create a vividly original, coherent environment that is filtered through Wren’s professional gaze. Setting is not just decorative: the vertical abyss, the sky-trees, and the peculiar “hush” time all shape what is possible and when the messages can be read. The recurring objects (seeds, leaves, moonstone probe, tiny monuments) all feel physically embedded in this world and charge the final image. This could edge higher only if the environment more directly constrained a tactical choice at the turning point rather than primarily framing atmosphere and vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is rich and purposeful: moss-slick stairs, bioluminescent fungi, the impossible underground greenhouse, and the eternally falling waterfall are all filtered through Mira’s instrument-maker sensibility. Environmental features matter to action (path behind the waterfall, digging in disturbed soil, the ventilated glasshouse) and strongly charge the final image—“The waterfall continued its eternal fall… keeping time with nothing” ties atmosphere directly to theme. At times the description verges on lushness that slightly outruns immediate pressure, but it remains controlled and integrated into movement rather than stalling it.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rain-washed foundry, furnace, and iron beams are vivid and consistently filtered through Mira’s emotional state, with the environment mirroring the thematic move from catastrophe to renewal. The setting is not just backdrop: the foundry’s history, the crucible, and the morning light all charge the final image. A slightly deeper integration of tactile constraints (heat, danger, physical risk) affecting her actions could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    Echo Gorge, the narrowing “throat of striated stone,” and the bone-white harp create a vivid, coherent physical space whose acoustics (echoes, spectral voices) are thematically apt. The setting feels lived-in through details like ghostly repetitions of her footsteps and the “hidden sunrise,” and it mirrors her internal constriction and eventual opening without shouting the symbolism. The crocodile’s tooth functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image, though the gorge itself doesn’t heavily constrain on-page choices beyond being the locus for the harp. Overall, atmosphere and specificity are strong and well-integrated with tone.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ultraviolet forest is richly realized and tightly integrated: its light both reveals the governing numbers and justifies her escape during the ritual, and its “nodes” and pulses concretize the moral calculus. Environmental detail is filtered through her altered body, so setting and embodiment fuse—she literally reads the trees as a computer. The closing image of her remaining in the forest, burying the mask among violet roots, shows the environment constraining and charging the final choice. Minor worldbuilding exposition (colonists’ ritual, Settlement Authority) stays within the frame and does not dilute the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    The alchemist’s market above the rooftops, phosphorescent lanterns, and tiny paintings with impossible scenes create a vivid, specific atmosphere integrated with Mira’s perceptual bias. World rules (hidden histories in paintings, overlapping worlds) are consistent and learned through her actions. The environment mirrors liminality nicely but doesn’t strongly constrain her tactics moment to moment, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is textured and specific—peeling red paint, rusted turnstile, dust patterns—filtered through Miriam’s professional and ghost-attuned gaze. Environmental details meaningfully interact with action: the fluorescent light’s buzz and failure cue the ghost, dust patterns signal unseen movement, and ceiling stains mirror Miriam’s compulsion to “look up.” The mainspring as an object-as-setting recurs and charges the final image. A slight further constraint from the environment (e.g., physical limitations of the condemned space affecting choice) could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glass orchard library and cloud-sea are vividly realized and tightly integrated with the stakes—the fragility of glass, the ripening books, and the frost patterns all bear on what’s possible. Environmental changes (trees trembling, clouds tightening, cracks spreading, pages falling) track the story’s escalation and closure. The final images—books seeding the world below, the library descending—are inseparable from this specific setting. It stops just short of 9+ because the environment constrains mood and symbolism more than tactical options in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    The baroque asteroid, temporal storms, and visible ribbons of time are vividly realized and strongly filtered through Maren’s perceptions. Setting constraints meaningfully shape action: storms dictate the mirror-covering ritual, architecture doubles as “temporal sails,” and the shard and mirrors are charged environmental tools driving the final choice. World rules about visible time and temporal storms are consistent and learned through observation rather than exposition dumps. The setting is both beautiful and functional, though one more tactile interaction with the physical environment under stress might deepen its pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    The resonance chamber, copper walls, and array of music boxes are vivid and functionally integrated: the chamber focuses sound, the walls “sing,” and the environment is a tool, not wallpaper. Details are filtered through Elias’s craftsman sensibility, which keeps the imagery specific rather than generic “magic lab” décor. The chamber and boxes literally shape tactics (arranging focal point, harmonics) and also charge the final image of light carried out into the world. This micro-setting works as both mechanism and atmosphere, tightly bound to the story’s stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    The subterranean lagoon and limestone cathedral are vividly, economically rendered, with sensory detail (bioluminescence, mineral air, petrichor) that feels integral rather than decorative. Environment and key objects (lagoon, compass, jars, factory above) directly charge the final image: her staying is only legible because of the underworld’s contrast with the industrial surface. The world’s rules (psychometry, memory-bearing petrichor, compass pointing “down”) remain consistent and are learned through embodied action. Setting tightly mirrors and enables the Threshold concept, so removing it would break story logic and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.5)
    The storm-tossed archway, the peninsula, the inlet, and the weather are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with Marina’s perceptions and choices. The environment meaningfully constrains action (she must shelter under the archway; the lightning enables the layers of the slide to appear) and then charges the final image as the archway catches sun, its shadow “like a bridge.” Sensory detail feels selective and purposeful, with the mechanical “turbine” hum especially effective in modulating tone. This setting is both atmospheric and structurally important to how the revelation occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.0)
    The amber pavilion, cathedral glass, and melting snow are sharply realized and consistently used as more than backdrop: the window literally structures discovery, and the pavilion becomes a thematic sanctuary. Environmental shifts (night/dawn, winter/spring) closely track Mira’s understanding and the mural’s evolution. The final images of visitors in dawn light moving through that same space are charged by all the prior physical detail. Setting is not just vivid; it constrains what can be learned and how it is experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting work is vivid and purposeful, from “clouds the color of old bruises” to the obsidian lagoon as a literal and thematic wound. Environmental details (the rusted fence, reclaimed sand, parley debris, zeppelin shadow) anchor action and charge the final images. Worldbuilding around water riots and reclamation zones is economical yet convincing, and the rules feel internally consistent. The setting also meaningfully shapes the story’s metaphors of buried history and resurfacing truth rather than serving as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cove, paper lanterns, bioluminescent algae, and Wishing Stone are vivid and purposeful, not postcard garnish. Setting materially shapes the solution: she retools the village’s lantern tradition into crystallized-memory lanterns, and the final tableau of swaying, lit lanterns is charged. World rules around wishes and memory extraction are consistent and learned through action rather than dumped. A touch more sensory variety or physical constraint in her process could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vividly and efficiently drawn: an ancient orchard sixty stories up, bruised-plum sky, apples falling in numerical patterns—all filtered through Maren’s specialized perception. The garden and tower are not mere backdrop: the prophecy literally references towers and crown-gardens, and the trees actively respond with coordinates, so environment and object charge the plot and ending image. World rules around the foghorn “window” and transplanted monastery feel internally consistent and learned through action rather than dump. This is rich, distinctive atmosphere that meaningfully shapes the story’s logic, though one more tactile interaction with the space at the climax could have deepened constraint.

    The icebound atrium is vividly, economically realized—the frozen garden, glass dome, starlight, and crystalline ice all feel specific and lived-in rather than generic. Crucially, the environment isn’t postcard-only: the ice’s molecular structure is what her humming works on, and the atrium’s preservation function directly underpins the logic of the seeds and the vortex. The oak cap, ice, and fountain all return in the ending, charging the final image with both history and promise. A slightly wider sense of the outside world (beyond the brief “world…thawing” mention) could deepen context, but the local setting work is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sanctuary above the clouds, the impossible microclimate, and the rope/bell architecture are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Mira’s professional sensibility. Setting isn’t postcarded; pressure patterns, equilibrium, and “where storms come to die” all structurally matter to the zero-hour premise and the final act. The environment and the rope as recurring object clearly charge the final image, though the physical space doesn’t significantly constrain her choices beyond mood and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.3)
    The observatory is vividly rendered and feels lived-in: stardust on the floor, moss in the stones, owls in broken scopes, the drifting station itself. The yellow lantern glass and the dome opening ground the cosmic imagery in tactile objects and spatial relations. While the setting strongly charges mood and theme, it rarely constrains concrete choices, which keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and particular: “scorched wasteland,” “abandoned beekeeping oasis,” bone-white hive boxes, and the stone cottage all create a strong atmospheric frame. Environmental details are consistently filtered through Maren’s orientation toward silence and ghosts, and they recur meaningfully in the final image (bees of gold across the walls; wasteland humming with ghosts). The oasis and wasteland logically enable her isolation and the pilgrimage of ghosts to this specific spot, so the world is not merely decorative. The only limitation is that the physical environment constrains mood and logic more than concrete tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    The emerald silo, glass walls, and green light are vivid and recur meaningfully, especially when the silo fills with green as Vera works and again when it “pulsed with anticipated mysteries.” The time-emotion world (numbers as feelings) is sharply specific and shapes how Vera and society conceptualize time, even if it doesn’t tightly constrain tactical choices. Details like “channels still tuned to the frequency of your childhood kitchen” are sensory and character-filtered, enriching atmosphere. The environment charges the final image, though it stops just short of directly forcing a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cobalt lagoon, post-rain hush, eucalyptus branches, and marshes provide a vivid, coherent environment that suffuses tone and images. Setting is not mere backdrop: the lagoon and wind enable the kite’s flight, the storm explains the smudged notebook, and the final image of the kite over the lagoon is charged by everything established. Details are consistently filtered through Mira’s sensibility, keeping description purposeful rather than touristic. This is strong enough that the environment feels meaningfully fused with theme and ending.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    The temple orchard of spiraled apple trees and living stone pillars is vivid, specific, and integral to both premise and ending. Environmental features (stone timescales, water access, copper-thread networks) literally shape what’s possible and charge the final image of copper gleaming “like threads of connection between worlds.” Details are filtered through Maren’s professional, devotional eye, avoiding tourist-catalog description. World rules for living stone and copper intention largely emerge through action rather than expository dumping and stay internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rainwashed tower, worn steps, bronze light, and overgrown sculpture path create a vivid, specific atmosphere filtered through Mira’s scholarly, reflective gaze. The amber operates as both setting-object and thematic fulcrum, and the weather subtly mirrors the emotional shift (rain softening, sun breaking through). However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics beyond mood; it frames contemplation rather than forcing action. The specificity and integration are strong, but not quite to the “environment as palpable constraint” level.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting work is outstanding: the phosphorescent jetty, dead reef, battlefield headland, and luminous currents all feel specific, tactile, and integrated. Environment isn’t just backdrop; reef chemistry, tidal currents, and the birds’ vantage materially shape his choices about when/where/how to release seeds. The recurring jetty and sea imagery directly charge the final image of him alone over the “narrow vastness,” making place inseparable from theme. This is publication-ready atmospheric worldbuilding.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    The scrapyard settlement and wasteland are vividly evoked (“metal dreams of being earth again,” “towers of compressed cars”), and the environment feels lived-in rather than touristic. Setting meaningfully shapes action: the compost pit exists because of the settlement’s practices, and becomes the key to locating the box. The recurring metal/earth imagery charges both the clue (“where metal dreams of being earth again”) and the final image of ongoing transformation behind her. This integration of world, symbol, and plot is strong enough to reach the high band, though one might want one more moment where the environment constrains rather than simply frames her movement.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observation deck, warped temporal field, and starfield are vivid and integrated with action and thought, not just backdrop. Time dilation and emptiness tangibly shape what she can do and what it costs, while the journal and compass rose function as charged micro-setting objects. Details like emergency lighting and “stars that moved like honey” support mood and concept. The environment clearly constrains choice and charges the final image, meeting high-band criteria.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Icebound Spire, sky-wrong, and cloud-ice chess pieces are vivid and specific, and details are filtered through Corwin’s sensibility as an “apprentice of wonder.” The environment isn’t just decorative: the temporal fold of the wrong sky is diegetically necessary to open the vault, and the final contrast with proper dawn reweights the sky’s earlier wrongness as gift. Spatially, the piece stays coherent—tower peak, vault, descent—and the recurring sky image meaningfully charges the ending. A bit more tactile constraint from the ice and altitude could have pushed this toward the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    The whispering gallery and the chessboard are superbly integrated: acoustics that amplify absence, a board with missing pawns, and the empty palace during interregnum all charge Vera’s rituals. Setting isn’t postcard; it constrains what’s possible (solitude, ability to leave a message for an unseen monarch) and shapes her tactics. The final image—pawns restored in the silent gallery, game-as-memorial—is inseparable from this environment. Details remain selective and purposeful, never cluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mountain-sized labyrinthine bookstore is vivid, specific, and thematically fused with the story—the store literally rooted into the rock and later revealed as a book in the lost language. Environmental shifts (“the bookstore noticed… its corridors shifted around her”) actively respond to Vera’s progress and open new passages, so setting constrains and enables choices. The mountain-as-text realization charges both the middle discovery and the final climb toward the peak. Detail is economical yet evocative, filtered through Vera’s relationship with the stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    The time-frozen village, platinum labyrinth, and ever-distant thunder are vivid, integrated, and filtered through Marcus’s preoccupations (“woven hush,” preserved moments). The world’s rules (traded future time for one endless present) are efficiently embedded in the tapestry decoding, and the environment meaningfully shapes the story’s premise and closure. The village’s stillness reconfiguring from suspension to “fierce repose” at the end charges the final image. A minor limiter is that the physical environment does not significantly constrain his tactical options beyond serving as the metaphysical stage.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is striking and purposeful: towers of bone, perpetual mist, and echoing canyon all interact directly with the plot, especially the echoes enabling the refracted-truth strategy. Details are filtered through Sera’s relationship to the place (childhood hiding spots, scrubbed-away paintings), which keeps description from feeling touristic. The environment constrains tactics and charges the final image (“bone towers hummed,” fingers on “warm bone”), though a few more tactile or non-visual cues under peak pressure could deepen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    The acid sea, copper pontoons, and gear-cathedral workshop are vivid and consistently filtered through Vera’s attention. Crucially, the environment is not just decorative: the devouring sea and precarious suspension mirror and pressure her liminal emotional state, and the workshop physically responds to her ritual. The final image of a gold-veined workshop drifting through emerald mist is powerful and charged by prior detail. A slight limitation is that the acid sea threatens but never quite constrains a tactical choice beyond mood and metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the coastal drive, the nearly hidden path, and especially the cave’s “cathedral built by water and time” all mirror and deepen the themes of time, memory, and persistence. Details like phosphorescent pools, mineral “tears,” and the tiny, scuttling crabs make the place felt rather than generic. Crucially, both the cave and the seashell charge the final image and his choice: the environment enables the revelatory painting and stands in dialogue with the ancient wall art. The only slight limit is that the cave doesn’t significantly constrain tactical choices beyond inspiring him—it functions more as resonant stage than obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cobalt lighthouse, the heat-scorched coast, and the impossible night-garden scent are sharply evoked and always filtered through Mira’s tired, attentive gaze. The setting does more than decorate: the tower’s function as a listening post and “loud” beacon directly underwrites the thematic opposition of light vs. listening, shouts vs. whispers. Environmental detail evolves meaningfully—the shift from lethal heat to cool stone and ordinary sea air parallels emotional cooling and the boy’s stabilization. The final image of the tower’s long shadow and the objects in her hands is charged and specific, giving the setting true closure weight.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    The signal station, failing hydraulics, sea, stars, and salvaged glass are all vividly drawn and consistently filtered through Mira’s priorities. Crucially, environment constrains choice: the hydraulic breakdown forces a manual, mirror-based beacon; the buried landline allows the calls; the censer foot and sea-wrack physically anchor the theme of return. The final image—starlight refracted over the water, censer at the array’s center, returning lights on the horizon—derives its charge directly from this setting logic. Details are economical yet specific, with no white-room moments or postcard superficiality.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    The hanging orchard over a ravine, trees on steel cables, and storms tearing them down create a vivid, specific environment that mirrors and contextualizes her emotional precariousness. The setting justifies her isolation (no one climbs down here) and charges the final image of roots reaching toward nothing, surviving anyway. Weather and geography affect possibilities—this is a place built for solitude and risk. The world beyond the ravine is sketched more lightly, but enough to sustain plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the opal dock, mist, and lighthouse are not decor but emotional architecture, mirroring isolation and liminality. The Edelweiss and alpine/sea contrast deepen place through implied geography rather than exposition. The environment charges the final image—the dock as a patient threshold for offerings—and the lighthouse beam underscores Elias’s vocation. While the setting does not physically constrain choices, it thematically shapes every move, sustaining a strong atmospheric integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    The shop, ridge, and especially the blooming cavern are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail—“glimmer like captured starlight,” sweet earthy perfume, and the spatial layout of platforms and water create a lived space rather than a postcard. Environment constrains action: the hidden crack, the need to follow ants, and the rising creek all affect how and when she moves. The recurring objects (map, chip) are tightly integrated with setting, charging the final image of the new map with embedded matrix. Under peak pressure, the cavern’s tactile danger (slipperiness, cold, physical strain) could be even more foregrounded, but what’s here is strong and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    The physical and atmospheric setting is vividly realized: cobalt grotto, bleeding starlight, mist like funeral shrouds, and fireflies-as-stars create a cohesive, uncanny environment. These elements are not mere backdrop; the grotto and its starblood form the visual and emotional crucible for the revelation and final thematic weaponization. The mountain and mist tangibly shape the queen’s body experience (cold, burning muscles, concealment on descent), giving the world some physical consequence. It stops just short of 9-band because the environment influences mood and symbolism more than concrete tactical choices beyond the climb and concealment.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ember nexus, geothermal vents, and twilight are vivid and integrated into action—the heat shimmer, magma song, and pocket-sun’s glow all interact with character behavior and mood. The setting’s magical/technical rules feel coherent without exposition dumps, and the nautilus and pocket-sun act as micro-settings that structure gesture and attention. Atmosphere strongly supports the romantic-scientific tone and the theme of presence as density. The one limitation is that the environment colors and echoes the conflict more than it constrains specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mountain ranger cabin, birch trees, grave in the meadow, and peaks above are vividly rendered and recur as charged anchors (table, window, meadow, ridge). Setting is tightly tied to stakes: the isolated station enables chronicling, the grave anchors her fear, and the ridge/peaks frame the possibility of “flight.” Environmental detail is selective and filtered through Vera’s mind, supporting tone. A touch more tactile interaction with the space under pressure could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    The water clock repair shop and the morning fog are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elena’s tactile and visual attention. Environmental details—the dripping clocks, fogged windows, tarnish—mirror and charge the emotional state without feeling like mere decor. The tools and clocks constrain her actions and provide concrete means for the repair and for the closing image of time measured “drop by drop.” This object-rich micro-setting is tightly integrated with theme and character, though not quite to a transformative, 9+ level.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    The floating rock, amber twilight, and cloud-sea are vividly drawn and consistently filtered through Mira’s attention, with weather and altitude mirroring her internal volatility. The platform and its protections meaningfully shape the action—the “breath between storms,” the oncoming front, and the dry center create a held, ritualized space that charges every choice. Objects like the kettle, cups, and quill are integrated into both magic and theme, not just scenery. The final image of rain veiling the platform while she sits in a pocket of stillness uses setting to crystallize the story’s emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sheet music archive is vivid and functional, not decorative: dust, yellowed manuscripts, and flickering fluorescents create mood while also housing Eleanor’s unfinished score and reacting physically to the induced currents. The external orchard and its imminent destruction add a concrete clock and thematic echo, charging the final image with loss. Environmental detail is tightly chosen (fluttering sheets, humming generator, gray morning) and consistently filtered through Marcus’s musical-spiritual lens. The setting shapes stakes and closure but stops short of directly constraining tactics in surprising ways, which keeps it just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and tonally aligned: “stone that had forgotten the concept of erosion” and “pause between universal breaths” establish an otherworldly library that suits the premise. The spiraling architecture and temporal pocket concept integrate well with the theme of illusions of sequence and ending. Still, the environment rarely constrains her options or forces tactical adaptation; it serves more as a symbolic and atmospheric container than an active pressure. The temple library does charge the final image, but less through concrete constraint than metaphysical framing.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    The horizon measurement station, cliff, and “fjord quiet” are vividly and economically rendered, with details (brass instruments, hydraulic clocks, twilight over black glass water) tightly woven into action and theme. The environment constrains and colors the story: the isolation and stillness heighten the strangeness of the clocks and the horn ritual. The final image of the silent station aimed at the horizon is charged by all that came before. Setting is deeply integrated without feeling over-described.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mushroom farm is vividly evoked and tightly integrated: specific species, impossible colors, and mycelial “walls” all reflect and inform Maya’s emotional and conceptual journey. The setting isn’t just backdrop; the permeable light barriers directly shape her realizations and the story’s metaphors of grief and connection. The environment also structures movement (deeper rows, mapped thresholds) and charges the ending image of dawn and birdsong filtering down. It stops just short of 9+ because the setting doesn’t meaningfully constrain any practical choice; its pressure is conceptual and emotional rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: rain, submarine light, ivy, clover scent, and old paper all mirror the submerged, half-deciphered emotional terrain. The library isn’t just a backdrop; it’s where the coordinates lead and where her father’s documents reshape her understanding. The candle lantern and its cracked mica operate as a micro-setting/object that pointedly charges the final image. Weather and season (midsummer rain) modulate tone and feel character-filtered rather than cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    The subway utility tunnel, antique phone, and streetlamp-frequency frame are vividly specific and tightly integrated with the liminal, haunted mood. The glass harmonica disc functions as a micro-setting object that catches light and “sings,” charging both atmosphere and the final image. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, but it does conceptually shape Vera’s vocation as someone operating in literal/figurative underworld margins. World rules are consistent and economical; the quasi-mystical phone behavior feels intentional rather than sloppy.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.2)
    The harbor, blooming jetty, early roses, and archive are vivid and filtered through Marguerite’s sensibility as someone who catalogs subtle variation. The jetty at twilight and the roses blooming early are not just postcard images; they signal the covenant’s renewal and frame the Keeper’s emergence, then echo in the final sense of regenerated purpose. Environmental details are economical yet specific, and the recurring walnut ink / locket / roses triangulate setting, vocation, and magic. The setting stops just short of actively constraining tactics, but it strongly charges the atmosphere and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ivy-choked station, moss, foxes, and improvised lab are vivid and selective, strongly filtered through Maya’s perspective and mood. The environment mirrors the thematic arc (abandonment versus persistent reaching) and charges the final image, especially the ivy creeping toward light. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it does shape tone and thematic resonance. The integration of overgrowth and forgotten infrastructure with clandestine science feels specific and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ultrasonic forest, singing pines, seasonal constellation pause, and tactile cartographic tools form a richly specific and coherent environment. Setting is not postcard decoration; it actively constrains timing (the stellar pause) and defines her navigation method (sound through skin and boots). The stillpoint’s silence weaponizes the established sound-saturated world, charging the clearing with real conceptual weight. This is very strong, just shy of exceptional because the broader world beyond the forest remains almost entirely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    The gravitational anomaly, the station, and the observation port are vividly and economically drawn, and their rules stay consistent. The anomaly’s behavior (“unbend,” “folded like wet paper,” time distortions) is tightly tied to plot and theme rather than postcard description. The fountain pen works well as a micro-setting object that charges the final image and constrains her framing of the choice (through Okonkwo’s teachings). A touch more sensory texture of the station body/tech could push this higher, but what’s here is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.5)
    The luminous harbor, weathered dock, and lighthouse cottage are sharply drawn, with water and wood doubling as emotional and sensory anchors, especially in the opening and closing images. Details are filtered through Mira’s visual and tactile bias, which feels apt for a deaf photographer; the harbor’s history is evoked economically. However, the environment mostly serves as atmosphere and symbol rather than an active constraint on choices—the same conversation could happen on another evocative waterfront with minimal alteration. The filmless camera and wooden planks do charge the final image nicely, but setting stops short of reshaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mountain-archive environment is vivid, specific, and tonally aligned (“cathedral of whispers,” “volcanic heart”), and the Prescott Street library and tunnels add a lived-in sense of her past. Details are filtered plausibly through Miriam’s priorities (patterns in stone, temperature shifts) rather than tourist description. The setting isn’t just backdrop; the underground archive and its chambers directly frame the revelation and charge the final image. A bit more interaction with physical constraint or danger could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sound wave garden and auric lagoon are vivid, specific, and tightly integrated with mood and action (the sculptures storing sounds, the lagoon’s glow syncing with rhythm). Environment actively participates—the staircase, platform, and resonant materials are what allow Mira to trigger the transformation, and the final image of the dimmed lagoon charged with Elias’ presence lands strongly. World rules (resonant sculptures, quantum fibers) feel internally consistent at this length. This is near top-tier setting work; a touch more tactile engagement beyond sight and sound in the peak might deepen the embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    The container labyrinth and geomagnetic storm are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Celia’s practical, sound-based perception, giving the world a strong lived-in texture. Environmental rules (sound propagation, interference with markers and compasses, hidden maintenance routes) actively shape navigation choices. The final image of the storm crackling above the discovered cache elegantly ties atmosphere to theme. Setting isn’t just pretty dressing; it constrains and enables action throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the “cobalt dock,” canal, rain, and warped planks are not just pretty but directly tied to the brother’s death and the boy’s potential drowning. Environmental specifics—the junction of old waterway and new concrete channels, the boathouse with its shutters—constrain tactics and enable her intervention. Water’s “stillwater tension” mirrors her emotional state without feeling like blunt allegory. The recurring water/light interplay charges the final image of real stars replacing her artificial ones.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt library, mist, and magnetic grotto are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Eleanor’s sensibility, with details like iron foundations, spinning compasses, and mirrored ceiling doing real atmospheric work. Setting and object micro-setting (chessboard, queen, mirrors) recur and help charge the final image of her leaving the chess set behind. The environment doesn’t sharply constrain options, but it meaningfully frames this as a secret rebel space and heightens the sense of “amplified quiet.” Overall, the specificity and integration with theme and mood are high.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sublittoral fringe, tidal pool, and abyss are vividly realized and meaningfully tied to threshold imagery; the “underwater mountain wreathed in impossible light” effectively charges the final approach. Details like gills, tail, and pressure-as-embrace make the environment feel lived-in rather than postcard-like. World rules (Treaty, impossible violence) are sketched economically but consistently through setting and perception. The setting does constrain choice—only in these depths can she reach the island—but another specific constraint or hazard could have pushed it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and thematically integrated: turbines as “hands of a broken clock,” their hum drowning silence, the empty neighboring farms, the drone overhead, and the dried bouquet all feel specific and lived-in. Environment constrains choice—she stays in the isolated farmhouse because of the turbines and the flowers, and the open fields make surveillance a real pressure. Recurring objects (turbines, bouquet, carved figures) explicitly charge the final images and the wind/happiness metaphor. Detail selection stays tight and purposeful, with no white-room moments or tourist listing.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is a major strength: the cobalt atrium, humming quartz, and memory-ice are vivid and specific, and they’re always filtered through Mora’s poetic sensibility. Environment materially shapes the piece—the quartz responds to her reading, the frozen lake cracks, and the moths and reflection imagery charge the final image. The world rules (ice remembers, crystals hum and glow) are consistent and learned through action, not exposition dumps. This setting feels inseparable from the story’s core question about boundaries and the sacred.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glassblower’s courtyard, cooling furnaces, shards, and jasmine are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Mira’s sensory limits, then her expanded perception. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the furnace is the ritual site, heat and ash cue the phoenix’s aftermath, and the glass shards explicitly charge the final image and thematic insight (“beautiful because they were broken”). Details are well-chosen and economical; no white-room moments. This is strong enough in atmosphere and object-use to be publication-ready as-is.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is rich and specific: the Prism Cathedral, the forgotten Laboratory of Lost Sounds, and the equipment (phonograph horns, oscilloscopes, glass tubes) all feel lived-in and thematically charged. Details are filtered through Mira’s sonic-visual perception, so environment and tools are inseparable from how she thinks and chooses (traveling via recordings rather than physically). The persistent presence of light—golden through dust, spectra from the lens—charges the final image of her ringing bells with the lens around her neck. The only small gap is that the physical constraints of the lab don’t sharply limit options; they shape method more than they pressure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory is vivid and integral: its lack of clocks and cracked dome both ground the mood and directly motivate Elara’s refuge from measured time. Environment and object details (brass mount, great lens, star charts, vellum stencil) are filtered through her grief and craft, charging the setting with thematic weight rather than serving as static backdrop. The “place outside of time” quality actively shapes the community’s function and the final image of another mourner arriving. A bit more sensory range beyond the visual could further deepen atmosphere, but as is, the specificity and integration are high.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft, onyx cards, worn Persian rug, and measuring tape are vivid and coherent, creating a tactile, lived-in environment that strongly supports the mood and themes. Weather and loft height subtly echo isolation and the “sanctuary after collapse” frame. However, the setting rarely constrains concrete choices; it colors the scene rather than shaping tactics, which keeps it just shy of the highest band where environment becomes an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    The archive, obsidian door, bronze prism pagoda, and saffron veil are all concrete, sensorially rich, and consistently filtered through Mira’s historian/granddaughter gaze. Setting is not a backdrop: the archive’s non-Euclidean geometry and collapsing state, the pagoda’s twilight alignment, and the veil’s materiality all meaningfully constrain or charge her options. World rules around “atoms of nostalgia” and twilight boundaries feel internally consistent and legible without clunky exposition. At this length, it’s near-top-tier atmospheric work.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    The blooming library above the clouds, glass petals, hope-lattices, and flowing shadow-current form a vivid, coherent environment. Setting is not mere backdrop; the transformed library’s nature literally generates the unbound shadow and defines the stakes (preserved hopes for cloud-born generations). The river stone as a relic of Earth’s rivers and its final placement within the living library sharply charges the closing image. A slight limit is that the physical layout doesn’t significantly constrain tactics beyond mood and access, keeping this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    The misty, skylit workshop and surrounding forest are vividly and economically rendered, and they stay present as an emotional and thematic backdrop rather than a static postcard. The recurring specifics—the skylights, the mist, the owl, the worn wood, the enclosure frame—are filtered through Vera’s working attention and charge the final image of dawn and “something wild…set free.” Environment doesn’t sharply constrain physical options but it credibly shapes mood, isolation, and the sense of quiet labor under the stars.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tower at dawn, frost, stone floor, windowsill fern, ivy, and moss create a coherent, tactile space that feels lived-in and specific to these characters. Setting is not postcard-ish: the medical wing below, the garden passage, and the old monastery below-ground all directly influence options and stakes. The hourglass and coffee-ring desk function as micro-settings and tools that shape thought and choice. Atmosphere and environment consistently support the quiet, uncanny tone and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    The projection booth and projector are vividly realized, with purposeful, POV-filtered detail (“smelled of nitrate dreams,” “seats folded shut like sleeping birds”). Setting is not postcard décor; it meaningfully frames the grandmother’s past, enables the psychometric reading, and becomes the locus for the final offering. The Simplex in particular functions as a charged tool-object that anchors both memory and closure. The only reason this doesn’t reach the highest band is that external constraints from the environment remain relatively gentle, more thematic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    The aurora-lit archway, timeless peak, frosted instrument, and muted valley are rendered with vivid, selective sensory detail that strongly supports tone and theme. Setting is tightly integrated with action—the archway as a place “outside time” validates Elara’s rest and the sky’s behavior (aurora, falling stars) directly shapes her tactic via the instrument. The environment doesn’t quite constrain her choices in a tactical sense (there are no spatial or physical obstacles), but it absolutely charges the final image and the conceptual stakes. Overall, atmosphere and specificity are well beyond functional and feel purpose-built for this story’s concerns.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glowing dune, bioluminescent flowers, and “occasionally everywhere” archive are vividly drawn and tightly integrated with action—the anomaly appears there, the flowers sing, and their glow is literally spent to stabilize the child. The chess clocks and luminescent pollen act as recurring micro-settings/objects that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful rather than touristic; the world’s rules feel internally consistent within a lyric SF mode. The environment constrains options lightly rather than severely, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mechanical rainforest is vividly realized—copper leaves, brass trees, titanium vines—and consistently filtered through Mira’s perceptual biases as a philosopher attuned to “frequencies of thought.” Setting isn’t decorative: the differing tree-voices literally guide her choices, and the sequoia’s internal machinery creates the concrete problem she must solve. The environment and the small gear converge to constrain and enable the climactic act of repair. World rules feel internally consistent and are learned through observation and action rather than dumpy exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vividly and consistently rendered—the veiled ridgeway, mist, twilight, and shore of light feel like a coherent liminal world with a strong atmospheric signature. Details like the unnamed colors at the horizon and star-shaped impressions in the air ground the metaphysics in concrete imagery. Environment mostly supports tone and theme rather than constraining choice, but the twilight threshold and shore between regret and redemption meaningfully charge the final images. World rules (guides, tickets, accumulated courage) are introduced through action rather than exposition and remain consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cobalt fortress and encasing snow are strongly realized and tonally integral, with details like frost veins on the piano and dust on the staircase doing double duty for mood and plot. Environment directly constrains choices: the walls’ bargain with the storms defines the central dilemma and the piano-as-mechanism charges the final image. Sensory specificity, including synesthetic cold-as-sound, keeps the space from feeling generic despite being a single-room scene. A more tactile echo of the exterior cold pressing in at the climax could elevate the sense of environmental pressure even more.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ancient, time-suspended temple library is richly and economically realized—the constellations, dust, iron gall ink, and folded corridors all feel organic to Mira’s role and the conflict. Setting meaningfully shapes options: the library’s perfect memory and extra-temporal pauses enable both the discovery of the bloodline secret and the methodical, non-violent intervention. The final star-shift image charges the sense of an age turning through paperwork rather than war. This is an atmospheric, functionally integrated environment just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    The monitoring station and ocean are vividly particularized (“floated on its pontoons like a creature that had forgotten how to swim”; “the ocean continued its patient breathing”), and the scientific milieu feels plausible without exposition bloat. Setting details—especially the station’s moored drift and the fluttering atlas page—directly charge the final image and mirror Marina’s own state. While the physical environment doesn’t tightly constrain tactical choices, it clearly frames and colors the stakes and the mode of response.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay, skeletal launch towers, and stone circle are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Maya’s sensibility, creating a cohesive atmosphere of sacred ruin. Setting details (cold metal grating, punctured ceiling, rusted cranes) are not mere decoration; they mirror the rebellion’s pause and charge the final image of her walking toward dawn. The opera glasses and stone circle function as micro-settings/objects that meaningfully shape perception and the climactic realization. The only thing keeping this just shy of exemplary is that the environment constrains mood and symbolism more than concrete tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    The volcanic hot springs, chemical-scarred valley, and reconstruction encroachment are specific and atmospherically strong, and the environment directly shapes the mechanics of the climax (song frequency resonating with volcanic glass, heat affecting her body). Setting and eco-magical rules feel internally consistent and are filtered through Mira’s perspective and history. The springs and plants also charge the final image as a continuity of “living memory.” A bit more sensory texture at peak pressure (sound, smell, bodily sensation while she sings) could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    The arboretum on the cliff, the fogged cypress grove, orchids, greenhouse, and dark lighthouse are vivid and tightly filtered through Mariam’s priorities. Setting is not postcard backdrop: the hawk, salt-blasted soil, and precarious cliff gardens mirror and pressure her inner state, and the final assertion that “the arboretum held her” explicitly charges the environment in the closure image. World rules and spatial logic are consistent and unobtrusively credible. The only thing missing for an even higher score would be one more explicit moment where physical constraints of the setting directly alter an on-page tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse-library is vividly realized and filtered through Eleanor’s eye: dust, salt-crusted windows, shelves “like passengers on a sinking vessel,” and a lantern that feels almost sentient. The breathing walls and contracting space meaningfully pressure her choices, pushing her toward the redesign and signaling the stakes of staying stuck. The environment and the recurring lantern and box objects clearly charge the final image. A slight excess of descriptive flourish in places is the only thing keeping this from the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.0)
    The wind-carved encampment, eclipse-ruined canyon, and eroding traces of nomad life are vivid and sensorially specific, with good integration into Seren’s perceptions. The environment reinforces impermanence and memory, especially the wind erasing her presence at the end, which thematically charges the final image. However, the setting rarely constrains tactics or forces particular choices; it’s more atmospheric than operative. World rules around the eclipse and nomads feel coherent at the scale used.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Archive, perpetual cold, and snow-muted exterior are vivid and consistently filtered through Mira’s perception, creating a strong, unified atmosphere. The silence and cold are thematically charged and recur in the ending (“the silence had finally broken”), reweighting earlier images. While the environment mostly functions as mood and metaphor rather than a concrete obstacle, the dormant networks and cryogenic chambers do shape what’s possible, keeping this just below top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    The desert dome and “copper-tinted soil” are vivid, coherent, and tightly filtered through Mira’s priorities. The glass dome and desert sun concretely constrain choices (sanctuary, shade, fragile roses) and charge the final image of “blazing tranquilly in the desert light.” Recurring objects—the roses, glass, ballast scrap—interlock with the environment to embody the story’s ethos of non-destructive light and transformed weight. Worldbuilding hints (Sovereignty Tower, territories) are economical yet sufficient, with no white-room moments.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sound wave garden, crystallized vibrations, and resonance fountain are vividly rendered and consistently tied to character perception, not just decorative spectacle. The garden and constellations actively frame possibility—the Unraveling opens the gate, the center fountain is the locus of contact, and the garden’s fade charges the ending image. The rail spike functions as a micro-setting tool that bridges inner state, environment, and sky. Nearly every descriptive choice deepens atmosphere while supporting the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.0)
    The observatory above the clouds, the tarnished dome, and the echoing dome interior are vivid and tightly filtered through Margaret’s gaze. The setting coherently mirrors isolation, distance from the world, and the burden of secret knowledge. The echo and the glimpse of the world through shifting clouds nicely charge the final third, though the physical environment doesn’t materially constrain her options beyond mood and vantage. Overall, description is economical and thematically aligned without becoming a static postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Laboratory of Lost Sounds is beautifully and efficiently evoked—“the fold between midnight and the first breath of dawn,” resonance chambers, crystalline walls, and slow meteors create a strong, unified atmosphere. Details are filtered through Vera’s professional lens (constellation tattooing, frequency language), avoiding touristy cataloguing. The environment genuinely matters: the lab’s tech, the fold, and the chambers are the only reason this form of temporal communication is possible, and meteors/time-fold imagery charges the peak moment. A slightly more embodied interaction with the physical space during the ritual could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    The grotto and its mist are vividly realized and integrated—acoustics, flaking tiles, damp stone, and the very existence of whispers there all meaningfully shape what’s possible. The tile as recurring object and the mandala as micro-setting both charge the final image of “watching the mandala breathe.” World details about the unlearning are economical yet evocative, giving the grotto’s persistence real weight. Setting is not just backdrop; it is the mechanism by which the hush is interrogated.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the shattered sky, ruined fountain, and mosaic architecture all feel specific and culturally legible without turning into a museum tour. Crucially, the environment and objects (tessera, stepping stone, overlooked stones) are not just backdrop; they’re the medium of Kira’s power and the site of her subversion (“they never looked at stepping stones”). The shattered sky and fire-scorched plaza recur at the end to charge the final image with both desolation and tenuous hope. A hair more tactile interaction with the hostile environment (risk, surveillance, physical constraint) could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mystic orchard within the hedge maze is vivid and purposeful: its theatrical past, sacred ground, and twisted time directly enable Madeline’s magic and the story’s emotional logic. Sensory specificity—voices through leaves, colors of sound, apple trees as an audience—creates a strong atmospheric frame. The setting meaningfully charges the final image: Madeline beneath the apple tree, waiting for future visitors, is inseparable from this exact place. A touch more physical interaction with the maze’s constraints (e.g., how being concealed affects access or urgency) could push it even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.7)
    The studio, wand, camera, and mica slivers are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through an artist’s eye, giving the setting strong texture. Environment and tools don’t just decorate: the faulty ground wire is the catalytic cause, the panel conceals the chamber, and the wand structures both process and the final image. The micro-setting feels lived-in and plausibly technical (light painting, long exposure) without exposition bloat. The closing image—painting Daniel’s name in light—concretely ties setting and emotional stakes, charging the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    The coastal cave network is vividly rendered and functionally integrated: damp limestone, thermal gradients, narrowing passages, and the underground river all shape Vera’s route and the plausibility of hidden life. The elm leaf fossil and the underground lights act as recurring, charged setting-objects that frame the thematic bridge between epochs. Physical details usually arrive through Vera’s specialized attention, not as neutral cataloguing. The environment constrains the encounter into this quiet, liminal place, effectively charging the final image of her alone with the fossil and the floating lights.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    The amber warehouse is vividly rendered—stalactites of resin, fossilized crates, beetles—creating a palpable, tactile atmosphere. Setting and objects (buttons, jar, amber, cliffs) are tightly woven into the logic of memory, preservation, and forgetting, and they charge the final image of her ascent. The environment doesn’t significantly constrain her tactical choices beyond being a repository, so it’s more atmospheric than obstructive. Still, the specificity and thematically aligned imagery are remarkably strong for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    The physical world—Zephyr Bluff, mist, melting snow, and later the white-on-white sanatorium—is vivid and thematically tuned to liminality and thaw. The snow as code elegantly merges setting with mechanism, and the recurring “silver hush” charges the final image. Environmental constraints are more symbolic than practical, but the season and snowmelt do materially enable the code’s existence. Details stay selective and filtered through a professional reader-of-patterns rather than feeling like a tourist catalogue.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fog-bound river, ticking gutters, and rope ferry are vividly realized and consistently filtered through the coachman’s sensory priorities (sound and feel more than sight). Weather and water meaningfully constrain action—he waits for the gutters to stop, reads the fog, and the danger level shifts with environmental cues. The yarn needle as a recurring object charges the final image, effectively functioning as a micro-setting tool that carries history. Atmosphere is rich without feeling like a static postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    The oasis, hives, smoke, and palms are vividly and economically rendered; the opening image of smoke “like gray ribbons pressed to glass” is tonally precise and immediately locates us. Setting is not just backdrop: bees, hive boxes, brass disc, and lantern glass interact to embody the themes of selection, memory, and kindness. The environment meaningfully charges the final image of Serin working clay in a place that “slip[s] between fractures,” though the landscape itself doesn’t tightly constrain her options beyond being a rare refuge. The specificity and integration are excellent, even if not quite at the “setting as inescapable constraint” threshold for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the fire escape, alley, and luminous harbor are not just backdrop but shape what is possible (a vertical garden, the sightline to the condemned building, the use of moonlight). Details like "hammered silver" water and the smell of "garbage and rain" give textural specificity filtered through Marina's gaze. The brass tooth and garden work as micro-setting objects that constrain actions (reflecting light, tending plants) and charge the final image. Environment and recurring tools together strongly color theme and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tidal library above the clouds, mist currents, atomically reflective stones, and cloud floor are all sensually and conceptually vivid, and they’re tightly tied to the story’s workings. The setting isn’t postcard-like; the stone circle and cloudborne manuscripts and creatures directly shape what’s possible and charge the final image of a once-empty place now inhabited. The recurring objects (sundial, stone circle, library itself) all function as world elements and thematic carriers. This is rich, economical worldbuilding that feels lived-in rather than expositional.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, rain-cleansed valley, and drifting spheres are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with mood and meaning. Setting functions as more than backdrop: the installation’s mechanics (dissolving spheres among lotus flowers) concretely enable her action and charge the final image of her secret joining “the constellation of secrets.” The twig spiral and pond together form an object-as-setting pair that shapes her choice to release one thing and retain another. Sensory detail (light scattering through spheres, words bleeding in water) is precise and purposeful, never touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    The basement studio, burnt coffee, and old electronics create a tactile, lived-in micro-setting that fits the story’s tone and premise. The university quad outside and the candlelit procession broaden the world just enough and visually embody the stakes. The station isn’t just backdrop: its equipment enables both the threat and Mira’s countermeasure. That said, the environment rarely constrains her tactics in a concrete way beyond housing the gear; one more moment where physical space or tools truly pinch a choice could elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ruins, fallow fields, organ, and crawlspace are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Helena’s anxiety and purpose. Environment and objects are not decorative; tight spaces, the organ, and the hidden passage all constrain or enable actions. Details like moonlight through shattered stained glass and dust motes in the organ’s sound deepen the mood without stalling momentum. The setting meaningfully charges the final image of dawn and distant bells.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.3)
    The quarry, mist, granite walls, and black water are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Clara’s perception, giving the story a strong, coherent atmosphere. The environment supports theme and tone—the “tombstone” walls and “furrowed hush” echo erasure and buried memory—and the final image of her leaving the silent quarry is charged. However, the setting mostly frames and mirrors rather than constraining concrete choices or tactics, keeping it just shy of the very top tier. Still, specificity and integration with mood and theme are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)
    The weather station and altered winds are vivid and integrated into the stakes, especially the opening image of clouds defying inherited maps. Environmental details (glass, sensors, Cape Ruin, howling wind) support mood without overloading. The setting doesn’t heavily constrain tactics beyond providing data, but it does charge the premise and final image. Overall atmosphere is strong and specific, just short of making the environment feel like an active antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mountain pullout, guardrail, scaffold wrap, aspens, and impossible cabin are sensorially grounded and filtered through Margaret’s artistic eye. Setting actively shapes choice—the hidden trail and illicit-feeling cabin pull her off the paved, known space into risk and possibility. The recurring object-as-setting (the glass flake/darkroom tools) charges the final image and coheres with the world’s quiet magic.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    The abandoned circus train is vividly rendered (wildflowers, faded elephants and acrobats) and recurs as a charged locus of identity and return. The stones and pinned bills integrate with setting rather than floating as props, and the dusky light/amber windows anchor the final mood. The environment does not tightly constrain tactical choices, but it strongly shapes what the choices mean. Overall atmosphere is specific, coherent, and supports theme.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory, dome, and telescope are vividly and economically drawn, with details like the groaning mechanism, cold air, and “first gray fingers of morning” giving a textured atmosphere. The stars and telegram function as recurring objects that charge the final image and thematic frame. However, the environment seldom constrains her options; it supports mood and method more than it actively pressures choice. The off-stage temple is evocative but abstract, serving primarily as conceptual ballast rather than a tactile place in this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and continually functional: the swirling orchard vortex, cursed lake, and bone-pale confession tree all constrain movement and tactics (necessitating the seed-grown path) rather than serving as mere backdrop. Environmental changes map directly to story turns—the expanding vine-circles oppose the vortex, and the lake’s spiral softens after her act. Details like fruit that never ripen and faces frozen mid-confession mirror the thematic stasis she must break. The final image of the quieter orchard and faithful shadow is charged by everything we’ve learned about this place.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt glade, dusk light, roots, and hedge maze are strongly realized and tightly integrated with character and premise—her rootedness is literal, and the glade is the attractor and site of the crossing. The environment doesn’t just decorate; it constrains (she cannot leave) and enables (the maze regrows as a bridge). The recurring objects-as-setting (roots, maze, door of shadows) effectively charge the final image. A touch more sensory variety beyond the visual and tactile could deepen atmosphere even further, but what’s here is already high-level.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered and tightly integrated—roots in bones, phosphorescent moss, and skull-ledgers all serve both atmosphere and the premise of bartered destinies. The environment constrains choice (this is the only place the exchange can happen) and charges the final image: leaving the moss-glow for “true darkness” reweights setting into theme. Details are selective and purposeful rather than touristic. This is one of the story’s standout strengths.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.8)
    The quarry and the trailer are vividly realized and tightly integrated: “stone carved into absence,” “inverse of amphitheaters,” and the dust on the safety vest all feel lived-in and thematically charged. The environment is not just backdrop; it mirrors and reframes Marcus’s internal landscape and directly charges the final image of descending into the hollow. Professional detail (bankruptcy auction, limestone quarry, Marshall cloth) is precise without becoming touristic exposition. A slight restraint in sensory range beyond the visual and tactile keeps this just below the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    The magnetic arbor above the clouds is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elena’s sensibility (lodestones, magnetic dust, twilight, sideways trees). Setting is not mere backdrop: the magnetic soil, arbor altitude, and knowledge-fruit ecology directly enable the seed’s growth and charge the final image of her eating the fruit. The environment’s rules are coherent and integrated without infodump, and “above the clouds” versus the world below them quietly mirrors the thematic transition. It could constrain choice slightly more overtly under pressure, but as-is it strongly supports tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tidal atrium, wintersun, glass ceiling, and water’s rise are vivid and specific, with the titan-gear and moon-tide calibration integrating body, tool, and environment. Setting is filtered through Mira’s occupational lens, and the rising water physically touches her gear and filing system, subtly constraining how she works. The atmosphere strongly supports the themes of liminality and cyclical time. It very nearly reaches exemplary level; a more direct, choice-shaping constraint from tide or environment would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    The crystal caves and bunker are vividly rendered and tightly bound to theme (“latent radiance trapped in stone”) and closure (final rainbow-scattering image reweighted without terror). Shells and crystals act as recurring objects that charge the final moment and mirror her emotional state. The bunker context feels lived-in enough to support plausibility without exposition bloat. It stops just shy of using the physical environment to constrain on-page tactics, hence under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    The station, ivy, bathroom, graffiti, river, and accordion are vividly drawn and consistently filtered through Maren’s sensibility as a chronicler and grieving sister. Environmental details are purposeful: ivy as “green water,” black stones, grime, broken glass, and the crooked bathroom door all echo themes of abandonment and overgrowth. The setting shapes meaning more than tactics, but it does charge the closure—returning to the ivy on the platform and the taped bellows reinforces her new stance. This is strong, publishable-level atmosphere, just shy of truly exceptional because the environment doesn’t significantly constrain action.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glowing, misty library is vividly realized and consistently filtered through her emotional state, with details like shelves pulsing amber/crimson and a volume “bound in frozen tears” doing real atmospheric work. The setting also functionally shapes action: colored shelves guide her search; the mist and glow visibly respond to her discovery and forgiveness; a path literally opens deeper into the library. World rules around unspoken words and cataloging feel coherent and are learned through her exploration rather than dumpy exposition. It’s rich, purposeful description that charges the final image without lapsing into static tableau.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and functional: the velvet dome, midsummer light, and ferns all both color the world and materially shape the outcome (acoustics for propagation, plants as memory carriers, promise-glow as temporal mechanism). Sensory detail is rich but selective—bruised-plum fabric, ice dust, mulberry, ash—anchored firmly in Mira’s perceptions. The observatory is not a backdrop; its properties directly enable the only workable tactic for “propagate, not return.” A minor note is that we don’t see much spatial movement within the observatory, but the scene’s needs don’t demand more choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    The skyborne grotto and aurora are vividly rendered, with crystalline ice, cloud, and light all filtered through Mira’s grief-trained eye; the mortuary room is sketched just enough to anchor her “ordinary” world. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain her tactics—she’s never meaningfully obstructed by the environment—but it does deeply charge the central act and final image (aurora as soul-echo; grotto as threshold). The recurring object-as-setting of the emerald bridges mortuary and cosmic spaces effectively. Overall atmosphere is cohesive and supports the liminal, sacred tone.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    The umbral grotto above the clouds, the “vineyard hush,” moss, cloudstuff, and silver birch create a vivid, coherent secondary world with strong sensory specificity. Setting is POV-filtered and thematically consonant: suspended, liminal space perfectly matches the waystation-for-souls concept. The antique hairpin and clouds meaningfully charge the final image and the grotto’s rules stay consistent. The atmosphere skews almost uniformly gentle; a touch more environmental edge or constraint could sharpen choices and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse at dawn, the wind and glass, and the specific chimes create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s actively used rather than decorative. The setting is filtered through the keeper’s professional lens (the chimes as diagnostic instruments, dawn as appointment time) so it feels lived-in rather than postcard. Environmental elements charge key beats—the chimes modulate as Sera’s emotions surface; the horizon and sea frame the keeper’s philosophy; the final stillness of the chimes underlines the earned stasis. The specificity is strong and consistent without bloating the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific—floating rock, magnetic grotto, sycamores, meditation pool—and consistently filtered through the story’s contemplative, quasi-mystical lens. Environmental features are not postcard decoration: the grotto’s magnetism explains the levitation and underpins the wave metaphor; the pool’s rings literally embody the core teaching. The final return to the sycamores and stars charges the closing image and folds environment into theme. This integration of place, method, and meaning is strong enough for high-band, even if direct physical constraint on choice is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    The canyon of sound and towers of bone are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Vessa’s vocation, with details like echoes carving stone and dawn harmonics doing real conceptual work. The environment is not mere backdrop: its acoustic properties enable her navigation and teaching-by-voice, and the verticality of the bone tower structures the student’s trial. Recurring objects and micro-setting (the arrowhead, the layered dust, the ancient ribs casting light) charge the final image of her returning to stillness. World rules (sound-carved canyon, bone resonance) stay internally consistent and are learned via action and perception rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the icebound spire, impossible geometry, and the “brilliant dimness” above the clouds all reflect and pressure Mara’s inner state. Environmental details (frozen vapor, collapsed stair, crack in the stone) shape tactics directly via mist walking. The Garden of Modest Wonders and the keystone’s lingering light charge the final image and concretize the theme without feeling like generic fantasy scenery. World rules (impossible architecture, twilight layer) are consistent and learned through her movement rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.5)
    The drowned-ship library, air pocket, algae-lit portholes, and lantern-filled night sky are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Marcus’s vocation and grief. The environment meaningfully charges the final image: the contrast between dark pier, submerged library, and colored lanterns underscores the boundary between worlds he straddles. The tool (lamplighter’s pole) and setting motif (lanterns, gas flames) function as a micro-setting frame for his identity, even if the physical environment doesn’t heavily constrain his tactics beyond the descent itself. World rules (impossible dryness, luminous vows) feel internally consistent within the piece’s quietly fantastical register.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ambered observatory, crystalline resin, dying stars, and physical coins are vivid and specific, and the setting is consistently filtered through Mira’s professional and metaphysical concerns. The environment is not just decorative: the amber’s preservation theme directly charges the final image when it begins to glow, and the receivers/static define how she can act. World rules (backwards signals, contracting universe, non-random coins) stay internally consistent and are shown through use rather than exposition dumps. A touch more sensory variety beyond the visual could push this to the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ancient observatory is vividly realized—the spiral stairs, worn stone, brass telescope, and cracked dome are specific and atmospheric. Setting is not just decorative: the dome and “scattered light” are mechanically necessary for the crystallization, and the stars at the end charge the final image as indifferent witnesses. The observatory’s age and astronomical history echo the long view of death and her role across centuries. This integration of environment with mood, magic, and closure is strong and economical.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sapphire viaduct and cosmic waterways are vividly and economically rendered, especially the “frozen river of gemstone” and the gods’ “cosmic plumbing.” Setting is integrated with the premise—this is a place built for managing flows, making it a fitting ritual site and charging the final dawn image. The environment shapes tone and meaning more than tactical choices; Corin’s options aren’t visibly constrained by the viaduct’s physical properties. Still, the recurring viaduct/bell/water imagery coalesces effectively around the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    The resurfacing reservoir town, ridgeway, and wind chime form a vivid, coherent environment that feels lived-in and symbolically apt without being over-explained. The setting is tightly bound to the story’s logic—the town’s emergence literally triggers the plot and mirrors Martha’s resurfacing memories—and the final image of the “mirrored hush” valley is charged by everything that came before. Weather, light, and geography are all used economically to support mood and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and particular—the silver-barked trees, chiming leaves, kaleidoscopic waterfall, and temporal strangeness all feel integrated through Elara’s gaze. The orchard is not just a backdrop but a functional ritual space that enables the transformation and charges the final image of her stepping back through the waterfall. World rules (wonder bending logic, the way time feels different here) are consistent and learned through perception and action rather than exposition. A nudge more interaction—environment actively constraining tactics—would push this toward the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The nocturnal arbor above the cloud layer is vivid and memorable, and the contrast between swaying treetops and indifferent stars nicely mirrors Vera’s mental state. Details are selective and in POV (radio static tied to clouds, the feel of the buckle), integrating worldbuilding into action. However, the setting mostly operates as atmosphere and metaphor; it rarely constrains tactics beyond causing radio interference, so it stops short of fully shaping choice. The final image of the clouds shimmering below and her above them does charge the thematic divide between watcher and watched.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    The floating rock dojo above rewiring timelines is vivid, memorable, and thematically apt, and the pyramids rising/falling sequence nicely externalizes impermanence. The dojo as sanctuary for the brain in the final image gives the setting some functional weight beyond backdrop. Still, the environment rarely constrains tactics or imposes practical pressure; it’s an atmospheric frame rather than an active participant in the scene. A bit more interaction between the characters and this unstable cosmos could push this into truly top-tier territory.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mill house, storm aftermath, moonlight, and especially the brook give the story a strong, consistent atmosphere that mirrors Vera’s philosophy of flowing “around stone.” The setting is filtered through her sensibility (nocturnal haven, orthogonal paths) rather than as generic scenery, and the recurring water imagery meaningfully charges the final image. However, the environment constrains mood and theme more than concrete tactics—nothing in the physical space forces or denies particular actions beyond tone. Still, the corpse flower pot by the brook and the moonlit window provide a vivid micro-setting that frames the closure beat effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    The echo chamber tunnel and decrepit estate are vividly rendered and meaningfully tied to the premise of sound-made-physical. Acoustics are not mere color; they shape how his songs behave, how the ritual works, and how the past presses on him in the present. The pull cord and the dead garden function as micro-setting elements that charge the final images. Overall, the environment feels both concrete and thematically loaded without tipping into over-literal symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    The frozen garden and perpetual twilight are richly evoked and consistently filtered through Maren’s sensibility, yielding a cohesive, atmospheric locus rather than postcard description. Environmental details (ice-locked books, frozen roses, mist “breathing”) do thematic work around suspension, stasis, and liminality while charging the final image of them watching the mist breathe. The garden also functions as a constraint—time distortion and frozen growth mirror Maren’s own stuckness—though it rarely forces concrete tactical choices. Overall, the setting is a major strength and clearly charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ember nexus, obsidian steps, volcanic vents, and twilight cold-versus-heat contrast are vivid and specific, consistently filtered through Maren’s alchemical focus. The setting is not ornamental: twilight and “ember streams” are explicitly tied to liminal weakness in destiny’s pattern and to the mechanics of the working. The broken crozier functions as a tool-object that charges the final image and thematically fuses sacred authority with rebellion. A touch more environmental resistance or hazard during the working itself could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and memorable—Voxhaven’s suspended radio towers, the gorge, rusted ladder, and lunar perigee all feel specific and texturally rich. Details are filtered through Mira’s technical and poetic sensibilities, and the final image of towers built to shout finally listening effectively reweights the whole environment. The world rules (abandoned broadcast tech, jury-rigged reception of cosmic signals) hang together without strain. The environment, while atmospheric, doesn’t much constrain her choices beyond initial climb risk, which keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting work is rich and purposeful: the spectral grotto, phosphorescent patterns, and impossible starfields feel both concrete and thematically charged. Details are filtered through Mara’s perspective as a working deckhand, which keeps the world from becoming abstract lore. The grotto and harbor are not just backdrop—they determine the mechanics of the crossing and the method of resolution (pouring the hourglass into the glowing water). A touch more tactile interaction with the physical ferry in the climax could strengthen the sense of material constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    The optical illusion gallery is vividly and specifically realized—painted shadows, tilting floors, Escher and Bridget Riley, mirror rooms—and always filtered through Marina’s professional and fever-altered eye. The environment meaningfully constrains choices (false doorways, shifting corridors) and provides the very medium of conflict (space that exists only when observed). The sinew thread as a tool-within-setting strongly charges the final image and functions as a micro-setting structure inside the gallery. A touch more non-visual sensory grounding (sound, temperature) might deepen embodiment, but atmosphere and rule-consistency are already robust.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    The benthic city and the observation dome are vividly rendered, with selective, purposeful details (volcanic spires, bioluminescent coral, stars as seen through miles of water). Setting is filtered through Vara’s professional gaze, tying environment tightly to her identity as a navigator. Crucially, the environment (undersea lens, crystal dome, chain on the floor) is not mere backdrop; it structurally enables the alien method (starlight refraction) and charges the final image, where the underwater sky becomes the new map.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mist-clad atrium, former sanatorium bones, and fog “pooled like spilled milk” create a vivid, tonally apt liminal space that supports the story’s life/death membrane. Setting is well integrated into action—crossing the atrium, fountain, ferns—and mirrors the thinness between worlds. The hearing aid functions as a micro-setting/tool with its own rules and sensory texture. The environment, however, is more atmospheric than constraining; it doesn’t significantly alter choices or tactics, which limits it just below the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    The drowned undersea facility is vividly specific (barnacled ceilings, tea-colored water, observation domes) and deeply integrated into character perception and action. Environmental constraints—depth, pressure, tidal windows—genuinely limit options and charge both the descent and ascent. Recurring objects and sensations (cables, hush, codex, bodies) evolve across the piece and meaningfully charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    The opal observatory under snow is vivid, specific, and tonally aligned with the story’s concerns—light trapped in stone mirrors wisdom trapped in wreckage. Setting details (residual hum of instruments, heavy snow, refracted light in ink) are filtered through Mira’s emotional lens and integrated into action. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactical choices, it does charge the ritual and final image with isolation and quiet finality. The recurring opal/light/snow imagery meaningfully amplifies the ending’s resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    The towers of bone, canyon of endless echoes, and copper-veined body form a vivid, coherent environment that’s inseparable from the premise: the acoustics of the canyon and the architecture of the towers are literally required for the lost consonants. Setting details are specific and purposeful (birds nesting in skull spires, echoes carrying voices across centuries) and the final movement down into the oldest towers charges the ending. The world’s rules are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    The underground bioluminescent garden, the chill cellar, the rising moonpetals, and the old cordless phone form a distinctive, integrated environment that shapes mood and action. Setting is filtered well through Maren’s professional eye (herbs, artifacts) and becomes active when gravity loosens and tools float. The final return to surface frost and the garden’s “exhale” gives the environment thematic weight and charges the last image. The space never feels like mere backdrop; it’s textural and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    The enchanted orchard and statues are sharply realized through tactile and sensory detail (silvered planks, rotting fruit, marble eyes, blossoms falling upward). World rules (sound-policing statues, Archives of Permitted Sound, Calcification) are embedded in action and perception, not dumped. Setting constrains choices—she plays softly to avoid detection, uses the sky-bridge’s vantage, and the orchard’s roots amplify the heart-rhythm rebellion—while the locust shell and upward-falling blossoms charge the final images. This is rich and economical, though a touch more embodied interaction with the fragile sky-bridge at the climax could further integrate environment and danger.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt arcade, twilight, and drone-patrolled borders create a vivid, coherent environment that’s both emotionally and functionally relevant. The notion of “linking absences” is spatially grounded in the drones’ blind spots and the arcade’s disputed, surveilled-yet-forgotten space. Setting details are filtered through Marcus’s priorities (routes, voids, letters) rather than feeling like a tourist catalog. The environment and recurring objects (bottle, drones, gaps) charge the final image even if the arcade itself could constrain action more concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned circus train, desert, wind bells, and carousel fragments are vividly rendered and filtered through Marcus’s history and craft, producing a strong, coherent atmosphere. Environmental elements actively charge the story’s meaning: the bells create the temporal “pocket,” the train becomes sanctuary and workshop, and the halo fragment literally and symbolically centers the climax and final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful rather than touristic. This is close to publish-ready in a top venue on setting alone.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is distinctive and saturated with purposeful specifics—the scientific poetry library hours, the analog media formats, the non-Euclidean aisles all feel integrated rather than decorative. Details are filtered through Eleanor’s sensibility as someone steeped in both science and poetry, which sharpens the atmosphere. The scarf and the architecture function as micro-settings that directly charge the final image. The only small limitation is that the environment constrains less in a tactical sense and more in a conceptual/lyric one.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Whispering Archipelago, fog, rooftop, and dawn light are vividly evoked and feel integral rather than scenic; the environment literally shapes the turning point (the blade of gold through fog) and enables the magic. The palette as object-as-setting is particularly strong, constraining how she can act and charging the final images. Sensory focus is mostly visual but controlled and purposeful, matching the light/memory theme. The setting could perhaps exert more practical pressure on choices, but as an atmospheric and thematic engine it’s highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    The nexus “under starlight” is evocatively rendered, with time pooling and dripping, and the standing stones interacting directly with Mira’s actions. Setting is not mere backdrop; the star’s beam, shifting symbols, and the circle of stones all function as the mechanism she works on. The recurring celestial imagery also charges the final transformation of the ribbon and the path home. A slightly more tactile sense of risk or constraint from the environment itself would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    The greenhouse and encircling shipwrecks are vivid, tactile, and thematically charged (“a geometry of loss and searching”), with details like petrified trees and salt-crusted glass working as more than decoration. Setting is tightly bound to method and closure: the cracked panels form the “star charts” she must read, and the fairy ring/rooted jar can only exist in this specific place. The environment shapes how she locates the memory jar, not just where she stands to find it, satisfying the constraint/charge test. A slight expansion of how the weathered, exposed site complicates or endangers her actions could push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    The forgotten library, grimy windows, marble floors, and shard-mirror artifacts create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels particular to this story’s world. Setting details are tightly tied to character and theme—the glass paperweight’s shadow and the Sacred Looking Glass meaningfully echo and charge the final moral stance. Spatial and temporal anchors are clear, and the outside playground swing image widens the setting without losing focus. The only restraint on a higher score is that environment influences mood and symbolism more than practical tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and thematically charged: the waterfall from no height, mossed stone walls, twilight light, and impossible fruit all feel integral rather than decorative. World rules (each tree drawing from a different realm) are embedded in the environment and matter to the premise of fading wonder. The final image—waterfall scattering rainbows through the grandmother’s tree—demonstrably relies on this environment to carry meaning. It could press Marek’s tactics a bit more, but as atmosphere and conceptual space it is exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prism sanctuary, fractured starlight, and crystalline walls are not just decorative; they embody the storage and refraction of silences, and the prisms literally “wait” to translate them back into sound. Environmental logic is consistent—the sanctuary releases her at daylight, and the prisms’ behavior tracks the emotional beats. Details are vivid yet economical, and the setting charges the final image of her carrying the sanctuary’s “interlaced hush” within her. This is very close to publish-ready at top venues on setting alone.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the rain, moldy crates, fresco vault, and henge stones all operate as more than backdrop, mirroring erosion, patience, and the tension between preservation and change. Details are filtered through Elena’s sensibility as a map framer and observer of boundaries, which keeps the description from feeling like a generic tour. The chapel’s physical features—fading saints, the torn map, the circle of stones—directly charge the final image and the thematic stakes. Environment doesn’t overtly constrain her physical options, but it continuously shapes perception and meaning in a way that feels essential.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    The underwater library is vividly rendered—books as coral, anemones as librarians—and consistently filtered through Eleanor’s professional and emotional gaze. The snow globe and the submersible environment function as micro-settings that charge the final images rather than pure ornament. Physical constraints of depth and darkness are present but not deeply exploited for tactical pressure, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier. Still, the setting’s specificity and atmosphere significantly amplify the thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.8)
    The monastery courtyard above the cloudline, the mist, and the weather are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the premise—the mist literally hosts the ghost’s words, and the lightning/thunder window defines how communication works. The floating garden and courtyard function as a liminal, isolated space that mirrors both Mira’s obscurity and the ghost’s partial existence. The flower press bolt plate as a recurring object is spatially and emotionally anchored, charging the final image when it warms on her chest. Setting feels specific, atmospheric, and meaningfully fused to the story’s metaphysics rather than postcard-like.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    The icebound spire, the groaning elevator, and the observatory above the clouds are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Mira’s perceptions. Environmental elements (ice as prism, amber glass, frozen height) directly charge the final image: joy literally refracts through ice and glass, embodying the grief/joy motif. The physical ascent through cold, narrowing air mirrors the emotional climb toward releasing preserved memories. Setting is not just backdrop but an active carrier of tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sky gondola, layered clouds, and instruments are rendered with precise, profession-filtered detail that shapes mood and meaning. The environment is not just backdrop; the gondola’s drift and tether-loss define her situation, and the atmosphere-as-archive directly charges the final images. Sensory selection (frost-rimmed window, nacreous iridescence, barometer tick) feels purposeful rather than touristic. The only missing element is a concrete, present-tense constraint on action; the setting pressures her conceptually more than tactically.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    The oak-library is textured, specific, and fully integrated: living wood, carved chambers, starlight constellations, and the bark-disguised safe all matter to how she moves and discovers. Setting is always filtered through touch and pressure, matching Elara’s perception and the story’s stakes. The final image—the condemned oak in gray dawn, knowledge in her hands as the library waits for demolition—charges both environment and objects with conceptual and emotional weight. The world feels singular rather than generic, and the environment meaningfully constrains/charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    The airship, marshlands, and murmurations are vividly rendered with selective, evocative detail (“brass hull catching the last light,” “moth-eaten rug,” “ink dissolving in water”), and the environment is consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The setting meaningfully shapes the story: being stranded above the Tessellated Marshlands makes the Luminance’s appearance directly relevant, and the tilt of birds around the ship ties world-physics to the central phenomenon. Objects-as-setting (hopscotch board, phrasebook, lantern) are well integrated into action rather than museum pieces. The only limitation is that the physical constraints of being stuck aloft don’t significantly complicate her tactics beyond premise setup.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    The frozen library above the clouds is vivid and specific—crystalline spires, frost-bloomed shelves, cold with “teeth”—and those conditions shape her experience rather than sitting as postcard backdrop. The hall of mirrors, frost-covered lectern, and gears form a coherent micro-setting that constrains what she can do: learn from prophecy, confront reflection, assemble mechanisms. Environmental changes (sound shattering frost, clouds parting, distant clock tower ticking) visibly register the story’s internal shift. The setting and key objects strongly charge the final image without feeling over-explained.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: floating rock arches, fog, silver-barked trees, twin suns, and the moth-summoning bell all feel specific and coherent. Environmental features matter to action—the arches as precarious habitat, the orchards and irrigation as survival infrastructure, the bell as a functional agricultural tool. World rules are conveyed economically through use (harvesting sideways-growing fruit, pollination) rather than exposition. The setting stops short of directly constraining a high-stakes choice in the climax, which keeps it shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    The hidden lighthouse, obsidian clock, and “pane of hush” are vividly rendered and deeply integrated with mood and action. The environment meaningfully constrains the story—this job and this act could only occur in such a liminal, off-the-map place. Details like “sun bled into the horizon, painting the glass in shades of amber and bruise” and the inward-igniting beam charge the final image rather than functioning as postcard description. Spatial and conceptual geography stay coherent despite the metaphysical premise.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific: mechanical birds, cliffside maze, cursed hazels, and the encroaching frost all feel texturally real and visually clear. Environment meaningfully constrains choice—the narrow paths, patrolling birds, and icing stone shape tactics and danger. The recurring elements of orchard, cliff, and valley reappear at the end to charge the final image (“graceless beauty, all sharp angles and honest ugliness”). A touch more sensory layering beyond sight and cold (sound, smell) under peak stress could push this even higher, but as is, it’s very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    The braided ravine, foam patterns, lab, and sky are concrete, recurring, and strongly filtered through Mira’s sensibility, with the ravine and chrysalis visually charging the final image. Setting is economical yet atmospheric and thematically aligned. It rarely constrains choices in a practical way, functioning more as resonant backdrop than as an active obstacle or resource.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, original, and tightly integrated: glass trees, cloud-stairs, Sea of Sorrowing Mist, and transparent floors all resonate with fragility, redemption, and “integrated fragmentation.” Environment constantly filters through Vera’s perceptions (clouds like cream in coffee, glass about to shatter) and echoes her internal state. The glass orchard library explicitly charges the final image (“inside the glass orchard library, something new had taken root”), making place inseparable from thematic closure. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, it very much charges the emotional and conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is textured and purposeful: desert fortress after rain, prisoner-carved channels, and the icebound coral cavern all feel distinct and lived-in. Environmental details (evaporating tidal pools, emotional cold as ice) directly shape action and possibility. The weather and stone help frame time pressure and tone without devolving into postcard description. The final cooking scene reuses the setting more as a quiet echo than a fully charged object, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    The astronomical clock tower, harbor, and grain elevators are vividly rendered and tightly tied to character and theme: clocks, pendulum, and starlight all echo time, rhythm, and navigation between isolation and harmony. The cuckoo weight and clock procession are not ornament; they literally structure her method and charge the ending with a sense of cyclical, almost ritual time. Environmental details (frequencies, winds, mechanical planets) are selective and POV-filtered, avoiding tourist listing. Setting clearly charges the final image, meeting the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.3)
    The moonlit canyon, sediment layers, and mineral memory-archive are richly realized and tightly integrated with the premise. The environment isn’t just pretty; its geology and the angle of moonlight are functional constraints on how her device works. The canyon’s history of “profound transformation” subtly mirrors Vera’s own, and the final image of the canyon’s depths holding remembered dreams feels earned. It stops just shy of the highest band only because the physical setting does not impose active obstacles or urgent limits beyond mood and method.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    The serpentine grotto, mist “like luminescent milk,” and ceiling carvings revealed only under inverted gravity create a vivid, coherent environment that feels integral, not ornamental. Setting rules (inversion timing, mist concealing/revealing, phosphorescent waters) are consistent and learned through her actions and perceptions. The environment directly constrains access to knowledge and charges the final image of the hidden doodle waiting in the hollow. A slightly broader sensory palette beyond the visual (sound, temperature, texture under stress) could deepen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and deeply integrated: the siskin alder grove, the ancient sculpture, and the telegraph relic all shape what’s possible and how Maren thinks. Environmental and object details (stress cracks, cambium, roots, porcelain) are filtered through her craft, not offered as neutral scenery. The final image—vibrations traveling through her bones, hedgehog, and swaying alders—recharges earlier details and makes the grove feel like an active participant. This interplay of place, tool, and body clearly constrains tactics and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    The magnetic nexus is vivid and sensorially specific—twilight colors, iron-rich boulders, humming fields—and consistently filtered through Helena’s perception as a chess-thinker and exile. Environmental details mirror and support the interior stakes, especially the pulsing nexus and EM “whisper” as repositories of forgotten voices. The recurring worry stone operates as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. The setting is atmospheric and purposeful, though it rarely constrains her options in a concrete, tactical way, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    The workshop under a collapsed roof, the stars, and the impending fireworks create a vivid, atmospheric container that echoes her internal tension between exposure and shelter. Details like dusty abandoned projects and the open sky over the ruined roof are well-filtered through her sensibility and grief. The environment matters thematically and visually at the end, when fireworks paint the ruin as she pockets the clasp. The only limitation is that the setting constrains mood and symbolism more than concrete tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    The treetop village and forest canopy are vividly rendered with selective, sense-driven details, especially smell, and feel deeply filtered through an herbalist with an acute nose. Spatial logic (platforms, rope ladders, central flower) is coherent, and the environment mirrors the philosophy of “serenity within motion” through swaying platforms and wind. Setting doesn’t strongly constrain her options tactically, but it does charge both the corpse flower experience and the final descent image. The world-building is specific enough to feel singular without bogging the story down.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    The orchard planet, floating arches, and gravity inversion are vividly rendered with concrete, imaginative detail that feels specific to this story. Environment constrains and guides choice: navigating by underground water currents, landing before inversion, and the hidden valley under the oldest arch are all plot-relevant. The grove of silver-barked trees, artifacts in the soil, and “whirling silence” deeply charge the final image of planting the seed. A slight overreliance on visual description over other senses keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    The port’s container labyrinth is vividly realized—scale (“seven stories high”), sound (groans, breathing wind), and function (funneling air, creating convergence zones) all feel specific and lived-in. Setting isn’t decorative: the geometry of stacked containers literally shapes wind behavior and danger, and her navigation through rows and stacks structures the scene. The environment meaningfully charges the final image, with the “metal canyons” echoing her father’s voice and the wind’s warnings. A still higher score would likely require one concrete moment where the physical environment explicitly constrains a choice under immediate pressure, rather than just informing her long-term method.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ice cavern, crystalline bell, and aurora are rendered with vivid specificity and a strong sensory palette, tightly filtered through Meren’s synesthesia. The setting is not just decorative; the crafted silence and sky aperture are mechanically necessary for the First Song to be completed. Environmental details (frozen stairs, breath turning to “brief diamonds,” the ice like frozen congregants) reinforce the thematic tension between stillness and awakening. The only thing holding this just below the very top tier is that the environment constrains mood and method more than it poses concrete, tactical obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting work is vivid and purposeful: the Thunder-echo Range, the Keeper’s Hollow, and the canyon hush all feed tone and mirror Mira’s isolation. Details like “stone worn smooth by generations of footsteps” and the absolute quiet of the Hollow are strongly filtered through her experience as the last keeper. Objects-as-setting (flute, driftwood markers) are integrated into both world rules and tactics. The environment quietly charges the final image: a silent range that now reads as “potential” rather than emptiness.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the topaz plateau, hemorrhaging sky, and mechanical press all shape the piece’s atmosphere and metaphoric logic. The halo fragment and the starfield recur as charged objects, with the dimming halo and dwindling stars re-weighting the final image. Environmental detail consistently filters through Mira’s sensibility (ink as grief, vanishing stars as asymptotes), so the world feels specific rather than generic. The setting constrains tone and theme more than tactical choices, but it strongly charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway, frost, northern peaks, and monasteries are vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail that matches Maren’s vocation and mood. The pendant, aurora, and monastic spaces work as recurring environmental anchors rather than a white-room; the sky’s energies and the ridgeway’s remoteness support the tone and premise. The setting does charge the final image—the lights “ancient and indifferent yet somehow approving” echoing her transformation—but it rarely constrains concrete choices or tactics. That slight lack of functional pressure keeps it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    The quartz arbor, mist, frost, and car are vividly realized and strongly filtered through Elara’s sensibility, creating a cohesive, almost sacred experimental space. Weather and environment aren’t mere backdrop: frost both encodes and then melts the emotional record, and the quartz pillars refract light into rainbows in the pivotal moment. The prism-as-object and frost-as-medium function as a micro-setting that charges the final image and grounds the magic in tactile detail. A slight tendency toward aestheticization over constraint (the arbor could be swapped for another liminal site) keeps it just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bamboo forest swallowing an old orchard is vivid, atmospheric, and consistently filtered through Mei’s loom-weaver sensibility. Setting details like the creaking bamboo, dimmed light, and moss-covered ground are not mere backdrop but mirror the piece’s preoccupation with encroachment and reclamation. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical options, but the orchard as shared locus across time is structurally essential. The final quieted orchard and bead reprise charge the last image in a way that feels anchored in place.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vividly particular: floating stone arches, bioluminescent moss, the Chamber of Roots, and the orchard planet all feel lived-in and visually striking. Environment shapes options—abandoned mine shafts and the planet’s core-heat dictate his method, and the arches’ defiance of gravity ties directly to the underground resonance he seeks. Recurring azure/blue imagery culminates in the blue forge flames and dusk sky, charging the final image with world-specific tone and meaning. This is near–publish-ready in atmosphere and specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay is vivid and purposefully rendered: “cathedral to obsolescence,” frozen drones, lipstick-stained cups create atmosphere and history. The magnetic coupling unit and floor concretely matter, serving as the physical locus for her mother’s trail and the rift itself. Details are filtered through Mira’s professional sensibility as a sensory mapper, which helps ground the speculative elements. The setting does more textural and symbolic work than constraining tactical options, but it still charges the final image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    The fogbound lighthouse, rusted stairs, bird’s nest, dead lens, and haunted lantern room are vivid and tightly filtered through Maren’s seafarer gaze. Environment and recurring objects (the lens, sea glass, cairn) don’t just decorate; they constrain perception and action and explicitly charge the final image. The notion of a “dead” light replaced by a faint, grateful glow enacts the thematic shift on a spatial, sensory level. Setting and objects are so integral that removing or flattening them would collapse both mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    The emerald lighthouse, glass dome, and storm-filled horizon are rendered with specificity and strong sensory texture, and the environment feels genuinely lived in by a professional keeper. The lens, wick, and height of the tower are not just décor; they shape how she works and what she can do. The consistency of the magical-physical rules (emerald facets, total internal reflection) gives the world solidity. The final image of dawn light on emerald walls plus answering rain is charged by all the prior setting work.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating rock tea house, Meridian Valley, and crystalline dawn light are rendered with vivid, selective detail, and always through Senna’s perception. Setting is not mere backdrop: the drifting house, sun trails, and altitude all underwrite Mei-Lin’s practice and the premise that “the light remembered everything it touched.” The morpho wing and solstice timing charge the final image and concretely shape Senna’s choice to stay. A slight cap remains only because the environment constrains mood and worldview more than it constrains concrete physical options.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the storm, tower, abandoned study, and moonlit grove all feel tangible and mood-rich. The environment is not just backdrop—the moonlight enables the sextant’s healing, and the grove of trees is inseparable from the story’s logic of grief and memory. Details like “dust and old starlight” and rain as “desperate fingers” are sensuous without becoming clutter. The setting could influence tactical options a bit more directly, but it already charges the final image strongly.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly particular—the mica windows, silver apples, alchemical trees, and endless night all feel tactile and integrated into the mechanics of the magic. Environmental constraints (no external light, memory stored in mineral panes, organic matter needed to cradle light) directly shape tactics and charge the final image of her forehead against the warmed mica. A slight overreliance on visual and conceptual imagery (light, threads, reflections) keeps it from feeling utterly incomparable, but it is still very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    The library between laundromat and shoe repair, the “Utilities” door, and shelves labeled “Contradictions” and “Harmonies” create a vivid, thematically apt space. The atmosphere supports the paradox motif and Miriam’s sense of entering an impossible, hidden architecture of grief. However, the environment mostly frames the conversation rather than constraining specific choices; the setting could be swapped for another liminal magical space without fundamentally altering the beat mechanics. Still, the recurring clock and utility door nicely charge the opening and exit images.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, economical, and thematically integrated: the overgrown palace courtyard, frost on wild roses, the vine-swallowed tea house, and the spider’s web all mirror the themes of erasure and persistence. Details are filtered through Mei’s sensibility as a noticer, so nothing feels like postcard description. The environment gently constrains action—the hidden tea house as refuge/lab, the courtyard soil as a place for guerrilla gardening—and the final image of leaving the tea house “to the vines” and the spider continuing its work is charged. This is just shy of the very top band because the palace/political context remains atmospheric rather than exerting direct, constraining pressure on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    The frozen library above a cloud sea, crystalline towers, frost-rimed catalog, and quartz hush create a distinctive, immersive environment filtered through Elara’s familiarity. Setting isn’t just decorative: the collapsing star and cracking quartz floors impose temporal and physical pressure, and the final image of her walking onto the cloud sea is charged by everything established earlier. The tools and materials (crystal vials, frozen starlight instrument, lantern slide) function as an extended, coherent environment-system. A small further integration of physical constraint into her moment-to-moment tactics could have pushed it into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    The pirate market under the rotting pier is vividly evoked through smell (“salt-thick darkness”), light (“lanterns swinging like captured stars”), and texture, and it feels lived-in rather than touristic. Setting meaningfully shapes tactics—the eel tank provides a reflective surface for surveillance, the labyrinthine passages enable her escape, and the under-pier world embodies the “hush” economy. The recurring vertical axis (under the pier vs. emerging into dawn) charges the final image thematically. World rules (Madame Vex’s trade, the Hollow Men, the truce) are sketched just enough to feel coherent without bogging the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting work is exceptional: lavender bluff, aurora, voting forest, and atmospheric phenomena are sensorially rich and always filtered through Vera’s taste-based perception. The environment is not just backdrop; the bluff vantage, the aurora, and especially the ring as micro-setting constrain what she can see and understand, and the forest’s election supplies the core stakes. World rules (weather-carriers, forest elections, emergent compass) feel internally consistent and are revealed through perception rather than dry exposition. The final image of tongue-to-ring under the aurora perfectly fuses place, object, and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vividly rendered—violet light, amethyst curtains, quartz and selenite—and consistently filtered through Maren’s familiarity and role as keeper. The environment is more than backdrop: it explains the secrecy of the hidden painting, the family occupation, and the final gallery-like display of three generations of art. The closing image of the crystals “pulsing with approval” in the auroral light effectively charges the final thematic beat. A slightly stronger sense of physical constraint or hazard could have lifted it further.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    The greenhouse domes, sulfurous sky, dried oasis, and magnetic-tape cathedral are vivid and coherent, and they’re filtered through Mei Lin’s sensibility as someone who works with fragile materials and words. The world’s rules (recycling bodies into gardens, collapsed postal towers, pre-collapse infrastructure) feel consistent and economical. The environment shapes the logic of the Archive’s existence and the emotional tone, though it rarely constrains moment-to-moment tactical choices. The final image of the inscription on the Archive’s entrance is strongly charged by the established setting and tools.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Whispering Bluff, cloud sea, and sound-different physics are vivid and integrated into how the monastery and bell function, not mere backdrop. Details like the bell tower “like a finger” and the glacier-air in the ice are specific and tonally apt, and the final image of the clouds parting crystallizes the setting’s role in the thematic payoff. The environment does influence meaning more than tactics, though: the plateau’s properties don’t deeply constrain choices beyond flavoring the world. This keeps it just shy of the very top band but still quite strong.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dome, desert, and desert roses are vividly realized and consistently filtered through VERA-7’s sensibility, with strong, purposeful details (magnetic auroras on the glass, fire from buried pipes, artificial sun). Environment and tools (dome, irrigation/burn system, soil) directly shape her tactics and the final image of burial. The setting’s contradictions—artificial containment vs. organic strangeness—mirror and charge the thematic contradictions in the protagonist. Worldbuilding feels rich yet economical, with no white-room moments or unearned rule shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    The courtyard at dawn, potted citrus, weathered benches, and the rusted mailbox create a vivid, coherent micro-world that feels lived-in and thematically apt. Setting is filtered plausibly through Maren’s sensibility, and the time-of-day light shift (“colors bleed from gray to gold,” “courtyard exhaled”) effectively brackets the emotional arc. The mailbox and locket function as charged objects that meaningfully shape the final image, not just backdrop. Environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, but it does tonally and symbolically charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    The sunken laboratory is vividly realized with tactile, visual detail (green-gray light, marine growth, bloated journals) and supports the melancholic, haunted tone. Setting is filtered through Marina’s focused, professional gaze, which keeps it from becoming a mere postcard. The environment contributes conceptually—buried history, pressure of the deep, rising toward light—but rarely constrains her choices in a concrete way. The final image of ascending with the journals through the water nicely reweights the opening descent.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    The harbor, whale carcass, and especially the salt crystal chamber are rendered with vivid, selective detail (“walls glittered white,” “silence gleamed like polished glass”) that supports mood and world-building. Setting is tightly integrated with plot: the chamber houses the sphere, salt produces the key, and the lighthouse heightens the final lantern image. Environmental elements constrain and enable choices, such as the sealed chamber and the specific black-iron, blue-glass lantern. The recurring crystalline/salt imagery also charges the final passage through the door.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    The brook, willows, and nocturnal haven are vividly rendered and integral to the magic: water as conduit for consciousness and the wing’s journey, quiet as both setting and method. Details like “water that moved without sound” and the wing resting against a smooth stone make environment and object meaningfully fused with the act of hushing. The setting tonally underwrites the theme of generative silence rather than serving as mere backdrop. It stops short of fully constraining her choices, but it clearly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rooftop garden, the building itself, and the meteor showers are vivid and purposeful, not postcard dressing; the environment doubles as classroom and character. World rules (the building speaks, the dead tutor gardens) are internally consistent and conveyed through action, not exposition. The setting directly charges the final image—garden waiting, kettle singing, building sighing—which anchors theme and closure. A slightly broader sensory range beyond the visual might have pushed this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    The velvet garden, twilight, and Archive towers are vividly rendered and feel integral, not decorative; the garden’s off-map liminality and wild resonance structures concretely enable Mirabel’s attempt. Time-of-day and environmental detail are coherently tracked as night falls and stars fade, building atmosphere that supports the magical mechanism. The seashell and garden both charge the final image, where Elena’s voice emerges from the liminal space. A touch more tactile interaction with the environment during the middle stretch could have pushed this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, stalactites, and heritage roses are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with tone and theme (endurance, time, sanctity, unfinishedness). Details are filtered through Veren’s calligrapher’s sensibility, especially around light and surfaces, which feels character-specific. The stalactites’ drip and the aurora’s shifts recur and subtly charge the final moments without feeling like mere decoration. The setting rarely constrains physical options, but it strongly charges the atmosphere and closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    The serpentine nexus, seven ravines, phosphorescent moss, and the sky “thick with ancient light” create a vivid, specific environment that feels intrinsic to the premise. Crucially, the canyon’s living consciousness and rules about voice as the only conduit for extraction directly constrain Mira’s choices and charge the final image of its “hunger” when she walks away. Details are well-filtered through her perspective as a canyon-bred singer; nothing reads like tourist cataloguing. A minor reason for not going higher is that some cosmic touches (“universe hummed its secret song”) tilt slightly ornamental compared to the tightly functional canyon imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glacier shrine, candlelight, warped glass, and “borrowed starlight” are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Mira’s function and theme (ice as memory, shrine as window). The environment is not just decorative; the ice explicitly serves as the conduit that thins the veil and charges the final image of stars filtered through frozen water. The snow globe and ice together act as micro-setting constraints on how she connects to Elise. Setting and atmosphere are finely integrated with concept and ending.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is richly and precisely realized: the whispering parapet, dripping gargoyles, fireflies over wet grass, and coastal village all filtered through Mirelle’s pattern-obsessed gaze. Environmental elements (rain, wind through crenellations, air currents revealed by fireflies) aren’t just decorative; they shape what she can perceive and how she experiments. The bamboo whisk and the parapet both return in the final image to charge the ending with place-anchored emotion. This level of atmospheric integration is publishable as-is, just shy of ultra-elite only because the environment constrains mood and perception more than concrete choice.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    The orchard, radioactive dust storms, and stillpoint are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Maya’s investigative gaze. Environmental specifics (mutated apples, Geiger counter behavior, respirator, windbreak) are purposeful and integrated into action rather than pasted on. The stillpoint’s “absence” of radiation and the orchard helping her leave effectively charge the final image and reinforce the premise. A bit more tactile constraint in the climax (physical difficulty leaving, immediate danger) could push this into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory above the clouds, cobalt glass portico, and storm are vividly rendered and tonally aligned with the piece’s concerns about distance, divinity, and static. The setting meaningfully constrains action: her isolation makes radio the only conduit, and followers must literally climb to reach her. Weather and glass are not mere backdrop—they mirror and frame her self-perception and charge the final ascent. A touch more tactile use of the environment in the middle beats could push this higher, but what’s here is strong and economical.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dune loft, driftwood, jars, rot and salt, and the sea’s soundscape are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Marcus’s sensibility. Setting and atmosphere reinforce theme (erasure vs preservation, the sea’s endless conversation) and charge the final image of footprints erased and a name given back to the wind. The environment slightly constrains options (his exile, his chosen workshop) but more as mood than as a hard tactical limit. Overall specificity and integration with tone are excellent, even if the setting doesn’t force a concrete choice.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Arctic drift-ice marina and ice-chapel are vividly rendered through sound, color, and tactile detail (“frozen pontoons,” “mournful whales”), and the environment is consistently filtered through Vera’s professional eye. Weather, ice, and distance create a concrete sense of precariousness and urgency, even if they don’t heavily modulate tactics. Recurring objects (the chapel, bell, coat, key) are spatially coherent and charge the final image of coat and key on the ice. The setting feels specific and lived-in without slipping into mere postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly drawn and tightly integrated with theme and action—the setting isn’t wallpaper, it’s the engine of her work and the metaphor of slow change. Details like the ice groaning, the lake as “second sky,” and iron concentrating magnetic forces feel both atmospheric and purposeful. Environment constrains and enables: the viaduct amplifies signals; winter and ice enforce isolation and long-view patience. The final image—bridge glittering, ice remembering how to flow—beautifully charges the theme, satisfying the 9-band gate, but a bit more tactile interaction with the environment under strain could make it truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.3)
    The subway maintenance tunnel, the seeping rain, and the Underground Railroad lantern are vivid, tactile, and thematically braided into the narrative rather than feeling like set dressing. Details are filtered through Margaret’s professional and historical awareness, which sharpens images like “history pressed against the present like a bruise.” The environment constrains action (narrow tunnels, hidden corridor) and charges discovery, and the weather/rain motif is meaningfully reprised in the ending. Slightly more use of the physical tunnel to limit or endanger her would push this into truly outstanding territory.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    The music box shop is vividly realized—“vibrant hush,” dust motes, amber light, ticking mechanisms—and remains active throughout rather than front-loaded description. The setting and the clockwork heart are thematically and functionally fused: a place devoted to delicate repair hosting a man seeking moral repair. Environmental elements (light through rippled glass, storm breaking) inflect the emotional arc and charge the final image without feeling purely decorative. The shop doesn’t heavily constrain available physical choices, but it strongly conditions tone and thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    The acid sea, bobbing brass workshop, and interior of gears and cogs form a striking, specific environment that’s integral to tone and premise. The acid sea and floating workshop directly constrain options (you “can’t glide on acid”) and make Zephyr’s launch a meaningful risk. Objects-as-setting (kaleidoscope, arrow tip) are tightly integrated and recur to charge the closing image. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that environmental pressure could be pushed even harder in the climax itself.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    The missile-silo archive, humming servers, and leaking audio fragments create a vivid, specific environment that feels lived-in and tonally apt. Setting is filtered well through Helena’s priorities—she navigates corridors, listens to “mechanical ghosts,” and the environment enables her unique access and isolation. The final image of the Nevada night and stars “like distant servers” elegantly charges the closure and ties space, data, and absence together. The only gap is that the physical space never quite constrains her tactically (e.g., security layout, isolation risks) as much as it could.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lighthouse orchard, ice floes, and salt-dusted apple trees are vivid and memorable, and they bracket the piece with a strong atmospheric frame. The environment subtly echoes the themes of precariousness and endurance (orchard "clinging," shifting ice, drowned village), and the mirrors/vintage store salvage are concretely rendered. However, the setting rarely constrains tactics or forces specific choices; it’s more symbolic and tonal than operative. The final image of Kira walking through the frozen trees with the beam sweeping over her is charged, but still more atmospheric than decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    The drift-ice marina and Arctic sea are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with mood and theme (“groaned,” “creaked its nightly song,” “cathedral of blue ice”), avoiding tourist catalog syndrome. Environmental conditions (collapse, wreckage, stranded scientists) plausibly force the volunteering context and shape what is possible. The parasol tip works as a micro-setting/object that charges the final image and echoes survival-in-fragment. Setting consistently mirrors and deepens interior states without overtly announcing itself as symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and integrated—the amber pavilion, arthritic vines, and sleeping bus station all mirror emotional themes of waiting, grafting, and emptiness. Details feel filtered through Marcus’s long familiarity rather than tourist cataloging. The pavilion’s amber light literally and figuratively “sepias” the scene, charging the final image of two strangers with fragments between them. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain choices, it meaningfully charges tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integral: the murmuring pavilion’s silk panels, ancestors’ voices, and the kinetic parapet under the dunes all feel original and tactile. Environment shapes tactics—she must go under the dunes to access the parapet, and the pavilion is the threatened locus that the clearing must be linked to. World rules (voices woven into silk, memory-as-infrastructure) stay consistent and are learned through action. The final image of the engine humming beneath the sand recharges earlier setting details and carries thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lavender field and rusted ammunition factory are striking, specific, and threaded through the entire story, with the vines and purple against gray doing clear thematic work. The setting isn’t just decorative: it becomes the social locus of gatherings and the literal backdrop for the final reconfiguration of the village. Details like the salvaged window-frame pavilion and “corroded skeleton” of the factory give a strong sense of place and history. The only minor limit is that the environment rarely constrains concrete choices moment to moment; it mostly charges images and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    The shadowed library, dawn light, and crystal are rendered with precise, selective detail that feels fully inhabited and tightly tied to Elara’s priorities. The setting is not backdrop: the abandoned institution, the fallen chandelier, and the stillness all directly shape her solitude and the nature of her work, and the crystal as recurring object powerfully charges the final image. Environment and object-as-setting integrate to constrain her options (she is effectively sequestered with analog relics in a post-dictionary world). This is high-level atmosphere, specific and purposeful without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    The fog sculpture garden is vividly and economically rendered, with the mutable sculptures mirroring the instability of Marcus’s visions. The environment matters tactically—fog’s lifting sets the window and the chalk-map is created on a literal stone at the garden’s center—and conceptually, as the sculptures dissolving at the end echo the theme of vanishing prophecy. Details like driftwood, salt-bleached wood, and the mutable horse/woman/wave show strong POV-filtered specificity. The world’s fog-net logic remains suggestive rather than systematized, but at this length that feels purposeful rather than underbuilt.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lunar observatory, cloud sea, and pale silver tree are vividly rendered and tightly linked to the story’s preoccupations with observation, distance, and the ephemeral. Environmental elements meaningfully charge choices: the altitude makes the lone tree uncanny and precious, the telescope and moon reinforce the idea of unreachable but observable states, and the shaking foundations echo the internal restructuring. The recurring image of above/below (clouds, stars, moon) frames the father’s “elsewhere” and Mira’s liminal position. One could argue the “lunar” specificity is more tonal than functional, but the setting consistently shapes the story’s images and final mood.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    The hospice “suspended in a radiant haven above the clouds” is vivid and consistent, and details like light “like honey through gauze” and clouds drifting below give a strong atmospheric container. Setting is filtered through function—window to nothing but sky, small worktable, coffee cooling—so it feels lived-in, not just decorative. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, but it meaningfully charges the tone and the final image (clouds seen through the gold-veined record). The surreal verticality of the place subtly underlines the liminal theme without needing overt explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle is vivid and specific—twilight skies, brass dome, telescopes aimed at the “spaces between” offer a strong atmospheric frame that fits the metaphysical premise. Details like the clouds glowing with borrowed starlight and the brass mechanism rising from the floor are concrete and well integrated into action. The environment, however, mostly serves as evocative backdrop and viewing platform rather than a constraint that tangibly alters her options or tactics. It charges the mood and concept more than it pressures choice, so it falls short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    The hedge maze, secret garden, apple tree, and grave are vividly rendered and thematically resonant, with nice sensory specificity (jasmine, honey-rot, moss, hollow bones). The maze and garden function as more than wallpaper, framing the journey from ordered rationality into liminal space where rules change. The setting slightly pressures choice (she must return here for revelation), and the closing hedge-maze image charges the final understanding. Still, the environment affects mood more than it constrains concrete tactics or options.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.0)
    The serpentine grotto, mist, mineral-coated walls, and coastal context are vividly and economically rendered, with details consistently filtered through Maren’s long familiarity. Setting actively shapes the premise: the mist and glistening stone amplify and diffuse light, enabling the non-fire beacon and charging the final image of mist carrying fragments of light outward. The recurrent use of the grotto—as a site of shared memory, work, and eventual offering—anchors the emotional arc as much as the physical space. Environmental specificity feels inseparable from the story’s meaning rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    The moss-filled data center is vivid, specific, and thematically resonant, with details like “raised floor tiles… now channeled actual water” doing double duty as worldbuilding and metaphor. Setting is deeply filtered through Mira’s gaze as someone drawn to patterns and reclamation. While the environment doesn’t force concrete logistical choices, it decisively frames the emotional stakes and charges the final walk “deeper into the garden.” The pendant as recurring object also helps satisfy the setting-as-constraint/charge gate for the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.0)
    The nexus in mist is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elena’s perceptions (“ground that felt like compressed whispers,” hopes like bioluminescent jellyfish). The seashell functions as micro-setting as well as object, literally warming and glowing as the environment and her understanding shift, and it charges the final image back at the desk. World rules for this liminal space are coherent and learned through action rather than explanation. The atmosphere strongly supports theme without slipping into generic symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.3)
    The arbor, vines, roses, altar, and sky are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Mira’s attention, creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. The environment does real work: the altar grounds the ritual, the tendril anchors stakes, and the moon/sun alignment constrains timing. Details generally feel selective rather than touristic, with botanic and mechanical elements interwoven. At this length, the setting earns its keep both as mood and as a functional frame for the story’s central act.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    The subarctic crater orchard is vivid and particular, from “skeletal apple trees” to “ancient volcanic glass,” and the microclimate logic is persuasive. Environment is not just backdrop: Maren selects this withered, sheltered bowl precisely because it is a “perfect vessel,” tying setting to method and theme. Weather and cold constrain her body and underscore the cost (frost, aching knees, prior frostbite). The final image of the aurora resuming above the rim elegantly charges the setting with transformed meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    The marble cavern and the “wounded season” are vivid and functionally integrated: marble geometry governs the echo mechanics, and the suspended season provides the low-noise window she needs. Details are selective and character-filtered (a locksmith noticing gears, angles, and resonance rather than generic cave imagery). The environment constrains her tactics (peripheral listening, light-angle mapping, timer positioning) and charges the final image of her sitting with stone, mechanism, and memory. This is publishable-level setting work, just shy of the very rare 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    The bronze grotto and its acoustics are vivid, specific, and central: “walls of living metal that sang when touched” both hold others’ burdens and enable Elara’s work. The starlit aperture and mineral sheen anchor tone and imagery while also shaping her tactics (facing particular walls to tune into specific griefs). The grotto and its rules directly charge the ending image—her weaving merging with the stone and the grotto humming with one more burden transformed. Setting is not a backdrop but the primary engine of the story’s magic and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    The loft, rain-beaded skylight, October city, and workshop objects are vividly, economically rendered and consistently filtered through Marguerite’s grieving gaze. Setting and object-as-setting (ash wood, lions, sawdust, kettle) meaningfully charge the thematic field; the workshop-as-former-studio subtly enforces the sense of living inside Viktor’s absence. Weather and interior color (“rust and amber,” copper pipes greening) parallel the rust-hued peace without feeling like blunt symbolism. The environment doesn’t much constrain her choices, which keeps this just short of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    The kinetic lagoon and halted carousel create a vivid, coherent atmosphere and are filtered well through Mira’s scavenger priorities. The environment matters—lagoon as resource and temporal distortion, carousel as emblem of stalled ambition—and the final image of the ghost dissolving into the spray is strong. However, the setting mostly works symbolically rather than constraining concrete choices moment-to-moment. A single sharper instance where the lagoon’s physical danger or mechanics affect her tactics would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.5)
    The abandoned spaceport is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Maya’s engineering gaze—vaulted ceilings, air ducts, water drips, and floor drains all feel tactile and purposeful. The lingering traces of the carnival deepen atmosphere and contrast temporary spectacle with infrastructural hope. The setting meaningfully shapes her thinking by offering existing “bones” and systems she can model rather than a generic ruin. The recurring image of the terminal as “patient as stone” at the end charges the final moment with a quiet, environmental gravitas.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is richly particularized—crystal-veined stones, quartz whispers, petrichor, the noise-plague, and the Silencing enchantment all feel integrated and lived-in. The environment is not ornamental: the soundless sanctuary and its anti-noise enchantment directly define the central problem and the possibility of its resolution. The forecourt’s physical properties (catching rain and tears, reflecting dawn light) charge the final image with transformed meaning. World rules around sound/silence stay consistent and are conveyed through concrete experience rather than infodump.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    The twilight canal, hollow warehouses, and drifting barge are vividly rendered and tonally aligned with the themes of ambiguity and revelation. The sundial and twilight recur to charge the final image, with the dark face measuring “only absence.” The setting is more atmospheric than constraining—her choices don’t depend heavily on environmental difficulties—but it feels lived-in and purposeful, not a postcard backdrop. Spatial and temporal orientation remain clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting work is outstanding: the golden dock, fish-oil amber, snow, fog phasing out landmarks, and the lighthouse beam all build a vivid, coherent world filtered through Mira’s priorities. Weather and environment meaningfully affect the scene—fog isolates the dock into an “island,” the snow accumulates as time marker and physical cost, and the final image of the empty dock and coiled rope is charged. The recurring rope and fulgurite function as object-as-setting, constraining her posture and attention and reappearing at closure. It stops just shy of exemplary only because the dock’s physical constraints don’t directly force a tactical decision in the climax beyond mood and isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    The shadowed autumn garden, ruined palace remnants, and salvaged carpet are rendered with high specificity (“persimmons left too long in the sun,” the moss-swallowed benches), and the environment is consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The crimson thread functions as a micro-setting object that recurs and is crucial to the final image as something carried forward. While the garden doesn’t strongly constrain her tactical options, the seasonal and ruin imagery deeply support tone and theme and evolve meaningfully by the end. Overall, atmosphere is rich and purposeful without bogging down momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cavern palace, stalactites, and mechanical birds are sharply realized and integrated into action, not just backdrop. The environment participates in the climax (light racing along chains, palace swaying, stalactites humming), charging the final image. Detail selection is purposeful and filtered through Aldric’s sensibility—mechanical birds versus remembered organic life. One step more of setting-as-constraint on his tactics could push this into true top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    The obsidian lagoon, black sand, succulents, and migrating clouds are beautifully particular and consistently filtered through Mara’s perceptions and profession. Setting is not a postcard; volcanic glass, kelp, and dunes mirror the themes of stored heat, scarred landscapes, and patient survival. Environmental details evolve (jar-filling, footprints that will vanish, walls gleaming with inner light) and strongly charge the final image of her leaving with the sand toward the city memorial. While the setting is more symbolic than constraining of physical choices, its material properties and mood are integral to the story’s logic and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    The City of Forgotten Fountains is vividly and economically realized, with basins, crystallized recollections, and frozen geese working as strong visual and conceptual anchors. Setting is not mere backdrop: the fountains’ nature as memory wells directly defines the problem and the mechanism of its resolution, and the final image (fountains flowing, geese resuming flight) is charged by that world logic. Details feel purposeful and filtered through Mira’s stakes rather than touristic. The environment constrains the story’s options and deeply colors its atmosphere, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    The nebula garden is vivid, textured, and integral: crystalline petals, frozen starlight, and light-collecting flowers both establish atmosphere and supply the mechanism for non-destructive illumination. Setting is not postcard-like; the flowers’ capacity to store and release light directly shapes the plot turn and the final beacon image. The gear and the garden’s architecture interact in a specific way (resonance, stored light) that charges the ending. Description density is high but well-controlled, supporting the mood and the thematic contrast between fire and stored starlight.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    The greenhouse, monarchs, and carved-stone streets are richly evoked and thematically aligned with cultivation/decay and migration/continuity. Details are selective and filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a carver and mourner, rather than generic landscape description. The environment charges multiple images (butterflies as moving grief, glass like frozen tears, stones as doorways) and subtly frames her choices to listen and sketch rather than flee. It doesn’t much constrain physical tactics, which keeps it just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    The obsidian ridge, tide, tower interior, and pendulum are vividly drawn and consistently filtered through Maren’s professional eye and shame, avoiding postcard description. Environment constrains and charges choices: the daily climb, the exposure to tidal pools where the rake handle appears, and the tower as a penance site all matter to her actions and the final image of the tide reclaiming the ridge. The pendulum as a micro-setting (reflection, pause, resumed swing) effectively mirrors and structures the key emotional beat. I’m capping below 9 only because, strong as it is, the setting supports rather than decisively transforms the final calculus in an unmistakably irreplaceable way.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cobalt silo, cemetery, stars, and brass case are all sharply rendered and filtered through Mira’s sensibility; atmosphere is strong and consistent. Details like “velveteen gloom,” “midnight-blue paint,” and grave objects build a coherent, tactile world. The setting meaningfully charges the final image (silo cupped under the cosmos, unseen grave coordinates), though it doesn’t quite constrain choices or tactics. Description remains purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.5)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vivid, tonally apt, and seeded from the first line; the lake’s buried Engine and history nicely mirror the thematic concern with knowledge and prediction. Setting is strongly atmospheric and returns in the closing image, but it rarely constrains concrete action—Mira would largely make the same choices in a less symbolically loaded room. Tools (desk, quill, modeling instruments) are present and partly embodied but stay mostly conceptual props rather than tactile constraints. Overall, specificity and mood are strong even if environmental pressure on choice is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ember alcove and mist are vivid, specific, and functionally integrated: the mist’s thickness and the radio’s modified glow directly constrain when she can broadcast, and the alcove’s warmth contrasts the surrounding repression. World-building around the Silence Decrees and scattered listening posts (Thornwick, Sallow Bay) is economical yet evocative, giving a textured sense of a territory under narrative starvation. The final image of dawn dissolving the mist while she banks her inner “fire” effectively uses setting to charge theme and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Vanishing Point Gallery, the impossible space of perspective, dust motes, and the threshold where ashes are scattered all create a vivid, unified environment. Setting is filtered strongly through Marina’s grief and professional eye, and the vanishing point literally and metaphorically charges the final image where her grandmother becomes “part of the infinite recession.” The gallery constrains the form of the ritual and the options for closure in a way that feels necessary, not decorative. Details like the rocking chair and mask are integrated into both atmosphere and meaning rather than feeling like mere props.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    The layered city—sewers, sedimentary ruins, drowned harbor—feels vivid and conceptually integrated with the story’s temporal and epistemic concerns. Details like verdigris on brass, drainage channels, and waterproof caches are concrete and filtered through Marcus’s archivist eye. The environment enables his mission (sewers as sanctuary) and charges the idea of buried narratives, though it rarely constrains a specific on-page choice under pressure. Strong, purposeful atmosphere, just shy of using setting as an active antagonist or problem-solver.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.3)
    The velvet library and autumn light are vividly evoked and tonally apt, with strong integration of environment and object (zither/rosette) into mood and meaning. Setting is filtered through Margaret’s sensibility—“traveled stillness,” “accumulated grief”—rather than as neutral décor. The rosette in particular becomes a micro-setting whose history and symbolism charge the final image. However, the physical space does not significantly constrain choices or tactics, so it charges atmosphere more than it shapes action.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rusted greenhouse and triple-moon sky are sharply rendered and thematically resonant, with details like “forgotten ribcage,” “iron bones bleeding orange,” and the graveyard of abandoned growth. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the decrepit greenhouse, prior regime experiments, and fractured ceiling all shape what’s possible, including the convergence of moonlight and the secrecy of the location. The final image—greenhouse groaning in morning wind, “purpose finally fulfilled”—charges the environment with narrative consequence. World rules (memory-foods outlawed, sterilized soil with surviving microbes) feel coherent and tied to choices.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lightning collection tower, amber “nectar dusk,” and phosphorescent moss create a vivid, coherent atmosphere filtered through Mira’s sensibility. The tower is not just backdrop; its memory chambers and copper infrastructure directly enable the resolution of the conflict. Recurring light/electricity imagery ties environment to theme (memory, stored storms) in a way that charges the final image. A slight limitation is that the broader city and storm fields are evoked more suggestively than concretely, but this suits the focus.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is richly and economically rendered—the bay, streetlights, swamp willows, and softened wood all feel tactile and specific. Details are clearly filtered through Marina’s sensibility, with smell (orris root), sound (water, heron), and light (amber, violet, honey) doing real atmospheric work. The Whitmore house and orris shard meaningfully charge the final image, tying place to memory and attention. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices, it deeply shapes tone and the story’s conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    The drowned garden is vivid and specific—coral-claimed marble, phosphorescent algae, statues as habitats—and this atmosphere permeates the entire piece. The environment meaningfully charges the final image of an immortal listener watching bubbles rise in a place designed to wait. However, the setting rarely constrains tactics or choices beyond being a beautiful, eerie backdrop; the underwater constraints on Mira’s body and options are underused. World rules about the consciousness-essence are consistent enough for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    The infinite staircase is vividly realized and functionally central: its geometry shapes her tactics (climbing, chalk-making, crack-hunting) and embodies the prison/laboratory duality. Details like pale stone that absorbs light and the golden rupture-light deepen atmosphere and theme without feeling ornamental. The environment meaningfully charges the final image—the new staircase is “identical yet different,” slightly warmer, reframing the whole space. A bit more sensory variety beyond the visual could have elevated this further.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rooftop greenhouse and smog-choked city are vivid and consistently filtered through Maya’s perception (“glass box,” “smog… like a living thing,” tomato vines curling around her ankles). The environment and the moonlight genuinely constrain options: the visions only come under moonlight in this elevated, glass-walled space, and the final charged image depends on that setting. The brush as a recurring tool-object is spatially and atmospherically anchored there, tying world and theme. Sensory choices feel purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    The grotto city behind the waterfall is vivid and sensorially rich—roar as silence, limestone ceilings, steam and yeast—filtered through Mira’s cultivated sensibility. Environment constrains their lives (hidden exile, dependence on the beekeeper’s access, filtered light), and the waterfall’s concealment is thematically tied to being forgotten. Recurring objects (emerald lens, ovens, manuscripts) are integrated with action, not postcard detail. The final image—waterfall thunder against a persisting grotto city—beautifully charges the sense of besieged continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is rich and purposeful: the rocky island at low tide, wrong-spiraled lighthouse, and hunger stone all actively shape options (access only at low tide, coordinates, the door’s keying). Environmental details consistently filter through Alaric’s sensibility (clockmaker noticing “spiraled wrong” stairs), which keeps description from feeling touristic. The returning tide physically and symbolically seals the path, charging the final image. Sensory texture is mostly visual but specific enough that the space feels coherent and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned funhouse, cursed mirrors, and “lingering luminance” are vividly, economically rendered and tightly married to the horror tone. Setting details (tilted corridors, warped floorboards, faces trapped in glass) feel filtered through Vera’s dread, not touristic. The funhouse and its mirrors also charge the final image, where her smiling face is added to the cursed collection, giving the environment a clear role in closure rather than mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating orchard, lashed driftwood circle, barnacle-crusted hull fragment, and blue-hour sky are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through her sensibility. Setting and recurring objects are not decorative: the sea’s violence and generosity, the fragile orchard, and the chimes all concretely embody her practice of turning destruction into music. Environmental details evolve—debris arrives, clouds shift configurations, soundscape builds—so the world feels active rather than backdrop. The final image of the orchard drifting leeward charged by storms-parting lore and ongoing wreckage integration gives the environment real thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    The turtle city, spiral shell, rusted gate, and distant watchers are vividly rendered and integrated into Mira’s perceptions rather than listed. Environment constrains choice (the rusted, fused gate; the narrow crack she must squeeze through) and charges the final image of the shrinking city on turtle backs. Sensory detail (sun bleaching to bone white, gold light that feels like a lie) sustains mood and supports theme. A touch more physical interaction with the living turtles during her departure could have heightened the embodied cost.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    The disused station and overgrown ivy are vivid, selective, and tightly integrated with mood (“green fire frozen in time,” “station’s hollow bones”), anchoring us in place early and sustaining atmosphere. The rosebush and its petals effectively bracket the story and symbolically charge the timing and ending image, and the first snow over the tracks that “led nowhere and everywhere at once” nicely mirrors the thematic turn. The environment does not heavily constrain tactics—Vera could perform the same actions elsewhere—but it meaningfully charges the final image. Detail balance is good: we see space, weather, objects and their decay without museum-tour excess.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    The submerged pavilion and flooded district are richly evoked and integrated into action—wading, diving, the columns as dead drops—rather than serving as static backdrop. Environmental constraints (water depth, hidden cavities, the sealed district at night) shape what Marina can do and deeply color the mood. The recurring imagery of water, foundations, and the pavilion’s “bones” charges the final image of her wading back with artifacts in tow.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sunken city library is vivid and purposeful: pressure of water, reinforced domes, bioluminescent kelp, and humming pumps all shape mood and action. The blackout and kelp light directly enable the discovery of the hidden compartment, and the outside fish in the last image reframe human meaning against the indifferent sea. Details feel filtered through Maren’s professional gaze (spines, margins, ledgers) rather than touristic cataloguing. There was still room to let the physical danger or logistical constraints of the underwater setting bear more on risk.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is richly imagined and specific—the floating island tea garden, jasmine-scented air, glass basilica, and gem-studded lantern all feel concrete and integrated. Environmental and object details charge key choices: the edge where Lin fell, the highest terrace, and the lantern itself all matter to the action and final image. The world’s rules (shadows detaching, dream recording tech) are conveyed through lived detail rather than exposition dumps and remain consistent. The lantern-as-tool and the garden/basilica as opposing poles of power effectively charge the ending (the basilica dimming in acknowledgment).

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    The floating observatory, perpetual twilight, and brain-like clouds are vivid, specific, and tightly filtered through Yara’s sensibility. Setting and key object (the geode) recur and deepen, especially in the final image where geode warmth and isolation refract the theme of hollow spaces housing potential. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices in-scene, it meaningfully frames her isolation and access to abandoned astronomical tools. The description is economical yet atmospheric, avoiding touristic excess.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory and the “brilliant dimness” are vividly realized and integral to the mechanics of the plot (the dome, pedestal, and lens literally enable the revelation). Details are well-chosen—crumbling dome, bronze lever, rotating segments—without feeling like a catalog. The setting is not just backdrop but the lock that the chips (keys) open, and dusk light conditions matter to how the starlight works. World rules around the observatory and starlight remain consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cobalt terrace, forgotten shore, and “sieved hush” are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Maren’s sensibility, giving the piece a memorable atmosphere. The driftwood carvings and carved hand with the watch fragment do more than decorate—they become the pivot point of the scene and charge the final image on the terrace. Spatial and sensory anchors (tiles, silver driftwood piles, tide line) are clear and evolve with the action. The environment shapes the ritual and the realization rather than feeling like a postcard backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The watchtower and parapet are vividly evoked—mist, crumbling stone, wind carving grooves—and the setting consistently mirrors the neutrality and erosion themes. The environment is more atmospheric than constraining, but elements like the 15-pace distance and the mist-obscured figures provide spatial clarity and tone. The antique drawer pull works as a micro-setting object that recurs and charges the final image of Mira pocketing it again. While the weather doesn’t materially alter tactics, the scene feels grounded, textured, and thematically coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    The coastal setting and weather are vivid and purposeful: fog, November cold, lighthouse, bluffs, and utility poles all mirror and structure her inner state. The compass and coastline function as micro-setting elements that directly charge the final image and concretize her grief and tentative return. Details are selective and filtered through a navigator’s eye, avoiding generic “sea” description. It stops just short of the very top band because the environment, while thematically rich, doesn’t significantly constrain her choices beyond mood and path.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underground bioluminescent lake is vividly realized and tonally apt, with strong sensory detail and a resonant operating-theater comparison. The algae are not just décor; their responsiveness to emotional honesty directly constrains how Marcus must navigate, and they charge the final image around his feet. Spatial logic (lake, tunnels, stone, shadows) remains clear. A slightly wider range of non-visual sensory cues could deepen immersion further, but what’s here is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    The orchard under perpetual moonlight, silver soil, luminescent fruit, and responsive trees all create a vivid, coherent fantastical environment. Setting isn’t mere backdrop: the thinning veil, the orchard’s reaction to the spices, and the phoenix’s off-stage presence directly condition what is possible. The final image (orchard as “eternal witness”) effectively charges the setting with thematic weight. Sensory detail is rich and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    The midnight glade above the clouds is intensely specific and sensorial—cloud sea, pressing stars, jasmine and ozone, “grief preserved in amber”—and always filtered through Morrigan’s emotional state. The setting is not just decorative: its premise as “where lost time accumulated” is what makes her quest possible and gives logic to the card door and suspended firefly-moments. Recurring objects within the setting (silver ladder, saucer, cards) charge the final return to earth and the pocketed saucer. Environment and concept meaningfully constrain options, supporting a high-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.9)
    The “cathedral of salvaged memories” hull and observation deck bruise in space are vivid images that support the mood and themes of salvage, guilt, and fragile hope. Environmental details (grated floors, workshop, photograph-lined walls) are economical yet grounded in Mei Lin’s priorities. The ship and the bruise in space do charge the final image as the vessel passes into the healed dimension, but the physical setting rarely constrains tactics or choices on the page. World rules around photos and tears feel consistent and are mostly learned through her activity rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    The black sand beach, smoldering volcano, and bioluminescent water are rendered with precise, evocative detail that feels necessary rather than ornamental. Setting is meaningfully entwined with the premise: “where fire meets water” literalizes the prophecy, and the sand, tide, and volcanic hush all charge the final images of release and erasure of footprints. The jars, lightning bugs, and planetary conjunction function almost as micro-settings, recurring to shape both action and closure. This is lush but controlled atmosphere that materially supports the story’s stakes and ending.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Luminous Fort, its glass panels, the Eastern Tower, and the twin sundials create a vivid, coherent physical and symbolic environment. The blackout and the architecture meaningfully frame the intrigue, even if they don’t quite box Maren into hard tactical constraints. The recurring light/sparks imagery charges the final image of the fort “holding the last light like a promise” and the twelve sparks below. World rules remain consistent and are delivered efficiently through action-tinted exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    The frictionless world, tidal bluff, aurora, and eels are vividly rendered and integrated into how people move, how ships behave, and why Meren occupies this specific liminal place. Environmental conditions (slick stone, glassy sea, thriving eels) directly motivate her tools and options, and the aurora’s shift to a “borrowed dawn” literally charges the final image. Worldbuilding details (ropes anchored to bedrock, protein supply from eels) feel selective and purposeful rather than touristic. The setting consistently supports both tone and premise without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observatory above the storm is richly realized and tightly braided with mood and meaning—the lightning, dome, and telescope all reinforce her liminal position between silence and broadcast. Weather is not merely decorative; the storm becomes an answering presence, a “percussion section” for her speech, charging the ending image. Objects like the timer, timetable, and telescope are well-situated in the space and used rather than just described. A slight cap comes from the setting constraining choice more symbolically than logistically.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    The glass atrium, half-painted sundial, and brook are vivid and integrated, not mere backdrop: the sundial encodes information, and the brook’s indifferent continuity charges the final image. Detail selection feels controlled and filtered through Elara’s priorities, with the mechanical arm and sundial functioning almost as micro-settings. The environment supports the dignified/violent contrast and the theme of hidden peace under diplomatic surfaces. It could go further in concretely constraining tactics during the duel, but what’s here is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rusted, roofless library under stars, the prison bars as shelves, and the coffee tin are all precise, atmospheric, and integrated into action. Setting is filtered through Mira’s experience—“stars poured through the gaps like witnesses,” “shelves made from prison bars”—so the world-building feels both tactile and thematic. The environment tangibly shapes stakes: the ruin’s invisibility to patrols, the need to work by candlelight until the moon rises, and the physical debris they salvage from set the constraints. The final image of blooming resistance in broken ceilings and rusted metal is deeply charged by all the prior concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal arbor above the clouds is vivid and conceptually specific, with atmospheric “currents that remembered the ocean” and a shifting alignment that directly constrains the window for action. Objects-as-setting—the clock, piano, projector, compasses—are integrated into how the world works and how choices are made. Weather and altitude shape the timing and visibility of the craft’s approach. The final image of the horizon inviting night from above the clouds is resonant and grounded in everything established.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and particular—the “purple starflowers,” “golden ferns,” and impossible coexistence of orchids and alpine moss create a memorable, lived-in environment. The ridge and soil are meaningfully integrated with the premise (they “remember” and literally receive the seed), and the approaching monsoon adds atmospheric and temporal pressure. Details are filtered through Yara’s professional and cultural lens, so they never feel like cataloguing. This is very strong work; the only thing keeping it just below the top band is that the environment constrains choice conceptually more than through specific tactical moves.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    The islet, post-storm mist, and tide imagery are vivid and thematically aligned with memory and recurrence, while the cottage and window seat give the reconciliation a tangible locus. The compass and lace function as micro-setting objects that shape perception and charge the final image. Environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, so its role is mostly atmospheric rather than tactical, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.


== Grader: Gemini 3 Pro Preview ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.4)
    Atmosphere is exceptional; the "smell of drowned things" and "columns of gold" dust serve as active participants in the narrative rather than mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is atmospheric and well-drawn, with the terra-cotta arbor and silver moonlight creating a strong visual texture. The sensory details effectively ground the scene, though the "salt winds" description leans slightly toward generic literary prose.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmospheric details of the viaduct and the inverted jasmine are evocative and effectively ground the scene in a specific "watercolor" mood. The camera obscura provides a strong, tactile anchor for the magical realism elements, though the setting exerts little pressure on the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is not merely atmospheric but functional; the "negative curvature" and "impossible knot" of the bridges actively enable the climax, serving as the lens that reveals time's texture. The integration of botanical and mathematical details creates a vivid, constraint-driven environment that shapes the protagonist's final tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is rendered with vivid, specific sensory details—"elephants with matted fur," "keys yellowed like old teeth"—that effectively ground the dystopian tone. The environment is not just a backdrop but integral to the plot, as the piano serves as the locking mechanism. The atmosphere of dust and decay contrasts well with the "dormant miracles" of the seeds.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is masterfully integrated; the sunken greenhouse and forge are not just backdrops but the essential tools of the narrative's central action. The sensory details—specifically the synesthetic translation of the aurora and the "fractured glass"—charge the atmosphere and constrain the protagonist's work. The environment feels heavy, lived-in, and physically pressuring.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting integration is strong, utilizing the shifting light from sunset to moonlight as a functional ticking clock that dictates the heist's timing. The sensory details ("jade-tiled walls," "amber rays") are vivid and specific, though the "emerald station" description leans slightly toward the ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    The atmosphere of the weeping ice and frozen bunker is palpable, establishing a strong mood of transition. However, specific details like "rusted hooks" and "dark monitors" lean on post-apocalyptic staples rather than the unique "glass containment" imagery promised by the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid ("iron bones groaned," "stars pressing down"), establishing a strong mood. However, the environment serves largely as a backdrop and does not specifically constrain the characters' choices or tactical options during the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.5)
    The flaking gold leaf booklet is an excellent, tactile object that grounds the magic system in specific sensory detail. The setting establishes atmosphere well, though descriptors like "screaming gales" lean into cliché and the "darkness" remains a somewhat generic void.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is established with excellent sensory authority ("seventeen different kinds of silence") and atmospheric specificity. The central object—the ice violin—is handled with tactile precision ("ice did not melt against its metal fingers"), grounding the surreal elements in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sensory details like "wet stones" and the acoustic properties of the space effectively ground the scene. However, the "whispering crystal" aesthetic leans on genre-standard tropes, and the environment feels somewhat static until the sound dynamics come into play.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    The physical details of the marbles ("clouded with age," "split down one side") are excellent micro-setting elements that ground the abstract concept. The atmospheric description occasionally dips into cliché ("wind that smelled of endings and beginnings"), which detracts from the otherwise specific garden imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    The atmospheric details of the gas giant and the station ("legs of a sleeping spider") are vivid and ground the scene well. The setting effectively mirrors the protagonist's isolation, though the prompt-forced phrase "mechanically warm" feels slightly repetitive and disrupts the otherwise solid sensory work.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.7)
    The atmospheric details—flickering lanterns, trembling shadows, flooded velvet—are vivid and establish a strong mood. However, the specific mechanics of the "treble clef map" remain abstract and difficult to visualize as concrete geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.4)
    The weather station functions as a thematic crucible; the instruments measuring pressure mirror her internal state, and the smudged illustration acts as a vital micro-setting constraint that charges the final philosophy. The environment actively shapes the metaphor of prediction versus reality.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    The valve wheel draped in beads is a vivid, haunting micro-setting that anchors the story's emotional weight. While the atmosphere is generally strong, the initial description of the tunnel ("gaped like a confession") feels slightly overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    Atmosphere is the piece's standout strength; the "drowned city," "roots threading," and "walls shedding scales" create a vivid, textured world that fundamentally shapes the protagonist's role. The setting effectively constrains the premise—decay forces the shift from preservation to witnessing—and charges the sensory experience of every paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    The eclipse imagery ("amber and strange," "corona flaring") is vivid and anchors the scene well. However, the specific imagery of "dreaming roots" is overused, appearing five times in a short space, which dulls its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with the "curved walls" and "bronze quiet" creating a cohesive, tactile atmosphere. The silo's physical properties (concrete resonance) are well-integrated into the plot mechanics, grounding the abstract magical realism.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is atmospheric and integral, with the lighthouse beam and fog mirroring the themes of revelation and obscurity. The microdot specs function well as a micro-setting/prop that anchors the character's history.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    The atmospheric blending of the cathedral setting with sci-fi elements (dimensional anchor, loop pedal, void) is vivid and specific. Details like the "ash gray" paint mixed from collapsed dimensions and the "acoustic void" effectively ground the high-concept premise in sensory reality.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.5)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the glass spire and the "mirrored horizon" are not just backdrops but active constraints that enable the final realization. Sensory details are precise and evocative ("cold glass," "accumulated silence"), grounding the metaphysical themes in tangible experience. The environment actively charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.5)

    The setting is atmospheric and cohesive, effectively grounding the "hollow promises" of the abandoned cove. Specific details like the "amber bottle" and "bioluminescent algae" create a distinct visual texture, though the logic of the world softens into generic fable physics at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, blending the ancient (orchard, clay) with the futuristic (Meridian Tower, 60 stories) in a vivid Solarpunk tableau. Imagery like "sky the color of bruised plums" and "twisted toward a sky" creates a distinct, cohesive atmosphere. The environment actively frames the ritual, though the "apple coordinates" push the setting's agency a bit far.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frozen atrium is rendered with vivid, sensory-rich detail ("silver ribbons," "cold burn") that effectively grounds the fantasy elements. While some descriptors lean toward cliché ("cathedral of ice"), the setting successfully acts as both constraint and resource for the central ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting of the windblown sanctuary is evocative and spatially grounded, acting as a pressure chamber for the story's events. Sensory details like the "gold into platinum" light and the texture of the "scarred" hemp rope are specific and tangible. The atmosphere effectively supports the "solstice hush" tone.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Specific physical details like the broom, stardust residue, and amber glass effectively ground the setting. However, the atmosphere occasionally drifts into vague abstraction with descriptors like "ancient peace" and "primal elegance" that tell rather than evoke.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stained glass box is a vivid, constraining object that centers the scene effectively. However, the broader setting relies on post-apocalyptic stock imagery ("copper sky," "bleached bone-white") that feels generic rather than specific to this beekeeping oasis.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.1)
    The "emerald silo" creates a vivid, constraint-based environment where "green waves" make time visible, grounding the metaphysical premise in sensory reality.

    The setting is vivid and conceptually distinct, blending botanical and mineral imagery effectively. The "living stone pillars" and copper interactions create a strong, specific atmosphere that grounds the fantastical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)
    The atmosphere is a strength, with "bronze quiet" and the rainwashed tower creating a cohesive, meditative mood. While the visual details are vivid, the setting functions more as a backdrop for thought than a source of pressure or constraint on the character's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active participant; the specific chemistry of the water and the currents dictate the protagonist's actions. The interplay between the phosphorescent flora and the dead reef creates a vivid, cohesive ecosystem that constrains choice and charges the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.2)
    The "metal dreaming of being earth" imagery efficiently charges the setting with thematic weight that pays off at closure. The sensory details of the scrapyard and compost pit vividly constrain and guide the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.5)
    The observation deck is vivid in visual detail, but the sci-fi physics are fundamentally incoherent. The story asserts "the universe rushed past" while simultaneously describing stars and the ship as "suspended" or "moving impossibly slow," which directly contradicts the stated rule that "seconds here equaled hours below." This logical breakage undermines the setting's credibility and the reader's orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "sky-wrong" and "bruised plums" imagery creates a distinct, vivid atmosphere that grounds the fantasy. The cloud-ice chess set effectively integrates the setting with the plot's central puzzle.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    The whispering gallery is not just a backdrop but a constraint that shapes the protagonist's method (walking names) and the story’s central metaphor (amplified absence). The chessboard functions as a critical micro-setting, anchoring the climax in a specific physical interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral to the plot; the mountain bookstore feels like a living antagonist and partner. Sensory details—the "insects beneath glass" of the stone, the "barbs and rachis" of the feather—ground the fantastical elements in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    The frozen tableau is rendered with evocative specificity; the "flour suspended in a cloud" and "laughter preserved" are standout images that anchor the magical realism. The "platinum labyrinth" and "woven hush" create a cohesive, tactile atmosphere that supports the story's fable-like quality.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is not merely atmospheric but functional; the specific acoustic properties of the canyon and the architecture of the bone towers actively constrain and enable the protagonist's tactics. This integration satisfies the high-band requirement where environment charges the final image and dictates the method of resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is atmospheric and exerts genuine pressure; the "acid sea" and the lurching "cathedral of gears" are tactile and integral to the stakes. The sensory details ("emerald vapors," "copper pontoons") effectively ground the magical elements in a physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sensory details are vivid and specific, particularly the "living punctuation" of the crabs and the "mineral tears." The cave atmosphere is palpable, though describing it as a "cathedral built by water and time" veers slightly into stock imagery compared to the freshness of the rest.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "bruise" of the lighthouse and the misplaced garden scent ground the magical realism in visceral, specific detail. The sensory environment effectively mirrors the internal shift from exhaustion to renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and tactile, with details like the green-black patina and buried cables grounding the magical elements. The station functions effectively as both a physical shelter and a spiritual instrument, constraining choices and shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.4)
    The "hanging orchard" is an exceptional setting that physically manifests the protagonist's precarious psychological state ("suspended on steel lines").

The sensory details ("steel lines that sang... like broken instruments") are vivid and thematic.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is integral to the narrative logic; the mist and the "opal dock" do not merely provide atmosphere but actively constrain the timing of events and charge the final image. The sensory specificity ("bruised light," "pale finger") firmly anchors the ethereal elements in a physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the rising creek acts as a dynamic constraint that forces the protagonist's hand. The bioluminescent cavern is vividly rendered ("glimmer like captured starlight") and charges the final decision with specific atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    Descriptions of the "bleeding starlight" and the mist are vivid and atmospheric. However, a significant orientation issue exists: the location is named "ember grotto" in the second paragraph and "cobalt grotto" subsequently, with no explanation for the shift from red/dying imagery to blue/mineral imagery. This inconsistency disrupts spatial grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with the thermal vents and "geothermal whispers" providing excellent atmospheric pressure that contrasts with the "frozen time" of the shell. The environment feels lived-in and integral to the alchemical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sensory shift from olfactory memory to the tactile reality of the water clock shop is vivid and grounding ("copper oxidation," "faint petroleum"). While the shop itself is realized with specificity, the atmospheric description occasionally slips into purple prose ("city's slow tears") that detracts from the grit of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting acts as an active constraint rather than a backdrop; the "breath between storms" creates a functional ticking clock, and the specific atmospheric conditions (cold, wind) directly enable the magic system and the protagonist's solution.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.7)
    The archive setting is rendered with evocative sensory details ("smelled of dust," "fluorescent lights flickered"). The contrast between the dusty interior and the doomed orchard outside effectively grounds the supernatural elements. The setting actively pressures the timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, establishing a vivid, mythic sense of place with details like "manuscripts floating in amber light" and time pooling like water.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bioluminescent farm is drawn with vivid, atmospheric detail that serves the plot directly rather than just acting as backdrop. The integration of the setting into the mechanism of the epiphany is excellent. A few descriptors lean into vagueness ("something beyond naming," "captured starlight") which detracts slightly from the otherwise precise technical-organic imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Atmosphere is the standout strength; the "submarine, greenish light" and the specific tactility of the cracked mica lantern ground the scene effectively. The setting details actively mirror the protagonist's internal state.

    The setting is the story's strongest asset, using specific sensory details like the "walnut-ink" and "blooming jetty" to establish a consistent, fable-like atmosphere. The environment effectively mirrors the thematic focus on preservation, though it serves more as a backdrop than an active constraint on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is active and thematic; the ivy "swallowing" the station mirrors the protagonist's need to be reclaimed by connection. Details like the "pruning shears like weapons" effectively charge the atmosphere with necessary tension.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.3)
    The "ultrasonic forest" is a triumph of sensory specificity, translating landscape into vibration and texture without relying on visuals. The environment actively constrains her movement and informs the dowsing process, integrating setting deeply into the action.

The environment effectively mirrors Vera's internal stasis and eventual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong sensory grounding defines the piece; the "liquid silver" harbor and "vibrations through the floorboards" effectively charge the atmosphere. The setting actively shapes the mood and the "silence" concept, acting as a third character that anchors the abstract themes in concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.1)
    Atmosphere is consistent, but descriptions often lean on abstract adjectives ("cathedral of whispers") rather than sensory specifics that constrain movement. The archive feels like a generic backdrop until the portrait appears, lacking distinct tactility or spatial geography.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sound wave garden and auric lagoon are integrated into the plot mechanics rather than serving as mere backdrops; the acoustic properties justify the climax. The sensory details—bioluminescence, resonance, harmonics—create a cohesive and immersive atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is excellent, with the storm's electromagnetic interference forcing a reliance on sound that creates a unique, constrained atmosphere. The container maze feels tactile and vast, directly shaping the protagonist's method of navigation and the plot's progression.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.9)
    Atmospheric details like the "cobalt dock" and "bruise healing" are evocative. The score is limited by the boathouse shutters functioning as a high-precision light projector; this mechanical impossibility distracts from the realist setting and feels like a convenient contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "cobalt library" and the "magnetic grotto" are distinct, vivid, and atmospherically rich. The magnetic quality of the basement effectively constrains the props (chess pieces clinging to the board), grounding the magical realism in physical detail. The atmosphere of "amplified quiet" permeates the scene effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting of the "sublittoral fringe" effectively mirrors the protagonist's liminal state. Specific details like the scrimshaw's texture and the "twilight zone" lighting ground the magical elements in sensory reality.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    The wind turbines are effectively used not just as scenery but as a rhythmic constraint ("shadows sweeping... like the hands of a broken clock"). The dried bouquet and whittling wood provide necessary tactile grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the cobalt glass, frozen lake, and humming quartz provide a vivid, reactive stage that grounds the magical elements. While the imagery is evocative ("twilight caught in glass"), the environment yields too easily to the protagonist, failing to act as a constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting actively pressures the scene, from the "residual heat" of the phoenix to the specific transformation of the glass shards from grey to "impossible emerald." The environment anchors the metaphysical change in concrete sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the Laboratory of Lost Sounds is rendered with vivid, synesthetic specificity that grounds the abstract themes.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    The "black as wet stone" cards and the "rain-beaded skylight" create a cohesive, somber atmosphere that mirrors the post-crash economic reality. The specific use of the measuring tape anchors the abstract concept of "mapping belief" in a tactile, memorable action.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmosphere is strong, with specific sensory details like the obsidian door, saffron veil, and bronze prism grounding the scene. The "colors that no longer existed" and "geometry that defied" tropes act as slight drags on specificity, but the physical environment generally pressures the mood well.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and integral; the specific constraint of a cloud-bound library with no rivers gives the stone its high value and justifies the shadow's grief. The imagery of "translucent walls" and "light-lattices" successfully establishes the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.1)
    The chameleon tail tip serves as an excellent micro-setting that grounds the abstract theme. The workshop atmosphere is vivid, though phrases like "mist curled" and "universe seemed to breathe" lean slightly toward atmospheric cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting blends clinical and mystical elements effectively, with the "frosted hourglass" and "coffee rings" serving as tangible, choice-constraining anchors. The specific sensory details of the plants (ivy, moss) deepen the atmosphere and reinforce Mira’s ability.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    The projection booth is rendered with excellent specificity ("smelled of nitrate dreams," "cork," "Simplex"), and the setting actively constrains and shapes the resolution. The environment feels lived-in and integral to the magic system, grounding the abstract concept of "unused love" in tangible machinery.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.3)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, effectively anchoring the mythic tone with details like the "brass tarnished to old blood." While the imagery borders on ethereal, the physical presence of the instrument grounds the scene sufficiently for the genre.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the bioluminescent dune and "divergent archive" creating a strong, specific sense of place. However, the environment serves primarily as a passive backdrop for the encounter rather than an active force that constrains or complicates Mira's physical actions.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with sensory details like "serrated like ancient saws" and "velvet pistons" that go beyond visual description to guide the protagonist’s actions. The environment actively constraints and informs the narrative, serving as both obstacle and map.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting relies on ethereal abstractions ("colors that had no names," "mist that parted reluctantly") rather than concrete, grounding details that constrain the character. While the "shore of light" is visually distinct, the environment functions as a backdrop for the lesson rather than a physical space with rules that pressure the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.1)
    The "cobalt fortress" and the "bruise" imagery establish a vivid, oppressive atmosphere immediately. The piano and the bolt serve as excellent micro-settings that constrain focus and ground the abstraction of the "silence" concept in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, rendered with atmospheric precision and sensory detail like the "iron gall" smell and "constellations shift."

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmospheric details like "starlight pour through like silver rain" and "skeletal towers" effectively ground the scene and support the tone. The juxtaposition of the ancient stones within the mechanical spaceport is visualized clearly, though some descriptors feel slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.8)
    The volcanic setting is established with decent sensory details (sulfur, steam, moss), though the "reconstruction" backdrop feels abstract. The environment provides atmosphere but does not actively pressure the protagonist's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Excellent integration of environment; the salt-blasted cliff and the orchids' fragility mirror the protagonist's internal state without heavy-handed symbolism. The setting actively constrains the action (wind, soil texture) and grounds the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.5)
    The atmosphere of the "echoing library" and the "sheets" of snow effectively mirrors the frozen stasis of the minds. The setting exerts pressure on the mood, though some descriptors lean toward cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and active; the "tranquil blaze" and the specific quality of light in the dome constrain the atmosphere effectively. The glass dome functions as both a physical barrier and a thematic lens, filtering the harsh world into something manageable.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and active, with "crystallized vibrations" and "humming gravel" doing excellent sensory work that reinforces the central conceit of sound/silence. The environment actively responds to the protagonist's progress (the path straightening), functioning as a dynamic constraint rather than a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory setting is atmospheric and functional, mirroring the protagonist’s detached perspective ("cities like circuits"). The sensory details of the tarnished dome and burgundy ink effectively ground the abstract intellectual conflict in physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is not just a backdrop but the engine of the plot; the resonance chambers and the "fold" in time actively constrain and enable Vera's actions. The specific detail of mapping star patterns onto sound chambers creates a unique, tactile environment that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory details regarding the thermal sensors and cave atmosphere are vivid and ground the scene well. However, the emotional mapping leans into color clichés ("cool blues," "warm yellows") that flatten the specificity of the "unknown" environment.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    The amber warehouse is evocative and tactile, effectively grounding the abstract premise with details like "fossilized crates" and "crystallized resin." However, the setting functions primarily as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraint or active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    The atmosphere is consistently "silver" and cold, creating a cohesive sensory experience that mirrors the protagonist's emotional distance. The setting is not just backdrop but a functional tool; the melting snow on the bluff actively delivers the plot's inciting information.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is integral to the narrative logic; the temple is not just a backdrop but the source of the resolving metaphor (the spheres). The sensory details of the post-storm light and the "glass stillness" of the water effectively mirror the protagonist's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    The imagery of the topiary maze growing from a clipping and scars acting as maps is vivid and specific. The setting anchors the magic effectively. The description occasionally dips into abstraction ("color of bruises and promises") that blurs rather than sharpens the visual.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is vivid and specific, utilizing the &quot;roots snaked through femurs&quot; and &quot;phosphorescent moss&quot; to ground the setting. The environment constrains the interaction appropriately, though some elements like the skull patterns feel slightly ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prism sanctuary is an evocative setting that actively participates in the scene ("prisms angling to catch her answer"). The atmosphere is consistent, though the reliance on "fractured starlight" becomes repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is active and distinct; the damp stone, the fading pigment, and the "tear" in the painted map are not just backdrop but the primary evidence driving the plot. The final image of the shadows reaching like hands charges the closure with visceral environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.7)
    The atmospheric details of the sunken library are vivid ("books had become coral," "anemones... displaced librarians"), creating a strong sense of place.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    The visual imagery is distinct and cohesive ("floating rock arches," "silver-barked trees"), anchoring the reader firmly in the world.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)

The contrast with the "digital" world below feels generic and lacks lived-in texture or interaction with the protagonist's immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting of the floating valley and indigo-stained hands creates a vivid, specific atmosphere that anchors the fantasy elements. However, the environment primarily serves as a scenic backdrop rather than a source of physical constraint or tactical pressure on the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.1)
    The "feral loft" and sensory details of the dunes are vivid and anchor the scene well. However, the setting feels more like a static backdrop for reflection than an environment that forces specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, treating the ice as a tactile constraint ("negotiation between her weight and the frozen pontoons") rather than just a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.3)
    The underground lake provides a stable visual anchor, though descriptions like "impossible blue" lean toward generic. The setting becomes mechanically relevant only at the end via the algae interaction, but this feels more like a magical convenience than a grounded environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.9)
    The sensory details of the spices (saffron in eclipse shadows, cardamom in dragon breath) provide specific, textured grounding that elevates the fantasy setting. However, broader descriptions lean toward standard genre tropes ("silver soil," "luminescent fruit," "ancient life") which softens the atmosphere's uniqueness.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    The "empirically whimsical" ridge is excellent, functioning as both atmosphere and a necessary plot enabler that supports botanical contradictions. The setting actively participates in the resolution, justifying the high score by constraining and guiding the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.1)
    The atmospheric details of the wet islet and mist are vivid and establish a mood of melancholic quiet. However, the use of "cerulean light" feels forced for a misty/storm-aftermath setting, creating a slight sensory dissonance driven by the prompt requirement rather than environmental logic.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Greenhouse shards, sediment layers, and refracted light through broken roof panels are tactile, specific, and filtered through Mira’s scientific gaze; the butterfly-slide drawer functions as micro-setting that constrains her final selection. Sensory economy is excellent—smell of drowned things, crunch of glass under boot—each detail doing double duty as emotional echo. The orchid at the end is a perfect object-image reprise, reweighting the stakes without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Canyon, frost, and charcoal strip all act as micro-settings that constrain decoding choices; frost literally rewrites the ledger before her eyes.

Final frost-light rainbow scatters through residual crystals, charging the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    The crystalline walls, frozen petals, and fogged handprint are tactile, POV-filtered, and constrain movement (glass walls = no escape, frozen stems = fragile touch). The tuning-fork case reappears as “empty” at the end, charging the closure image with spent possibility. Sensory hierarchy is respected: vision and temperature dominate because hearing is gone. Environment and tool jointly force her final stance; without the conservatory’s preserved specimens the experiment—and thus the arc—would collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    Kelp-wrapped parcel, saltwater on workbench, coral-crusted spires—details are filtered through undertaker pragmatism (“his hands intimate with silence”). Micro-setting rule met: the lens itself constrains every choice once handled. Spatial choreography clean: descent through “impossible spaces between shelves” is internally consistent under dream-logic taught early. Atmospheric tone of “chased stillness” modulates from mortuary hush to submarine hush, charging the final image.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.6</grade>
    <comment>Dominant stake—grant unwitnessed dead their witness—signals in line 1 via package “addressed to no one living.” Each burial rite tightens the cost: seven nights blur, lungs fill with ocean, exhaustion accumulates. Agency remains his: he “spoke aloud” each name, fusing fragments. One micro-turn suffices at this length; escalation is accumulative density, not causal reversal, and lands with felt fatigue that forecloses further wandering.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    The arbor’s clay pillars constrain every gathering; their salt-weathered surface mirrors the community’s erosion. The silver bell’s micro-setting—tarnished map of every palm—functions as portable homeland, charging the final pocket image. Spatial choreography is clean: volunteers arrive “in twos and threes,” crates descend from a borrowed truck, distances tracked through back paths and culverts. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mira’s urgency—moonlight first, then rationed candlelight, finally the dawn glow on columns—never a tourist catalogue.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    The viaduct, jasmine, fog, and wooden camera form a coherent micro-setting that constrains movement and supplies the only channel through which love can be vented.

Environment, tool, and body together charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rotting carnival prizes, dust beams, and the piano’s “yellowed teeth” are filtered through Mira’s scavenger eye; each detail doubles as emotional mirror and tactical map (keys = staff). Micro-setting of shackles and arrow constrains final choice. Spatial track clean: scout exits same doorway he entered. One slip: “eastern dead zones” named but not yet sensory.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    The greenhouse’s cracked ribs and geothermal forge are not backdrop—they are the only place this imprint can occur; the final image of green light through fractured glass literalizes her own cracked trust. Kelp-threaded iron constrains her every motion; the ashen forge’s heat dictates tempo. Micro-setting (the glass fragment) is handled twice and returns in the closure, recharging meaning. All sensory picks are POV-filtered: “singing green” is synesthetic, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.3)
    Emerald tiles double as mirror + pressure gauge: jade-to-silver shift signals moonrise and triggers visible jar glow, coercing the swap beat. Spatial choreography is clean: vendor row, bench, exit turnstile track without impossible drift. Selective sensory triage—scent of jasmine, cool glass, chime—serves urgency over panorama. Micro-setting (moonbeam jar) literally constrains next move: visible radiance forces accelerated departure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.0)
    Frost-covered console, weeping ice, and single red bulb operate as micro-setting that literally powers her next move; spatial choreography stays coherent as she circles the room. Sensory selection favors touch and sound (drips, thunder of calving ice) that mirror internal thaw—economical rather than catalog. Weather and environment directly affect the choice: melt makes descent possible, solar batteries viable. Bookmark as portable setting-as-object constrains her final gesture, meeting 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    Roofless library under star weight is more than backdrop—mirrors exposure and forces standoff in open sight. Salt-ruined astronomy texts ground the spatial choreography; every shelf and wind-groan is filtered through Marla’s hyper-vigilance. Micro-setting of the shell-as-recorder constrains the reveal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.3)
    The fort’s broken stones, screaming wind, and flaking gold micro-setting constrain every move—she must climb barefoot, shelter in ruins, and let metallic dust seed the map. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: salt-tanged gales over visual panorama. The final glow of the booklet against absolute dark charges the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Frozen courtyard, crystalline pillars, and the ice violin are not backdrop: the violin’s impossible physics forces Unit-7 to re-categorize reality and thus triggers the bowing. Twilight light is filtered through machine optics (“purple light…geometries that should not have existed”). Spatial track is clean: fountain center, dropped broom, raised bow. Weather (slow spiraling snow) mirrors the mental blizzard of amalgamated minds while remaining tactically inert—only the violin acts.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    Crystal forecourt functions as micro-setting: rain-slick facets amplify footfalls into music, guiding Mira’s eavesdrop; the bench and spire provide coherent spatial anchors for the exchange. Lens and tickets act as portable setting-extensions that constrain choices—she sees through it, he draws on them, both are re-handled at climax. Sensory selection stays inside POV bias (registrar’s ear for echo, archivist’s eye for refracted light). Environment mirrors internal thaw without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible object positions.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    Atmosphere is selective and sensory: grease scent, amber-violet cloud layers, cold deck air against warm scanner hum. The station’s spider-leg arms and folding cloudweaver wings serve as both spectacle and timekeeping device; spatial choreography stays consistent as Mira moves from hull to deck to quarters. The “mechanically warm” vibration recurs as a tactile anchor that charges the final image. Minor slip: no evidence the environment ever truly threatens or constrains her choices—beauty is vivid but not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    The flooded pit functions as micro-setting: water level constrains every movement and dictates the camera angle for the coded stains. Lantern flicker is not mere ambience—it selectively reveals the shifting Voss portrait, charging the final disappearance. Sensory hierarchy obeys Clara’s musician ear: silence between lapping waves mirrors “unstruck chords.” One minor over-description of velvet seats early on is forgiven because the body-as-buoy and cello-case-as-vessel soon dominate spatial choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Frost-garden on the window, juniper tea, barometers, and the cot’s narrowness are filtered through Cassandra’s meteorological gaze; each returns to mirror her shifting certainties.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.0)
    The obsidian refuge’s fractured reflections and the river’s voice physically constrain her final stance; the micro-setting of the origami swan in her palms charges the last beat. Every sensory note is filtered through her witness-poetics, never touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sage Ridge is anchored early, sensory layers (dusty perfume, bird false-evening song) filter through Elena’s therapist gaze, and the locket micro-setting constrains the decisive hand-off. Spatial choreography is clean—summit blanket, root myth, eclipse corona—each detail re-enters to charge the ending. One missed chance: the “underground rivers older than memory” never pressurize choice; they stay decorative. Yet environment suffuses the final image enough to meet the 9+ gate for constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    The silo’s “bronze quiet” and curved concrete function as both archive and resonant instrument; the tapestry fragment is handled, turned, pocketed—an object that literally re-weights the world. Micro-setting excellence compensates for sparse external geography.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lighthouse lamp room as micro-setting constrains every move—circular desk, automated beam she’s powerless to stop, archives literally in her hands. Fog and sweeping light return in final image, re-weighted from surveillance to self-guidance. Spatial choreography is tight: specs travel from nose → desk → box, tracking her shift. Tool-level specificity (microdot film, ink, paper slips) anchors Cold-War residue inside domestic ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.7)
    Cathedral as pocket-dimension is sketched with three concrete anchors: flagstone hum, acoustic void, ash-gray dust that literally re-stitches reality. The palette’s single color and the pedal’s muffled repeats function as micro-setting objects that constrain every tactic; without them the exorcism fails. Spatial choreography stays clean—kneeling distance, circle of symbols—so the body-in-danger feels placed.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    Glass spire and mirrored lake are not backdrop but instrument: the horizon’s duplication literally teaches the before/after doubling that closure reenacts inside her. Cold, pre-dawn breathlessness narrows perception to sound and vibration—perfectly selective. The nautilus segment operates as micro-setting pressed against window, turning entire tower into resonator. Setting constrains the final choice: only here, only now, can silence be transduced into fortune.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    The viaduct’s phosphorescent algae and rain-slick stones are not backdrop but causal texture: their bright-dark paradox mirrors and constrains her perception of self. Micro-setting—tablet in palms, wet stone against soles—grounds orientation within 50 words. The final ascent is charged by the glowing arch beneath, making environment inseparable from the closure image. Spatial choreography stays clean: suspended → descent → rise again tracks without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.0)
    Cavern acts as micro-setting that literally channels vibration into Marina’s body, constraining the only path to feeling; drum-skin tension and leaf-scrape supply tactile immediacy. Sensory selection stays POV-true—sound is never described, only vibration and light-fracture through the needle. Weather/rustle beat returns in final line to re-charge the closure image. Spatial choreography clean: Elias emerges, places feet, guides hands—no floating bodies.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rusted mill gap, dry fountain, and lavender dusk are filtered through Mira’s weather-eye; the courtyard’s stopped water echoes her suspended safety. Spatial track is clean: bench → pocket → coat → home path. The brass tube constrains the next move and is re-handled twice, nearly qualifying for 9+ gate; however, it does not physically limit her escape route, so stays sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Glass-and-regret cathedral, UV racks, crystal sediment swirling in three drops—each detail is tactile and choice-limiting: the UV array permits the bloom, the vial’s facets refract both light and memory. Spatial choreography clean: aisle walk, central chamber, pocket-to-hand-to-light motion tracked. Environment forecloses escape; she must confront scent inside this sealed past. Micro-setting (vial interior) charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    Terra-cotta grotto is not backdrop but instrument: warm clay pulses under back/hips, star-fissures pattern the page, forcing reclining-sharing choice. Rope micro-setting constrains the climax—fiber texture must be handled to complete the pattern. Sensory hierarchy favors touch over visual, matching Marcus’s bias. One soft cliché—“rivers of abandonment”—but overwritten sentences are sparse; no 9+ gate missed.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sunken greenhouse, cracked panes, salt-clouded glass, and tide-lapped wrecks create an irreplaceable micro-setting that physically alters acoustics and forces her to play "between" sounds. Apple trees and copper bowl are handled, not catalogued; their states evolve (unripe fruit at start / bowl glowing at end) to mirror internal shift. Spatial anchors hold across single scene; no impossible positions. Sensory hierarchy obeys her acoustic bias—sound textures prioritized over visuals—staying character-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    Amber fractures, resin taste, and static-charge mapping turn the grotto into a second body that literally conducts her transformation; the spent petal left in a wall crack recharges the setting at exit. Selective sensory hierarchy mirrors her professional bias for chemical emotion. Environment constrains the final gesture—only amber can preserve the petal’s trace.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rooftop library, salt wind, and pulsing lighthouse beam are vivid and selective; the same glass ceiling returns to silhouette Marina’s final decision, giving the setting closure charge. Dock geography tracks cleanly across eras. Weather is used to dissolve the symphony, not just decorate. One micro-setting—the 1952 dock configuration—constrains recognition and triggers the whole quest, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Crystalline orchard is not postcard scenery—its light-fractured heat guides when and where sculptures are left; crater mist supplies the dawn meeting site. Reed itself becomes micro-setting: its fragility mirrors the community’s provisional weave. The obsidian arbor returns as charged closure site; removing it would collapse the communal ritual space. One small over-telling—“the air itself seem wounded with beauty”—is filtered through Veren’s perception and thus forgivable.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    The rooftop canal system is not backdrop; its gravity-defying water guides Miriam’s footing and signals Aldros’s sleep-state, determining when echoes can be freed. The crystallized-sound cage is a micro-setting that physically constrains her final action. Infinity pendant as recurring object heats/changes state, charging the last image. Sensory hierarchy is illustrator-specific—line-weight of light, “feathered impressions”—never tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cavern orchard is never mere wallpaper: drip intervals supply the “mathematics” she literalizes, phosphorescent moss feeds both fruit and spell-light, stalactite fissures frame the moon as natural lens. The mosaic stepping stone is micro-setting that doubles as calculator—every missing tile a live variable that constrains her finger-traced algebra. Spatial choreography stays clean (kneel, place brown eye at spiral, green at tree-branch) without puppet-master narration. Environment passes the 9+ gate by shaping tactics and recharging the final image of “orchard seemed brighter.”

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Library’s crawl spaces, boiler bones, and dawn-shadowed shelves act as micro-setting that literally constrains movement and supplies her hoarding highways. Ferromagnetic tape and corroded copper fittings are tactile tools that charge the final cache. Sapphire hush evolves into silver light, mirroring her shift from shadow curator to active gift-giver. Spatial choreography never falters; bodies and distances tracked cleanly through ducts and stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mossy trellis functions as micro-setting that constrains her stance—wood once alive, now leaning toward her—mirrors her transition. Rain timing is causal: pauses let her reach the trellis; its return forces the final surrender. Sensory hierarchy plant-biased (“slow, meditative drip” she can read). Spatial choreography clear: kitchen→path→trellis, distances held. Final image of roots testing soil is tactile, not symbol-stated.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    Salt-crusted walls, diagonal rain sheets, and the tide-warmed stones are filtered through Mira’s painterly attention, constraining her decision to cross. The museum’s intact case and pooled rainwater literally point the way, integrating setting into plot. Micro-setting—her paint-stained fingers, the seaweed veils—carries emotional charge without cataloguing. Spatial choreography is flawless; we never lose track of body, object, or distance.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.1)
    The cave’s singing crystals constrain pace and perception—song deepens into language, colors bleed with each step, forcing Vera to “walk blind.” The pearl’s alcove, worn smooth by millennia of drips, charges the final image: moonlight she can hold. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.1)
    Salt-stung paper, verdigris on brass, and rain-scrubbed limestone are selective and POV-filtered. The trumpet valve serves as micro-setting that constrains choice: its repair record forces Elena to cross-reference and thus publicly resurrect the lighthouse crime. The harbor’s post-rain luminescence bookends the piece, charging the final lamplight image. One minor slip: “glistening with the particular luminescence that gave the harbor its name” is a touch expository.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    The starlit vault is more than postcard: its crystalline ceiling fractures starlight into directional cues, turning the sky itself into a map that undercuts Clara's craft. The phantom punch operates as micro-setting—its warming brass and impossible weight tether abstract mystery to sensory reality. Spatial choreography is flawless; the door stands freestanding, bronze on nothing, a deliberate cartographic impossibility that forces her surrender. The vault's mist and star-cast light constrain perception, steering her attention from surveyed ground to revealed path.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    The tower’s circular roof opening, star-refracting tile, and whale-borne vibrations constrain attention and later choice. Micro-setting objects (tea tasting of honey and “something unnamed,” worn pen) are handled, not catalogued. Spatial choreography clean: Mira sits, watches tiles, writes, descends. Environment mirrors internal state—starlight “danced across the journal’s blank pages” without forced symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    The escondite’s crystalline membranes and seventeen-dimensional refraction are returned to again and again, constraining motion (“trapped”) and later enabling the collapse. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Vera notices light that “hurt her ancient teeth,” a tactile specificity that marries world-rule to body. The “hushed thunder” beyond the door re-anchors setting as emotional state, passing the 9+ gate by charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prep-room micro-setting rules every beat: arterial fluid scent, steel counter, fluorescent-lit corpse—these constrain dialogue distance, object handling, and moral tone; the ink pot’s cloudy glass is returned to like a compass, charging the final image as it catches streetlight.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.2)
    The blooming bonsai labyrinth is not backdrop but engine: its spiral forces Mei’s repetitive climb, its impossible blossoms refract the lamp-light she must record, and their ancient patience contrasts her consumptive cataloguing—environment that charges the final image. Every sensory pick is filtered through her paper-maker’s bias (gold leaf, cedar, “tastes of ash and wedding cake”), so the mountain becomes a texture quarry, not scenery. Spatial choreography is pristine: she enters, reaches center, exits, same path, same silence, yet the trees’ micro-seasons mark invisible time. The setting constrains her choice to keep ascending, making the labyrinth indispensable to stakes and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    The port-container labyrinth is not backdrop but agon: rusted walls “eight stories high” compress movement, ladders dictate escape routes, moon-pull governs visibility and audibility. The tide-as-clock forces every tactical climb or descent; the sodium-orange glow above versus the mud-choked silence below mirrors her liminal citizenship. Micro-setting objects—glass-square label, rust on fingertips—constrain choice and physically carry memory. One decimal off 9 only because a single spatial coordinate (“lower passages”) is briefly vague in the overhear beat.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    Observatory as cracked cranium mirrors Eleanor’s fracture; every tactile detail (rust, November chill, bow vibration) feeds the stake. The half-finished cello becomes micro-setting that constrains the impossible music, charging closure. Selective senses—sound foremost—keep economy tight. Only nit: “perpetual gray sky” edges toward weather cliché, but dome wound redeems it.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.1)
    The raft city is sensuously alive—accordion vs. steel-drum clash, painted hulls, rope bridges—each detail filtered through Mira’s body and agenda. The foundation-stone chip micro-setting re-appears at the end to charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room lapses. Could use one more tactile beat of water underfoot to tighten constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.0)
    Volcanic scree, aperture light, satellite glare—details are filtered through Elena’s professional eye and selectively deployed. The summit constrains movement and supplies the reflective lake that literalizes “held breath,” feeding the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no exposition dumps. Lacks one tighter object-interaction beat that would push it into 9-band.

    Opal walls, cloud-level library, foxglove regret, calcified hope—these particulars are sensory, selective, and filter through Mira’s caretaker eye. Micro-setting (bamboo tube, orchids) constrains the ritual and literally hosts the closure image; no white-room lapses. Weather and spatial choreography stay consistent; world rule (names fossilize into orchids) is shown, never exposited. The setting’s emotional palette directly powers the thematic engine rather than acting as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    The archive is never a postcard; dust and forgotten vowels filter through Maren’s professional eye, guiding her eye to the phosphorescent moss and the faceted inkwell that ultimately holds their reflected faces. The glass well functions as micro-setting: handled twice, it refracts their images into fragmentation then possibility, literally charging the final image.

The micro-setting of the press dissolving into light charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Baroque asteroid is not backdrop; its spirals “catch temporal flow like a sail,” directly enabling the climax. Micro-setting (crystal shard, uncovered mirror) constrains the final tactic—only through their physical interaction does passage occur. Sensory selection is POV-filtered: Maren notices gilded arches, ignores mineralogy. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Weather (temporal storms) directly affects action—covering/uncovering mirrors. Setting thus charges the final image; meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    The resonance chamber’s copper walls, amber pulse, and transformed rust are not backdrop; they modulate the only two actions Elias can take (play or stop). The micro-setting of the workbench arranges the seven boxes in a fixed geometry that must be obeyed for the ritual. Sensory selection skews auditory and tactile, matching a tuner’s ear. Final sparkle of “copper stars” recharges the opening covenant of rust.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lagoon is not backdrop; its bioluminescent alphabet literally spells the invite that reconfigures Maren’s options. Spatial choreography is clean—narrowing passage → cathedral columns → water’s edge → spinning compass. Sensory hierarchy obeys her collector bias: scent > sight > sound. One micro-slip: “captured sky” is a hair cliché, but the phrase is immediately re-weighted when the water replies with living letters, so closure image remains charged.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Archway, storm, and lantern slide each constrain choice: granite offers back-rest, slide demands lightning angle, wind sets clock for revelation. Micro-setting (palm-sized glass) literally steers final tactic; no 9-band only because salt-air physics stays generic.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Honey-colored panes, copper light, and etched seed-to-figure sequence are concrete and motive—glass strata literally direct her brush. Weather shift from melting snow to spring bypasses cliché by syncing with mural completion, not mere seasonal marker. Micro-setting dominates: the cathedral-layer window constrains her final insight and later governs visitor ritual, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography clean; no floating bodies or impossible sight-lines.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.1)
    Obsidian lagoon is handled like a living archive—reflecting sky and history—its glassy surface literally cuts Celeste’s knee, constraining her stance for recording. Zeppelin library’s restricted section and rusted fence supply tools and obstacles that shape access tactics. Micro-setting (beach-debris code) returns in the final circle of stones, reweighting the lagoon as a courtroom rather than a relic.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cove’s bioluminescent algae, empty lantern cords, and later the crystallized memory-lanterns are tactile, plot-functional objects that constrain tactics and charge the final image. Selective sensory economy—glow, warmth, weight of amber—keeps momentum. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Meets 9+ gate: the lantern-object environment directly shapes the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Skyscraper orchard as micro-setting constrains her choice—no escape, only upward roots; apple-drop code directly shapes final recognition. Sensory triage under crisis: bruised-plum sky, windless leaves, amber spiral—each mirrored in her internal bruise/glow. Tool-as-setting: wax shaving is handled, warmed, and re-weighted at closure. Spatial choreography tight—60-story height felt in vertiginous silence before dawn. No exposition dump; world rules (oath-scribe craft, temporal fold) learned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ice is not backdrop but instrument: its crystalline lattice must be sung into alignment, constraining how Maren can move without shattering history. Starlight “poured in silver ribbons” is visual, yet the crunch of frost under boot and the burn through glove give tactile counterpoint, keeping scale human. Spatial track holds: perimeter walk → fountain center → cap placed atop, all within a single dome. The oak acorn cap micro-setting functions as pivot: its spiral geometry is the literal template that re-orders ice, so object-as-setting charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cathedral’s impossible altitude—storms dying below, light arriving “unfiltered by the world’s accumulated grief”—is lived-in, not toured. Micro-setting objects (the scarred rope, her sensors) constrain every choice: she can test tension but never pull until equilibrium data permits. The bell’s timbre is described through atmospheric feedback, fusing setting with instrument. Environment directly shapes the final act: only at perfect barometric balance does the rope become a viable choice.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Observatory stones, moss-choked scopes, and the yellow lantern glass are tactile, lived-in, and fate-bearing; the amber lens literally refracts both starlight and meaning, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—ladder, railing, dome slit— and the environment’s decay constrains her mobility and options, anchoring the stakes of staying.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dead orchard’s heat-shimmer and bleached hive boxes aren’t backdrop—they filter what Maren notices (cracked earth = cracked voice), and the stained glass box functions as portable micro-setting that literally constrains her choice to withhold/release words. Final image of gold bees projected across desert walls recharges the orchard’s lost pollinators, marrying setting to theme. One micro-slip: “copper sky” leans generic amid otherwise razor-specific idiom, but it doesn’t dull the closing projection.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.1)
    The emerald silo’s glass walls catch light to make “seconds visible as shimmering green waves”—a micro-setting that constrains perception and finally charges the sealing image. The capsule and urn fragment function as tactile tools whose cracks and textures guide Vera’s choices. Spatial choreography is immaculate: fragment moves from palm to seal, light shifts as holograms project. One notch down because exterior weather/environment never press back, but interior objects satisfy the micro-setting gate.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt lagoon mirror and the feather’s iridescence are not postcard prettiness—they constrain Mira’s attention and later become the literal material of the kite’s repair, charging the closure image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a poet notices “burnished hush” and kelp twist before practicality. Micro-setting (the feather as tool) meets 9+ gate. One hairline slip: “burnished hush” edges toward thesaurus drift, but cadence justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is not postcard backdrop but tactical partner: hollowed pillar gives oak water access, copper threads guide human hands. Micro-setting (body, diary, copper spool) constrains climbing and conduction choices. Sensory hierarchy obeys Maren’s botanical gaze—spiral growth, mineral consciousness—never tourist catalog. Final image of gleaming threads against stone recharges the orchard as living architecture, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rainwashed tower, the overgrown sculpture path, and the amber itself are used as micro-settings that literally steer who can enter and what can be touched; the spring light break at the end re-illuminates the same stones, charging the closure image. Density is selective—“bronze quiet” keeps the palette tight—while spatial choreography stays clean across six silent bodies.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    The blooming jetty’s phosphorescent planks, calcified water chemistry, and bird-perch pilings are tactile, sensory, and choice-relevant: seeds must enter this exact current at this glow intensity. Environment directly supplies the minerals that will sprout tomorrow’s shoots, charging the closure image. Micro-setting (seed pods, leather pouch) handled repeatedly, states tracked. One minor over-lyric (“narrow vastness of the twilight sea”) slightly dilutes specificity, but overall setting constrains tactics and resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    Refrigerator shell as perch, compost pit as inverted grave, and the shipping-container Archive all double as metaphor and tactical space; each site constrains Marta’s next move. Scrapyard textures (rust flakes, oxidizing metal bleeding into clay) are filtered through bloodhound sensory hierarchy—smell > sight—keeping description purposeful. Micro-setting gate met: the waxed leaf’s “amber perfection” against rust charges the final image of translation. One minus: timeline of “three winters ago” vs “fifteen years” could tighten for sharper chronology.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    The observation deck functions as micro-setting: the warped glass, the spider-silk temporal field, and the compass rose itself constrain every action—how slowly Mira moves, how the star positions diverge from ground truth. Sensory selection is biased to her astronomer’s eye: light that “hangs like honey,” footsteps that echo in elongated corridors. The deck’s physics never contradicts itself; even the approaching ship obeys dilated time. Gate met: the tool (compass rose) literally charges the final image as she smoothhes it onto the cover.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    Icebound Spire is sketched through tactile cold (“cloud-ice that never melted”), violet sky pressing like “a living thing,” and the chess table whose cloud-ice pieces constrain the puzzle. Micro-setting—sundial lid in palm, warm vial in frozen air—charges the final image. Spatial choreography holds: vault apex reachable only during sky-wrong, stair descent tracked. One proper-noun economy lapse: “Vault of Names” is named twice in two lines; minor.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Whispering-gallery acoustic and missing-pawn chessboard are not backdrop but instruments: the dome’s scatter of sun-fragments constrains where she stands to whisper, the pawn-less squares literally forbid conventional play. Spatial choreography is immaculate—footstep alphabet, acoustic focus points, marble table center—every move tracked. Sensory hierarchy obeys camp-honed attention: sound and touch (footfalls, carved wood) override visual spectacle. The final image of restored pawns on alien board crystallizes setting as memorial tool.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mountain-bookstore is not backdrop but active archive: shelves grow roots, corridors reconfigure in response to Vera’s re-inscription, turning the setting into a living text that answers back in the tongue she etches. Micro-setting—the feather’s barbs, the stone’s insect-symbols—constrains method and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: descent to “deepest level,” ascent to “peak where light still reached.” Environment, body, and tool fuse into one constraint system.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Frozen tableau supplies an immediate, tactile micro-setting: suspended flour grains, half-turned rope swing—details noticed by a man who parses stillness for a living. The platinum labyrinth’s mirror at center becomes the decisive environmental pivot that forces self-confrontation. Thunder lull functions as lived weather, never decorative. Spatial choreography stays crisp as Marcus kneels, threads, rises, walks away.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    The canyon’s echo physics is not backdrop; it enables the entire refract tactic and charges the final image. Bone towers constrain movement and supply the carved surface that absorbs the multi-truth. Mist thickness modulates auditory surveillance, directly shaping the poets’ positioning. Environment, body (paint-stained fingers), and tool (tower as resonator) together constrain the climax—meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    The workshop and statue function as micro-setting: every gear and crater constrains how she can move (grabbing the statue’s hand for balance) and what she can feel. Selective sensory hierarchy—emerald vapors, brass warmth, acid hiss—mirrors her narrowed crisis perception. The acid sea’s hunger and the groaning pontoons evolve with events; after the transmutation, the same sea is now lit by her second sun, showing environmental causality. Spatial choreography is clean: lurch → grab → press throat, no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Coastal cave functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: only its phosphorescent pools and narrow egress allow the new painting to exist; tide clock supplies implicit deadline. Sand “no larger than his studio apartment” and ancient wall paintings ground scale and time. Sensory economy privileges salt smell, mineral tears, crab punctuation—details that later migrate onto the canvas. Meeting 9+ gate: environment’s tidal threat directly shapes the decision to leave and the price of impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt tower’s bruised paint, stone breathing after heat, and salt-crusted glass are worked into ascent and gesture; environment steers choice when Mira decides the tower is the only place that can receive the boy. The vial cork micro-setting constrains the final gesture, charging the closing image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and urgent—no postcard filler.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    The starlit signal station functions as both macro-setting and micro-tool: its broken hydraulics and salt-rotted lenses directly constrain what she can build and force the mirror-array solution. Patina-green bronze censer foot acts as portable shrine-anchor, handled in at least three beats, its changing weight charting her emotional register. Spatial choreography stays clean—rocks, workstation, windows track believably during overnight labor. Weather and moon phase affect visibility and thus tactic timing, charging the final mirror-alignment image. No static tourist catalog; every detail is filtered through her bereaved sailor’s eye.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    The hanging orchard is not backdrop but dare: every gust threatens cables and forces her to value the relic. Steel lines “sang in the wind like broken instruments” is auditory specificity that fuses setting and mood. Micro-setting of the eye’s temple-housing constrains the crucial lie test; without that anatomical detail the mechanism fails. Final image of trees “surviving anyway” mirrors her earned stance, charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    Opal dock’s iridescent planks and bruised twilight light are not backdrop but instrument: the glow literally enables night-reading of the logbook and motivates the full-moon vigils. Micro-setting (pressed alpine flower) constrains the final gesture—only this object could mountain-signal across oceanic distance. Spatial choreography clean: dock length, mist swallow, body placement tracked without drift. Weather (mist thickening) times the beat of memory intrusion, forcing the pencil act now, not later.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    The limestone ridge, ant-crack entrance, and phosphorescent flora are concrete, POV-filtered, and supply both wonder and a ticking physical clock; the cavern itself constrains the final binary—step through or drown. Spatial choreography remains exact; no white-room moments. Micro-setting qualification met: the matrix chip functions as tactile environment in hand and wall.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt grotto functions as micro-setting that pressures choice: starlight bleeds literal “luminous ichor,” giving the queen an external correlative for buried trauma. Spatial choreography is tight (handholds slick, mist “curling around her ankles”), guiding her ascent. Weather/starlight fusion supplies both atmosphere and oracle credibility; no physics amnesia. The setting’s mineral walls and ascending fireflies mirror internal shift without overt symbol-dump, though the palace geography below remains placeholder.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    Micro-setting succeeds: the pocket-sun’s corona and nautilus columella literally constrain the final choice—handing over the shell dims the sun, signaling consent to change. Heat shimmer, sulfurous air, and magma chorus are filtered through Mira’s alchemical gaze, never touristic. Spatial choreography is immaculate: Theo’s shadow crosses the bench, shell passes hand-to-hand, distances hold. Environment mirrors internal shift (nexus cools as she lets go), yet avoids overt symbolism. Meets 9+ gate: tool charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Birch bark, cabin window, meadow grave—each recurs and constrains: bark demands handwriting, grave demands acknowledgment, window frames the climb she’ll attempt. Mountain wind’s scent of “birch and snow” recharges opening bark image at closure. Spatial choreography tight: table → window → meadow below tracked cleanly. Micro-setting (her own handwriting on bark) functions as environment that limits action. Meets 9+ gate: recurring object charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    The shop’s condensation-fogged windows and patient drip of clepsydras act as micro-setting that constrains Elena’s every motion; brass mechanisms and mineral deposits replace scent as her perceptual filter. The midwife clamp’s tactile coldness and historical heft charge the final handshake, literalizing “ordinary miracles.” Spatial choreography is impeccable: Elena’s bench, screwdrivers, copper bowls track cleanly across the scene. Weather shift—fog lifting—mirrors corrosion removed, underscoring theme without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Body-as-setting functions: forearm scar becomes parchment; quill and kettle are tactile tools that constrain gesture. Weather and rock motion are filtered through her narrowed storm-trauma perception—steam scent, rain curtain, dry pocket at centre. Spatial choreography is clean: kettle, cups, quill, crows circle; no impossible moves. Final image of iridescent scar on living flesh charges closure. Environment does not merely mirror mood—it is the page she must write on. Micro-setting qualifies and reweights choice; just shy of 9 because description occasionally luxuriates until the rune-drawing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    Archive air (“dust and forgotten symphonies”) is smelled, tasted, heard in fluttering pages; the perfume bottle’s faceted glint becomes a handheld star that guides the trap. Micro-setting succeeds: the third-row seventh shelf is a spatial anchor that later delivers the manuscript. Orchard threat is sensed through chainsaw dawn, not just declared. Environment never over-described; every detail either chills the ghost or narrows Marcus’s tactical options.</question>
    <question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—free Eleanor’s soul before the orchard anchor vanishes—is signaled early and tightens when chainsaws wake at dawn. The electromagnetic attempt is the one meaningful escalation; failure would leave her “smoke” homeless. Cost is legible: Marcus kneels in defeat-redemption, knowing the orchard—and part of his own myth—will still be erased. Stakes remain personal, not abstract; no world-saving inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.6)
    The temple library is rendered with sensory exactitude—manuscripts floating in sourceless amber light, shelves curving inward and upward simultaneously—details that feel alien yet concrete. Environment directly enables the climax: the circular reading chamber with suspended scrolls supplies both the illusions to be unraveled and the spatial form of spiral arbitration, fusing setting and plot. Micro-setting qualifies: the cracked softcover dictionary operates as tactile terrain, its blank pages charged in the final image. Spatial choreography is dreamy but internally consistent; no impossible moves undercut the hallucinatory logic.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    The station, fjord, and cliff edge are economically sketched yet sensorily sharp: “brass instruments aimed at the perpetual twilight,” “fjord quiet pressing against the windows like something alive.” Micro-setting objects—hydraulic clocks, copper tubes, mantle clock key—are handled on the page and directly enable the climax (key turns the lock, clocks hum the countdown). Spatial choreography is clean: Einar moves from workbench to observation window to threshold without drift. Weather/environment (still black-glass water, star reflections “too sharp”) mirrors the crystalline razor edges that appear in the glass, satisfying the 9+ gate for charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.1)
    The bioluminescent farm is not backdrop but physics: wavelengths that “shouldn’t exist” actively teach the permeability thesis. The laser tool and ghost-mushroom spores constrain Maya’s final metaphor and her literal path through the rows. Spatial choreography is pristine—rows, thresholds, membranes track cleanly. 9+ gate met: the mushrooms’ glow charges the final image of permeable grief.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rain-soaked library, clover scent, and green submarine light are not backdrop; they filter Margot’s attention and steer her preference for “something submarine.” The cracked mica pane functions as micro-setting: its fractured yet functional glow mirrors her own damaged utility and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is tight—book, candle, folder track cleanly across the beat. Only the sealed-window date (1987) drifts toward gratuitous specificity, but it never perturbs choice.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    Subway tunnel geometry is visceral: steam pipes graze shoulders, rotary dial clicks “like teeth,” glass shards paint rainbows on wet concrete. The disc serves as micro-setting—its vibration from passing train literally sings the theme—qualifying it to satisfy the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and echo over visual catalog. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    Jetty at twilight is sketched with selective sensory economy—roses “catching the dying light like fragments of stained glass” fuses color, motion, POV bias. Micro-setting (locket brass warming against palm) functions as tactile anchor that charges the final image. Keeper’s plank-formed body supplies surreal specificity without over-description. Dock geography stays consistent; no spatial drift. Setting never constrains a tactical choice, so capped at 7.6.</question>
    <question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“will she renew the covenant?”—is signaled by paragraph 4 and tightens once: release the locket or keep it. Escalation is textural/accumulative; tension builds through pattern density (letters, roses, Keeper myth) rather than reversals. Agency is renunciation; the cost is the locket itself, paid on-page. Pressure stays coherent; no external antagonist needed. Missing a mid-course tactical narrowing, so stays sub-8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ivy as living shroud, moon rock under fractured skylights, fox duo in ticket booth—each image is tactile and filtered through Maya’s disaster-trained eye. The station’s dereliction mirrors her emotional abandonment while supplying the secret lab’s cover. Micro-setting rule met: the overgrown platform constrains her movement (she must sit on a trunk) and charges the final image of “plants never stopped reaching.” Only gap: no smell or temperature cue at the climax to fully exploit sensory hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ultrasonic forest, platinum ring, and bark-as-text function as micro-settings that actively channel her route; each tool constraints motion and is handled, not observed. Sensory economy is POV-filtered—she “hears” through boot leather—so place feels lived-in, not toured. Final image of ring humming toward “home” re-anchors the entire trek.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.1)
    The gravitational anomaly is not backdrop but active agent: it folds causality, lets the radio question slingshot backward, and physically tilts the deck under Vera’s feet. The fountain-pen/meteorite iridium is micro-setting that constrains her last move—dry nib forces palm-scribble equations, charging the final image. Sensory triage is POV-true: she clocks “centuries-late starlight” and skips tourist catalog. One minor over-label of “impossible directions” keeps it from 9.3.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    Harbor as micro-setting constrains every move: moonlit planks serve as classroom, witness stand, and final pulpit. Camera, lighthouse cottage, and dock boards are handled, not toured; their texture returns in the closing image of Elena framed “against the waking harbor,” recharging prior motif. Spatial choreography is clean—bodies track from cottage shadow to shoulder-touch to departure. Weather-light shifts from “liquid silver” to “pink and gold” mark beat transitions and mirror internal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    The volcanic cathedral of whispers, the stone alcove protecting the chest, and the scratched-out eyes of her own likeness all constrain her next move—she can only stay and inherit. Sensory selection is urgent: headlamp as sole light source, temperature shifts read as text. Micro-setting (the vandalized portrait) literally charges the final image. No orientation debt; anchors arrive within the first 90 words.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Crystalline paths, acoustic spires, and bioluminescent lagoon are filtered through Mira’s musician-ear bias; every surface she strikes becomes a tactile instrument. Spatial choreography is clean—spiral ascent, perch, descent track without drift. The garden’s stored sounds constrain tactics: only by drumming can she unlock the lattice, so setting actively shapes climax. Final image of starlight bending through water recharges earlier Elias sketch, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.1)
    Port-container maze is rendered through sonic geography and auroral sheen; every metal surface either deflects or channels sound, dictating tactics. The storm is not wallpaper—it scrambles compass, flickers paint, and justifies the key’s electromagnetic vulnerability. Micro-setting (folded paper, brass key) constrains the pivotal fold that reveals the final path.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dock, rain puddles, warped planks, and shutter slats act as micro-setting that literally constrains every tactical move (where she stands, how she angles light). Stillwater tension is rendered through precise sensory hierarchy: visual gleam of dental mirror, haptic creak of shutters, acoustic hush after rain. Weather evolves with beat—overcast fragments become scattered star-diamonds—mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean: guardian at junction, boy at far end, beam travels uninterrupted to his chest. Dock after rain is indispensable to final charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt library’s bruised indigo walls, the magnetic grotto’s iron breath, and the mirrors that steal starlight are not mere ambience; they literally clutch the chess pieces and permit the silent conspiracy. Mist and starlight function as micro-setting that constrains visibility and time, forcing nocturnal action and hidden assembly. The setting re-enters the final image when Eleanor leaves the board in the grotto, so environment charges closure. Detail is selective, never touristic; each sensory note folds into either magnetic practicality or thematic hush.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sublittoral fringe functions as micro-setting: its twilight pressure literally enables her gilled lungs and propels the final dive. Whale and bone scrimshaw are handled tactilely—vibration, glow, warming palm—so the “tools” constrain tactics. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: she notices shimmer, sand, pressure, not tourist visuals. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from tidal pool to drop-off to island threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    The turbines’ rhythmic shadows function as micro-clock and panopticon, directly constraining her staging choices; every time she must freeze her face as the blade sweeps. Dried bouquet and pine curls act as micro-setting—handled, cracked, scattered—each state change forces the next covert beat. Farmhouse isolation and neighborless fields are sketched with three swift strokes yet decisively remove external rescue. Final image of brittle petals reflected in blank window glass recharges both objects, earning the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    Cobalt atrium and frozen lake double each other, forcing Mora to read her own reflection as text; quartz colonnade functions as micro-setting that literally vibrates syntax into light—an environmental tool that alters her poetic method. Cold air narrows sensory palette to crystalline sound/blue, matching exile’s austerity. Spatial choreography holds as she moves from threshold → colonnade → window → reading spot. Weather (lake crack) evolves causally with voiced verses, sealing causality between inner speech and outer world.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.9)
    Glass courtyard anchors every beat; heat-pulse under palm, cooling slag colorfields, and furnace kneel all constrain body placement and ritual sequence. Micro-setting qualifies: the shard-strewn flagstones literally cut Mira’s knees and refract new light into her eyes. Jasmine and moonflower provide scent layer but stay background; no weather or spatial drift. The world rule—“phoenix fire lingers in objects”—is taught early and paid at climax, so the fantastical glow feels earned rather than wallpaper.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    The laboratory’s acoustic relics (phonograph horns pointing at walls, oscilloscopes dreaming) are sketched with sensory economy and re-enter as tangible tools: the lens spectrum thrown across them at midpoint literally changes what she can see. Golden light “casting shadows that seemed to breathe with warmth” is a micro-setting that foreshadows the later tonal flip to connection as warmth rather than presence. No world-rule contradictions; every object is handled (lens held to ear, dust disturbed) so the environment constrains attention. Meets 9- gate: lens-light on horns directly charges the final bell-strike image.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory’s cracked dome and abandoned instruments constrain every move—sleeping under the lens, folding on instrument tables—charging the final image where starlight literally pours through the breaks. Timelessness is shown through perpetual twilight and the eviction notice as the only calendar, never exposition. Sensory selection stays urgent: brass mount chill, paper crease sound, starlight warmth on skin. The micro-setting (vellum stencil) acts as tool-as-setting, its constellation pattern guiding the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft is not backdrop but apparatus: water streaks distort light, forcing Vera to read ink-absorption rather than faces, constraining her method. Grandmother’s tape literalizes generational continuity in centimeters; its metallic snap punctuates beats. Body-as-setting (Marcus’s soaked coat puddling onto Persian wool) anchors class collapse in tactile discomfort. Final image—the Moon card resting on wet wool—fuses setting, tool, and stake into one charged tableau.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Bronze prism pagoda and obsidian archive are not backdrop but instruments: twilight angle sets ritual timing, cracked dome focuses final light. Micro-setting—the crystalline sphere in her palms—literally contains the world’s nostalgia and dictates ritual choreography. Spatial track stays clean: door → spiral shelves → central chamber → exit. Only missing a quick auditory cue inside the archive to widen sensory hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.0)
    The glass-and-light library is not backdrop; its hope-lattices and unfixed shadows actively constrain tactics—Vera can’t torch the shadow without incinerating dreams. Micro-setting triumph: the river stone’s grit against translucent petals offers tactile grounding that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is impeccable; we track her climb, kneel, placement, and retreat without drift. Meeting 9+ gate: the stone-as-body-proxy directly shapes the decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Workshop breathes through touch—warped cedar smell, rusted mesh grit, starlight pooling like cold mercury—each sensory pick is filtered through Vera’s reptile-handler precision. The enclosure skeleton becomes the story’s micro-setting: its failing joints mirror her own cracked certainties, and the final true frame charges the closing image.

    Tower, frost, dawn, and coffee rings are filtered through Mira’s bias; the hourglass operates as micro-setting that constrains her final choice when sand moves. Spatial choreography clean (desk → doorway → garden passage). Sensory hierarchy favors tactile cold and whispered greens, not tourist visuals. One missed beat: caverns beneath monastery are named but not sensory-anchored; since closure occurs above ground, no cap triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    The projection booth is rendered through usable detail—cool Simplex gate, cork walls that drank decades of whispers—every sense filtered by Vera’s professional eye for “psychometric architecture.” Micro-setting (the projector throat accepting celluloid) literally constrains the climactic choice and charges the final image. Economy is strong: no cinema-tour filler, only objects that remember or refuse to. Just short of 9.0 because one paragraph widens to the auditorium below without returning pressure to Vera’s hands-on task.

    The optical-illusion gallery is not backdrop but antagonist: floors tilt, doorways vanish, mirrors fragment identity. Sinew thread functions as micro-setting—its tensile strength literally cages the chaos. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we track every knot and trailing filament. Final image—Marina seated inside her thread-drawn geometry while the outer gallery freezes—makes environment, body, and tool indivisible.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    The benthic city is not backdrop; its light-bent dome literally refracts the final comprehension. Volcanic spires/biolum coral are selective, not tourist list, and filter through Vara’s pilot-eye priorities. Spatial choreography immaculate—helmet lamp, crystal dome, chain placed on floor—objects tracked. Anchor-chain as micro-setting constrains her letting go—qualifies 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.1)
    The atrium’s sanatorium history, fog, and marble are filtered through Vera’s tracer gaze, supplying atmospheric density without checklist excess. The hearing aid functions as micro-setting; its static and pulse constrain the only available action (listening) and charge the final silence. Spatial choreography is clean across the wheelchair move and photo release. Environment does not alter tactics beyond the initial premise, preventing 9-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Environment, body, and tool trinity: the elevator shaft constrains the initial descent, the flooded corridor dictates slow-motion choreography, the codex’s gold flecks catch the final light to charge the closing image. Sensory hierarchy is biased by Mira’s claustrophobic perception—ceiling “barnacled” is felt as impending suffocation, not scenery. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the codex functions as portable, pressure-sealed “room” whose cracking is a spatial beat.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    Opal walls trapping light under snow function as a micro-setting that mirrors Mira’s stalled radiance; the ink pool becomes a second, mutable “sky” she physically reads.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    The bone towers, canyon echoes, and flawed diamond are not backdrop but instruments: the towers’ shapes literally form the missing resonating chambers, the echoes preserve phonemes, the diamond becomes translator. Micro-setting (her copper veins) constrains the climax by rerouting the curse. Final image recharges earliest motif: she follows her own echo deeper in—setting now internalized. Specificity throughout (“grit in creases of old linen”) keeps description tethered to POV priority.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    Underground garden is not backdrop but tactical resource: moonpetals’ gravity loosening lets the epiphany manifest physically; flint arrowhead functions as micro-setting that warms, cuts light, and is pocketed to constrain future choices. Sensory hierarchy filtered through Maren’s scientific eye—luminescent spectra, soil temperature—never stalls momentum. Spatial choreography tracks her kneeling → rising → climbing with mortar floating mid-air. Setting evolution causally tied to Samuel’s metamorphosis residue. Meets 9+ gate: recurring object charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sky-bridge itself functions as micro-setting: its “silvered planks” constrain Mira’s movement and literally splinter under the final resonance, charging the closure image. The enchanted orchard’s rules are learned through action—statues climb, dust patterns shift—never dumped. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: she notices “rotting fruit and frost” because survival depends on weathering the night. Only the brief “manicured hell” phrase edges toward symbolic shout, keeping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cobalt neon arcade functions as micro-setting that supplies the “brittle hush” tone and the color keynote for the final ghost-image; the vintage cabinets’ silence mirrors the enforced hush of surveillance. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Marcus notices space and sight first because he navigates by visual gaps. The “swirling gray clouds” inside the jar achieve object-as-setting and constrain the hand-off beat. Weather is bottled, not ambient, yet it still affects action when the daughter presses it to her chest—meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Desert night, rusted circus cars, and the micro-setting of Marcus’s palm around the halo fragment all constrain action: heat dictates the metal’s warmth, darkness frames the starlight catch. Wind bells function as both atmosphere and clock, tightening the final cadence. The description is selective—no tourist catalogue—and filtered through a carpenter’s eye for grain, paint, bronze vibration. Environment directly enables the climactic note: “dust motes swirled in patterns that resembled carousel horses mid-gallop.”

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    Tiny library objects (wax grooved sonnets, punch-card moths) act as micro-setting that literally bends space; scarf weave doubles as map—both charge the final image. Sensory triage favors smell and haptic vibration, narrowing under Eleanor’s bias. Spatial choreography stays clean through impossible geometry shift because Eleanor’s perceptual drift cues the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    The whispering wind and seventeen-island geography are filtered through Miriam’s nocturnal solitude, guiding her decision to use the roof at 4 A.M. The empty pigment wells function as micro-setting, constraining how light can fracture and thus how memory can appear. Fog and sunrise are not backdrop but tactical variables that decide whether the palette will yield an image. Sensory selection is urgent and narrow—golden blade, impossible colors—mirroring the narrowing bandwidth of the dream.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    The velvet pouch, the shifting standing-stone symbols, and the star-beam act as micro-setting that physically constrain Mira’s finger placement and unlock sequence; spatial choreography inside the circle stays coherent through tactile verbs (“pressed,” “withdrew,” “tucked”); the ribbon’s color-shift in final image recharges atmosphere.

    The garden functions as micro-setting: every described anomaly (no-height waterfall, seven-sun light) directly enables Marek’s essence-gathering tactic. Sensory triage favors shifting color and sound over catalog, mirroring his painterly attention. Spatial coherence holds as he kneels, cups, exhales; bodies and tools stay tracked. The final image of rainbowed mist through the new tree recharges earlier waterfall motif, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prism sanctuary is not scenery; its refracting walls literally scatter starlight into the colors that mirror the confessions being released. The tapestry needle’s worn silver and the net’s salt-crusted knots are tactile, lived-in tools. Spatial choreography holds as Mira moves from altar-center to departing at dawn, objects tracked without drift. The micro-setting of her own body—hands steadying—constrains the final image and qualifies for 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    The vault’s damp stone, flaking saints, and the literal tear in the map are viscerally tactile and steer Elena’s attention; the henge stones act as micro-setting that reconfigures from blank to grieving faces, directly charging the final image. Weather (rain) is not mere backdrop—it is the causal agent eroding pigment and threading the 300-year timeline. Spatial choreography stays coherent; the laptop’s blue glow and mold crate root us in one continuous location. Environment constrains choice: she cannot touch the tear yet reads it as boundary, informing her poised report.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sunken library is not backdrop but constraint: shelving becomes obstacle, coral-choked law books force route recalculation, the captain’s desk survives as mahogany island. Sensory hierarchy follows Eleanor’s scientific gaze—she catalogs anemones swaying “like displaced librarians,” notices chemistry-quirk preservation—so detail never stalls momentum. The snow globe functions as micro-setting that charges closure; its intact glass and internal storm literalize the captain’s physics and give her a portable scale-model of surrender. Spatial choreography is clean; submersible, desk, shelf, globe track without impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating mist-courtyard is never over-described; instead it supplies sensory filtration (cold brass, lightning flash, swirling pixels) that directly shapes perception. Micro-setting succeeds: the bolt plate functions as portable monastery—compression chamber for memory. Spatial choreography is flawless across rope-ladder descents and mural hunts. Only the bridge-warehouse paragraph drifts toward postcard listing; the rest keeps environment pressed into character goal.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    The brass-geared elevator groaning against ice walls is sketched with economy yet keeps returning to guide spatial rhythm. Frosted window, thinning clouds, and prismatic walls act as micro-setting that literally refracts the plot’s decryption method. The observatory’s crystalline jars (handled, lifted, poured) meet the micro-setting test by constraining the final choice: only here can light be released into sky. Sensory triangulation—cold bite, amber glow, glass clink—is selective, never touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    The frost-rimmed gondola window, brass telescope, and ice-crystal nacreous clouds are tactile, cold, and specific; they constrain action—she can’t open the window, the telescope’s weight steadies her tremor. Sky layers function as vertical geography, limiting escape and forcing the emotional confrontation. Final image of telescope catching starlight recharges every prior mention. Micro-setting (notebook pages “soft as old skin”) anchors body-in-space without drifting into catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tree-trunk library is not backdrop but instrument: its false panel, carved star-slits, and heartwood chambers constrain how Elara searches and what she can carry out. The coin’s microscopic grooves act as micro-setting, dictating finger movement and narrative direction. Spatial choreography is flawless—every tactile discovery is tracked in real time. The final image of the oak “settling into its final hours” charges the atmosphere with undeniable mortality, satisfying the 9+ gate.

Sensory hierarchy narrows to lantern-light dust grooves under urgency; no postcard catalogue.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The floating library’s cold grows “teeth,” the mirrors’ light has no source, and the gear wax is “old honey”—selective, sensory, and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is immaculate: hand on door → seventh-floor hall → lectern corner → vial uncapped, each object materially constraining the next move. The clock-tower payoff below proves the setting’s resources alter outcome, satisfying the 9+ gate. Minor deduction: “clouds below” is repeated without evolving, a small static note.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating rock arches and sideways starfruit branches are not backdrop—they dictate irrigation routes and the colony’s daily choreography. The butterfly-moth pollinators respond only to the bell’s unique tone, so the micro-setting (tool) constrains harvest tactics. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through Elara’s dawn-walk priorities: phosphorescent chalk precedes mist and silver bark. Spatial choreography is clean: chalk appears “outside her dwelling,” settlers converge, Elara leaves a reply on the same path. The setting charges the final image: the bell’s chime across the arches is the audible bridge between living and lost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse-in-dusk micro-setting directly constrains her tactics: the glass walls become the “pane of hush,” the console is the only interface, the beam direction reverses to inward. Sensory selection is urgent—obsidian face, amber-and-bruise light, cracked wood—all filtered through a professional timer’s eye. Spatial choreography is clean: spiral stairs → lantern room → console → kneel. The final image is charged by the setting itself becoming the delivery system.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Micro-setting—the nut-in-pocket against cliff stone—supplies the critical tool that literally marks the path; its faint green glow charges the final image. Frost crystals forming on stone narrow time and dictate faster ascent. Mechanical birds’ copper wings, brass beaks, and centuries of neglect are selective, not encyclopedic. Spatial choreography is flawless: three path prongs, one glowing, her hand pulling two bodies upward.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ravine’s foam patterns actively constrain her scientific imagination; the chrysalis micro-setting doubles as lab talisman and molecular model. Sensory selection skews tactile-visual in chemist-specific ways—she notices lattice, shear, translucence. Final image of clouds “braided like streams, like foam” loops environment back through POV bias, charging the closure. One hairline slip: “clouds moved…like the molecular chains” risks overt symbolic symmetry, but the phrasing stays in her professional lexicon, so cap not triggered.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Glass trees, moonlight-filled slates, and the bracelet’s pulse act as micro-setting that constrains choice: only glass forgives revision, moonlight must be dripped not poured, bracelet light pulses arithmetic. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—Vera notices opacity of clouds like “cream dissolving in coffee,” tactile evidence of her bartering past. Spatial choreography clean: child ascends cloud-stairs, touches slate, words appear. The setting’s “integrated fragmentation” mirrors thematic question of brokenness that can still hold light.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    Micro-setting triumph: the chef’s knife, tidal pools, and coral ice constrain every tactical move. Rain-softened sand enables literal descent; evaporative clock (“wouldn’t last the afternoon”) pressures map-reading. Pavilion ice is remorse made tangible, charging the final image of moderated guilt. Sensory triangulation—metallic taste of regret, petrichor, cold coral—anchors each emotional pivot without catalogue excess.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tower dome, brass planets, and suspended pinecone weight function as micro-setting objects that literally constrain Elena's oscillation rate; their mechanical intimacy charges the finale. Harbor scale is sketched with brutal economy—“concrete giants” and “prairie winds”—but specificity is funneled through Elena’s acoustic ear, never touristic. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she smells metal resonance, feels 42-hertz vibrations in her sternum, ignores visual clutter. The final image reuses the weight against her heartbeat, reweighting the setting as part of her own thoracic cavity—an unavoidable spatial merge.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    Canyon layers, broken mirror fractures, and moonlight refractions are returned as tactile constraints: the mirror’s angle must stay exact or the channel collapses, and the mineral walls literally hold the archives she raids. Sensory hierarchy is engineer-visual—angles, strata, reflection—yet body-led (trembling, weeping) under memory load. Final image of sourceless mirror-light recharges every earlier glitter, locking setting as the closure device. Environmental specificity is irreplaceable: remove the canyon’s mineral memory and the entire premise collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mist, wet stone, and phosphorescent ceiling function as micro-setting that actively conceals/reveals choices. The lantern’s prismatic shadows and the inverted pool of mist provide sensory hierarchy filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias.

Spatial choreography is clean in the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.1)
    The nexus is rendered through bodily tug in her chest, iron boulders catching dying light, and the stone’s shadow-shift—details that charge the final image where she becomes transmitter of the field. Environment directly constrains her choice to sit, write, and later stand facing east; the magnetic hum is the invisible antagonist. Micro-setting (worn dent in basalt) functions as charged object that reprises at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    The workshop roof’s collapsed memory and the bronze clasp’s “stubborn as grief” charge every beat; the clasp is handled in four distinct moments—display, warmth, click, pocket—each altering Vera’s tactical options. Starlit silence and imminent fireworks create a live clock that narrows her ritual window. Micro-setting (the clasp) constrains the final image: its emptiness is the pivot from recovery to surrender. Sensory economy is high—sound of forks, rust scent, bronze temperature—never a visual dump.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.1)
    Canopica’s architecture-as-flower constrains the final insight; that spatial metaphor recurs in doodles and charges the exit image. Olfactory specificity is relentless and biased to Mira’s profession. Selective sensory hierarchy (resin, smoke, rot) mirrors internal shift from revulsion to acceptance. No orientational drift; spatial choreography tracked across rope bridges and platform spirals. Environment subtly guides choice—only after inhaling the bloom’s decay does she decide to descend.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.0)
    Floating rock arches constrain every maneuver; Rootbound’s hull scrapes stone when current shifts, making setting an active antagonist. The gravity-inversion hour narrows sensory bandwidth to breath, heartbeat, and “amber light,” mirroring Maren’s narrowing options. Micro-setting succeeds: the broken arrow tip half-buried in roots functions as locale and catalyst. Final image—“a new voice joined the gathering of echoes”—recharges the orbital valley as perpetual repository, not resource.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.1)
    Container corridors, anemometer dial, and contracting metal function as micro-setting that directly constrain her survey path and safety choices; the flight-patch body-object recurs to charge the final image. Sensory selection—cooling groans, bitter coffee, corrugated walls—filters through investigator POV, guiding tactical attention. Environment is indispensable to both tactic and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ice cavern is not backdrop but acoustic instrument: prismed light, frozen congregants, and sculpted hush directly constrain Meren’s choice to break or preserve silence. Synesthetic overlay turns setting into playable interface—each color becomes a musical key—so environment shapes tactics in real time. Micro-setting qualifies: the bell itself functions as place + tool + stakes. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions. Minor over-purple phrase “impossible gold” is the single hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Thunder-echo Range is more than postcard; its silence presses eardrums and later becomes the canvas for the new dissonant song. The driftwood markers and the gilded flute act as micro-settings that constrain return logistics and ritual possibility. Spatial choreography is clean—three-path junction, hollow, altar tracked without drift. The final image of silent peaks reconfigured as “potential” is charged by the protagonist’s altered stance, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Topaz floor, crystalline starlight, and the halo fragment’s warmth are tactile tools that constrain action—Mira sets type barefoot on cold metal, halo heat dictates when she reads. The press itself becomes micro-setting: its mechanical rhythm mirrors stellar pulse, fusing cosmos and craft. Sensory hierarchy is character-specific: a typesetter who “reads” light as musical notation. One tenth off 9+ because the exterior plateau geography remains vaguely moored; no wind, breath, or bodily spatial relation to the open sky.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ridgeway’s spine-of-stone metaphor and aurora curtains are selective, purpose-driven, and constrain movement—she must walk, cannot turn back. The pendant-as-micro-setting charges the final image: its crystalline wings become the lens through which sky and story coalesce. Cold, frost, and electromagnetic hum are filtered through her courier’s professional attention to relics and weather. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible shifts across seven monasteries and the final ridge.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.1)
    Quartz arbor and frost-layered windshield function as micro-settings that actively constrain perception and choice: only through the prism can she read the frost, forcing her to kneel, breathe shallowly, race the thaw. Mist-light interplay supplies sensory hierarchy—visual refraction dominates, sound is “relocated.” Idiom stays consistent; no anachronism. Spatial choreography is clean: car at edge, pillars around, body crouched at glass. Setting evolves causally—sunrise melts frost, tightening time window. Final image recharges the arbor as site of revealed impossibility.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Bamboo spears through rotting apple trunks, amber bead glowing under “scattered diamonds of light”—selective, tactile, and mirrored in Mei’s narrowing perception.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    Floating arches, gravity-defying orchards, and petrified root cathedral are sketched with economy; every descriptor is filtered through Oren’s smith-eye (stone as forge-hearth, sap as slag). The silk and the blue-flame forge function as micro-settings that constrain tactics—he can’t farm wide, only graft-and-forge iterative patches. Spatial choreography is clean in the single POV trek. While we get no smell or temperature data, selectivity fits the lyric mode and charges the final azure-flame image.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.1)
    Shuttle hull rust, dying emergency lights, coffee-cup lipstick—the selected images evoke an inter-dimensional graveyard while guiding Mira toward the coupling unit. Spatial choreography stays clean: palm-to-hull → floor → coupling → rift entry. The bay’s obsolescence mirrors her orphaned urgency, and the green shard’s glow physically charges the final image. Environment thus constrains choice and closure, passing 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lantern room itself—rust, dead lens, dust motes swimming like underwater creatures—functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice: she must physically handle the glass and stones to rewrite the keeper’s code. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a skipper notices “handrail flecks,” bird-strike evidence, oil smells absorbed over years. Spatial choreography is flawless; the spiral stairs, gallery, and lamp base are never lost even in darkness. The only tiny slip is the generic “fractured prisms” phrase, a touch postcard, but it is immediately re-filtered through her marine eye.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    Emerald lens, lightning-filled wick, and spiral stairs are tactile, bias-filtered, and directly enable the climactic light-bend. Stars “pressed close like curious children” mirrors her isolation while guiding the beam’s outward arc. Micro-setting (the lamp room axis) literally constrains the alignment choice. One loose weather cliché (“painting the walls in shades of gold”) prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tea-house-as-setting actively pressures choice: it drifts, so Senna cannot leave without deciding before the solstice. The crystalline east windows and indigo-stained hands are vivid, selective, and POV-filtered. The morpho wing micro-setting functions as a tool that literally refracts the light onto her hands, forcing confession. Only the valley’s physics (“ancient currents”) is sketched broadly, but this is within allowance for a single-scene 700-word piece.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tower study’s dust, cracked window, and silvered moonlight are filtered through Maren’s caretaker gaze; the sextant itself becomes the micro-setting that constrains her final choice.

No object geography errors; spatial clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Tea-house micro-setting constrains every move: frost on roses, spider web, chipped cup all filter through Mei’s selective attention and charge the final image. Wild courtyard’s proximity dictates the guerrilla gardening tactic; soil temperature affects timing. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and smell (stale bread, cold soil) over visual catalog. Proper-noun economy: only “Chen Family Bread, Est. 1923” is named and reused.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    The frozen library is not backdrop; its cracking quartz floors and self-turning ice pages directly force Elara’s hurried selection and the literal narrowing of available vows.

Sensory detail is selective, cold-light imagery echoing the dying star, never catalog-like. Spatial choreography stays clean as she moves through dissolving tiers toward the cloud-sea exit.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    The pirate market is rendered through sinewy, selective detail—lanterns like “captured stars,” eel-tank reflection used for surveillance—so setting actively constrains tactics. Rotting pier, salt-thick darkness, and vendor layout track spatially across the intercept beat. The watch fob acts as micro-setting: its frozen 3:47 and “CONSTANT” anchor paternal memory and final decision. Weather is absent, but market’s geography and reflective surfaces directly enable the theft.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lavender bluff under aurora is not postcard scenery: magnetic fluctuations alter scent release, guiding Vera’s tongue; the voting forest below directly harvests her brother’s storm. The ring-as-micro-setting constrains her final orientation. Spatial choreography tracks the three approaching figures cleanly. Selective sensory hierarchy (taste > sight) mirrors POV bias and charges closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cave is not backdrop but tool: the narrow passage she alone can access, the selenite pillar that literally hides the painting, the violet glow that times her hours-long sitting. Micro-setting objects—the broken lock, the canvas edge—constrain the moment she finally draws. Spatial choreography is clean; hands, paper, and crystals remain trackable. The selenite pillar’s hidden niche satisfies the 9+ gate by charging the final triptych image.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    The greenhouse domes function as micro-setting: their sulfurous glass and evaporated lake create the oxygen-scarce pressure that makes “lost words” precious currency. Tactile lived-in detail—warm pane against forehead, rust-smell in tunnels—anchors orientation early. The Archive’s magnetic-tape cathedral is not ornamental; it supplies the playback station that forces Mei Lin’s final stance. Spatial choreography stays clean: fragments are spread on floorboards, tools clink in bag, inscription happens at the threshold—each beat is locatable.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.2)
    Whispering Bluff’s sound-bending physics is anchored by line 3 and paid off when the bell’s truth literally clears the sky to reveal new peaks—setting becomes actor.

Sensory hierarchy is character-specific—Maren tastes bronze, feels dissonance “like sandpaper,” privileging haptic and synesthetic data over postcard vistas. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies, rope, and sculpture remain trackable in the tower’s throat.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    Glass dome, adenium spirals, irrigation pipes as fire-ring—each environmental element is lived-in and choice-constraining: the dome’s transparency lets magnetic auroras charge the final image, the sandy paths meter VERA-7’s ritual pace, the burn pipes repurpose life-support for sacrificial cleansing. Selective detail never stalls momentum; “strangely organic” is felt through tactile Bloom-to-chassis contrast rather than declared.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.5)
    Courtyard’s iron benches, citrus scent, and rusted mailbox are filtered through Maren’s thrift-store eye—objects as vessels of story—so micro-setting constrains her decision to curate people, not just things. Dawn light progression tracks emotional thaw. Spatial choreography is clean: cane taps, bench settle, locket hand-off. No sensory checklist; each detail either blocks or enables the final opening.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sunken lab filters every move—sediment “snow,” bloated journals, green-gray light through portholes—constraints tactile and moral.

    The brook, origami wing, and celestial wheel function as micro-settings that actively constrain tactics: water carries the wing, paper geometry dictates silence-mapping, starlight times the ritual. Sensory selection skews auditory/tactile, mirroring Mira’s vocation. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible moves. The environment’s quietude is more than postcard; it is the raw material she sculpts, charging the final image when the damp wing docks against stone.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rooftop garden, antique seal, and frost-bitten roses act as micro-setting that constrains choice: only here can the language lessons occur, only this seal certifies enrollment. Meteor shower supplies temporal urgency, its streaks “measuring borrowed time,” directly charging the final January image. Sensory hierarchy is narrator-obsessed: starlight on silver hair, taste of impossible winter bloom, chill of brass seal—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean: fire-escape ascent, desk seal hand-off, garden perimeter all track without drift. Environment mirrors internal state—dormant roses under frost = Elara’s fading—yet avoids overt symbolism by keeping image in action (narrator still prunes them).

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    The garden-as-micro-setting is vivid and selective: purple velvet flowers absorb warmth, wild resonance structures hum; these details constrain action (only here can she broadcast) and charge the final image (the shell glowing among flowers). Sensory hierarchy stays tight to Mirabel’s body—shell pressed to ear, dying light on iridescent surface—without tourist catalog. The Archive towers beyond the hedge serve as off-page anchor only; no occupational detail is required at this length. One small lapse: “tragically radiant” is used twice as label rather than perceptual filter, slightly dulling specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sanctuary is not backdrop: the aurora’s color-shift mirrors Veren’s rising certainty; the dripping stalactites supply the story’s clock and final image. Marble, pearl twilight, and mineral patience constrain the ritual—only this place allows forty years of guilt to condense into one stroke. Micro-setting object: the key’s materiality (weight, warmth, dust) charges the final image. Selective sensory economy—no tourist catalog—anchors every detail to Veren’s scribe-trained eye.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    The canyon is not backdrop but predator: its phosphorescent moss, stone corridors, and groaning hunger directly enable the harvesting mechanism and shape Mira’s final refusal. The split seashell recurs with tactile heat and remembered voice, charging the closing silence. Spatial choreography is tight—seven ravines, secret meeting chamber, the nexus center—tracked without drift. Environment thus constrains tactics and supplies the final image’s felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Glacier shrine, candle-amber on ice, warped globe—each detail is sensory, selective, and later weaponized (ice as “window,” globe as proof). The body-in-environment tension is missing; Mira kneels but we never feel her numb fingers altering her cognition. Still, the shrine constrains ritual pace and the globe’s “teardrop” silhouette reappears in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting that charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    The parapet’s wind-crenellations, gargoyle drips, and post-storm air currents are tactile constraints that shape firefly flight and her whistle acoustics. The bamboo whisk functions as micro-setting, its worn tines directing insect light and charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy is biased to her net-mender gaze—moisture as text, mesh knots as cosmology—anchoring mood without tourist excess.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    The wasteland orchard is rendered through selective, urgent sense—respirator hiss, mutant fruit colors that “had no names,” Geiger stutter/quiet. These details are filtered by Maya’s investigator eye and directly enable her deduction beats. The stillpoint itself is micro-setting as charged object: its “strange absence of radiation” is felt in her bones, guiding the final unwrapping. Meets the 9-band gate by constraining her tactics and charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cobalt portico returns twice, each time reframing her self-image and ultimately charging the final invitation; meets 9+ gate. Stormlit observatory constrains every move—lightning powers salvaged gear, clouds block retreat, weather becomes co-antagonist. Micro-settings: radio dial fingers, glass reflection, campfires as constellation—all tactile, handled, not catalogued. Sensory hierarchy biased to electric audio and bruised light mirrors internal state without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography tracked cleanly across single room and mountain slope.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.0)
    The feral loft beneath the dunes, the salt-rotted kelp air, and the glass-jar walls constrain every beat: Marcus can’t stand upright, must handle each jar, and the hidden music box is kept safe by the collapsed pier timbers. These micro-setting objects charge the final image directly—the three notes dissolve into the same salt wind that sculpts his shelter—satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drift-ice maze, skiff hull scrapes, crystalline bell interior—details are filtered through Vera’s lighthouse-engineer gaze (sound as data, light as vector). The azure coat and braided leather key cord function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice and reappear in the final image. Cold physics stay consistent; sunset window tightens spatial and temporal choreography. No exposition dumps; environment is discovered through goal-directed action.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Basalt ribs, ice mirror, brass-and-bone instruments—each tactile detail is filtered through Mira’s cartographer gaze and constrains her slow movements. The frozen lake doubles as clock and mirror, charging the final smile. Micro-setting (platform rail, frost on lenses) alters calibration choices; no spatial drift. One tiny lapse: “crystal along its iron rails” appears after the viaduct is already discovered, but the image is quickly anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lantern is micro-setting that constrains the final choice and literally charges the image; the tunnel’s wet concrete, rusted bracket, and vibration under train pass spatially ground every move. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—transit investigator notes scuffs, falsified manifests, tool displacement. Weather (ended drought) mirrors internal relief without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions or teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    The amber-lit dust-mote shop, brass heart, and ticking mechanisms form a micro-setting that literally constrains choice: Ruth will not rush, Marcus must wait, the gear must be realigned. The “rippled glass window” returns in the final image, refracting the mercy-light onto the street and recharging the morning-light motif. Sensory hierarchy is priestly—visual hush, metallic weight, absences that feel tactile. Only cap keeps it from 9: the street outside is sketched generically; no smells or temperature register to body the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    Acid-sea workshop is no postcard: brass hisses, caustic air corrodes launch rails, the dredged arrow-tip’s green edge is handled twice. Micro-setting (arrow-tip, kaleidoscope cylinder) directly constrains the final piercing act. Sensory hierarchy obeys Zephyr’s mechanical POV—she clocks gear pitches before color. One hairline slip: acid’s exact buoyancy/gravity rule drifts, but it never governs a choice, so cap stays 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.0)
    Missile-silo-come-server-farm anchors every corridor; server racks as “mechanical ghosts,” audio detritus, and the gutted timestamp 7-14 all tie to POV’s cataloguer gaze. Tools—servers, patch, corrupted sectors—shape both discovery and risk; the silo itself charges the final dash (“climbed the stairs toward the surface”). Spatial choreography is clean and economical, never stalls action.</question>
    <question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—“find what the deleted hide”—is signaled by line 6; escalation comes because each 7-14 sighting forces a deeper trespass and higher exposure. One meaningful tightening closes options when she copies the drive and exits security coverage; visible cost (job, freedom) is legible at the final sprint. Coincidence only complicates; pressure builds because her own choices trigger alarms.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ice-groaning cliff, salt-dusted apple limbs, and the brass-oval mirror give tactile anchors; the lighthouse interior is sketched only as backdrop for the mirrors, satisfying micro-setting economy. Weather and terrain stay causally present—salt spray, shifting floes—mirroring Kira’s frozen self-exclusion. Final beam sweeping the orchard recharges the opening image, locking setting to theme. No orientation drift; spatial choreography clean.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    The drift-ice marina functions as micro-setting: moving dock, creak timbre, and cathedral ice constrain boat tactics and bodily stance. Cold-water trawling is tactile, tool-heavy, POV-filtered. The parasol tip substitutes for geographic breadth, its shadow a portable locale. Final image folds body, dock, and ice into one breathing system, charging the close.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    The amber pavilion’s translucent walls act as micro-setting: they tint every gesture sepia, forcing memory into present choice; the burned letter fragment is tactile tool whose charred edge is handled twice, charging the final image. Vineyard rows and vacant station are filtered through Marcus’s caretaking gaze—“vines twisted like arthritic hands”—body metaphor keeps attention anchored. Weather and season tighten scene: October copper light is both clock and mood, narrowing options as winter approaches. Spatial choreography clean: path climb, bench seating, fragment placement all tracked without drift. Environment constrains the choice to share relics—meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.1)
    Silk panels, humming floor, and spiraling glyphs are tactile and POV-filtered; the kinetic parapet beneath sand functions as micro-setting that constrains her night-work. Spatial choreography is clear across the pavilion-dune-pavilion loop. The engine room is sketched with just enough sensory anchors to support the ritual beat without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lavender field and rusted factory evolve from backdrop to reagent: the purple persistence supplies both meeting space and symbolic pressure that softens grief. The map case and vine-climb serve as micro-settings that physically constrain when/where invitations can occur. Spatial choreography is flawless—readers track bodies moving among flowers, ruins, pavilion. Final image of swaying lavender charges the closure with undeniable sensory cost.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    The library’s dust, pale-gray dawn, and dangling crystal facets are filtered through Elara’s etymologist eye; sensory hierarchy (sight > sound) mirrors her academic remove. Micro-setting—the crystal itself—functions as both tool and environment, constraining every linguistic experiment; its light-splinter on the final page re-charges the stake. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the single uninterrupted scene; no floating props or impossible positions. One proper-noun economy slip: “Elara Vance” full-name drop feels slightly ornamental for sole character.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    The fog sculptures act as mutable setting-cum-antagonist: their dissolve constrains Marcus’s window to act and literally erases the map he writes. Driftwood, chalk, and stone are micro-settings that bear the weight of choice; the chalk stub’s diminishing length is tracked in tactile detail. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—salt-bleached wood, chalk dust, tidal hush—never tourist catalog. Environment never stalls momentum; each descriptor advances the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    The observatory, moonlit clouds, and pale silver tree are rendered with selective, sense-driven specificity that filters through Mira’s grief. The eastern chamber’s “skeletal remains of instruments” and the leaf’s “whispered-secret” sound are tactile and idiosyncratic, converging to charge the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean; the environment subtly guides choice—catching the leaf stops the hand.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating hospice is sketched via sensory selectivity: light like honey through gauze, clouds below as “slow thoughts,” coffee cooling—details filtered through Mira’s musician perception. The cracked guitar body and vinyl shards function as micro-setting, constraining the only tool-mediated action on stage. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies remain tracked from window to worktable to final shared stance. The environment never overwhelms, but the sky-window literally frames their last turn, charging the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    The floating twilight isle, brass observatory, and star-lit clouds are economically sketched and filtered through Mira’s scholar gaze. Sensory range is narrow—mostly visual, a hint of gear-whisper—but selection fits the hush of “perpetual twilight.” Setting supplies the only tools (telescopes, rune-slots) that make the sealing possible, so environment directly shapes tactics. Micro-setting of the key-slot beneath the telescope base is a small, tactile anchor that passes the 9+ gate by constraining her final gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    The garden under the apple tree is micro-setting at its best: night jasmine, moss-eaten marker, and hollow bones all constrain or enable the final choice. Spatial choreography is flawless—Eleanor’s knees in soil, femur lifted to moonlight, box snapped shut—each move tracked without drift. Weather (twilight → moonrise) times the beat shift. Only the hedge maze’s “closing behind her” skirts the edge of fairy-logic convenience, but it is taught early and pays off as thematic closure, so the gate for 9+ is missed by a whisker.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grotto’s breathing mist and mineral veins are filtered through Maren’s gem-cutter eye—“reflectively vibrant” is not decorative but a professional metric she applies to value. The mist acts as diffuser and amplifier, forcing her to abandon fire and invent glass-light; environment shapes tactics. Body-as-setting appears in her “protesting joints,” making the ledge an adversary each climb. The emerald fragment’s final placement charges the exit image; without that micro-setting the ending’s reprice collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    The data-center-turned-garden is vivid, selective, and guides choice: Mira kneels where melt-water once dripped, turning ceiling decay into pattern discovery. Bench of intertwined ferns later hosts the reconciliation, so environment literally furnishes the closure. Sensory balance favors emerald, velvet, honeyed—visual and tactile—while sound (former server hum versus present hush) supplies temporal layer. No world-rule violations; spatial choreography tracks cleanly from skylight to bench.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    The nexus is evoked through compressed whispers underfoot and bioluminescent hopes drifting like jellyfish—selective, urgent, never touristic. The spiral shell constrains her grip and is charged in the final image, satisfying micro-setting rule. Mist breathes, pools, recedes—environmental agency that mirrors her internal softening. Spatial track stays clean; no floating rooms.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    Micro-setting (the arbor lattice, stone altar, single tendril) constrains every move and literally charges the final image when the tendril releases. Sensory selection skews to tactile/rust/rot under crisis, then color-return as relief. Spatial choreography is flawless—moon west / sun east alignment tracked beat-by-beat. World rules stay consistent; no occupational depth required.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Micro-setting is the spiral itself: rusted nails and mirror shards constrain foot placement and ritual timing. Subarctic crater supplies life/death stakes—roots still clutch, branches still reach—so every discarded object placed is a negotiation with permafrost. Frozen breath, crystallizing silence, and copper’s green edge are filtered through Maren’s artisan eye, never tourist catalog. Final image recharges the orchard: soil now pulses, proving environment has been rewritten.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    The marble cavern is not backdrop but instrument: its acoustic geometry constrains every tactical decision—where she stands, how she angles the brass face, when the voices can separate. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elena’s trade—she notices resonance frequencies and crystalline cleavage planes before temperature or scent. Spatial choreography is flawless; the timer’s reflections "multiply through the marble chamber" and we track the exact path of light required for harvest. Micro-setting bonus: the mainspring’s tension is measured "against the beat of her own patient heart," charging the final image with embodied tool-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Bronze walls that “sing when touched” and “shingled hush” are sensory, selective, and filtered through Elara’s auditory obsession. The grotto’s acoustic properties directly enable her collection method—orientation toward each grief-pool—so setting constrains tactic. Starlight aperture and mineral sweat recur to mark time and internal shift. The loom and lamp burner act as micro-settings that charge the final image when she presses the weaving to the wall.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    Skylight-rain functions as micro-setting that constrains attention: droplets lens the sky, decide when she looks up, mark elapsed time against kettle. Ash blank, chair leather, copper pipes are handled, warmed, occupied—objects become tactile containers for emotion. Weather never decorative; October rust palette is absorbed into brick and sawdust so environment and internal state are indivisible. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.9)
    The kinetic lagoon is not backdrop; its current literally delivers the camera wheel and later swallows the ghost, constraining Mira’s tactics. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (she notices phosphorescent spray, cold, serrated edge) and mirrors her slippery memory. Spatial choreography is clean: crouch → stand → pocket → watch. The camera wheel fulfills the micro-setting role, charging the final image as she pockets it and decides to keep moving.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    Environment acts constantly: the vaulted ceiling ducts, floor drains, skylight grit all constrain her measurements and later her presentation logic. The sextant fragment is micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—Gate 47 to atrium to exit—no floating rooms. The 30% capacity figure is the specific constraint that shapes her final gamble; without it the climax would collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Crystal forecourt functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its enforced muteness literally prevents her from testing new music, shaping her tactic of composing in silence. Sensory triangulation is selective—petrichor after rain mirrors internal renewal without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single continuous scene. The tool-as-setting test satisfied: the brass stylus transfers from clock records to silent score, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    The canal warehouses, narrowing water, and crumbling bridge are sketched with economic selectivity, guiding Maren’s drift and the chain’s placement without tourist cataloging. Twilight is more than mood: its indistinct lighting enables smuggling history to stay beautiful yet hidden, mirroring the story’s epistemic shift. The sundial serves as micro-setting/object, its brass face constraining Maren’s perception of time and legacy until the final dark beat. Spatial choreography stays clean—barge, bow, chain, case, letter—each prop tracked without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.3)
    Golden dock, dissolving snow-flakes, and tarred hemp fibers are filtered through Mira’s collector gaze; every tactile detail advances the arc of deciphering. The fulgurite against her throat re-appears in the final paragraph to charge the lighthouse-lit image, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting that constrains the closing stance.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    The garden is rendered through tactile occupation: carpet under thigh, moss swallowing stone, cold seeping through clothes—details that constrain her to stay until dawn. Season is not postcard but instrumental: persimmons “left too long in the sun” echo Matthias’s untimely decay, autumn’s slow rot mirroring memory’s. Spatial choreography is immaculate; lantern pinpricks vanish beyond a legible harbor edge. The crimson thread operates as micro-setting, re-anchoring every beat; its final braid-position fulfills the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    “Frozen tear” palace anchored to “bones of dead gods” immediately grounds scale and stakes; geothermal winds sway the suspended city, guiding final swaying-heart image. Micro-setting—the egg’s velvet-lined box and brass-silver apparatus—constrains every assembly move. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: cold glass, copper glow, salt taste. Environment not postcard: it creaks under new resonance, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Obsidian ribs, volcanic glass, kelp-drift peace—each sensory pick is filtered through Mara’s professional attention to heat and texture. The lagoon constrains her ritual: only here can sand remember fire without burning, forcing the choice to carry it away. Micro-setting (coin against jar glass, boots sinking) doubles as tactical interface. Final image of sand warming her hip fuses body-tool-environment, meeting 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dry fountains, crystallized memory-amber, and the stained-glass box function as micro-setting that literally constrain choice: only the laughter can melt the plug, and only the key fits the hidden slot. City geography stays schematic, but the central fountain basin’s amber whirlpool is tactile and stakes-driving, earning high-band per the gate.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Nebula flowers shift from ornament to tool—they store starlight and release it under resonance—so setting directly enables the climax; the crystalline petal that falls at transmission is the charged image. Spatial anchoring could be sharper (garden’s edges, Veloris’s bodily relation to flowers), but the micro-setting (gear-in-palm, petal descent) constrains the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    Iron-and-glass greenhouse, monarch flight paths, and ribbon textures constrain Elara’s movements and literally guide the final design. Dying light, glass gaps, and cold spot anchor every beat; body-as-micro-setting (monarch on shoulder) charges the closing image. Selective sensory economy—never more than two senses per beat—keps momentum. Environment shapes tactics: broken panes admit butterflies that become the pattern she carves.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    The obsidian ridge is not backdrop but antagonist: slick, glass-sharp, time-eating. Tidal mirrors literalize retrospection; brass tower grows from rock like a natural fang. Micro-setting includes the rake handle whose splinters bite Maren’s palm while she carves, linking body, tool, and guilt. Spatial choreography is clean—descent, door, spiral count, pendulum arc—every move is trackable. Weather (fog) arrives only after the emotional turn, reinforcing rather than announcing mood.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cobalt silo functions as micro-setting: its cold rungs, starlight, and echoing hollow directly shape Mira’s meditative pace and supply the literal elevation for cosmic perspective that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (velveteen gloom, brass lid click) and filtered through a gardener’s tactile bias. Weather is absent but irrelevant; spatial choreography is clean. The silo’s color and height are reused, not mere postcard flourishes, and they constrain her literal and figurative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    Obsidian spire and frozen lake function as pressure apparatus: black mirror reflects her doubt, white ice buries past hubris. Kingfisher quill—blue summer sky this land forgot—contrasts monochrome world and charges final image when she sets it down. Setting constrains action: spiral stairs, stone desk, frigid air limit speed and symbolize ascent toward risk. Spatial choreography clean; no prop drift.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ember alcove’s glow, radio dial amber, and dissolving mist function as micro-setting that literally enables the crime (invisible from outside) and metaphorically charges the “banked fire” closure image. Sensory selection skews auditory (crackle, whisper) and tactile (weathered hands, blanket), mirroring a copyist’s haptic world. Spatial choreography tracks fox vs patrol sweep cleanly. Environment directly constrains every beat: mist thickness governs transmission length; dawn forces shutdown.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Vanishing Point Gallery is not backdrop but active constraint: its receding paintings and threshold literally receive the ashes, turning environment into participant. Micro-setting objects—porcelain mask, rocking chair—dictate touch and tempo, charging the final image when Marina restarts the chair’s rhythm, re-anchoring presence inside absence.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    The chronometer cog’s green teeth, the oiled-leather cache, and the carved forbidden calendar are tactile micro-settings that constrain every tactical choice Marcus makes; their evolving states (retrieved, catalogued, hidden, dated) track the arc. The sewer’s layered strata act as both topography and epistemic metaphor, guiding his descent and returning in the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean across one continuous descent/ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    Velvet library, burgundy drapes, and oak shelves are filtered through Margaret’s accumulated-grief perception; the zither functions as micro-setting that literally constrains finger placement and metaphorically frames cultural memory. Autumn light “surrendering” mirrors their internal surrender-to-starting-again, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: laps, chairs, strings tracked without drift. Sensory hierarchy favors hush and touch, matching stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    Environment and tool merge: rusted ribcage greenhouse literally frames moonlight path, forcing Maren to kneel where glass shards could slice; final image of pockets heavy with seeds reconfigures prior decay into mobile arsenal. Micro-setting—the seed pressed to heartbeat—constrains carry method and absorption of her pulse-data. Sensory hierarchy obeys chef-perception: smell of rot vs dormant potential, soil cold against knees. No spatial drift; geography holds in one collapsed structure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tower’s copper veins, phosphorescent moss, and residual charge are not backdrop but toolkit: they supply the literal current that saves the bees and re-charges the “nectar dusk” motif at the end.

Spatial choreography is clean; no sensory checklist.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    The garden is not backdrop but tactical constraint: marble pathways dictate swim-lines, algae limits visibility, the ampoule's foxglove stain is a color cue that later reframes the brother's botanic metaphor. The micro-setting of Veris's cracked chest—"structural weakness where the chisel slipped"—literally enables the extraction beat and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is diver-tight: sound of regulator, taste of salt, green light on gloved fingers. Environment constrains every choice; without watery pressure the glass would shatter, the revelation would disperse.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    The staircase as micro-setting constrains every move: steps absorb light, provide chalk, groan when violated. The cracked step and chalk-dust texture physically guide her equations and her final hand-press; the “warmer stone” on the new staircase is the charged image that reweights the closure. Sensory economy is tight—no visual clichés, only selective pale/golden light. Spatial logic is flawless: she climbs, kneels, writes, crosses, and the geography stays trackable.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    The greenhouse functions as micro-setting: condensation-streaked panes, tomato vines curling around ankles, and the brush’s starlight-tip all constrain movement and choice. Smog pressing against glass externalizes the city’s forgetting while the glass box encloses Maya’s act of remembering; this mirrored tension charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—easel, laptop, seed trays remain trackable. Selective sensory economy (glow, drip, ping) keeps description purposeful and tethered to Maya’s painterly perception.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    The waterfall is not backdrop but acoustic fate; its roar silences speech and forces the tactile bread-code. The emerald lens’s green skew is a micro-setting that literally re-sees pigment, constraining how Mira validates survival. Spatial choreography is immaculate: observation ledge → carved stairs → communal kitchen → oven → lens-to-bread inspection. Sensory economy narrows to yeast-steam and wet-stone dread under threat, never touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Every black vertebra-rock and tide-pool breath is filtered through Alaric’s clock-maker eye; the lighthouse architecture literally steers his body up backward stairs that later invert the beam. The hunger stone evolves from prop to key—its glow and carved coordinates constrain his route onto the island and then unlock the portal—meeting the 9+ gate. Micro-setting triumph: the yoyo’s guts become the world’s guts. Minor slip: “Dresden” is named once but never exploited for geist or historical weight, a missed specificity tweak.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    The funhouse is not backdrop but tactical arena: mirrors that “captured screams” force fear to witness itself, warped floorboards echo Vera’s heartbeat, cursed glass stores her final smile. Micro-setting objects—opera clasp, dictionary—constrain choices: clasp must be worn, definitions must be read to lure fear. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, yet the single permitted sense (silvered glass light) is thematically apt. Spatial choreography stays clean across the advisor’s doorway apparition and dream-mirror reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.1)
    The floating orchard is evoked through sound, flex, and salt taste; every tool (mallet, hull, nets) doubles as micro-setting that constrains how music can be harvested. Spatial tracking is clean—no impossible drift or warp. The 9+ gate is missed because no single environmental detail forces a tactical shift at the end; the orchard remains a gorgeous constant rather than a variable.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Shell-archipelago is more than postcard: the spiral streets force downward choreography, the eastern-edge gate’s gap literally shapes her escape vector, and the shell-scrape sound supplies tactile immediacy. Sun-bleached bone-white repeats too safely, but the dread is baked into environmental细节—rusted monument to decay, salt-fused bars—so tone and place co-evolve. Micro-setting (her own shell, the whistle) constrains her final choice: only a body small enough to fit the rust-gap can leave. Setting stays consistent; no physics violations under implied soft-fantasy rules.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    The station’s ivy-rust-ivy rhythm mirrors Vera’s patient reclamation; the rosebush micro-setting charges the final image when she leaves “dried petals” as memorial. Spatial choreography is tight—platform, ticket booth, desk, door tracked cleanly. Weather shift to snow is causally linked to departure, not decorative.

    Submerged pavilion as micro-setting constrains every move—cold water limits dive time, barnacles cut flesh, copper roof provides moonlit writing desk. Brackish scent and lapping acoustics merge with interior longing; environment is not backdrop but apparatus. Selective detail (three feet of water, wax-sealed inkwell) keeps geography legible without expository bulk. Could edge higher if weather or tide had turned against her exit, but restraint serves the hush.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sunken-library dome is not backdrop but active pressure: darkness dictates perceptual method, humidity warps pages, kelp glow enables discovery. Micro-setting—the desk compartment—literally births the plot. Spatial choreography is flawless across stacks and eastern drips. For 9+, the environment doesn’t quite force a tactic change at climax (she was already indexing), so stays just below top band.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.3)
    Jasmine scent, floating terrace geography, and gem-polishing tools are filtered through Mei’s artisan eye and constrain her method. The lantern itself becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays coherent; no world-rule contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    The floating observatory constrains every move: breakers trip because wind tilts the station; clouds resemble “brain tissue contemplating nothing,” mirroring her obsessive hunt; console beeps are tied to literal countdown. The geode functions as micro-setting—its purple scatter on the walls marks time passing and reappears in the final image, charging the closing beat. Sensory economy is ruthless: taste of ash, ears ringing, cold viewport—all selected to keep the lens on bodily aftermath rather than panoramic spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    Observatory stones, dome fractures, and drone spotlight are tactile and specific; the cracked-stone lens is a micro-setting that directly enables the climactic projection. Thermal drone readout and type-matrix chips supply near-future texture without expo dump. Dusk light and “brilliant dimness” mirror the threshold theme, but the phrase itself is used meta-textually rather than filtered through Mira’s perception, a slight POV wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    The cobalt terrace’s mirror-blue tiles catch last light and literally color her penance; the broken watch hand becomes micro-setting that constrains her final vow. Driftwood sculptures are not backdrop—they wash up as fragmentary confessions she must physically handle. Sensory hierarchy obeys her profession: she notices grain patterns the way a forger notices paper fiber. Spatial choreography is pristine: descent to shore, kneeling in sand, ascent back to terrace, all tracked without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.1)
    The parapet’s crumbling stone and rotted banners are filtered through Mira’s tactical gaze—neutral ground because neither side can claim it. Mist and moonlight are used to synchronize the swap, not merely as mood. The drawer-pull functions as micro-setting, its tarnish tracked by thumb pressure under stress. Environment constrains the choreography: fifteen paces, visible breath, erased footprints—setting charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    The coastal micro-setting (body-in-kayak, calves in “biting” water, brass against hip) functions as mobile crucible; environment directly constrains pace and visibility. Utility poles serve as both map and emotional meter—seventh pole past cannery = seal colony—integrated into stroke rhythm rather than postcard exposition. Fog “softens sharp edges of shame,” mirroring internal state without overt symbolism. Final image of eighth pole through mist crystallizes the re-orientation toward an uncertain “whatever came next,” satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Underground bioluminescent lake is not backdrop; its algae react to emotional candor, literally lighting the path, so environment constrains tactics in real time. Cold, blue glow, cracked leather baseball, and seven branching tunnels are tactile, perception-filtered through Marcus’s surgical numbness. Spatial choreography stays coherent as Marcus moves from shore to thigh-deep to chosen tunnel. The impossible future date and time-delivery rule are learned through action, never exposited. Setting fuses with interior state, earning high-band placement.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    The orchard is not backdrop but instrument: moon-dripping blossoms supply the light Kael is woven from, and the saffron/cardamom circle literally opens the veil. Sensory selection tracks Mira’s narrowing perception—smell sharpens, sight star-blooms—guiding the reader through bodily transformation rather than static tableau. Spatial choreography stays coherent as she kneels, crushes spices, wings emerge. The setting constrains the final image (she can no longer walk human markets), satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    The midnight glade above clouds is not postcard but crucible: silver ladder burns her palms, ozone scents each breath, grass warms under palm-trace—details constrain every ritual move. The cracked saucer functions as micro-setting; its fault-line mirrors her fracture and final glow recharges the closing image. Spatial choreography is clean: cards spread → saucer centered → cord unfastened → door opens. No anachronisms; world-rules (ink-cards respond to breath, glade stores time) taught through action.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cathedral-ship is not backdrop but micro-setting: its salvaged hull plates and grated corridors constrain Mei Lin’s barefoot glide and house the photographs that supply the plot’s engine. The faint shimmer of dried tears is a tactile, visual tool whose optical behavior is learned early and charges the final pour. Spatial choreography is flawless: workshop → observation deck → dimensional barrier track cleanly. The 9+ gate is met because the vessel itself becomes the final image—starlight from its dissolved seal—recharging earlier metallic motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Micro-setting supremacy: the seventeen glass jars function as portable crucibles—handled, opened, heated, emptied—directly constraining the final gesture. Volcanic hush and bioluminescent surf filter through Miriam’s synesthetic need to “feel transformation,” never as postcard filler. Spatial choreography is immaculate; jars arc, fireflies rise, twin planetary shadows stripe the waves. Heat-retaining sand and tide erase footprints, embedding cost in the tactile world.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.1)
    Thousand glass panels catching dying sun is an immediate, camera-ready image that later flips from beauty to surveillance liability once the blackout hits. Micro-setting of the Astronomer’s Tower (loose stone, hidden complete sundial) constrains the final move and literally “completes the circuit,” qualifying as a tool/setting hybrid that charges closure. Spatial choreography is clean: stairs, courtyard, gate, stables tracked without drift. Sensory economy is biased toward sight, appropriate for a lamp-less night, but other senses are invoked only once (hoof-beats); a second non-visual cue would have lifted the score into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Tidal bluff, painted rocks, seal-skin pouch, and aurora-lit sea constrain every move: slick footing demands deliberate grip, rock geometry dictates vision access.

One slip—“furiously tranquil waves” pushes weather into thematic pun territory.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Glass atrium, brook, and sundial are sketched with economical sensory strokes; sundial’s code actively shapes plot, meeting the 9+ constraint test. Brass gears of Elara’s arm recur as tactile micro-setting. Spatial choreography stays coherent during the brief duel. A few decorative adjectives (“crystalline walls,” “patient song”) slightly temper economy but never stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    The roofless library operates as both lived-in workshop and symbolic seed bank; every sensory detail (rusted circulation desk, welded prison-bar shelves) constrains the couple’s tactics—books must be sorted by moonlight to avoid detection. Micro-settings—Ezra’s coat rattling with pennies, the coffee tin’s seam—are handled in tactile beats that alter later choices (the tin’s false bottom hides contraband philosophy). Spatial choreography stays clean: crate echoes across roofless void, bodies track believably in starlit dark. The final image of stars pouring through gaps literalizes the conceptual repricing: knowledge flows in because the ceiling is gone.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Tidal arbor’s swaying deck and cloud-curtains constrain piano volume and landing clearance; body-as-setting (hands on keys, cracked clock-glass) charges the final image. Sensory picklist favors sound/mist over visual cliché. Selective detail supports theme without tourist fog. Spatial choreography clean; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ridge itself is the constraint: impossible botanic mash-ups and storm runoff literally force Yara to plant before erosion. Micro-setting (seed, soil, palm) and macro-setting (limestone terraces, monsoon sky) alike charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she notes soil dampness first, starflowers second, because her job is measurement. Environment shapes the stakes and the closing renunciation; without the ridge’s blooming contradiction the conceptual cost vanishes.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    Islet, mist-wet rocks, cerulean sky, and antique lace all filter through Mei’s attention and guide her choices.
