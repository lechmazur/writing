  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.1)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse is vividly particular: silt-white benches, brine-drinking orchids, bronze butterfly dust along fractures. Spatial choreography is clean (panes, vents, potting table, puddles). The dust functions as micro-setting, constraining interpretation (reading which vents failed) and charging the final image (children steering by windows). Sensory hierarchy reflects the researcher's professional lens. One minor slip: "drowned notebooks" are introduced late and feel more thematic than spatially grounded in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    Canyon setting is vivid and purposeful: starlight navigation, morning frost as cartographer, the hidden metal door, and the basalt kiln all constrain the search and shape the discovery. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the glass artist's lens ("ferned pane," "throat clogged with fused sand"). The kiln's physical state—scarred, unbroken, requiring a traveler flame—directly enables the closure action. Spatial choreography remains clear across the night walk, dawn study, and chamber entry.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.3)
    The winterglass conservatory is not decorative: frost draws staves, heat from bodies drives compositions, the tower bell becomes a breathing circuit. Micro-setting details (glass bells, ice orchids, boot-prints in snow) constrain choice and charge the final image. The conservatory functions as both spatial anchor and instrument, with sensory selection (frost fretted into lace, aurora over the vault) filtered through the narrator's project-focused attention. The kelp coil at the door and the tower climb demonstrate lived-in use of the environment under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    The broken lens, underwater library (marble/silt/coral arches), and the skiff all constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through the undertaker's occupational lens: "salt-stained rags," "plankton make a slow alphabet," "tide-smoothed teeth." The library setting supplies the catalog system that enables the resolution (assigning addresses to Names Unrecovered). Spatial choreography is clean across the descent and the atrium work. Minor slip: the mechanism of "occupying impossible spaces" (wedging between lens and light) lacks concrete spatial anchoring—how the body fits into a "blade-thin seam" remains abstract at the pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.1)
    The terra-cotta arbor anchors the opening and closing, and the bell functions as micro-setting (held, passed, catches moonlight) that constrains the ritual. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("moon was a rind," "amplified quiet"). The sanctions period colors perception without overwhelming the frame. The arbor's role in the ending charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but spatial choreography during the midnight run blurs—individual doors and thresholds are not tracked distinctly.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    The viaduct, fog, arches, weeds through cracked mortar, and the camera obscura box are vivid and purposeful. The bellows stitched to ribs and the clear tubing that ties breath to aperture function as micro-setting that constrains the protagonist's method and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the narrator's spiritual and artistic lens. The setting does not dynamically alter a choice under pressure, but it anchors the ritual and the closure image coheres spatially.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    The living bridge garden is vividly specific (roots "thick as torsos," willow chamber "ribbed and furred") and constrains the protagonist's movement across hyperbolic paths that "multiply like coral." Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through professional attention (hedge maze designer noting "negative space," "cambium kept slick and new"). The halo fragment and photographs function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image: the fragment's disintegration into cambium and the photographs' bleaching are tactile, present actions that reweight the closure. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite the garden's recursive design, and the setting's breath and pulse embody the story's central stake.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    The carnival setting is vivid and purposeful: old syrup, solder, a piano with no soundboard, a hidden hatch. Micro-setting elements (bench, arrow, jars) constrain the protagonist's choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail reflects urgency (dank stair, baked coins, damp wheat) and the space guides action through access and proximity. The chain on her ankle functions as bodily constraint that shapes tactics at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate test for environment/body/tool constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse is vividly realized and integral to the protagonist's work: kelp, shipwrecks, aurora-filtered light, and the ashen forge all constrain action and charge the ending. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("greens whispered tin," "aurora hummed a soft, cracked teal"). Spatial choreography across forge, orchard rows, and shipyard cavern remains clear. The setting directly enables the protagonist's organoid cultivation and device testing, meeting the 9+ gate's requirement that environment constrain choice or charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    The emerald station by moonlight is vividly anchored (tiles, brass door, timetables, concourse flow) and the jar of moonbeams functions as a micro-setting element that charges the closure image when released into the rafters. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (cut stems and station metal, minnows pooling around laces). Spatial choreography is clean across moves. The setting subtly guides choice—destiny's door becomes the literal threshold where the man and narrator lean together—pushing this into the high 7s despite the dreamlike register that occasionally floats above concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned control room supplies concrete details—rafters, gauges, ducts, intercom—that anchor the glassblowing action and constrain choice (no generator reliability, ice melt as clock, pooled water reflecting flame). The cracked leather bookmark functions as micro-setting, held in the teeth during marver work, charging the final promise. The setting participates in the closure image ("puddles mirror the sky") and ties the environment to the protagonist's reflective stance, satisfying the 9+ gate criteria of constraint and closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rusted library supplies concrete constraint: skylight for projection, circulation desk as arena, metal stacks and rotten floorboards that enable the climax. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("air salted and still," "smell of iron and old glue thick"). The seashell's spiral steps matched to rust constellations and the cast under skylight demonstrate micro-setting that charges the ending. The projector threading the microfilm "to the ceiling" and spraying images "across the stars" uses setting to embody the thematic reversal, elevating this into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ridge fort is vivid and pressure-laden: wind braids spindrift through arrow slits, the storm worries driftwood, the cliff drops to surf. Sensory hierarchy is strong—sea breath, lantern glass, the star's shine "scraping the sky"—and details like cannonballs and bread weighting the map corners ground the closure beat. The oracle's body (salted ankles, foam-tasted stick) and the gold booklet (flaking, shedding specks) function as micro-setting that charges the final image. The fort's physical layout (wall, yard, battlements, storerooms, barracks) remains coherent throughout, and the last star acts as a recurring spatial anchor that tightens the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    The frozen courtyard supplies recurring environmental constraints: ice texture guides sweeping, frost must be cleared from the violin's bridge, glaze changes underfoot across loops. The violin itself functions as micro-setting, pressuring JN-3's choices (clearing, bowing, listening) and charging the closure when it melts into a comma-shaped puddle that the protagonist reads as permission. Sensory hierarchy reflects robot-janitor bias (maintenance stamps, chalk flecks, bristle hum). The courtyard's physical state tracks causally—steam writes cursive, the violin renews daily, the puddle remains at the end—and the final sweep integrates setting detail into the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.1)
    The crystal forecourt recurs across five distinct beats (opening hum, post-concert confetti, lens setup, Rell's arrival, street projection) and constrains the climactic choice: the narrator hangs the frame "between two columns" in the rain-washed public space, making secrecy impossible. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("tiles hissed softly," "lamp halos drifted like forgetting"), filtered through a curator's attention to surfaces and light. The rain and stone charge the final image of transparency as posture, satisfying the 9+ gate for environmental constraint at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    The garden maze constrains choices throughout: marble placement at joints, vine angles, humidity measurement, the doorway that fits the narrator's stoop. Setting detail is filtered through the POV's occupational bias (sensors, meters, trellis posts, clover). Spatial choreography is coherent (center court, hedges leaning, doorway arching) and the maze functions as both physical constraint and proof of recognition. Sensory specificity is strong (moonlight polish, sunlight pooling, meter hum) and the final image of roots gripping earth like old hands charges closure. Meets the 9+ gate: the maze's physical structure and the marble-placement mechanics directly shape the Auditor's loss in the hedges and the protagonist's proof.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    Setting details are vivid and voice-filtered: "domes breathing," "aviary nets," "snow plotting its fields in faint chevrons." The station supplies resources (roost heaters, holographic panel, lever) that enable the experiment. The magnetic nexus at twilight functions as micro-setting, constraining the timing and framing the final image when it "thinned into ordinary night." Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The piece reaches the 7-band because the environment shapes the closure image, though it does not force a pivotal choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    The flooded pit with flickering lanterns constrains every choice—standing in water, program damp at corners, the visual code legible only by angled light. Spatial choreography is precise: pit, stage, mezzanine, north exit, and the cracked cornice all track cleanly. The antique program functions as micro-setting, its physical state (damp, soft as fabric, warm against chest) charging the final beat. Sensory hierarchy reflects the musician's priorities: varnish smell, rope, rosin powder, bow hair—all filtered through professional attention. The setting actively shapes the climax: lantern angle reveals the fracture diagram, and the north exit's position becomes tactically urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    The weather station micro-setting constrains every choice: desiccant scale enables the weight revelation, the microphone channel delivers the warning, the botanical illustration hides and reveals the glide-plane map. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"ribs of antennae rising into a thin aurora," "wool to muffle outgassing clicks," "coal dust and winter breath"—and filtered through occupational urgency (anemometers, seismometer, cornice maps). The aurora "bruise of color that hurts and heals" charges the final image. Spatial choreography (console, desk illustration, bench scale, rail) remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tunnel is anchored early and constrains every move: rails, grease, seam drips, the valve wheel's iron throat, the ballast niche. Micro-setting elements—beaded wheel, lunch pail, ledger—function as charged objects that guide discovery and reweight meaning at closure. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered (soap, oil, lye smells; "tired moon" light) and spatial choreography tracks cleanly (wheel → panel → niche → climb back). The tunnel's physicality charges the final image: the narrator walks "straight on water for a while" with the tag as tangible proof. Body and tool (the wheel's beads biting skin) actively shape the turn, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting is vivid, multi-sensory, and functionally integrated: vines, stone arches that "sweat minerals," mushrooms editing leather, and the obsidian refuge that "kneels to mirror and forget." The library's collapsing architecture constrains choices (toppled encyclopedias as shelter, roots drafting tunnels) and the swan-enabled navigation turns setting into a tactical puzzle. The final image of planted cuttings greening broken spines charges the closure. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the transition to the refuge and back can feel slightly unmoored in time.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sage Ridge is anchored early with crushed sage, dust, juniper, and spatial position ("lower, near the roots") that contrasts the town uphill. The setting constrains choice: staying "lower" to avoid spectacle, the tree's "lacework shadows" marking time, and the ground that "records and returns." The bowl and curl function as micro-setting objects that charge the final beat when Felix touches curl to rim. Sensory hierarchy reflects the therapist's professional filter: tone, breath, rhythm dominate over visual tourism. The eclipse's progression (crescent, blue dimming, corona, return) provides concrete time markers that tighten the ceremony's window.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    The silo's curved ribs, spiral ladder, hearth, and corrugated exterior are rendered with lyric specificity and consistently filter through the historian's ear. The tapestry fragment and half-burned diaries function as micro-setting objects that constrain his method (probing via charred margins, aligning by dragon nodes). The final beat—"building leaned a little farther east" and spine alignment—directly charges the closure image, making the displaced axis tactile and the environment indispensable to the ending's reweighting of attention and tilt.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse functions as both setting and lens: the Fresnel apparatus charges the dot-fortunes into legible messages, directly enabling the climax. Spatial choreography (basalt steps, catwalk windows, beam swing) remains coherent. Sensory detail is purposeful (oilskin smell, citrus memory, steam rising like staff lines) and filtered through Mei's perceptual bias. Minor: the island's "open secret" culture is asserted more than dramatized through environmental cues.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    The chapel functions as dimensional anchor with concrete detail: basalt, brass outlet, rafters, pews. The palette is handled across multiple beats, its single ultramarine color "purring" and "pulsing" under the sanctuary hum, then crawling along the rim, finally thinning to water. Spatial choreography is clear (Mara by steps, Ruan near altar, loops behind him). The loop pedal rig and brass outlet ground the setting in tactile specificity. The "dimensional anchor" takes more weight during the confrontation, constraining the entity's pressure and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    The glass spire and frozen lake are vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail (ribbed throat, mirrored horizon, hairline cracks). The nautilus shell segment functions as micro-setting, constraining the conductor gesture and charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy shifts appropriately: visual domination outdoors, tactile and auditory focus indoors. The environment directly shapes the final action (tracing the shell along glass, holding tones the tower cannot ring), meeting the 9+ gate's constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.1)
    The viaduct after rain is vivid and specific: slick stones, halos thinning, puddles as doors. The tablet functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (its runes glow, warm, spell rules) and charging the final image when Lio dries it and reads the single-line promise. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (arches, balusters, canal), though the procedural maze's internal geography (chambers, landing, central span) occasionally blurs under the lyric compression. The rain modulates from "single notes" to cessation, marking emotional closure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cavern is anchored early with vivid sensory detail ("rooms of hides and wood smelling of rain and hearth," "filament of hush strung between stalactites") and the drum functions as micro-setting that Lena reads "as if a braille river." The setting constrains her method (she must work beneath the filament) and charges the final classroom image where the drum becomes a teaching tool. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The piece does not exceed 7.2 because the environment's role is more atmospheric scaffold than a live constraint that alters Lena's tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    The courtyard provides sensory detail (fountain, pigeons, balustrade) that grounds the narrator's patient observation, and the pigeon's arrival supplies the message tube that drives the turn. The rusted footbridge inference ("metallic as pennies") demonstrates professional perception filtering setting detail. The courtyard's spatial logic remains coherent, and the recurring image of "layered tranquility" modulates slightly with the follower's arrival. The environment does not directly constrain a choice but charges the reflective frame throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto setting is vividly anchored ("terra-cotta grotto under starlight, where the cliffs breathe like shells") and sensory details are purposeful and filtered through the poet's lens (mural whale, rope patterns in sand, hush "so dense the rope straightens"). The environment constrains the final action: the whale's clay ribs house the braided rope, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear across beats, and the setting evolves with the arrival of the escapee and the visitors' whispers from the cliffs. Micro-setting (the rope, the whale, the grotto mouth) shapes tactics and charges the ending, meeting the 9+ gate criterion for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse and shipwreck ribs are not mere backdrop; they supply the dripping eaves Mara tunes to, the barge deck that cradles fire, and the bell's hiding place. The mendicant's bowl functions as micro-setting, catching leaks and later serving as buoy—constraining choices across beats. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "glass ribs jeweled with salt," "fruit knocking seed against skin." The environment evolves causally (bell raised, bowl repurposed) and charges the final image when "ship ribs flicker, orchard glass brightens."

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    The amber grotto functions as micro-setting throughout: its resinous hum provides the dealer's diagnostic tool, the "cool glow" houses the precompounded moods, and the dimming at the end marks closure. Sensory selection is purposeful (static prickling, labdanum scent, salt and vetiver tears) and filtered through the dealer's professional POV. The slate, electrodes, and cabinet of accords constrain the dealer's method and charge the final image when the grotto "dimmed like a patient closing their eyes."

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting details are purposeful and voice-filtered: "library windows open like sails," "tables smell faintly of lemon and salt," the wharf cranes mirroring stars. The breezy library under stars constrains the choice to house the ledger and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across pier, library, and wharf. Minor deduction: some environmental details (gulls, neon tourists) appear ornamentally without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    The crystalline orchard is vivid and purposeful: trunks refract silhouettes into "braided halos," quiet stones regulate temperature, and the obsidian arbor's gloss stitches faces together. Micro-setting qualifies when the arbor constrains the dedication ritual and charges the final image (the sigil blooms on its underside, the bench sits in "the arbor's cool mouth"). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (marsh reeds "salt still cataloged," fruit "tasted like the sound of rain on linen"). Minor gap: the crater's rim villages are mentioned but never pressure a choice, remaining ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rooftop canal system, sluice gates, hush-basin, and painted infinity tiles constrain multiple choices: lifting the sluice triggers the echo, the basin's geometry requires the pendant's placement, and the giant's twitch raises immediate stakes. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (syrup-thickened air, shimmer like memory, taste of stone and wet feathers) and filtered through the illustrator's perceptual priorities. Spatial choreography across ledges, bridges, and aqueducts remains clear throughout. The micro-setting (pendant on tile, canal mouth) charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cavern orchard is vividly particular—stalactite drips as tempo, mosaic stepping stone as instrument, root-black water—and these details constrain the protagonist's method throughout. The glass eyes' convex reflections and the mosaic's chipped triangles are handled multiple times and charge the final image (chalk-and-salt fruit, dripping calculus). Spatial choreography is clean. The setting functions as micro-environment whose elements (stone, drip, reflection) alter tactics and enable the closure moment, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is vivid, selective, and purposeful: "emergency lamps smear blue along the encyclopedias," "atlas case, behind Antarctica, beneath a threaded screw." The crawl space, pipe chases, and atlas case constrain the narrator's tactics and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; the narrator's body navigates ducts, screws, plaster, brass with tactile specificity. The outage-driven lighting modulates atmosphere and mirrors the emotional stakes. Setting details integrate into action (the silver hair as signature, the screw as anchor) and the final steadying of lamps provides a quiet environmental echo of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.9)
    The mossy trellis after rain recurs with functional pressure: it survives the gale because "the moss had stitched seams the screws missed," constraining the protagonist's reconstruction choices. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "wet limestone and linden," "drip line moved it," "veins glistened as if mapping routes under the skin." Spatial choreography remains clear across the nursery, gate, trellis, bench, and street. The linden leaf functions as micro-setting, driving observation and tactical shifts, charging the final image when it settles on the boot with fern spores—a moment that reweights "life drifts by invitations instead of orders."

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tidal island constrains choices throughout: low tide reveals the brooch, rain trails guide the search, high tide marks when elders sing. The brooch's circles, cistern mouth, and mural wall function as micro-settings that pressure action. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "eelgrass," "blistered mural," "algae painted the ceiling in a feral fresco." The amber brooch returns as a charged object when Mara presses it back, anchoring gratitude and courage in a tactile exchange. Spatial choreography (shore → causeway → desalination hall → chapel) tracks cleanly without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.1)
    The cave's sonic properties constrain every choice: the organ of stalactites receives the pearl, the vowel's resonance "chooses a path," and the final tone "lands" to settle the unseen forces. Micro-setting (the hollow where rain used to dream) charges the closure beat by housing the pearl that spins and centers the tone. Sensory hierarchy is consistent: sound dominates, filtered through the clairvoyant's professional lens. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (under crown of stalactites, beside the pilgrim, vowel walking away and returning).

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ivory harbor, rain-wet quays, dais, and trumpet case provide tactile grounding and constrain movement (climbing steps, placing the valve). The valve as micro-object charges the closure—its fitting opens "a room where breath can gather." Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the archivist's oceanic idiom (brine-laced, salt that never dried, kelp smell). Spatial choreography remains coherent across locations without teleportation.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    The railyard, boxcars, and starlit vault constrain and charge the journey; the cracks in pavement forming arrows supply a lived-in, tactile guide that the protagonist trusts because "the city breaks where the truth pushes through." Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "streetlights hummed like tuning forks of rain," "tracks glowed like nerves," "walls showed only the backs of words." The vault's architecture (pages refusing ink, windows refusing faces) directly shapes the protagonist's realization that "the fortress kept nothing; it only held the shape of holding." Spatial choreography is coherent across the transition from boulevard to railyard to vault interior, and the micro-setting (the punch, the mist, the platform) drives the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stargazer's tower, magic square tile, and whale soundscape are vivid and purposeful. The tile's "crazed glaze like winter ice on ink" and the "lantern circle" anchor spatial choreography cleanly. Micro-setting excels: the tile constrains the ritual, the open tower admits whale-song, and the resulting "chamber with windows onto years" charges the closure image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (whales' "low moans seemed to pass through our bones without sound"). Minor slip: "harbor" and "city" appear without prior spatial grounding, creating a brief anchor wobble mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prismatic escondite is vividly rendered—"blooms during a solar storm, when light becomes lances"—and the setting constrains the climactic action by requiring auroral conditions to activate the coils and fragment. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "the prisms misaligned their rainbows and refused to agree on directions, and the floor sighed, then stepped away." The micro-setting (copper coils in crystal alcoves) charges the final image by enabling spatial mutiny. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the single-location scene.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prep room's steel tables, refrigeration hum, and side-door latch function as micro-setting that constrains action (the alley groove, the hedge sightline). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through occupational POV: "formalin and salt," "drips from the faucet to keep the beat steady." The ink pot (body-adjacent tool) charges the final image by reappearing in the confrontation beat. Spatial choreography is coherent across gurney, threshold, alley, and street. Minor gap: chrysanthemum stems feel slightly ornamental rather than pressure-bearing, but the groove and latch do causal work.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bonsai maze, fluorescent lamp, and kiosk function as micro-setting that constrains daily ritual and charges imagery throughout (blossoms refracting light, paths that "lean," sap fragrance steadying the protagonist). Spatial choreography is coherent, sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the protagonist's archival bias, and the labyrinth's protective shade and gesturing pines participate in the closure image. The mountaintop isolation and post-silence emptiness pressure the protagonist's choice to remain, meeting the constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    The container labyrinth constrains movement ("wedged between two rusted walls") and provides the archive the protagonist reads (dents as consonants, scrapes as vowels). The poison-bottle label, tide-worked pilings, and barred-window office all appear in goal-directed action and modulate pressure. Micro-setting (tarps, cranes, mud at low tide) charges the closure image: "moving across the rhythm of tides, gathering what the water returned." The recurring container-as-text motif reweights at the end when shared listening replaces solitary decoding.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    The observatory setting is vivid and specific: dome floor, slit windows, chalk snow, crack watching the sea. The seashell and cello function as micro-setting objects that constrain the narrator's interaction (the shell is placed over the cello mouth, stars aligned to the crack). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("the taste of iron," "fine chalk snow"). The spatial choreography is coherent across moves. The setting charges the final image when the aligned shell and propped cello are left to the wind, creating a tender, wandering compass. No occupation-level detail is required here, and the cliff-and-dome particulars feel integral rather than postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    The raft city is vivid and purposeful: rope bridges, tide charts, hulls bearing graffiti, floating libraries and clinics. The foundation stone chip functions as micro-setting—its "pocked like a map" texture and its socket in the shrimp mural constrain the narrator's tactical choices and charge the final image when it's tucked under the tongue. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the narrator's professional lens (confetti routes, tide-shadow, diesel and jasmine). Spatial choreography is clean across moves (mast, docks, bridge, Lantern Gate keel), and the setting actively shapes the reroute that starves the financiers while anchoring rents. The environment embodies the stakes and enables the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is anchored early (moonlit summit, cinder cone, pumice, crater lake) and micro-objects constrain action: the vial's chemical timer governs the message reveal, the tripod shadow shelters the final shot, the basalt ring frames the ritual. Sensory detail is filtered through professional attention (foil pennants marking wind, smell of cinder and juniper, the vial's "mouse of sound") and the environment charges the closure—the lake "forgets the stars" as logos arrive. The crater itself, "the rocks, the old scars," anchor the final frame.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.1)
    The depot's mist, rails, bowls, and acoustic texture are vivid and filtering through Mara's non-visual perception. The water bowls constrain her navigation method and charge the ending when they "brighten" as the anchor lifts. Spatial choreography (bench, door, pier, flood grate) tracks cleanly. The rail-and-harbor setting pressures the time window and supplies the closure image (anchor, foam, hulls).

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting constrains choice throughout: the falcon's return triggers departure, ice stability dictates movement, condensation on glass teaches the map, frost etching guides the scrape site. The outpost and frozen lake frame the expedition with rust, cold, and tranquility that "worries." Micro-setting details—stovetop kettle steam, wind-carved sastrugi, the radio mast—pressure the protagonist's method and tactics. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (kneeling to scrape, tasting the drop, listening to subglacial thud). The final image of the warm kettle and canteen by the window charges the ending with proof against folklore.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archway functions as micro-setting: it "drinks" the rhythm, its shadow thickens, and a mortar seam responds to cadence, directly shaping the story's central action. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("smoke-dark hum," "cobblestones," "ebony tuning fork"), filtered through the narrator's wondering perspective. Spatial choreography is clear across the plaza walks. The archway charges the final image when the narrator stands beneath it, feeling prior steps "trembling in the stones," meeting the 9+ gate for constraint and closure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underwater temple is not postcard description; it constrains movement (cables snag, net traps, anemones guard) and charges the final image with accumulated texture. Micro-setting details—filigree netting, coralized steps, silver air pockets—are filtered through the POV's professional attention and urgency. The body in the suit and the transmitter grill function as tools that enable the climactic broadcast. One small miss: the "listening gods" reliefs hover near decoration rather than pressing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lighthouse architecture (lens, lantern pit, drowned pantry, confessional lattice) is vivid and particular, and the lattice physically enables the climax by dividing light. Spatial choreography remains clear across vertical movement (chapel → corridor → pantry → lantern pit). Sensory detail is filtered through the narrator's professional vigilance ("vinegar tang history wipes on its teeth") and the copperlight beam charges the final image. The recurring lattice and beam constrain the protagonist's method and shape the closure beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.1)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly rendered with selective detail (glass aisles, copper grafts, stringed flasks, tubing) and constrains the narrator's choices—coaxing sap through tuning, placing the bead on a graft scar. Sensory selection is purposeful: frost on pears, vapor on panes, chimes in the rungs. The "endless night" and winter-cracked fields frame the stakes spatially. The bead and the grafts function as micro-setting that charges the final image ("we are finally remembered"). The environment is not mere backdrop; it negotiates, remembers, and responds.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    The labyrinth's stone texture, chalk marks, and grooves constrain and guide multiple choices: the seam sewn open, the table's missing pages prompting the sail-scrap book, and the lighthouse's inward bloom that opens corridors. The tide-pool timeframe brackets the journey with sensory anchors (salt, ochre, glistening stones, refilling pools). Spatial choreography remains clear across the wharf → canyon entrance → fork → chamber → emergence sequence, with each location supplying resources (waxed thread, sail scraps) that alter tactics and charge the closure image of the town gathered with buckets and ropes.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail ("air carried figs and damp limestone," "bark slick, each tree a ladder for the restless dead") and the setting constrains choice: the narrator must search among roots and ribs to find the gnomon, and the spatial choreography of the dig team, orchard, and crypt remains clear throughout. The sundial base on the crypt step charges the final image, making the environment integral to closure. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) meets the 9+ gate: the dial and its shadow govern the bread-making and the closing blessing.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.1)
    The golden arcade, brass slots, and chalk-marked stones create a coherent futuristic-nostalgic environment that constrains choice: the narrator must navigate scanner protocols and margin-reading machines, shaping tactics around edges and color codes. The ebony clipboard and chalk stub function as micro-setting tools that alter the pseudonym creation process. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the narrator's professional lens, and the spatial choreography (arches, bench, brass slot) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt observatory's circular rail, orrery gears, eternal candle, and mural room anchor spatial choreography cleanly across moves. Micro-setting (the flame in glass, the cloth held to the dome) constrains Tamsin's key choice: she must align stitches with stars and alter the flame's rhythm to disrupt conspirators' timing. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional lens—she notices star-metal cracks, thrum of instruments, sugar-traced chart amendments—and the dome's "blue hush" charges the final image when she "let the orrery hum." Autumn timeframe and "cold nights" ground the body in season. Gate met: environment shapes middle choice (orrery alignment) and final image (flame reset). Minor: some diction ("echoed silence," "soft thrum") leans abstract where tactile detail would sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mangrove setting and the houseboat constrain the ritual effectively; the condensation-fogged pane and the splinter in the doorframe both charge key moments. Sensory detail (copper taste, antiseptic and orange peels, tin roof ticking) is selective and purposeful. However, the "singing spirits" remain atmospheric rather than tactile obstacles, and the transition from mangrove to hospital hallway lacks spatial bridging—"the world tilts" gestures at the shift without grounding it. The micro-setting (splinter, doorframe) successfully charges the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    The mist-clad atrium with palms and ferns supplies atmosphere and the brain-coral fragment functions as micro-setting, constraining the translator's interpretive method and charging the final exchange with the auntie who "recognizes the shore encoded in its ridges." Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "windows breathe salt," "night-birds test the rafters," "the atrium glows with a strange inland moon." Spatial choreography is clear across moves—from bedside to waiting families to return. The jetty as off-stage anchor directs the resolution and ties the coral fragment's grooves to geography, making setting active rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting (ruined orchard, fog, skeletal pears, cracked cistern) is vivid and purposeful. The fog functions as "patient audience" and "emulsion waiting for light," directly enabling the display's mechanics and charging the final image when it "wants to keep all stories" and begins to bleach the projection. The projector balanced on a honey crate, bulbs strung between trees, and fresco fragment propped against a stump all constrain the narrator's staging choices. Sensory detail is dense and POV-filtered ("fog applauded in damp thuds," "pockets sticky, heart light, shoes muddied"). The orchard's spatial logic remains clear across preparation, display, and departure. Micro-setting (body, tools, recurring objects) qualifies under the allowance and charges closure when the narrator slips the fragment beneath roots and the bulbs in the bag "chimed like nervous birds."

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sound wave garden, console, hobo nickel, and plaster wall are deployed with purpose: the nickel guides echo, the console filters tone, the garden shapes her exit. Micro-setting (body + tool) constrains method and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean. Economy is high; no postcard detours. The recurring nickel and echo mechanics lift this into strong territory.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.7)
    The greenhouse supplies concrete sensory anchors (wet soil, low heaters discouraging microphones, mantises as green knives) and micro-setting tools (seed trays, watering wands, vents) that constrain collector movements and enable the message-planting tactic. The final image charges when the gourd seed moves from potting bench to envelope, reweighting the ledger metaphor. Spatial choreography remains mostly clear, though the transition from greenhouse interior to garden maze compresses quickly without tracking distance or door passage.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    The gargantuan shell functions as micro-setting throughout: "walls remember," "stairs spiral down past murals," "antechamber," "Spiral Choir acoustics bow like trees in a salt wind," and the postcard itself (physical object that pulses heat, fattens into bark) constrains ritual choices. The chalk circle, drum, and hibiscus tint are handled and reused, grounding the negotiation in tactile action. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("drink the dark," "reef-shadow joy," "wind carries notes to balconies"). The final image—constellations on the postcard "flare, then fade, as if breathing, too"—charges closure by making the shell's posture shift legible. Small friction: the exact spatial choreography of the Choir (floor, balconies, vents, guardrooms) is suggested rather than mapped, and the "reef-shadow joy beyond" remains atmospheric rather than a concrete constraint that alters a tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    The opal library, glass-orchid planters, cracked bamboo chime, and mezzanine window all constrain choices: the chime's fracture catches fragile frequencies, prompting her decision not to patch it; the mezzanine window allows wind to animate the orchids. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the caretaker's priorities (match flame warming dew, translucence across aisles). Spatial choreography remains clear across moves, and the stormfields outside charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive is vividly established—dust, high shelves "like staves," sealed room, scrolls "like sleeping infants"—and the glass ink well functions as charged micro-setting, handled across beats and tied to grandmother's peace charters. Spatial choreography (catalog desk, sealed door, chamber, floor translation) remains coherent. The archive constrains choice (door requires vows to open) and the ink well charges the reconciliation moment ("small thing gathered all the weight"). Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered, though some metaphors (shelves as staves, scrolls as infants) lean decorative rather than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    The amphitheater's breath functions as more than backdrop: it times the gate operation, hums in response to the chain, and constrains the maintenance calendar. The volcano's "stone lung," basalt ribs, and galleries bored by vanished fire are specific and purposeful. The antique surveyor's chain becomes a tactile object handled across beats (quivering against the wrist, laid across steps, polished bright, run under a farmer's thumb). Micro-setting qualifies; the chain and the breathing rhythm directly charge the final resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    The attic setting constrains and charges multiple choices: cedar drawers repurposed from card catalogs teach navigation history, the skylight and dust motes provide the training method that shapes bird memory, and the meteorite chip anchors the scale—each detail functions tactically. The final image ("keep the ledger of safe returns… and teach balance by mapping the swirl of dust motes") directly links the micro-setting to closure. Spatial choreography is coherent (scale, window, rafters, ledger pages). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the narrator's professional priorities without catalog bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    The terrace's drifting prism motif recurs purposefully: light scatters in the opening, passes through logbook holes mid-story to align map codes, and settles at closure to resolve the maze-letter. The wooden desk grain becomes micro-setting, constraining the discovery method (vortex rings, compass knots) and charging the final creak "like a wing spar." The cedar frame threshold is worn where hands rubbed it, a tactile anchor that the protagonist crosses with embodied cost. Environment directly enables the central revelation and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    The underwater facility is rendered through purposeful detail: viewing dome, plankton bioluminescence, ducts and vents, anemone-filled courtyards. Sensory selection (cool glass, brine-wet finger, silt constellations) is filtered through the astrologer's professional lens. The burnt feather functions as micro-setting object, constraining the protagonist's mapping ritual and charging the final image when "tucked in my sleeve." Spatial choreography (air lock, corridor, dome, room to room) remains clear. The facility's mesh of ducts and the generator hesitation both pressure choices, elevating the setting beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.0)
    The geode's iridescent ribs, quartz corridors, and mica mirrors are vivid and voice-filtered through the recollectionist's metaphoric perception. Spatial choreography holds across moves (climbing, walking ghost-bridges, meeting the bird at the heart). The crater glass functions as micro-setting, constraining the transliteration method and charging the final ledge placement. Cap applied per orientation debt in Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal arcade, chalk grid, and advancing tide constrain and charge multiple choices: the ribbon's fall, the coin's spin, the woman's stepping through marked squares, and the final image of chalk dissolving. The sea's metronome and the arcade's pillars ground the action spatially. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the performer's analytical POV. The grid functions as micro-setting, structuring the encounter and visibly eroding at closure to reweight impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    The twilight garden functions as both sanctuary and constraint, with "enforcement drones refuse to look" establishing the spatial stakes early. The moonstone and gravel-as-shoreline anchor the dancer's practice concretely. The garden basins reflecting stars create a charged final setting detail. However, the enforcement drones remain abstract threat rather than present pressure, and the watcher's physical approach lacks spatial choreography—we never see him positioned relative to the dancer's movements, which would sharpen the tension of the dance itself.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pearl Bay at dawn is richly textured—fog, oars, crane cables, bait sheds, lily pond—and the atrium itself constrains the protagonist's tactic: rather than petition verbally, he uses the structure's own light-refracting properties to argue. The cracked pane becomes a tool that directs the demonstration. Sensory detail is filtered through craft perspective: "glass greenhouse full of unplanted mornings," "star crack, as if some constellation fell and could not swim." The pond and atrium together form a micro-setting constellation that charges the final image when the harbor master agrees to bring the council.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ridge path, telescope, cairn, and duff pocket ground the encounter; sensory detail (moon's silver, coyote yips, sweat dried by wind) is selective and atmospheric. The cracked box and cones function as micro-setting, constraining his ritual and charging the final image. The environment enables the seed-planting choice and the box's burial under the cairn, both of which shape closure. However, spatial choreography between protagonist and Mira is impressionistic rather than precise, and the ridge itself remains more symbolic backdrop than lived-in terrain that pressures tactics in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: updrafts test trial balloons, wet stone forces ephemeral proofs, tide rhythm structures gatherings. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"tide-polished," "salt and memory," "moon turned the grotto silver"—filtered through the protagonist's experimental lens. The altitude gauge, shells, cords, and driftwood act as tools that alter tactics (gauge readings prompt pattern revision, decorations become "choirs"). Spatial choreography remains coherent across the protagonist's solitary work and the later collective arrival. The final image—decorations "firm enough to guide us and light enough to change"—charges closure by embodying the thematic turn in physical form.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ivy-veiled passage, flooded museum, and fireplace are vividly rendered with economy ("half-burned pages slumped like wilted fins"). The film negative strip functions as micro-setting: it constrains perception ("I held it to my eye and watched the hallway invert its light") and charges the final act when the narrator uses it to hum and soften walls. Sensory selection reflects the narrator's professional filter (echo, reverberation, tiles as topographies). The tiles and corridor architecture directly enable the climactic choice to "rechart the echo," satisfying the 9+ gate of environment constraining choice and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.4)
    The terrace is vividly rendered with selective detail (puddled skies, slick bricks, silvered wells) and the prism parapet recurs across beats, constraining the painter's method by redirecting sunlight. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or impose a tactical cost; it functions as backdrop rather than active pressure. The final paragraph's "terrace answered with subtle echoes" is atmospheric but does not charge the closure image with on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    The terrace (warm stones, cracked balustrades, lichened bowls) constrains the ritual's staging and charges the ending ("the terrace altar," "the night can press its own seal"). The bowl of river water and the ebony clipboard function as micro-setting tools that alter tactics (steam braiding air, breath-clouds on wood). Sensory selection is purposeful: salt banners, ember shawls, charred scar tissue, and the faint planetary ring filter through a negotiator's lens trained to "adjust a distance without announcing why." Spatial choreography is clean (western edge, stools exchanged, knees knocking). The midsummer celestial dance frames urgency without mechanical countdown.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    The salt flat is not postcard: it pressures every choice (the convoy must stay on the margin, engines off; the protagonist walks alone to preserve silence; the ceramic bowl is set over the "breathing gap"). The chamber's "shy thermal sigh" and the bowl's vapor enable the hatch and echo, directly affecting outcome. Micro-setting (the throat of stone, the seam in the shell, the bowl) functions as setting and constrains the peak action. Sensory hierarchy is tight: "vapor kissed the ceramic, and my glasses, and the back of my hands" filters through professional and personal priorities. The recurring image of the salt as "white mirror" and "listening" floor accumulates meaning and charges the final moment when the chamber "caught it, spun it, braided it."

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    The courtyard and snow anchor early with vivid, purpose-driven detail: frost remembers vows, snow spins in patient spirals, the door gleams "like glass beneath breath." The prism sanctuary's crystals hanging "like verdicts" charge the climax. The body as micro-setting works: barefoot steps, chest as metronome, hair ribbons as physical anchors. These elements constrain Lira's ritual and charge the final image—snow writes a new path, the hush shifts from oppressive to held. Spatial choreography remains clear across courtyard and sanctuary transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    The radar dome functions as more than backdrop: its "meteor hush" and acoustics (echoes, the moth's percussion) charge the reflective atmosphere and recur at closure to underscore the shift. The campfire story stick is handled across multiple beats, its char-grooves and notches constraining Aurel's choices and grounding the thematic turn. The seedy bar at the end supplies social texture (drunk, old beer, citric cleanser) that tests the new ethic in a live environment, meeting the micro-setting standard.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto above clouds is anchored early with moss, cliff eddies, verdant exhalation, and spatial choreography (lip, apex, cardinal axes). The reeds, twine, and glass vial are handled tactilely across multiple beats, and the environment constrains the narrator's choices: wind direction shapes frame alignment, the broken circle's lip becomes a perch, the tilted triangle spills current eastward. The final knot left on a root charges the setting's role as archive and signal-point, meeting the 9+ gate for micro-setting that alters tactics and the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    The icebound sanctum, whale-oil lamp, rope curtain, and organ bellows constrain the protagonist's actions throughout. The punched card scrap's singed edges and the scar on the index finger both charge the final casting sequence. Spatial choreography (chamber behind knotted curtain, pipes drinking air, sluice of flame and wax) remains clear and the ice-as-listener image recurs meaningfully at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bunker interior (lichen-covered consoles, stone figure catching rain, crumbling wafer seal) and the storm-driven forest constrain choices: Only must read the directive before it disintegrates, and the rain's timing charges the exit. Micro-setting details (mud stamping boots "like a clerk stamping documents," vines reknitting "like curtains after a play") are purposeful and POV-filtered. The recurring physical anchors—seal fragments as constellation, footsteps as signatures—charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across bunker interior, threshold, and forest bend.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    The palace's dusky corridors, chipped lapis ceiling, and bronze eyelid constrain the astronomer's movements and choices: he aligns the tile to painted claws, follows the seam of mortar-sparked mica, and the eyelid's warmth signals the passage's opening. Sensory detail—"boiling glue and cedar," torchlight pooling—is filtered through the astronomer's patient, frugal perception. The micro-setting of the niche (ash basin, stylus rack, charred wax slab) directly enables the final ritual and charges the closure image when the ash turns to mirrored night. Spatial choreography remains clear across the hall and hidden passage.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sanctuary functions as active constraint: it "reappears when needed," "absorbed" rage, and its "tremble...changed the pattern of dust on the floor into braided rivers" that maps withdrawal strategy. The music box serves as micro-setting/tool, shifting from "broken...teeth tired of harm" to charging the final beat when placed against Mara's sternum. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"sabre at her belt numbed by the sanctuary's hush," "pulse stuttered like hooves before a river crossing." The space actively shapes the cellular memory work and final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ruined orchard, fog, frost, and mirror frames create a coherent micro-setting that constrains Iren's tactics: he aligns shards "to the dim north," uses the trellis as anchor, and the fog's erasure of boundaries becomes the central spatial pressure. The sextant functions as a charged tool (measurement becomes invitation), and the orchard's "apple skeletons" and "frozen mud" ground sensory detail in the POV's craftsman perspective. The final image of "mirror lanes" and "glass mountains" charges the setting's transformation and participates directly in closure, fulfilling the 9+ gate (setting constrains choice and charges final image).

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cathedral-orchard hybridity constrains the repair task (bellwater, broken irrigation, fruit-bearing rafters) and charges the final image when water returns to roots. Spatial choreography is clean: pew, bag, pipe joint, ribbon tourniquet. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—citrus humming with bees, chalk on clay, beadwork gathering—filtered through the mender's craft priorities. The micro-setting (the joint, the ribbon as soft clamp) directly alters tactics and outcome, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard's aurora leaves, glowing stones, and roots function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the rule against touching flowers bare-handed, the book nested in roots, the petals that "edit the air." The setting is filtered through the curator's professional and philosophical lens. The pistachio shell cameo and the bathroom mirror also serve as charged micro-spaces. The orchard's breath pressed into the shell directly enables the closure, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.1)
    The mountain bookstore is vividly particular (Atlases of Abandoned Journeys, Stairs of Recanted Promises) and constrains multiple choices: the thread from Palinode, the rain-written contract, the culvert of footnotes as physical trap. The botanical diary functions as both tool and micro-setting anchor, its pressed fern enabling the negotiation. Sensory detail (crushed thyme, erased chalk, moss-stitched margins) is purposeful and filtered through the protagonist's arcane-linguist lens. The final image—shelves humming "like beehives of paper"—charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    The carnival ship is rendered through vivid, purposeful detail: "Paint peeled in ribbons, and rust sang a quiet metronome beneath the creak of rides." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the gangplank, funhouse, ballroom deck, and horticultural deck. The emerald swatch card constrains passage ("I pressed the emerald swatch card against it, and the hinge exhaled salt and sawdust"), and the garden's chalked-letter blossoms charge the final image by literalizing forgotten names as seedlings. Sensory selection reflects urgency and POV filter throughout. Minor slip: "porthole crusted with barnacles" introduces marine accretion mid-ship without prior cues, a small spatial inconsistency.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.3)
    The mechanism room saturates the middle: gear teeth, escapement, weight drums, pendulum cadence, and the ceremonial rope all constrain the archivist's choices (can't use force, must honor tension/release vocabulary). The rope becomes micro-setting—its braids are tactile anchors the protagonist must "trace with fingers" and "let thrum against forearms," directly shaping the merge action. The door's presence/absence brackets the frame and charges the closure ("no longer matched the wall"), and dust tracings on the floor mark causal consequence. The setting earns high marks by making physicality indispensable to both escalation and ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    The echo chamber stone functions as micro-setting, constraining choices (magnifies both danger and path, warmed as if kissed, gathered echoes like a shepherd) and charging the final image when lifted after the ice drum quiets. The harmonic caves supply tangible pressure: stalactites that would fall "like teeth," calcite ribs "like frozen surf," and the ice sheet that "crawls slow as a beast that dreams" all filter through the mapkeeper's professional attention. Sensory hierarchy is consistent—metal and snow taste, crack patterns read as script, the bloom of hush carries a fragrance—and the spatial choreography (Throat Alcove → narrowing corridor → room of tuned darkness) tracks clearly. The "gently luminous" lamp detail recurs with purpose (anything harsher would trigger collapse), grounding the world's acoustic fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glass pavilion hums and guides Kera's tuning; the prism cradle and copper threads are handled tools that constrain the rekindling process; the waterline and cracked highways receive the beam's sweep. Setting is integrated into action rather than described separately, and the spatial choreography (climbing stairs, nesting the prism, turning the wheel) remains clear. The beacon itself functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when the flare answers. Gate met: environment constrains choice and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.9)
    Vivid, purpose-driven details: "fog has hardened into pale reefs," "crystal whispering forecourt after rain," "summer-quill nib that holds warm sap" all constrain method and charge atmosphere. The observatory's altitude, the frozen fog's texture, and the monuments' shadow-grammar consistently shape the archivist's observations and final insight. Spatial choreography is clear (parapet, forecourt, rim, plaza). The setting directly enables the closure image (the crack in the reef that widens into a window), satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.1)
    The blooming fortress, ivy-clad walls, and mosaic note provide vivid spatial anchors that guide Lio's choices (placement of mortars, tuning sound to corridors). The "hush of a night with no stars" tightens urgency and charges the final image when artificial blooms replace absent celestial ones. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric (charcoal "like river silt," fire "like a memory deciding finally to speak"), though some figurative language leans decorative rather than constraint-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    The grotto's drip/hush, tidal pools, and barnacle-lit surfaces constrain observation and choice throughout; the narrator reads "braille in water" and learns to answer "sideways," making the cave's acoustics and tidal clock active participants. Sensory hierarchy reflects the chronicler's professional filter—pools, molting crab, snail bridging slick—and the physical act of pressing palm to stone in the penultimate beat grounds the closing vow. The jade cicada functions as micro-setting, its cool weight and green glaze anchoring reflection and the final turn. Spatial choreography (knees in low tide, walking out as tide turns) tracks cleanly and the tidal clock charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    The trellis constrains action (hooking ankles, tapping for thanks, sprouting tendrils as approval) and charges the final image (ladder as "rib cage widening"). The doll functions as micro-setting/tool: its hollow torso holds silence, its porcelain surface anchors tactile memory. Gravity inversion and floating dew bells create coherent world rules. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("coins rinsed in sunrise," "rope and patience"). Minor: the clouds' behavior ("wrinkle and smooth like an enormous inhalation") reads slightly ornamental in mid-scene, not directly altering a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    The drifting terrace, storm-glass vial, and noise meter function as micro-setting that constrains the operator's choices: adjusting swing, dimming lights, avoiding the glass orchard. Sensory selection (catenary wires, signal beacons, cable hum) is filtered through the operator's professional lens. The vial's crystal shifts and meter's flutter directly shape the protagonist's path adjustments, satisfying the 9+ gate of environment constraining choice. Spatial choreography remains clear across the gondola, terrace, and orchard.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard, waterfall, and root-room are vividly rendered with distinct sensory texture: "colors tasted like childhood circuitry," "ozone and apples," sap veins pulsing with coordinates. The ruby flake functions as both tool and micro-setting element, warming to guide Maris and constraining her path. The environment directly enables the climax: the platform rises through the trunk, the aperture opens, and the throne materializes as "a radio made of rain." Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (through waterfall, rows of trunks, root-room crawl, platform ascent). The setting charges the final image without devolving into postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.2)
    The sanctuary is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail (ash, starlight as "fine salt," doorknocker "shaped like a throat clasped by a star"), yet it functions primarily as backdrop. The missing door and the floor that "keeps footprints like notes" offer micro-setting texture, but neither constrains a choice or alters tactics during the breath-teaching sequence. The doorknocker chimes once, producing a metaphorical effect (sound sinking "into the floor") without changing the visitor's options or the Keeper's approach. Spatial choreography is clear, tone is consistent, but the environment does not pressure the central conflict, capping the score below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bioluminescent farm supplies recurring sensory anchors (blue pulse, damp canvas, spore drift) and the submarine porthole bolt materially constrains the chamber seal, charging the final image. Spatial choreography inside the chamber is clear (bolt between teeth, hands on valves, gauge watching). The "shadowseam wonder" and "season when concepts become physical" risk abstraction but are tethered to concrete actions—mushrooms brightening under pressure, flakes forming along the seam—that guide the protagonist's choice to complete the sentence/transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sepia reading room is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (dust, leather, citrus; shivering shelves, rattling pens, humming floorboards). The gramophone and crank handle function as micro-setting, constraining the narrator's discovery process through physical interaction. The standing waves—a recurring environmental force—pressure the revelation sequence and charge the final image of walls that "speak without speaking." Spatial choreography is clean: oak table, west wall, portrait frame, narrow cavity track without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    The alchemical orchard is vividly realized through selective sensory detail: citrus constellations, liquid night in canals, quicksilver-glass lattices. The marionette program (vellum that "gleamed like rain") and the bell fruit constrain his choices—he must align with the blueprint, step through the pattern—charging the final image when the pear hovers awaiting his touch. Micro-setting earns the 9+ gate, yet some descriptors ("factually mystical") drift toward ornamental mood rather than spatial constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    The file room constrains choices (shelves, ledger, lamp, Row M) and charges the final image (vending machine hum, hallway length, mailbox). Dust patterns function as micro-setting that enables investigation and tactic (reading clean gaps, thumb-smudged crescents). Spatial choreography is clean: desk lamp, third shelf, envelope, mailer, hallway, mailbox. The button itself becomes object-as-setting, its brass face and bent shank carrying the story's pressure into closure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    The auric lagoon, maintenance tunnels, puddle reflections, and the phone booth key all function as micro-settings that constrain Jessa's route and enable tactics (hatch descent, wire-bridging, floodlight disruption). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—"starlight dripped through grates, striping cables with celestial bars"—and the final image charges the lagoon with thematic weight. Spatial choreography remains clear across the culvert, reeds, and relay chamber.

    The grotto, mist, and atrium prism are rendered with vivid, purpose-driven detail: stalactites tap sequences, droplets adopt the protagonist's tempo, ferns lean as if reading negative beat. These environmental elements constrain the protagonist's tactic (playing silence into the atrium's geometry to trap the code) and charge the final image where "droplets keep my tempo without me." Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—fog nests in chest, keys are "moon scales," pads "sealed eyelids"—filtered through a musician's perceptual bias. Spatial choreography is coherent across the descent, performance, and departure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.7)
    The Ashen skyborne arbor constrains action (villages hang beneath, tipping risk) and the monument's physical assembly is concrete. Spatial choreography of seed drawers, bark surfaces, and falling leaves tracks clearly. Sensory detail is often metaphorical ("sepia sentences," "ash and candy") rather than immediate; the arbor functions more as symbolic architecture than lived-in pressure. The final lifting "a finger-width higher" does charge the image, meeting the 9+ test partially, but much description is ornamental rather than tactically integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    The compass rose constrains the greenhouse entry ("tugged me through the swirling leaves"), the waterfall supplies the machine's heartbeat and measures time "by weight and fall," and the wire spool becomes tendon linking eras. Micro-setting detail charges closure: charred beams mounted as "ribs of memory" transform the rebuilt shop into a skeleton that mirrors the cavern machine. The botanical garden's "wet paper and the color green grown tired of itself" filters through the tinkerer's lens—decay as adjacent to restoration. Spatial choreography in the cavern is exact: ledge, pedestal, machine ribs climbed with "hands wet and shaking," socket placement.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    The foundry constrains choices throughout: fire's role in annealing, the anvil as workspace, rain as witness and metaphor. The zodiac coin is handled across multiple beats (pressed into palm, annealed, hammered, inlaid, carried outside) with material properties shaping tactics. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("slag-light," "commas of light"), and the final image of the disc cooling on the anvil while rain drinks from seams charges closure. The rain-washed foundry is indispensable to the alchemist's method and the story's central metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Echo Gorge is not postcard—it "opened like a throat of stone," and the river's roar constrains the collector's placement of the harp. The crocodile's tooth as micro-setting object is handled twice (pocket → plectrum → pocket) and charges the closure by opening the seam. Sensory specificity is high: "crazed like sun on broken water," "grass singing beneath ice." The gorge witnesses the bargain and hums approval, shaping the final turn. One late image—"the gorge echo inside my ribs like fresh rafters"—reweights the space with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ultraviolet forest constrains movement (liturgical maze, corridors of reeds), the pewter strap charges the final image, and proprioceptive nerves filter perception ("distances between tendons"). The pool's stillness and the strap dripping a circle anchor the climactic equation. Sensory hierarchy (bruised humming pollen, iron taste, moss smell) reflects trauma-survivor urgency. Minor slip: the camera/beetle blink lacks full integration into the choice sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.1)
    The alchemist's market is vivid and purposeful: "swinging aisles," "rope frayed into wings," "wind bells speak on wires." The lighthouse lens fragment recurs across beats and charges the closure by enabling the translation. Spatial choreography is clear (narrator moves from stall entrance to canvas over lantern to painted door), and the setting supplies the canvas that becomes the map. The lens itself functions as micro-setting, constraining and enabling the protagonist's method throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ticket office is vivid and purposeful: paint curling, sequins "barely remembering light," slatted wood drooping. The setting directly constrains choice—the hatch mechanism requires the mainspring barrel found in the drawer, and the ceiling's architecture (mirrors, cables) is the story's central discovery. Micro-setting as constraint: the barrel's cradle, the hidden pin, the dust patterns all guide action. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the narrator's professional lens. The final image charges the setting: "Cracks in the facade let truth escape like steam."

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glass orchard constrains and enables every move: panes as translucent fruit, trunks grafted with presses, the cloud-sea pier as whisper source. The bottled whisper and platen function as micro-setting that charges the final image—frost patterns as constellations of fractures, the press bite that kisses and ruptures. Sensory hierarchy filters through craft metaphor ("intervals between breath," "bright ash of cold"), and spatial choreography remains clear across rows, pier, and press frame. The orchard's buoyancy is a live constraint whose revision completes the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    The baroque asteroid is vividly realized through selective, purposeful detail: "cherubs cut into ore," "gilt veins rise like liturgy," "walking seconds" trailing "comet hair." The shard is handled twice (cradled in wire sling, tilted to reveal tableaux), directly constraining the tribunal's judgment and charging the closure when Neris returns to drape mirrors. Sensory hierarchy reflects Neris's poetic lens—visual and auditory dominance (humming shards, banging window seconds)—and the environment subtly mirrors internal states (storms, burnished sorrow) without becoming overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.1)
    The resonance chamber functions as both literal workspace and metaphoric frame: "sound could be seen as drifting filaments" establishes sensory logic, and the final image ("morning loose inside the dome… like oil that smells of apples") charges the space with consequence. The chip and drum are handled across multiple beats, altering tactics (tether construction, scale played backward). Spatial choreography remains abstract—lamps, stakes, and the keyhole lack concrete positions—but the micro-objects (chip, drum, tweezers) constrain choices enough to reach mid-7s. No occupational depth for "resonance chamber" mechanics; the term floats as poetic rather than technical.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    The subterranean lagoon's sensory signature (salt-silvered films, cold breath, jasper veining) is vivid and filtered through the protagonist's collector idiom. The lost expedition compass and the seam constrain the protagonist's path, and the dry niche's paradoxical petrichor charges the closure vial. Spatial choreography (trestle, cleft, shelf, seam, chamber) tracks cleanly across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    The storm-tossed basalt archway supplies concrete constraint: the protagonist builds shelter *under* it, using its geometry ("curved seam," "shadow now a gate"). Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("salt-white world," "foam-lit sand," "drowned organ tone"). The magic lantern slide functions as micro-setting object, constraining the final act by "throwing hints" that guide construction. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though "angle the slide so moonlight through cloud finds it" introduces slight physics ambiguity (moonlight in storm cloud). The archway charges the closure by transforming from threat to gate, satisfying the Q3 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting details are vivid and selective: etched glass with "scenes ghosting over scenes," cloister gardens, melting snow, amber pavilion among maples. The cathedral's materiality—stone, glass, lead, walls—constrains the artist's work and guides perception through refracted moonlight. The pavilion's "soft geometry of amber" charges the final image, and the recurring object (postcards on the sill) functions as micro-setting that anchors reflection. Sensory hierarchy reflects the artist's professional bias (light paths, color tones, graphite scratching). Minor slip: the river bend and pavilion appear late without prior spatial grounding, creating slight disorientation before the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    The zeppelin library, obsidian lagoon, and beach debris function as active setting elements: the gondola's sling-lift choreographs Esteban's arrival, the lagoon's reflective doubling unlocks the cipher, and beach arrangement under "shouted coordinates" grounds the decryption experiment spatially. Sensory selection is purposeful—brine/tobacco, dry glue, sand heat—and filtered through Mara's archival lens. The micro-setting of the reading room and the physical manipulation of bottles/shells/twine constrain the parley and cipher-solving, charging the final image when debris "settled into their patient grammar."

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cove functions as active constraint: tide erases chalk plans, forcing working memory; lanterns project gridded geometry that defines streets; tide pools supply algae for tiny economies. The amber bottle as micro-setting object charges the final image, refracting lantern gleam into neighborhoods and canals traced in light. Spatial choreography remains clear (strand → cliff wall → skiff arrival). Minor gap: the two women's spatial entry and positioning could be more precisely staged.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    The orchard and the wax shaving function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the bark "whispers in Hittite," forcing the scribe to respond in a dead language, and the grooves' texture guides the protagonist's final decision. Sensory detail is purposeful ("syrup"-colored lamp, "velvet disquiet," grooves that "skim the rim"). The skyscraper-orchard juxtaposition is vivid but remains atmospheric; a single additional spatial constraint affecting a middle beat would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    The icebound atrium functions as micro-setting that constrains choice throughout: frost-grain arrangement guides the unlock sequence, the dome's "Maxwell trick" architecture demands song rather than force. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered: "tannin and story," "smell of stored rain," "fine nap like frost that never melts." The oak cap as recurring object charges the closure image when placed on the hatchling's head. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (glass dome above, seed racks, trays of wheat).

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tower setting constrains every choice: sensor placement, wind shear observation, the bell rope's tactile feedback. The "cathedral bell rope, frayed by weather and blessed by a thousand hands" becomes micro-setting; the protagonist's hand on the rope ("felt the mountain's shrug arrive before the gust") directly informs the pivotal decision. Sensory hierarchy matches professional attention (thermistors, strain gauges, anemometers) and the spatial choreography (nave of wind, eaves, doorway) remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    The station's physicality—antennas as "vertebrae," the tin cup taped to a mast, ozone-and-chalk air—constrains and enables the climactic beat: opening shutters, tracing on paper, persuading receivers into tune. The yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting, charging the closure when it circulates "hand to hand." Spatial choreography is clean (room with shutters, mast-mounted cup, the gate crack). The "overlooked era" and mountain-sky interface texture the narrator's solitude without becoming a postcard. Environment directly shapes the crew's reversal: the station "remembers how to sing," and that embodied memory alters their choice.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The scorched wasteland, black sand, empty hives, and irrigation channels are vivid and selective, filtered through Mara's attentive gaze. The stained glass box functions as micro-setting and recurring object; its panes, solder seams, and changing state (sealed with new hinge, breathed upon) constrain Mara's gestures and charge the final image. The hives are arranged into parentheses—a purposeful spatial choice that frames the covenant ritual. Sensory detail (air sweetens, dust, temperature, clover scent) modulates with emotional beats. The environment shapes the closure: the covenant is retied through perimeter-walking and the hives' affirmative click.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The emerald silo's "watery heartbeat" glass panes and the cremation urn fragment's "cool grit" constrain the final choice—Mara's pressing the fragment into the narrator's hand steadies the decision to release the coins. The rye "sugar-lit" at dawn and the silo's green light create a coherent micro-setting that charges the closure image. Spatial choreography (capsule at center, fragment at seam, ribbon uncoiling) remains clear across beats, and the silo's timeless air brackets the key turn without postcard drift.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt lagoon functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: reeds snag the kite, shallows allow the poet to wade in, puddles "give back little circles of agreement." Sensory detail is filtered through the poet's bias ("burnished hush," "drizzle threads the warp") and the drake's tail feather—found near reeds, handled twice, threaded into the kite—becomes a tool whose physical properties (stiff shine, curve) matter to the repair. The final image charges setting detail: "reeds begin applause, a ticking of seeds on water" directly mirrors the opening gulls' arguments, closing the spatial loop with accumulative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    The temple orchard is vividly particular: living stone pillars that hum, fruiting oaks trained like bells, tidemud where crabs scribble prayers. Sensory detail is filtered through the caretaker's professional bias (sap, tide, iron in the diary; moss and crushed lightning in the chamber) and the setting constrains choices—storm shifts a pillar, opening the chamber only after spiral planting and canopy tugging. The micro-setting of copper wire and oak boughs functions as a tool-set that the protagonist handles across beats (wrapping, listening, feeling tremor). The final image places the protagonist "centered where orchard and temple traded breaths," charging spatial position with thematic weight. Minor: the gulls nesting in alcoves at the end feels slightly decorative rather than causally tight, but the body-in-environment choreography (ear against bark, hand on pillar, feet feeling chamber rhythm) remains concrete and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rainwashed tower, bronze sculptures, and garden path supply vivid, selective anchors. The fly amber functions as micro-setting, constraining the misting choice and charging the final tucking-away moment. Sensory hierarchy reflects scientific attention (resin, rain, pepper of soil). The dusty footprints serve as both navigational constraint and thematic vessel. The ending image—garden "smelled deliberate, like a formula solved by walking"—directly charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    The jetty, birds, seed pods, and dead reef function as micro-setting that constrains choices: tern and gull calls direct planting locations, coral powder becomes fertilizer, the coach's leather seats "cradle seedlings." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("taste of pitch and brine," "scent walks"), and the twilight setting charges the final image by lengthening the jetty "underfoot, ferrying us into tomorrow." Spatial choreography remains coherent across beats. The recurring jetty and reef anchor both the opening and closure, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.1)
    The scrapyard's material palette—rust, wax, cracked wasteland, salvage towers, bolted spindle—constrains choices at every turn: the narrator must oil the phonograph's turn, find the western heap's pipe, and thread hose "seam to seam." The autumn leaf in wax charges the final image by bending light to reveal the map and later promising to "meet the water and name it." Sensory detail is consistently filtered through the narrator's poetic bias (wild hush, constellations made of cranes, moon as stitched eye), maintaining coherence without catalog excess. The settlement's spatial layout—aisles of wrecks, western heap—tracks cleanly through the night walk, and the underground river's discovery alters the environment causally (pipes sigh, buckets brighten).

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    The time dilation observation deck is not mere backdrop: residual gradients stretch shadows, panels index centuries, visor grids enable the sketch method, and the leftmost lens becomes the instrument of alignment. The compass rose applique, bedrock valley, and river reflection all constrain or charge choices. The protagonist's body—breathing that stutters the star, hands moving twice—functions as micro-setting. The valley's mineral seam operates as true north, indispensable to the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound spire constrains movement and charges the atmosphere throughout; the frozen tide clock at the heart shapes the final amendment action. Micro-setting details (frost blossoming into letters, ice ticking like teeth) anchor perception and pressure. Sensory selection reflects urgency: wind, cold, colors bleeding into wrong constellations. The sundial lid's physical placement in the niche and crown directly affects the closure image ("time dripped sweeter from the ledges").

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.1)
    The whispering gallery's curved acoustics and tiled alphabet constrain and enable the protagonist's method throughout, fulfilling the micro-setting test. Sensory detail—iodine and smoke from the dome, veined marble bench, concentric tiles—anchors the space without tourism. The gallery's circular architecture mirrors the thematic refusal of linear drills and scripted exits. Spatial choreography (center under oculus, second rank of chessboard, heel-to-toe tile touching) remains clear and purposeful across all beats.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bookstore mountain is evocatively rendered with consistent metaphoric texture: "aisles smell of glue, ash, and rain," "floor is an atlas made of unreadable skin." Sensory detail is filtered through the protagonist's search for belonging, and the feather as micro-object charges the final image by enabling the stone's grammar. Spatial choreography within the labyrinth is impressionistic rather than clear—distances, turns, and room transitions remain abstract—but the rotunda and cloche anchor the climax. The recurring objects (stone, feather, cloche) constrain the protagonist's approach and the final act, lifting setting above decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.1)
    The platinum labyrinth and tapestry constrain every middle choice: burned threads, silver threads, rope fibers become the tutor's chessboard. The time-frozen village supplies tactile detail (baker's eyelid, child's slingshot, woman at the well) that the protagonist manipulates to restore motion. The pawn rolled across knuckles recurs and charges the closure (left inside the tapestry as payment). Micro-setting (the bench, the gleam) roots the ending. Sensory hierarchy is consistent: the tutor notices geometry, weave, tension—details filtered through his chess-trained perception.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.1)
    Canyon of bone towers and echoes constrains the central tactic—sound refracts, multiplies, teaches meaning—and the pale spire functions as both setting anchor and pressure node. The mist, torches, and chalked faces supply sensory specificity filtered through the narrator's urgency. Spatial choreography is clean (hollow, canyon mouth, spire base). The echoes are not ornamental: they enable the protagonist's plan and charge the final image when "echoes braided our voices" until clarity fractures. Minor: the hollow and other interior spaces remain lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The acid sea, neutralizing vat, and the statue's pockmarked face all constrain choices—he must dive to work safely, must read craters as navigational logic, must match them to the stormwheel's teeth—fulfilling the micro-setting rule. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: limefat grease, vitriol's sting, the rasp of a mentor's laugh quilted from memory. The statue's craters charge the final image by becoming "a map not of stars but of survival," and the warm heartplate anchors the ending's embodied relief. Spatial choreography is clean; the vat, engine, and prow remain coherent anchors throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coastal cave network constrains the journey (flooded split, wrong turn, rising floor) and the slit of daylight charges the painting act. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "brine and sleeping fire," "olive" light, mineral breath. The shell and pool function as micro-setting that constrains the final choice to set the canvas and shell afloat. Spatial choreography (descent, cavity opening, ledge, pool) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt lens ("purifies intentions as they pass through") constrains the narrator's tactic: aim longing, not cruelty, to reach Mara. The vial cork's resin-and-night-flower scent becomes a micro-setting object that the narrator uses twice (pressed to lips, then opened to release garden into the room), charging the final beckon. Spatial choreography is clean (hatch, stairs, lantern shutters, lee of rock, skiff tie-line). The heat-wave aftermath creates sensory contrast (salt, cooled sea, thin dawn) that filters every perception and permits the whisper to travel without "burning" meanings. The garden scent wraps the light beam, a tactile environmental detail that alters the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    The censer foot functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its weight stabilizes the dish ("Its weight remembers smoke, and its curve cups a thread of wire"), and the narrator threads, lashes, and leans into the arc to manually aim the broken hydraulics. The station's spatial details (dish, cradle, counterweight rig, signal horn) are interleaved with action and pressure. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional focus: "The air tastes of ozone and rust, a recipe for remembering." The final image—"I rest my head against the censer foot"—charges closure by making the relic both tool and pillow, physical anchor for exhaustion and solace.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    The hanging orchard, ravine storms, and mycelium threading constrain choices—foraging location shapes the circle's safety metaphor, the eye's burial among roots charges the ending. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "leaves slick with brine," "orchard hummed with runoff and swallows." The glass eye's "stormgreen spiral, flecked with mica" is concrete and purposeful. Spatial choreography (kneeling with trowel, eye on branch, then beneath truffle bed) tracks cleanly. Minor gap: the iron cables and cliff faces are mentioned but do not constrain a choice or return at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The opal dock, mist, lighthouse lens, and harbor return across beats and constrain action—adjusting the lantern's pauses, pinning the flower inside oilskin, aiming light at the shipping lane. Sensory detail is filtered through the keeper's perceptual idiom ("harbor learns the living by the gestures they do not finish," "mist made the harbor a page erased"). The lighthouse mechanism (lens, waltz timing, pauses) directly enables the message and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear; no prop or distance errors. Minor note: Edelweiss's mountain origin versus sea setting is noted but not fully leveraged as a tactical constraint within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting does heavy work: the rising creek imposes a live clock and physical constraint (spray-wet brush, brown churning water, the need for a footbridge), the blooming cavern at midsummer supplies the mystical press and channels his father's typesetter legacy into tactile action (chip fits throat exactly), and the shop's transformation into shelter for wet strangers charges the final image. The matrix chip, ants, flowers, and pallets all recur with reweighted function. Sensory hierarchy matches Elias's empirical-intuitive bias (calipers, limestone smell, petals brushing sleeves). No missteps that break spatial or temporal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt grotto "above clouds" and the ember grotto on the ridge function as paired micro-settings that constrain the queen's journey and supply the closure's "lung" metaphor. Bleeding starlight inside the cobalt vault becomes tactile liquid that "cut her palms with cold," and the ember grotto's basalt absorbs her whispered bird-names to complete the breath-cycle. Spatial choreography (treeline → cobalt vault → descent to ridge) remains clear, and the grottos charge the final image when the wind begins "between them." One more sentence anchoring the physical distance or elevation differential would push this firmly into the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ember nexus is anchored early with sensory detail (hums, steam threads, grates, twilight velvet) and remains consistent throughout. The nautilus shell columella curl inside the reactor is a recurring object that charges the final image when it "dims like a yawn," signaling the experiment's completion. The reactor itself constrains choice: the narrator must calibrate it, open the iris, and feed it the vials in a specific sequence. Spatial choreography is clear (plaza center, grate, tiles, drain), and the body's role in the work (palm stained gold, wrist touch, sleeve used to revalue) gives the setting tactile weight. The plaza's shift from experimental hush back to "choreography of merchants" marks the world's return to normalcy and underscores the singularity of the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mountain ranger cabin anchors early with concrete sensory detail (creosote, spruce, birch bark, the stuttering clock). The grave cairn on the ridge, the scroll's pale scars, and the window where "the moon could adjudicate" all constrain or enable choices—writing on the bark "until my knuckles creaked," reading aloud to the ridge. The scroll functions as micro-setting and charges the final image. Spatial choreography (cabin interior, ridge, dream cabin, return to ridge) tracks cleanly. The only slip: "thermals that hummed like bees" and "wind fretted, stones listened" veer slightly ornamental, though they remain voice-coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    The water clock shop grounds the action through tactile micro-setting: the fogged dome, the thin wire, the felt washer, and the bone pin drawer all constrain repair choices and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is maintained (protagonist notices rhythm and condensation rather than scent), and the "rain script" breath-fog notation functions as workspace logic. Spatial choreography remains clear across the bench work. The screw's physical placement against the bone pin creates a material constraint that shapes the ending, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting, though one or two figurative descriptions ("careful hands" air) edge toward stock.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    The floating platform, porcelain bowls, and stormleaf tea constrain the ritual choreography; the crow quill and the held breath serve as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy (saturated hush, the way heat blurs the room to watercolor, frost on the lattice) reflects the protagonist's urgency and perceptual priorities. The environment subtly guides choice: Elder Nam's tapping the rim twice offers a rhythm of mercy that alters the protagonist's next move. Spatial choreography remains clear (leaning over the bowl, tools in satchel, chains anchoring the platform). The stormlight and rising wind at closure evolve the setting in step with the protagonist's internal shift, and the platform's tilt with the wind adds embodied consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.1)
    Archive shelves, copper wiring, perfume bottle, and fluorescents hum with tactile specificity; the orchard remains offstage yet presses via saw-sounds and taped signs. Micro-setting qualifies: the bottle constrains ritual logistics (salted water, hairline crack) and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (reading table, shelves, generator, folio). Minor gap: the orchard itself never enters as direct sensory pressure within the archive walls, weakening the urgency claim slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.9)
    The temple library is vividly rendered through selective detail (velvet hush, spiral aisles, ribs-curved shelves, window showing no outside) and the spatial choreography of the three circles is legible. The dais and the book function as micro-setting that structures the protagonist's movement and frames the arbitration. However, the environment does not constrain a live choice or supply a contested resource; it stages the ritual but does not pressure it. The setting charges the final image but does not alter tactics, holding the score below the 7.0 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    The horizon measurement station's hydraulics constrain choices throughout: the protagonist shepherds pressures, adjusts petcocks, and reads the floats' pulse. The mantle clock key physically enables the valve repair, a micro-setting moment that charges the ending. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through occupational priority (brass, tick, pluck of droplets, razor-edged horizon). The station and its tools are not postcard ornament; they shape the night's work and the final acceptance. Meets the 9+ gate criterion (tool constrains choice and charges closure).

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    The rainwashed library is vivid and purposeful: rain ticking on high windows, the mica lantern that "made the room look like a soft probability distribution," the drip that hisses on the pane. The lantern functions as micro-setting and recurring object, constraining the protagonist's attention and charging the final image when placed "between us so the light bridged our bedsides." The ward setting is less textured but functional. Spatial choreography (stacks, table, bedside) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    The subway utility tunnel is anchored early ("grates like a sleeping furnace," "Booth E-12") and charges the final image: "I sit in the tunnel... while above me the streetlamps hold their hum like a promise I can keep." The glass harmonica disc functions as micro-setting, constraining the operator's method (wet thumb, thin note) and appearing in three beats. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priority—copper trunk lines, fuses, rotary dials—woven through action rather than cataloged. Spatial choreography is implicit but clear; the console and disc occupy the operator's workspace without clutter. The underground/above contrast subtly mirrors the operator's cultivated distance without becoming overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    The blooming jetty supplies concrete constraints: salt roses, barnacles, rubber tires ground the ritual space, and the kettle's cooling marks ritual closure. The locket (micro-setting as body-tool) charges the final image by constraining the choice to close it. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: "walnut hulls dark as bruised moons," "thyme for courage and salt for memory." The jetty's tidal pulse ("takes back the edge…then gives it again") mirrors the covenant's rhythm and directly shapes the archivist's stance at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.1)
    The station's ivy-overgrown ticket counter, platform, and corrugated surveyor shack anchor spatial moves. The moon rock's placement "where the ivy could test its patience" charges the final image with the setting's slow green breath, meeting the 9+ gate criterion. Sensory selection prioritizes touch ("pressed against her palm"), texture ("striated and stubborn"), and the visual constellation of fingerprints. Spatial choreography (Mara's trip into the hills, return to the counter, walk to the platform) remains legible and the setting constrains the surveyor's isolation and the camp's circulation around the counter.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ultrasonic forest is vividly rendered through non-visual senses: "syllables of sap and spores pressing signatures into his fingers," the cedar's "grammar," the clearing's "nave that sang without sound." Spatial choreography is coherent (entering, following the trail, kneeling at center). The ring functions as a micro-setting object that constrains the dowsing method and charges the final image when it opens "like a locket." However, the forest's acoustic properties—its core conceit—remain largely atmospheric; no choice hinges on navigating or misreading its ultrasonic features, and the deer-of-echoes encounter decorates rather than complicates the journey.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    The gravitational anomaly flexes as a tide with no moon, the listening well and quiet room are spatially grounded, and the pen's exotic nib ("storm maps from a world that never hardened") constrains the repair choice—its dried reservoir is the material obstacle the protagonist must solve. The coolant beads frozen into "harmless ornaments" charge the final image. Minor gap: the docking spine's physical layout remains abstract; clearer spatial choreography of the shuttle's approach would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    The luminous harbor, chalk constellations, and vintage camera constrain the performance's staging and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("salt-shined hush," "rope fibers sighing"). The camera's emptiness becomes a recurring constraint that shapes how the narrator "conducts." Spatial choreography across jetties and the police launch remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.6)
    The salt flats, ribcage arch, and dust-filled archive rooms ground the search in tactile particulars and guide the protagonist's choices—pressing the tapestry to the carving opens the hidden chamber. Micro-setting (portrait chamber, niches holding breath reels) constrains discovery and charges the final image of dawn "rummaging through bones." Sensory hierarchy reflects the narrator's priorities: visual pattern-seeking dominates, with atmospheric dust and breath sounds anchoring key beats. The archive functions as more than backdrop; its structure (walls accepting the tapestry, darkness yielding) actively enables the resolution, meeting the 9+ gate for environment-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sound wave garden functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice: drumming surfaces answer with frequencies, the lagoon's auric sheet becomes the tactile interface for memory entanglement, and the system's rail-pulsed warnings force consent decisions. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the narrator's synesthetic attention ("metallic and sweet, like a bitten coin swirled in honeyed tea"). The garden's acoustics charge the final image when the narrator promises to "be the beat that lets us return." Spatial choreography (walkway, railing, lagoon surface) remains coherent across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    The container labyrinth is tactile and job-specific: "corrugated steel funneled breath like a riverbed guides rain," vents with drain holes, "graffiti with the blue whale," "pallet of oranges left open," the sympathetic hum of steel under the storm. The geomagnetic storm affects props (radios stutter, compasses rattle, lights hiccup) and the narrator navigates by "the steel remembered me." The zodiac coin is used to rap panels "until the pitch softened," the key turns cams, and spatial choreography stays coherent (Bay Twelve, catwalks, tarps, tower). The micro-setting of vents and corrugations directly constrains and enables the whisper-tactic, meeting the 9+ gate. The storm charges the final image (aurora washing the cranes, green sky) without becoming postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt dock, rain-slicked stairs, moored boats, and boathouse shutters constrain the guardian's tactics (mirror requires angle, shutters signal patterns, water holds danger). The dental mirror functions as micro-setting, shaping each move and charging the final image when pocketed. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered: "guttered sky," "wet grain," "warm light of the harbor lamp." No occupation-level depth required at this length; the canal as instrument is established and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cobalt library and magnetic grotto are rendered with purposeful sensory detail that constrains choices (compasses stagger, clocks tremble, blue light in mist). The grotto's physical properties (iron filings, ceiling tone) provide concrete constraint and charge the closure when the kids return there. Spatial choreography remains clear across the town's windows and the trail to the grotto. The mist functions as both atmosphere and a unifying image that returns at the pivotal night, though it occasionally verges on symbolic convenience rather than earned environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sublittoral fringe operates as micro-setting throughout: eelgrass combs the hull, kelp forests rise like cathedrals, tidepool placement of the scrimshaw unlocks island secrets. Sensory hierarchy is strong—wet rope, moon jellies' cursive, whale vibrations—filtered through the protagonist's maritime expertise. The disappearing island as woven raft of reef and driftwood constrains the protagonist's approach and charges the ending when it "rises to meet us with ropes of light." Idiom is consistent and the spatial choreography across skiff, pier, and island remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Turbines function as atmospheric pressure and metaphor ("trawl the sky like iron scythes"), their shadows rehearse in the glass during the show, and they threshold the dusk walk—constraining the protagonist's sensory world and charging the final image. The whittling station (knife, fence slats, falling shavings), kettle, window, and jars of salt all constrain micro-choices. Spatial choreography is clear: interior (kettle, window, whittling) to exterior (field, fence posts). The "remade hush" is sensory (wind, breath, shavings' applause) and purposeful, supporting tone. Minor gap: the farmhouse interior could have one additional concrete anchor (floor type, wall texture) to fully reach 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt atrium, quartz colonnade, and frozen lake are vivid and specific, filtering through the poet's aesthetic lens ("lantern-moth hush," "cold ink"). The ice surface constrains the crossing choice and the colonnade's changing hum charges the path-opening beat. Spatial choreography (atrium floor to west doors to lake to pier) tracks cleanly. Sensory selection is purposeful and the setting recurs across beats, supporting closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    The courtyard, kiln, pedestal, and cracked phoenix are concrete and recur with functional pressure: the phoenix's crack becomes the story's hinge object, the plant arrangements serve as communication medium, and the market whispers anchor social context. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("smoke water and milk lime...for texture that teaches air where to travel"). The failed phoenix on the pedestal constrains Ilias's choice and charges the final image when Mara's wreath renames it "home." Spatial choreography is clear across all beats. The setting functions as micro-geography that enables the central action.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    The laboratory setting and the miner's carbide lamp lens constrain multiple choices: the lens is positioned "before the bells so colors cut across their throats," directly enabling the harmonic effect that structures the pilgrimage. The lens returns at closure ("I lift it, and I let the mined glass pour a rim of light over their shoulders"), charging the final image with coal-memory and trust. Micro-setting qualifies: the lens, bells, and door are tactile anchors that alter tactics. Sensory hierarchy is maintained through the POV's professional filter—color refraction, harmonic ripple, knock patterns translated into maps.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory's "brass bones," curtains of intention, and genuinely artificial stars are vivid and voice-filtered. The vellum stencil, lockets with micromesh, and origami cranes function as micro-setting elements that constrain choices (alignment of pathways, measured illumination). Spatial choreography remains clear (central table, railing, floor corridor). The final image—curtains "slumber behind us, ready to illuminate again"—charges closure. Minor abstraction ("timeless observatory") and the lack of exterior city pressure keep specificity from reaching higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft anchors atmosphere early and returns in the ending ("the loft windows…hummed"), charging the final image with spatial memory. The measuring tape, cork map, red string, and chalk function as tools that shape the work itself, constraining the method of pattern-making. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the narrator's POV ("grit-bright hush," "steam, song, and rumor"). The environment charges the closure image, narrowly qualifying for the 9+ gate, but the spatial choreography during the gathering scene is vague (who stands where, how the room fills) and the setting's constraint on choice remains implicit rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archive's bronze ribs, glassy shadows, and "steadily unpredictable" air create a tactile, character-filtered environment. The quartz cages and their hum constrain the historian's approach, forcing varied step sequences and hand gestures. The final image—stairs unscrolling, mirrors reflecting child and scholar—charges the closure by spatializing the internal split. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.8)
    The blooming library is rendered through tactile, specific detail: petals that open/close, spines budding flowers, pollen of letters, cloud floor that shifts. The river stone constrains the final choice—its mica and warmth become the circuit that enables the shadow's remembering and the book's inlaying. The western window recurs as spatial anchor and the stone's placement there matters at closure. Sensory detail (paper, ozone, far thunder) is filtered through the narrator's curatorial attention, and the setting's vertical precariousness ("the heights billow and forget the ground") charges the stakes of witness and tether.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    The misty workshop, tools, glass vials, and chameleon tank are purposefully integrated. The bench lamp's glow makes "tools glint like small comets trailing trust," charging the setting with thematic weight. The chameleon's tank and branch lattice are rebuilt on the page, constraining choice and anchoring the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the handler's priorities (mesh, splinters, coil). The shed doorway frames Karim's entrance with spatial clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tower, its service tunnel, ivy, and elm are handled as micro-setting that constrains choice: the fern's refusal sends the protagonist down, the ivy blocks access until consent is given, the elm's wound becomes the door for the miracle's return. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("meteor hush," "sap rises like a sigh," "roots stitch the darkness together"). The hourglass and coffee rings function as intimate anchors; spatial choreography (room → tunnel → elm at stair foot → return) remains coherent. The tower's roots and plants become pressure-bearing agents rather than décor, charging the final image when "the tower windows glitter like healed skin."

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.1)
    The projection booth is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail: "projector purrs like hushed thunder," "carpet smells of heat and ghosted popcorn," "ceiling sheds glitter that used to be part of applause." The film strip as micro-setting ("perforations pulsing," "gutters between frames," "clear head of the reel") constrains the psychometry reading and charges the final image when blank leader is threaded and glows. Sensory selection reflects the gazer's spatially imaginative lens, anchoring reflection in concrete stimuli. The setting is indispensable to the closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    The aurora-lit archway is grounded early, and the instrument functions as micro-setting—brass and sorrowful, its face bearing an "unwritten calendar" that the protagonist traces and uses to catch falling star-routes. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "frost in my hair," "the ground rang like a bell," "ink ran from their beaks like warm rain." The archway and instrument constrain choices (the protagonist must stand within the arch, turn the brass circles) and charge the final image when the instrument rests "dark now, the needles at peace, the brass chill as a vow." The town's transformation—windows unlatching, a child shaking dry paint, an old poet threading stitches loose—anchors the consequence spatially. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, with the protagonist's position and the instrument's state tracked across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glowing dune functions as micro-setting that charges the closure: its algae-fed bloom provides the medium for planting sparks, and its brightening/dimming tracks the ritual's success. The chess clock and lamp are handled across beats (clock set on sand, faces catching bloomlight; lamp lowered, then lifted), grounding spatial choreography. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"pollen colored like drowned stars," "algae dim to make room for letters sprouting stems"—and filtered through the guard's professional focus on sparks and sidings. However, the tracks, train cars, and "buried yard of impossible switches" remain abstract anchors; the physical layout of the divergent archive and the railman's circle lack the tactile constraint that would push this into the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mechanical rainforest is vividly textured with metal-specific flora (fern cogs, copper laurels, bronze pines) and the sound-mapping method integrates setting into navigation tactics. The coinlight canopy and the tower's turbine-bone construction maintain consistent surreal-industrial idiom. Spatial choreography is mostly coherent, though the translocation between clearings and the tower's sudden arrival lack anchoring transitions. The small gear functions as micro-setting: it constrains the protagonist's attempts (clicking to emotions, fitting the door slot) and charges the final image when returned to the mouth, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment/object shaping choice and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.9)
    The veiled ridgeway, fog-laden water, and carved cliff stairs create a cohesive coastal dreamscape that directly enables the vigil and the protagonist's shift in approach. The ticket punch with star stamp becomes a tactile anchor that lights fence posts and guides movement, constraining the search method. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("conch-hum whispers," "fern drips," "moonbread air"), though some coined terms ("moonbread") edge toward ornamental. The environment charges the final image: the stars cooling like shells as they descend.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cobalt fortress, snow, and the hushing engine supply vivid spatial grounding; the piano bench bolt and the engine's missing bolt create micro-setting pressure by charging the protagonist's choice. Sensory detail is dense but occasionally ornamental ("snow steamed from travelers," "rugs hushed every footfall") without altering tactics. The bolt threading and reversal sequence grounds the climax in tactile action, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that an object constrain choice. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the path from vestibule to grand stair to blue door to lobby compresses slightly without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.7)
    The library as setting supplies atmospheric texture (dust as "thoughtful constellations," shelves in "graceful collapse"), and the rune of drift functionally shifts corridors, gating access to the sealed ledger. The iron gall ink and bowls of starlight constrain Lys's method (forgery ink "sulks purple" under starlight, revealing truth). However, spatial choreography is vague—where Lys stands, how readers navigate the mosaic, and the ledger's physical location remain abstract. The setting pressures choices at closure (the rune hums, the corridor opens) but earlier beats treat it more as mood than tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    The monitoring station is vivid and purposeful: "drifting moored among buoys and beeps," steel desk, pipe to Jun's shack, tower, railing. The atlas page (torn, creased, sunsoft, smelling of basement rain) and the Pilgrims Trace (posts, cairns of bottle glass) are tangible anchors. Spatial choreography is clean across the flats. Sensory detail is filtered through the narrator's grief and profession (sensor logs, hydrograph charts). The station and torn page constrain choices: the page seeds the investigation, the station provides tools. No tourist catalog; every detail serves the search.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    The repair bay is rendered through vivid, purpose-driven detail: "ribcage without a heart," cranes arrested mid-gesture, scored floor, busted roof with a carved notch aligning the lighthouse star. The opera glasses and stone circle function as micro-setting elements that constrain the protagonist's method and charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear across moves (edge → hull → access panels → control deck) and the textural specificity—braided wire, grounding points, hollow wing—grounds choices without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    The volcanic hot springs function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the heat/cool ritual is spatially anchored (slate ledge, dripping mineral water, basalt snag), timed by broken watch and reed songs, and directly enables the unsealing. The springs' sigh of approval at the end charges the final image. Sensory detail (ghostly steam, pumice, wet stone smell) is selective and filtered through Mara's priorities; the reeds' "chords of mineral thirst" and the moss/fern feedback shape her ritual pacing. The environment is lived-in and causally integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    The arboretum's glass ribcage, cliff fissures, spray height, and automated lighthouse constrain the ceremony choice on the page—Samira shows the chair the overlook "now only a sketch under spray." The pearl basin, eucalyptus whisper, and gutter-caught rain function as micro-setting that charges the closure image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered: she smells fog inheritance, hears wind lean on glass, reads the sea as having "more drama than any of them could hold." Environment decisively shapes the final spatial and emotional geography.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lighthouse interior—spiral stairs, lens rings, shutter ropes, the beam itself—directly constrains and enables the protagonist's final choice: untangling the mechanism restores light and metaphorically clarifies her vision. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through her artistic POV (fog as feathered, dust as sentences, moon rings on floorboards). The "wick once curled like sleeping kelp" and "fogbones" demonstrate voice-specific perception that charges the space beyond postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.1)
    Wind, tarps, ink, and the drone function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the closure: the ink's evaporation maps attention vectors, the drone films seams, and the encampment's "consciously wild" design braids design into disarray. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("salt on my tongue," "heat rising out of the ink"), and spatial choreography remains clear across the threshold crossing. The eclipse aftermath and wind-carved bones anchor the opening and return in the final image, meeting the gate for environment shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    The library's architecture (glass ribs, frost cabinets, dormant conduits) constrains the archivist's choices and charges the final image: the blinking lights across stacks become the medium of the unspoken conversation. Micro-setting details—breath fogging margins, dust moving like startled fish, the misaligned slot—anchor each beat. The snow outside operates as pressure (muffling, thickening) and the plows' "slow commas" at the end mirror the punctuation metaphor threaded through the piece. Sensory detail is filtered through the archivist's professional lens (catalogs ticking, servers coughing, relays clicking) without tourist excess. Minor dock: "dizzying quiet" recurs but the specific mechanism of dizziness could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glass dome constrains every major choice: it must not crack during the storm, its fractures require the sandbag strips, and it hums as the physical container for her philosophy. The desert environment (sand, heat, wells, wind) pressures tactics throughout—water is scarce, dust threatens, the storm tests structure. Micro-setting is vivid and functional: the peg where the sheath hangs, the cistern where strangers crouch, the seam-crossing where new cuttings are planted. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (turbine smoke, gritty eyelids, petals like coins), and spatial choreography remains clear through the storm sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sound wave garden functions as micro-setting: stems shiver, petals unfurl, pockets pool echoes, and the garden "parts like lips" in response to the fisher's breath. The rail spike—smooth with weather and palms—is handled twice (swung to drop into a pocket, then steadied against during the pull) and its coldness signals the catch's strain. Spatial choreography of skiff, furrows, and pockets remains coherent. The garden's responsiveness directly enables the capture: the fisher offers "a bowl of nothing" and the roots taste his transliterated phonemes, constraining his method and charging the final image of the garden sighing behind him.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    The observatory's echoing dome, humming floor, and shutter "like a slow eyelid" are filtered through the heiress's newsprint idiom and constrain action—she climbs stairs, places the pen nib beside a keyboard, uses the catwalk's verticality to dramatize intervention. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: graphs "look back like children," wind "hisses through lashes," the rosewood tin "smells like inked thunder." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (floor → mirror → catwalk → stairs) and the micro-setting (keyboard, cursor blinking "like a fuse") charges the peak choice. The pen nib as tactile anchor and the dome's acoustic properties ("echoes dislike evasions") make the environment a participant in the ethical confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lab is sensuously particular: "meteor hush," "mothlight," reels that "whisper a year," and the antique credenza smelling of "ash and lavender." The amber lens, red tether-cord, and conductive-silver ink constrain the repair method and charge the final image when the nephew's name is tattooed in "tiny stars." Micro-setting (amber as window, insect as saint-of-pause, chassis as canvas) functions fully, transforming body and tool into setting that drives choice. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto-as-body (whispering walls, hush that "nudged," sand that "settled like a note") and the tile flake (warms, whispers corduroy-smell, hums agreement) function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the flake mediates the artist's social perception, the mandala's water-threading reveals avoidance-points, and the grotto "rearranged their echoes." Sensory detail is purposeful—mist, lilac-gray twilight, chalk dust voice—filtered through the artist's backward-listening idiom. Spatial choreography (threshold, kneeling on sand, standing where standing hurt) remains clear. The flake's return to moss and the grotto keeping the mandala "until the next tide" charge the ending without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.1)
    The shattered sky, charred cedar decree, and tessera as seed/door/bell anchor the post-fire plaza vividly. The tessera constrains choice: pressing it to the ground opens retrocognitive images that supply the renaming intelligence the narrator needs. Spatial choreography is clear—broken steps, square fracture-as-question, patrol approach—and the "peeled fruit" sky modulates tone. The arms of "pitted steel and faded scripture" serve as micro-setting that charges the final beat. Sensory selection remains purposeful without catalogue excess.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.1)
    The mystic orchard-maze functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the pears chime, plums hum and sour if hearts lie, hedges rearrange in response to the coin flip, revealing the prop shed and blueprint. The synesthetic filtering (tasting lime-light, hearing hammers in plum, seeing pitch of silence) is specific to the ghost's perception and drives navigation. The tarot coin's light-catching blank side and The Star motif charge the closure image when Rowan leaves it on a branch. Spatial choreography remains clear across hedge-corridors, prop shed, and the dawn crew arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    The light painting studio supplies the fiber wands, camera rail, and wristband rig—each used in choreography that translates thought into motion. The muscovite shard is handled twice (texture use before, key tonight) and its fractal splitting charges the final ladder image. Micro-setting (body, skin, breath) constrains choices: the wristband reads microflinches to trigger colors. The storage loft and grounding coil are discovered through the mapped light, altering tactics. Specificity is high ("willowglass hope made mineral," "river reeds path") and sensory detail modulates with attention—urgent during the dance, reflective when they climb laughing.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    The coastal cave network constrains multiple choices: the protagonist must skim on her back through the narrow elbow, the mineral pool eases joints (enabling the float), and the chamber's imprint directly charges the closure image. Sensory detail is vivid, selective, and filtered through the POV's professional lens (trace gases, tannin ghosts, microtemporal steps). The elm leaf fossil functions as micro-setting, accumulating meaning from opening to chamber alignment to final broadcast. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (bluff mouth → mineral pool → narrow elbow → chamber → broadcast shed).

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.1)
    The amber warehouse is vividly anchored with "shelves rise like ribs," "honeyed" light, and jars holding time, creating a distinct textural envelope. The canyon echo jar and buttons function as micro-setting elements that constrain the protagonist's method and charge the final image (the cord and preserved echo). The cliffs and sea provide external pressure ("sea gnaws…at the ankles") and the rain road's appearance is spatially coherent within the lyric frame. Spatial choreography remains clear when the townspeople enter and work collectively. However, occupational detail—how hourglasses physically interact with cliffs, what "turning" them together entails mechanically—is gestural rather than grounded, and the grottoes holding crates "dry enough to lift" after presumed flooding lack causal setup. The sensory palette is strong (honey, stone, rain, rust) but the transition from warehouse interior to clifftop exterior to grottoes compresses geography without bridging moves.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bluff, mist, and silver hush ground the opening; the hut and broken radio constrain the final act. The pillbox functions as micro-setting, its engraving serving as key and inventory. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the spy's priorities (wind on scars, snow like "sifted salt," thawing drops as percussion). Spatial choreography is clear across the bluff lip, path, and hut. The environment pressures choice: the codes must be written in snow, the radio repair depends on the coil hidden in the pillbox.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ford, fog, rain gutters, and ferry chain create a coherent pressure-system that constrains the crossing and mirrors the protagonist's internal process. The yarn needle and embroidered linen function as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and charging the final repair of the coachman's map. Sensory detail is purposeful: "spindrift serenity," the chain groaning "like memory," beads condensing on iron. The far bank as "an answer, not a warning" reweights prior material without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    The oasis is vividly particular: "collapsed hives and brittle windbreaks," "trough," "honey house," and the lantern glass all anchor spatial choreography and constrain action (the narrator sits, lifts, mends, places objects with clear blocking). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("the hush so complete that the memory of bees seemed louder than wind"). The faded lantern glass functions as micro-setting, constraining the narrator's discovery of braided timelines and charging the final image when placed on the mended bowl's rim. Scorched wasteland and distant kiln smoke supply temporal and atmospheric pressure without catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    The harbor, fire escape, stairwell, and roof are spatially coherent and pressure the protagonist's plan: the padlock blocks access, tar holds the tooth, the transom permits light passage. The gauge tooth (micro-object as setting) constrains the key choice—opening the lock—and charges the final image with its promise to rust. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered: "tar that keeps yesterday's sun," "smell like the hull." The threshold from stairwell gloom to rooftop spill drives Theo's crossing and Mrs. Gallo's hum. No occupational excess; canal-lock detail anchors character without sprawl.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.2)
    The tidal library, floating shelves, and stone circle hum create vivid atmosphere, but function primarily as backdrop; the sundial is used twice (angling to open the door, final placement as beacon), offering modest constraint. Spatial choreography is loose—aisles, wing, threshold blur without precise positioning. Detail is lyric and dense but does not narrow tactical options in a legible way at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lily pond, south colonnade, and thrush's nest supply concrete spatial anchors and constrain the installation's choreography. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("dragonflies stitch the edges," "ribbon vibrate in the fragrant air"). The nest functions as micro-setting, charging the final image. Minor gap: the crowd's physical staging—how many, exact positions—blurs slightly during the spiral-building, though it does not break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    The studio micro-setting constrains choices throughout: grimed charts guide when to open the gate valve, the synthesis rack shapes the reply, tuned couches and milk-crate labyrinths become resonant tools, and the tower hum/vibration is felt "in our bones" during the subsonic scaffold deployment. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities (dust/coffee/solder, breath fogging the mixer, bass string moaning like weather). The quad vigils and barricades outside the glass provide spatial contrast that pressures the narrator's bridge-versus-gun stance at closure. Specificity is high (turntable bearing grease, patch bay, node over valley), and the final image—sun sliding up the tower as charts are folded—recharges the opening anchor. Choreography remains clear across moves despite the compressed climax.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.4)
    The shadowed nexus, church nave, and organ loft are rendered through selective, purpose-driven detail (fog pooling like ink, pipes as silver birches, rose window framing the square). Spatial choreography is coherent across vertical movement (ladder, loft, rail). The compass point and the organ constrain and enable the protagonist's tactics, charging the final image when the nail warms in the coat. Minor limitation: the "fallow period" as temporal setting remains atmospheric rather than tactically decisive, and some metaphors (city as tired animal) are vivid but not irreplaceable.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.9)
    The quarry functions as crucible: its "silted water without breaking the surface mirror" and submerged branch constrain Lio's investigation method and charge the final discovery. Micro-setting elements (the collapsible ash pole, the metronome, the canvas roll) are handled across multiple beats and shape tactics. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lio's prosopagnosia—he notices breath arrangement, boot tapping rhythm, and the "sweetness of algae" on fabric rather than faces. Minor gap: spatial choreography of the captain's descent and final position ("just beyond the metronome's click" then "stepped closer") could be sharper, and the quarry's physical properties (depth, rim layout) remain slightly vague when they would help anchor the girl's disappearance.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    The station's "plywood floors that never dry," intercom "coughing foreground static," and "wet animal" hum create coherent waterlogged atmosphere. The cliff face that "sweats," gulls "scissor[ing] the saturated air," and copper screws fitting the nail constrain the discovery beat and charge the samples revelation. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (station → cliff → intake → back to station). The setting pressures choices: dampness threatens journals, the intake's location/seal demands the nail, the kite array becomes the delivery mechanism for Seraphine's route.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.7)
    Setting is vivid and filtered through the narrator's cataloging habit ("gullies shaped like sleeping faces, the bruised sky"). The glass flake functions as micro-setting, constraining the search and charging the cairn-building beat. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the transition from pullout to switchback compresses geography without anchoring distance or duration. Environment shapes one key choice (placing the flake) but does not pressure earlier tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.1)
    The abandoned circus train functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: lion door, clown car, ringmaster's chair become surfaces for the bill-placement ritual. The river, rusted cars, and chalk marks supply tactile anchors. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("notes of straw and grease still hiding in the wood"). The train constrains the protagonist's final choice by offering specific surfaces and a boundary between self and neighborhood kid, satisfying the 9+ gate. Small deduction: the motel memory is gestured at but not spatially grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    The observatory dome, telescope console, and daylily-pressed telegram function as micro-setting that charges multiple beats. The telegram's copper-scented petals constrain the narrator's method (align glyphs with R Lyrae amplitudes), and the monitor's glow illuminates the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear (narrator, Mara, console, dome), though the desert temple itself stays abstract—no tactile detail of stone texture or chisel marks that would ground the inscriptions' physical discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    The orchard vortex constrains every choice: circling trees, orbiting apples, ice disk at center supply spatial pressure and resources (ice to read, rings to unbind). Micro-setting details—flat stone for the seed, shore for kneeling—anchor action. The lake's transformation from forced mirror to "winter sky and a steady woman" charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is controlled: "apples bump the shore like helmets stacked after drill" filters perception through Issa's martial lens.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt glade at dusk is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory selection ("blue hush," "murmuring loam," "storm milk quartz"). The maze clipping functions as micro-setting, constraining the narrator's action when pressed to the wrist to create a map, and the setting's "paths wake under the grass" directly alters the final convergence. Spatial choreography between narrator and girl remains coherent despite the abstract nature of their joining.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly anchored: roots between bones, pear grafted into skull's crown, moth-worn gauze lantern. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (kneeling, scribing, walking corridors). The burned tarot card functions as both object and micro-setting, warming like a coal and blinking at the climax, constraining the protagonist's choice to regraft rather than undo the bargain. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "tarry syllables," "dust of wasted afternoons," "bees in snow." The orchard's root-response to the lullaby and the pear's exhalation directly enable the regraft, elevating environment from backdrop to active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    The quarry setting actively constrains choice: Echo Bench's location and the buried gear frame the excavation plan, while the trailer's trembling desk and concrete dust anchor sensory experience. The grille cloth's weave and singe provide occupational specificity that drives recognition. Spatial choreography is clean (pit below, office above, filing cabinet with busted handle). The final image—wind through trailer vents like crowd noise—charges the ending by transforming setting into active pressure, making the valley a patient calling the narrator back.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Magnetic arbor is rendered through charged detail: iron boughs, rails that ring like bowls, chirping magnets, buried storms humming in the walkway. Micro-setting elements—the rail junction, the seed's warmth and polarity, ozone and salt in the air—constrain the ritual and charge the final image (coil cradling the fruit beside the seed). Sensory hierarchy reflects professional focus: the narrator attends to field alignment, tonal calibrations, gradients rather than景观 tourism. Spatial choreography is clean throughout (kneel at crossing, fingerwidth rotation, fruit placed back beside seed). The arbor's magnets and storm-charged lattice function as both constraint (the protagonist must align with field lines) and resource (the rails answer, enabling growth), meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping choice and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal atrium functions as micro-setting: the floor "switches languages, trading slate for ripple," the tide arrives "like a whisper," and the moon's phases directly govern the creel's behavior and the tags' singing. The bamboo creel hanging "near the door" and the "western stacks, where moonrails gleam" constrain the librarian's cataloguing actions and charge the final image when the creel is pulled from its hook and "its weave warm like skin." Sensory detail is vivid and purpose-driven (salt, tea, chalk-dust moths, frost of questions), filtered through the librarian's professional lens, and the environment pressures choices—placing tokens in the creel, smelting at the rail—meeting the 9+ quick test for constraint and closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    The crystal caves function as more than backdrop: they "breathed," crystals "rang like tuned bowls," and the stalagmite becomes the crowned focal point that enables the resolution. The pearl's warming and the shell's spiral grooves supply tactile anchors. Spatial choreography (descent, first chamber, pool, ledge, center stalagmite, corridor exit) remains clean. The environment charges the final image—"the crowned stone and the gathered hearts gave enough to see by"—meeting the 9+ gate criterion, but one or two descriptors ("warped door," "shallow pool") trend generic without POV filter.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Micro-setting (the Water Service Portal, the clogged grate, bathroom graffiti) directly constrains choice: the portal's rust and the culvert's breath guide the protagonist's confession and clearing work. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("wet coins and nettles," "mica like dragon teeth") and filtered through the POV's guilt-laden priorities. The accordion bellows patched with tape function as both object and sonic environment, recurring with reweighted meaning at closure to charge the final image. The station's spatial choreography (platform, waiting room, bathroom, freight gate portal) tracks cleanly across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    The confidence man's watch constrains multiple choices: its reversed cycle teaches patience, produces pulses the fog translates, and times the propagation delays that unlock the door. The mist and glowing library micro-setting charge the final image (the library sighs, relieved to return to silence). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the dreamer's veil-mediated perception. Spatial choreography across harbor, marsh, and library remains coherent. The watch and fog function as micro-setting elements that constrain tactics and reweight the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.1)
    The velvet observatory is sensuously specific ("night smells of wool and cosmic dust," "damp velvet") and the violin's ice-crystal materiality directly enables the climax—it must melt to fulfill the pledge. Micro-setting (desk fern, night jasmine, courtyard vines, coffee saucers) functions as active infrastructure: plants propagate the music "root to root, leaf to leaf," making the setting a co-agent in the closure. The river at dawn provides the spatial goal and baptismal closure image. Sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist's professional-mystic lens (scent, texture, light over generic visuals).

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.1)
    The grotto's physical details constrain action: "stalactites held beads of condensation that chose not to fall" establishes the uncanny stillness; the aurora "leaned nearer" as an active environmental pressure during the ritual. The emerald chip's warmth and the meltwater washing are tactile and purposeful. The final image—"the arch where aurora meets rock"—charges the closure by grounding the protagonist's vow in a specific spatial threshold. Sensory selection filters through professional focus (aligning eyelids, trimming the brush from her own hair) without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto is vividly particular: umbral, fog-fed, scalloped clay basins, spruce on the rim. Spatial choreography is clear—west-facing, above clouds, basins catching beads. The hairpin functions as micro-setting, constraining and enabling multiple choices (stirring soil, marking seasons, tying the tendril). The setting subtly guides the caretaking choices through access to fog, the rim for thinking, and the protective umbra. Sensory selection is filtered through the narrator's patience-focused lens (vineyard hush, sleeves brushing, beads singing), and the grotto charges the final image by supplying the tendril and shade where the hairpin becomes clasp.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    The lighthouse stairwell, wind-drafted chimes, and lantern window create concrete pressure: the chimes are active instruments that constrain Mara's process. The hollow mirror shard held to light paints "her cheek with sea and her eyes with tide maps," making the setting material to perception. The cloak's "salt stiff canvas" and the gull that "pretends to be a thought" anchor sensory particulars. The chimes constrain the method and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test, but minor descriptive density in the opening ("oysters speaking in coded clicks") occasionally tilts toward ornamental lyricism without adding spatial clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating platform, magnetic grotto, and iron sand constrain observation and charge the final image; the setting is not mere backdrop but a teaching mechanism. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("iron sand tremble into lines," "starlight," "sycamore hush"). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting actively shapes the lesson and the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment charge the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    The canyon's bone towers and acoustic properties constrain every choice—the narrator cannot move, must read echoes, must use the arrowhead as tuning wedge. The gulls function as living instruments that annotate resonance, and their movements directly shape the narrator's appraisal. The micro-setting of the arrowhead warming in the palm charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the abstract stakes, and the environment evolves causally as the pulse moves through the "hollow seam."

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    The spire's micro-setting—frozen archways, hanging garden, cracked quartz pedestal—constrains choice by requiring mist walking and frames the protagonist's approach to the keystone. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: "silence pressed against my ears like a gloved hand," "beading on my lashes, teaching me how slow seeing could be." The keystone's "lingering luminance" charges the final image when it "remained, unpossessed yet shared." Tool (boots, pack) and body anchor spatial choreography throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sunken library is vivid and specific—"ribs scrolled with moss," "books splayed like mussels," "phonograph horn nested with eels." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: pier ladder, skiff, pilings, window entry, cabinet. The setting constrains choice by requiring breath-hold and solitary descent during the distraction of the lantern release. The recurring hotel key tag charges the final image, vibrating with "the new color steadying the world," and the wreck's "silence that hums like a closed mouth" creates distinct atmosphere. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: underwater details intensify as discovery nears, while surface details remain peripheral.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ambered observatory deck constrains multiple choices: amber residue becomes coolant, the railings provide distillation material, the deck floor hosts coin patterns that determine antenna configuration. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through ritual attention: "room brightens to old honey," "tastes of metal and honey and leaning possibility." The micro-setting (console, receiver, coil, velvet bowls) functions as active equipment that responds to inputs and shapes the final song attempt. Spatial choreography remains coherent across casting, listening, distilling, and singing moves.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.1)
    The observatory's cold stone, echoing dome, cracked prism, and projector constrain the naming ritual and charge the final image (lexicon burning). Body and tool (prism tilted, tape unspooled) enable crystallization through scattered light. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: mica dust, frost on eyelids, burnt glass. The atlas page functions as micro-setting, grounding each naming act.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sapphire viaduct's slag-glass filtering dawn, the weeping seam, and dripping rates constrain Nera's entire method and charge the final image. The bell's bronze warmth, the rope "thin as regret," and the seam opening "where the light turns thick as sap" are sensory, specific, and purposeful. Micro-setting (the arch's hairline crack, puddle water, drops by breath and heartbeat) directly shapes tactics. The body and small objects (bell, line, clapper) function as tactile anchors throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.1)
    Setting detail is specific and purposeful: "porches reappear as ribs of wood," "church steeple shows its knee," silt and bleached fences ground the resurfaced town. The ridgeway and drained street constrain movement and discovery. The sapphire label and photographs function as micro-setting objects that charge the final memorial line. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the mirrored water in the closing beat ties environment to the dominant stake of memory preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    The orchard behind the kaleidoscopic waterfall is anchored early and charges multiple beats: the waterfall refracts "shade into music," guiding her breathing; the bark receives her chalk ratios; the stonefruit-and-wet-iron scent steadies her. The frozen dew crystal on moss serves as micro-setting, constraining her ritual and supplying the reflective surface for the murmuration. The setting directly enables the answer she seeks and recurs in the final image as she wraps the crystal "the way her mother had wrapped bruised pears."

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    The arbor's wooden arteries, ropewalk, and upper court ground spatial choreography cleanly; the parachute buckle and webbing constrain the rescue attempt and charge the final image ("a small bright vow"). Sensory selection reflects urgency: during the crisis, the narrator counts gusts and hears the off-key percussion of the failing strap; afterward, wind smooths its ruffled sheet. The nocturnal arbor functions as micro-setting, pressuring every choice through verticality and exposure. Idiom ("the hungry clasp that must be fed") is consistent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating dojo and brain-in-jar are vivid and purposeful, constraining the hearing's emotional stakes. The chalk line strike and fan kata use spatial choreography to dramatize opposition. However, the broader setting—torn horizon, sky-as-court—remains largely metaphoric backdrop rather than a resource that alters tactics. The body and jar anchor the closure moment (palms on glass, chimes stilling), meeting the micro-setting standard for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tunnel functions as active constraint: its acoustics shape the ritual, oils of hands "pressed against this world" anchor grief's history, and the space forces tactical choices (blower placement, singing into turbulence). The pull cord handles recur with charged specificity, acting as both tool and somatic anchor. The final night smell ("wet iron and pears, the sort that bruise if you stare too hard") charges the closure image with tenderness and cost. Micro-setting (carburetor, manholes, cold pipes) pressure the method and outcome without postcard drift.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.1)
    The frozen garden constrains movement and choice throughout: the mist-circle as entry ritual, the hoarfrost words, the bench "glossed with rime" where waiting occurs, and the sundial reset that opens the inward path. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("glittering needles that drew maps on our tongues"), filtered through the protagonist's stance. The pendant's crystal eye and the comma of ice function as micro-setting tools that alter what can be seen and accessed. The final corridor of frost—"trees grew from the margins of glimmer"—charges the closure by making the threshold spatially real, and the recurring "interiorizing exteriors" method ties body to weather in a way that affects tactics (tucking mist into sleeves, pulling cold inside).

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ember nexus is vividly anchored with sensory specifics (copper inlays, ashwood, retorts, porcelain crucible, wind-warped bellows, five furnace flues) and the frozen-bloom motif recurs to charge the ending ("a flower the color of banked coals and morning ice"). The crozier's physical transformation—sanded, broken, rewoven with wire and frost—directly shapes the alchemist's method and the final symbolic victory. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (ring of flues, approaching boots over clinker), though the exact mechanics of pressing the frost-flower to the wound and the loop materializing remain slightly abstract. The mills and cathedral clock are introduced early and reappear at closure, but their physical relationship to the nexus is never anchored, leaving the geography somewhat floating.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    The gorge-suspended city supplies constant physical constraint (catwalk danger, guy-line tension during perigee) and the coupling's materiality (bottle caps, microwave horn) grounds the fantasy practicality. The map traced on railings directly enables the bucket descent, charging the closure. Sensory selection is purposeful: "serenely electric" glow, water that "sounded like lullabies," hush swallowing clatter. Minor gap: the cave's interior and the bucket mechanism remain abstract when tactile detail would sharpen the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.9)
    The spectral grotto constrains the resolution—only here can the parallel timelines be merged—and its starlight, ripples, and breathing water supply the patterns poured into the hourglass. The empty hourglass functions as micro-setting, a recurring object that charges the final image by holding the "patterns" and turning "without hands." Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "starlight threads down through holes in the ceiling as if the sky trawled for souls." The ferry's transformation from "suggestion of benches and ropes, shimmering with absence" to "the deep shine of yes" tracks causally and spatially.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.1)
    The optical illusion gallery is vividly specific—"suspended staircase that appears to descend and ascend simultaneously," "vanishing corners," "taut lines and hovering doors"—and the sinew thread as micro-setting constrains Mara's movements and charges the closure moment when she ties the final knot. The rigging "hums" and composes paths, actively shaping visitor and protagonist choices. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The environment is purpose-driven and integrated into action rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The benthic city is vividly particular: domes that "hum like a held breath," corridors ringing "like filtered bells," a cracked dome patched "to a scumble that catches light." The projector and chain link function as micro-setting tools that constrain the method. The monorail terminus dome and the pressure gap above the ridge supply spatial constraints that shape the ascent route. The setting charges the final image—rising through water toward starlight—but does not force a mid-story tactical pivot, keeping it just below the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting that constrains choices: fog obscures Eli, fountain breath and glass-panel tick signal danger, distance to doors and planters choreographs the escape. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (hearing aid pulses sharpen, spatial awareness narrows during exit). The body and the hearing aid operate as setting-equivalents that charge the final image (rain begins "in gentle syllables" mirroring the aid's drum). Spatial choreography remains clean across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    The caves, tidal clock, and steel console constrain every choice: Ivo waits for exact slack, tracks the siren's rise, and must leave before flooding. The mica electroscope and copper housings are handled across beats and their physical states (chill, warmth, charge) alter tactics. Sensory detail is filtered through professional priorities—air currents, cable hum, mineral taste—and accumulates pressure without tourism. The micro-setting (body as instrument: cupped ear, hands warming copper) and recurring objects (mugs, thermos, canned cold) charge the final image when spray and steam mark the threshold. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.4)
    The observatory dome, snow, icicles, consoles, and broken mug are vivid and purposeful; the shard becomes a recurring object. Spatial choreography is coherent (protagonist kneels, touches shard to lens). The setting constrains the protagonist's initial isolation and provides the spilled-ink map and the dome's "whale note," which charges the middle beat. However, the corridor itself is a metaphorical construct—wind and snow properties are asserted ("where wind drops and the snow forgets to bite") rather than tested on the page, slightly reducing the setting's role at closure. Micro-setting (body, tool) is present but does not decisively shape the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bone towers, canyon rim, and tunnel of echoes supply vivid, purposeful anchors that constrain the protagonist's movements and method. Spatial choreography remains clear: dusk entry, deeper progression guided by bird-patterns, wire-and-diamond tethering to bone. The flawed diamond functions as micro-setting (a tool whose warmth and thirst shape the narrator's choices), and the final image of copper seeping into bone charges the closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the narrator's attentive idiom, though some descriptions ("a canyon of endless echoes") edge toward generic lyricism without fresh particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    The underground garden is vividly particular: "roots dangled from brick ribs," "pollen began to orbit Dani's jars," spores with "gravitationally playful" rings. The setting constrains choice—the herbalist's space permits the arrowhead-singing ritual and houses the phone that translates the cryptid. Micro-setting objects (clay jar, willow branch, valerian sacks) are handled on the page and enable the final release. Spatial choreography remains clear across the single continuous scene, and the frostbitten/breath-under-ice motif charges the atmosphere without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is purposeful and constraining: the sky-bridge/orchard vertical geography shapes the descent action, the maintenance ladder provides tactical access, and the orchard's iron rails become the literal object of resistance. The locust shell functions as micro-setting—a small object that constrains the violin's tone and charges the final action. Sensory detail is filtered through the violinist's professional attention ("the grain of dusk, resonantly soft") and the enchanted-mechanical world is internally consistent (brass leaves, copper-threaded granite, actuarial light). The statues' physical transformation (unbuckling greaves, joints blooming moss) grounds the fantastical elements in tactile consequence. The setting directly enables the protagonist's method and the orchard's response supplies the story's central turn.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt arcade functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: it is the agreed meeting point, the visible border space, the site where rain and crowd pressure converge. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven: "bricks sweat with salt from the long-evaporated sea," "drones beaded by a sudden, polite rain." Spatial choreography is coherent across the mailman's routes, the bridge crossing, and the gathering. The arcade's recurring presence charges the final image where the storm rises "on its own" and fills the space with "rain and laughter and careful tears."

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    The abandoned circus train is vividly realized through specific anchors—lion cage, cookhouse car, tent car with moths, calliope swallowing sand, carousel horses "hung like stilled constellations"—and the hidden oasis supplies the halo fragment that drives the climax. Spatial choreography is clean, and sensory detail (misting hush, wind bells, crabgrass chimneys) is filtered through the carpenter's attentive perspective. The environment constrains the search and charges the final image, satisfying the Q3 9+ quick test and earning high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    The library's hyperbolic geometry constrains movement and choice throughout: "I walked the translation, turning left forever and arriving gently at right" is not decorative but alters spatial logic. The scarf functions as micro-setting, catching in the atlas hinge and warming to cue memory. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered: "pencil shavings and rain on windows," "cedar and lightning." The final image—"every book becomes precisely heavier"—charges closure by reweighting the physical environment with the librarian's new obligation.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The whispering archipelago functions as micro-setting and atmosphere: islands "speak in a different whisper," canals "sniff of rust and sleep," and Sibilant Key's "prayer-flat rock" grounds the tripod, constraining the photographer's stance. The palette—salted white with use—serves as both tool and memory anchor, charging the final act of angling it "to the sky" to guide the shot "to mercy." Spatial choreography across ferrying, beaching, and the gallery pier remains clear. The environment shapes the narrator's methods and the closure image of the unlatched door.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the freestanding door "welded to moonlight," the valley of blackthorn, the "shadowed nexus under starlight" with crickets "like clerks keeping sly records." The star functions as micro-setting—its breathing dissorients the valley into new alignment, directly enabling the door's opening. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the locksmith's craft-focused perception (tumblers, grain, keyhole "as small as the pupil of a startled animal"). The nexus constrains the scholar's choice spatially and atmospherically, and the final image charges the ending as "the valley settled into the dignity of having witnessed a release."

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sunken greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks constrains the protagonist's movements (diver caution, breath management, fin strokes) and charges the final image (shipwrecks as "old choir lofts"). Micro-setting details—silt geometry, panes rhyming with portholes, antique ladder—are filtered through professional/personal perception and recur with reweighted meaning. The fairy ring mushroom under the ladder becomes a spatial anchor that enables the climactic step-through. Sensory hierarchy reflects diver priorities (water taste, light motes, peppermint sting). The environment is not postcard backdrop but an active constraint and mnemonic field.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    The library setting actively constrains choices: dust that "preferred to be archived," the lectern that gates the ritual, the "most forgiving aisle" that unlocks only at the specified hush. Micro-setting details—glass jar warmth, tea bowl geometry, charcoal stub—function as tools that enable tactics. The playground swing timeframe is integrated spatially (squealing swings, hush that tugs windows) and charges the final image by looping back to the forgotten library's timelessness.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.9)
    The parapet and waterfall anchor spatially, and mist, roots, and seed function as micro-setting elements that enable key moves (door in foam, bridge of roots, planting). Sensory detail is lyric but often ornamental—"moss closed its starry mouths"—without altering tactics. The heirloom seed constrains the final choice (planting it charges closure), meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Spatial choreography across the bridge and back remains legible, and the orchard's echo-double supplies a second pressure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prism sanctuary is vividly rendered—"glass ribs arc above me, refracting the moon into patient geometry"—and the setting actively shapes the ritual: "the sanctuary listens, and what it gathers becomes gravity." The coffer "under the quartz floor" and the net "like a topographical cloud" supply tactile anchors that constrain the restorer's method. The final image—"the stars lean closer to the prisms"—charges the closure with environmental collaboration. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the setting's function as silent witness elevates the tone without becoming postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting constrains choice throughout: the tear's "pale crescent" guides the search, the panel's draft reveals the mechanism, the narrow chamber frames the pollen-and-soot maps as fragile discoveries requiring care. Micro-setting (the handle "like a tongue dried mid word," the ribbon trembling in draft) charges tactical choices. The fresco vault functions as "an ear, cupped to the hill" that teaches the protagonist's approach—whispering rather than forcing. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: salt blooms "as if rain had been arguing with the past," lichens "conquered," the hissing hinge "asking whether I would listen first." The final image of wheat-paste stitching and unsealed panel directly reflects setting's influence on closure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sunken library constrains every choice: brass numbers "flowered into green," books "spined like fish," the ribs groan under pressure, all filtering through a diver's embodied attention. The snow globe functions as micro-setting, its "skin of pitting" and slowing flakes providing a tactile anchor and a recurring constraint that charges the final image when released upward. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities—catalogue shelves, copper wire mechanics, tape heads—and the spatial choreography (threshold → doorway → central table → catalog shelves → exit, ascent, safety stop) tracks cleanly across all moves. The setting is irreplaceable: no other location could supply the transmission, the child's stub, and the buoyancy metaphor simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.9)
    The misty courtyard supplies concrete constraints: the flower press bolt plate grounds static, the parapet clamps stencils, and the ghost manifests as debug LEDs and dew-line replies. The timeframe (lightning/thunder interval) creates a live pressure window, and the copper lead + ozone-charged petals function as micro-setting elements that enable the encoding. The final image—bolt plate left "like a key, so the next storm knows where to knock"—charges the setting with recurrable ritual logic and constrains future visits to storm conditions. Sensory detail is selective (ozone crackle, mist carrying pigment, constellation of LEDs) and filtered through craft priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    The elevator cage and ten-floor ascent constrain all choices—time pressure is the story's skeleton. Micro-setting details (bulb's glare refracting through goggles, hoarfrost corridor, unlit keyhole) charge key beats and the final image. The forgetter room functions as both spatial destination and thematic anchor, altering the errand's meaning. Sensory selection is purposeful: "rattled," "creaking," "knocked its old knuckles" ground the spire's physicality while "letters rose like frost ferns" bridges object and perception. The icebound setting mirrors emotional stasis and the act of preservation-through-burial. Gate satisfied: environment (elevator, forgetter room) shapes tactics and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    The gondola micro-setting constrains every choice (altimeter, burner, rail) and charges the final image ("papered in pencil dust and star grit"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: fogging telescope lens, cooler gradient felt through fingers, ozone scent anticipated on the ribbon. The brass telescope recurs with reweighted meaning (heat fog clears to stars, then frames the "dim braille" of absence). Spatial choreography is coherent across all moves.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tree-trunk library functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the coin map cross sits "where the trunk widens, where the guild carved its first shelf," and the wood is "warm despite the cold," agreeing to remember one more sky. Sensory hierarchy reflects the artist's priorities (dust like pollen, ceilings that breathe, plaster folds over human faces). The spatially specific coin-to-wall translation (each spiral points toward beam, hinge, seam) charges the final image. Spatial choreography (chemistry shelves, botanical index spine, nested tin, wall orientations) tracks cleanly across all beats.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.1)
    The airship's groaning beams, brass bell, and copper-thread net are handled across beats and pressure choices (climb, lower net). The hopscotch board in the cargo hold constrains the heading solution, charging the final third. Sensory hierarchy (cumin/oil, pressure on teeth, hum in ribs) reflects priorities. However, spatial choreography is vague: the net's proximity to the luminance, the airship's altitude relative to murmurations, and the apprentice's station during the capture remain unclear, weakening the micro-setting's tactical role at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The frozen library is vivid and purposeful: hoarfrost glazes corridors, stairwells ring like goblets, the hall of mirrors is hauntingly bright and layered like dawn. The setting constrains his work (frost must not be startled; hinges trap silence) and charges the closure image ("the library hovered like a lantern fuller than night"). Micro-setting elements—the canvas roll, the small bottle of oil, the gears with moons—function as tactile anchors that ground abstract action. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout, and the scent of brass and pine, the chime drifting through stacks, and maps that breathe all support the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating rock arches constrain the relay choreography and shape the acoustic solution (each arch answers with "a throat"), meeting the 9+ gate requirement for environment. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "woolen body of vapor," "belly of a moth," "dust braiding into faint spirals of silver." The bell itself functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and charged at closure. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the relay sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lighthouse interior is vivid and purposefully filtered through the adjuster's ritualistic attention: panels, pendulum, lens, pane of hush, puppet on the finial. The storm glass, nested lens rings, and brass finial constrain the sequence of actions and charge the final image when "the beacon turns not to warn but to welcome." Sensory detail (salt taste, surf as applause, burn of old oil) is selective and voice-consistent, anchoring the closure in concrete physicality.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, and terraces constrain every tactic: shaking branches to redirect shadows, snapping reeds to shape dust impressions, flicking the nut into bird gears. The nut itself (micro-setting object) charges the closure when passed to the youngest stranger. Sensory selection reflects urgency: "copper and thyme," "penny bright mourning." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across ledges and switchbacks. The orchard's voice and the birds' patrols pressure the protagonist's method throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    The braided ravine constrains Mira's bridge design (filaments respond to current, require mutual step) and charges the final image (streams braiding pressures into one mouth mirrors the sibling reconciliation). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: froth patterns, hissing water, blue hour frogs. The chrysalis functions as micro-setting/recurring object, tied to her wrist and released at closure. Spatial choreography is clean during the bridge-crossing. Minor: the field spectrometer and adhesive-sketching remain tools without pressing choice-impact; they add occupational color but don't alter tactics in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glass orchard library, cloud sea, and moonlight jar anchor the setting vividly and early. The counter itself becomes micro-setting: moonlight pooling creates a "silver river" that the protagonist pours "into any gap," and later the incised line on the counter opens a door—both constrain and enable key choices. The booth's spatial choreography (customer rising from clouds, counter transactions, jar corking) remains clear throughout. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (cold grammar, frost seal, wet absence), filtered through the vendor's professional lens.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting constrains multiple choices: rain pools guide the chef east, the coral pavilion's ice provides the ingredient, the brazier and copper bowls are tactile tools that shape the cooking ritual. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—"petrichor," "slick filigrees," "cathedral of ribs and hollows whispering frost"—filtered through the chef's professional and sensory priorities. The micro-setting (body, brazier, bowls) charges the closure by grounding the ritual physically. Minor slip: the transition from dunes to pavilion compresses spatial choreography slightly, though it remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.1)
    The astronomical clock tower and grain elevator are rendered with vivid, purpose-driven detail: bevel gears, hoppers, augers, pelts of oats. Sensory selection reflects Mara's POV (brass and paper smells, zodiacal face tilting). The cuckoo clock weight functions as micro-setting when lowered as plumb line, constraining tactics. Spatial choreography—tower, catwalk, elevator—tracks cleanly. The final image of children testing the span like swallows charges the environment with consequence, lifting the category despite some generic lyric phrasing ("vigorous tender").

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.1)
    The moonlit canyon functions as more than backdrop: the trembling earth provides a physical correlate to the narrator's internal excavation, and the mirror placement "at an angle that doubled the moon" becomes a tool that constrains the experiment's progress. The periscope mirror charges the final image by reflecting "three moons where one hung," unlocking the seam to the river-sensor memory. Sensory detail is filtered through the engineer's priorities (circuit whispers, quarter-turn precision, theta-wave dials), and the canyon's "quaking reverie" recurs to frame both opening and closure. The kit, headband, coils, and mirror are handled with tactile specificity that grounds the lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.1)
    The serpentine grotto is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail: "ferns pressed to the vault swam with spores," "grooves like the ribs of a sea creature turned to stone." Spatial choreography during the inverted walk is coherent. The grotto constrains choice—only accessible during gravity inversion, the protagonist must drum a cadence to open the panel—and the tokens' location in the upturned lake charges the final image. Minor gap: the folio's physical handling is mentioned but its constraint on action remains thin.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grove's sensory detail is vivid and selective: "thin green light," "small gray pipes," "quills slicked with dew." The porcelain insulator functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—its refusal to hurry dictates the protagonist's tempo ("I match its refusal"). The wire-bark-insulator system anchors spatial choreography and charges the closure image: the protagonist leaves the insulator "to dream of sky," a purposeful release that reweights the grove's continuance. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency; during strumming, the protagonist notices exhale warming wire and glaze cooling thumb, details filtered through the tactile focus of the work.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.1)
    The magnetic nexus supplies the humming rail, drooping needle, and iron plate that anchor every chess move; the basalt stone and the aurora guide piece placement. The environment constrains method—correlating shifts with migrating birds, wires between lampposts—and the final rail-song charges closure. Spatial choreography (parapet, guard below, back rank) remains clear. Temporal cues (twilight thinning, last light leaching) track pressure without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    The shadowed workshop under stars, the bench with coils and rescued clasp, and the approaching fireworks outside form a coherent micro-setting that constrains action (tuning frequencies, sipping tea, writing notes) and charges the ending when the sky "rehearses endings." Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the narrator's poetic idiom; spatial choreography remains clear despite the lyric density. The clasp as recurring object constrains the protagonist's method and reappears in the closure beat, satisfying the high-band requirement that setting or object charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    The treetop village is vivid and purposeful—rope bridges, swaying platforms, and the chosen "platform that swayed hardest" directly constrain Mara's choice and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is strong (olfactory filter dominates), and micro-setting (the swaying platform, cedar baskets) functions as setting at this length. The piece meets the 9+ gate by having environment constrain a choice and shape the closure, but scattered phrases ("wildflower hush," "tide's thought") occasionally drift into poetic abstraction without grounding in concrete spatial choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    The orchard planet, floating arches, inverted gravity, and upward-running water are vividly established and constrain every choice: the protagonist launches when pears loosen, navigates by water flow, and works inside a root-sphere accessible only during inversion. The broken arrow tip (micro-object-as-setting) heats and leaps at the wound, charging the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through urgency ("drips crawl upward along my arms like silver insects") and the setting's rules are learned through action. The arches' singing and the root-sphere's light-and-sap interior provide both atmosphere and causal scaffolding for the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    The container maze functions as setting and antagonist: it funnels wind, traps gusts, constrains the investigator's path. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt, rust, soot V, flapping crate door), filtered through forensic attention. The final beat—gust on schedule, grid holds—proves the setting has been tamed, charging the closure. Spatial choreography is clean; the environment shapes tactics (chalk arrows, anemometer readings) and supplies the conceptual repricing. The port breathes, and the investigator learns to breathe with it.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ice cavern is vividly rendered with "veins loosened their centuries" and "ribs glowed," and the aurora functions as both atmosphere and tactical guide ("I stepped where green asked, where purple hushed"). The amber music sheet and bells are handled objects that constrain choices—"fossil bubble a syllable, each trapped leaf a rest"—and the cavern's spatial logic (above/below, sculptor/bell-ringer) remains coherent. The setting charges the final image: the hush "curled beside me" in a space "where ice remembers rivers." Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) all constrain on-page action, meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "mist stitched," "dried river scribbled runes," "avalanchingly quiet" all anchor the canyon setting through POV filter. The driftwood markers constrain the protagonist's directional thinking, and the flute's gilded threads and reed construction charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean across camp, gorges, and the loom-corridor. Minor limitation: the Thunder-echo range functions more as poetic backdrop than a pressure that alters tactics; the environment enables but does not force a key choice. To reach 9+, the setting would need to narrow options more aggressively at a closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.1)
    The Topaz workshop, halo fragment, and vanishing stars anchor the setting and recur across beats. The fragment is handled twice (held in palm, left on press) and the stars provide a ticking clock. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice—characters move through the space without spatial friction, and the press mechanics remain atmospheric rather than tactical. The piece meets the micro-setting allowance but does not reach the 9+ gate because no environmental detail forces a trade-off or charges the final image with constraint-based cost.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway pressures movement and supplies the cairn marker for the singer encounter; the narrowing blade-point where the woman waits spatially enacts the story's tightening. The dragonfly-wing pendant functions as micro-setting, vibrating sympathetically to constrain choices (extends encounters, must be released). Sensory detail is purposeful—thyme and bread scents, frost-glinting shawl—and filtered through the courier's attention. The ridge itself becomes an active presence ("leans closer, listening") that charges the final image without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    The quartz arbor functions as crucible: ribs overhead refract light into auroras, charging the ritual space. The car—ancient sedan, frost-filmed windows, trunk full of history—supplies tactile constraint and becomes the vessel for communion. Mara's prism refracts frost into color on quartz, a micro-setting chain that shapes every beat. The final image—keys set down softly—extends object-as-setting into the narrator's kitchen, proving the world has changed. All sensory choices serve pressure and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    The orchard and bamboo forest ground the piece early and recur with specificity: fruitless branches, bamboo whispering, moonbeams stippling fabric. The jigsaw edges and amber bead function as micro-setting elements that constrain the spinner's ritual choices. The final image—orchard sighing, dropping a pale leaf—charges the closure by signaling regeneration. Spatial choreography (blanket, frame, throat, wrist) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    The orchard planet's floating arches and mine shafts constrain tactics throughout: the protagonist must enter shafts, tie silk around cracks, hum through tunnels as wind organs, and the tremor forces a wall-press that tests resolve. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through blacksmith perception: "cold iron," "grooves" worn by carts, powder drift "like white moths." The environment evolves causally—arches stop slouching, floating rock grows polite—and charges the closure image (trees teaching children to listen for held breath in stone). Minor gap: the spatial relationship between orchard surface and underground shafts could be more precisely choreographed during transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    The repair bay is rendered through evocative, POV-filtered detail: "ribcage," "rusted gantries," "thermal tides," coolant smelling of "mint and burned dust." The green glass shard functions as a micro-setting object that constrains choice—wedged into a seam, it refracts a beam that reveals the log and enables the unsealing. Spatial choreography (concrete lip, maintenance cradle, gantry climb) remains coherent and the sensory hierarchy (taste, smell, vibration) reflects the protagonist's professional priorities. The setting directly enables the climactic action and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    The haunted lantern room functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the narrator goes "when the wick guttered," the panes "remember heat," the space "held the dark like warm water." The jar, stones, and sea glass become tactile anchors that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the skipper's professional eye: "seams on a fuel drum," "the way a keeper laced his boots." The setting's emptying (sketches taken down, automation pending) supplies the pressure that drives the protective ritual. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the climb and the floor-level ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lighthouse, its glass lantern wick, balcony, and bay form a micro-setting that constrains her choices throughout: she must "unspool the glass lantern wick, cooling it in brine," and the beam's mechanics (total internal reflection) shape her tactics. Sensory detail is filtered through her custodial lens ("the night smelled like ozone and library paste") and the environment charges the final image when she rewraps the wick. The setting is indispensable to both pressure and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating tea house constrains movement and charges atmosphere throughout. The blue morpho wing functions as micro-setting, pressuring perception at three distinct beats and charging the final image when carried down the path. Sun trails supply a recurring motif that guides both method and closure. Sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist's post-transplant hyperawareness (pulse, rhythm, breath). The valley-mist anchors tone and spatial logic consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tower, maze corridors, parapet, and encircling forest are vivid and purposeful: moonlight heals hairline regrets, dream dust collects at turns, the storm pauses to consider, trees flash "green radiographs" and hold maps. The sextant's cracked mirrors and rusted arc constrain the method (broken sight still knows how to point), and the rooftop setting enables the trees' answer. Sensory detail—"beaded curtain of patience," "pepper and rain," "leaves rubbed"—is filtered through the narrator's maintenance-worker idiom and supports the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.1)
    The greenhouse setting constrains action throughout: mica must be "peeled gently," roots "braid faster" under song, trees "curl into themselves" when the window fails. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the keeper's craft—"sap brightening," "fruits exhaling cold sugar," "smell old seaweed and gun oil." The mica window functions as micro-setting, returning at key beats to enable the climactic thread-gathering. Spatial choreography remains clear (inside greenhouse, doors open to village, cloth climbs rafters and spills outward), and the endless-night constraint charges the final image when "the horizon shakes off its winter cowl."

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    The laundromat-as-threshold and the driftwood table function as micro-settings that constrain Mara's journey and charge the closure: the humming dryers teach the world's hidden rules, and the table's "river scars" anchor her realization about harbors. Sensory selection is purposeful (paper/wool/patience, "air tasted") and filtered through Mara's craft-oriented POV. Spatial choreography remains clear across the threshold crossing and library interior. The midnight frame and "linted moons" in her pockets at the end tie setting detail to the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting is vivid and specific: cracked fountain, koi tiles "more powder than color," shells from the riverbank, wisteria and ivy. The tea house constrains action (pruning, sweeping tatami) and charges the final image (the chalk name revised by dew, the shell pocketed as anchor). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. Minor slip: the courtyard's spatial choreography during the group work is occasionally vague, but the micro-setting (bell, kettle, broom) functions as pressure and closure apparatus.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frozen library is vividly rendered ("cathedral of shelves and frost-bitten ladders," "quartz hush," "stairs filled with powder like hourglasses tipped on their sides") and sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The magic lantern, brass sensors, and hoarfrost-laminated catalog cards constrain the measurement method and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (Observation Alcove, atrium ice, dome). The setting pressures the narrator's task—cold threatens the library's "lungs," avalanches sigh outside—and the dome's "low glow" answers the narrator's test in the closing beat, making environment essential to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rotting pier, swells sighing beneath planks, bucket of eels, swollen crate with orange-blooming nails—all charge the negotiation and constrain movement (the boat horn discourages his bolt). The fob becomes micro-setting, handled across beats and charging the final image when it "hung quiet, curiously steadfast, as if holding open a breathing door." Sensory selection reflects urgency: nail-against-nail, breath swallowing, gull yawns. The market's salt "stayed in me" ties setting to closure. Easily clears the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lavender bluff under aurora is vivid and signal-rich; the aurora "drinking star milk" and the kettle's private rain are sensorially specific. The tin ring functions as micro-setting, constraining perception (taste-as-direction) and charging the convergence beat when flavors "lock into place like gears." Spatial choreography at the crest is clear, and the forest-election frame (pollen, leaf angles, lichen counters) feels purposeful. The aurora swallows and rewrites weather, directly enabling the closure image; environment shapes the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.1)
    The cave functions as both crucible and studio: crystals that "remember," the scarf that warms, the tin that smells of "iron and slow, reliable rain" all constrain and enable the final drawing act. Spatial choreography (ladder, niche, ledger, pedestal) remains clear, and sensory detail ("wet flint and old sketches," "crystals purpling like a pre-dawn bruise") is filtered through the artist's perceptual bias. The cave's acoustic memory (echo/chime) directly charges the closure image, making the setting indispensable to the ending's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    The greenhouse city functions as more than backdrop: glass ribs throw shadow-bars, toxic sky closes vents, the Ear's panels require specific interaction. The zinc plate slot and the spindle of copper vine are handled objects that constrain the protagonist's path. Sensory economy is strong—"breath of old glue rose, sharp and clean like a reprimand"—and the micro-setting (the corroded slot, the scarred panes) charges the final image. The setting directly enables closure by providing the mechanism through which lost words return.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bluff setting actively constrains and enables: "the place the bluff called its listening throat" positions the iceberg fragment to catch sunlight, and the wind tunnels through the kinetic frames. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"clouds stitched past at eye level," "iceberg fragment... a clear tooth blinking like starglass," "rivers of mist teased from stone." The sculpture's mechanics (wind, bells, water channels) are integrated into action. The setting charges the final image: the bells' ongoing vigil on the bluff above the clouds becomes the story's resonant close.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dome's honeycomb shutters, magnetic alarms, air mixers, and glass-lung collapse are tactile and specific. Micro-setting (copper shavings, mulch corridor, terracotta shards) constrains the burn choreography and charges the final planting image. Desert ions, cooled sand, and revised pole all shape the escape and closure. Sensory hierarchy stays consistent with android perception—technical precision softening into organic metaphor under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.2)
    The courtyard at dawn is anchored early with sensory particulars ("dust swirled like hush," "robes and work boots," "spoons clinking against enamel"). The aged locket constrains the midpoint turn (its half-moon sliver opens the lock), qualifying as micro-setting that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is clear (mailbox cluster, hamper behind counter, benches). The metal mailbox cluster and its third-from-left position are legibly tracked. However, the courtyard itself does not evolve or pressure the final choice; it remains a stage rather than an active constraint at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sunken laboratory constrains movement and charges every detail: algae as staves, grating as syllables, leaking bulkhead as pressure gauge, frosted tank as prison. Sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist's professional focus—valve pitches, filter wobbles, barnacles on intake—and the setting is not postcard but tactical workspace. The recurring spider-web metaphor evolves from description to structural principle, and the final hatch rise completes the spatial arc. The lab cameras, daemon, and consoles supply active resistance and enable the coded method. The body and tools (hangman's dice, journal log, hands sculling through water) function as micro-setting that shapes every beat and charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is integral: the salt crystal chamber's sensory particulars (iron-rain air, hanging crystals, brine troughs) constrain Ilya's exhumation and the gravity pockets shape his path and the flame's lean. The micro-setting (the chamber, the whale's ear bone) supplies the resources that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear across pier, chamber, and strand. The whale's vestibule and the tideline altar are not postcard description but active participants in the closure ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    The nocturnal haven, brook, reeds, and origami wing anchor the setting and appear across multiple beats. The wing constrains the summoner's method (anchored to twig, creases catch starlight, turned once to redirect the brook's thought) and participates in the closure image. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through a poetic, elevated register. Economy is sometimes lost to extended metaphor, but the setting genuinely shapes the action and charges the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rooftop garden constrains the entire encounter spatially and the meteor shower provides temporal punctuation that structures the teaching session. The seal, basil, broken tiles, and parapet are handled concretely and pressure the final act (seal impression on wrist). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "basil smelled like a green encyclopedia after the lights are out" reflects the narrator's bookish perceptual lens. The micro-setting (roof as mapped paragraphs, gutters as commas) charges the closure by making the building's "grammar" a tactile presence that the narrator commits to learning.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.9)
    The velvet garden, archive aisles, glass bell, and whispering seashell constrain choices throughout: the narrator walks paths "read like braille," touches jars in sequence, and places the shell in the oldest arch niche—each spatial beat advances the ritual. Sensory detail is purposeful ("silvered air," "hedges breathe," "dew numbers each grief") and filtered through the keeper's professional attention. The shell as micro-setting charges the final image when left "on a nail, an ear for travelers." Minor gap: the oldest arch's physical properties could be more concretely rendered to ground the climactic placement.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, stalactites, and vowstone tablets supply vivid, purposeful detail filtered through the protagonist's ritualistic attention. The heritage rose thorn and the key function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice (the thorn pricking the finger, the key revealing hidden hinges). The final image—pearl twilight, warmer sanctuary—charges the ending. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.1)
    Vivid sensory fragments ("metallic" air, "mica dust" masks, "black water") appear throughout, and the canyon as ribs, the nexus as serpentine coil, and the shell as warmed object create texture. However, spatial choreography is vague—the descent through fissures and arrival at the central rock lack clear distances or bodywork, and the final dissolution of the council ("fled sideways into the labyrinth") occurs off-camera. The shell constrains one micro-choice (where to stand, which word to release) and charges the closure image when left in sunlight, qualifying it as micro-setting that matters, lifting the score above pure description.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glacier shrine is vividly rendered with specificity ("ice flickering with candle breath," "smoke writes requests that freeze before rising") and directly shapes the encounter with the ghost. The melted snow globe functions as micro-setting, its warped interior constraining the narrator's understanding and charging the final image when its base reveals the name. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the narrator's professional lens. The setting actively participates in closure: the shrine's windows become conduits for witness-faces, and "borrowed starlight" pours through to seal the promise.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    The parapet anchors action (tea-brewing, whistle bouncing, mesh inspection) and the sluice provides spatial grounding for the discovery. The bamboo whisk functions as micro-setting and tool, constraining the philosopher's teaching method and charging the final image (drying on a nail, bristles remembering foam). Sensory detail—"stones still sweated," "slugs wrote cursive," "fireflies rose"—is filtered through the philosopher's perceptual bias (hidden patterns). The whisk and net materials shape the teaching demonstration and closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    The orchard setting is vivid and layered: "leaves like polished armor," "pool of still air where dust fell straight down as if on strings." The stillpoint functions as both atmosphere and constraint, literally altering the narrator's pulse and forcing thieves to lose their maps. The diamond mounted in the scarecrow's chest is tactile and strange, charging the final image. Micro-setting (the shack, the irrigation tanks, the scarecrow) supplies both discovery points and symbolic resonance. The radioactive dust storms remain somewhat backdrop, but the stillpoint itself decisively shapes the investigation and the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt glass portico functions as micro-setting that constrains action: it "bent lightning into indigo ladders," "hummed like a whale skull," protected the tower, and Kestrel stood beneath it to take the strike. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the narrator's lyric perspective ("thunder that smelled like pennies," "blue light smearing our cheeks"). The observatory's spatial layout is legible enough for the confrontation choreography, and recurring storm imagery charges the final image. The portico's mechanics directly affect the climax and closure, elevating the score despite some postcard abstraction in early paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    The feral loft beneath the dunes functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the ladder, oilcloth against leaks, driftwood shelves, and proximity to the beach all shape the protagonist's daily tactics and the storm's threat. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"sand whispering through the rafters like restless coins," "eelgrass," "brine from its seams"—filtered through the poet's attentive lens. The dune fox and the music box half-buried in eelgrass ground the world in tactile, lived-in specificity. Spatial choreography remains coherent across moves (loft, dune face, beach, back to loft). The storm environment directly alters action (bracing the ladder, spreading oilcloth, opening jars) and the widow's hand on the shoulder in morning light charges the final beat. Setting actively pressures and enables rather than decorating.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    The drift-ice marina pressures every choice: brittle chimes, iron pilings, and the vault's "fleshly ethereal" air anchor both atmosphere and tactical constraint. The crypt keeper's key recurs with reweighted meaning (warmth → trust, brass heartbeat → cooling metal), charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (skiff approach, hatch descent, hand on knuckles) and sensory detail modulates with urgency—salt, kelp, limestone singing. The micro-setting (vault, key, crystal cradle) functions as active constraint and closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.1)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly particularized and anchor the world. The viaduct's magnetite properties constrain tactics (iron nails, compasses) and the moon's position becomes a usable resource. The ending returns to the sanctuary, charging the frame. Micro-setting (iron slivers on slate, traces in kennels) tightens choices. However, spatial choreography across the lake and beyond the viaduct remains impressionistic; the journey to "windfallen ore" lacks tactile grounding, and the village itself is underdescribed—no sense of buildings, population scale, or material culture that would make the social shift more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tunnel setting constrains multiple choices: the jammed grate, hidden walkway, and control module with service tag all shape investigative discovery and the final decision to expose. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven (iron/mud smell, silt tide line, fingernail gouges, corrosion bloom), filtered through the investigator's professional priorities. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly—grate, panel, junction box, upward walkway—and the lantern's circle-of-light micro-setting charges the final image. The piece earns the 9+ gate: the tunnel and its material details directly constrain tactics and shape closure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    The shop's "drawers of tiny screws and velveted gears" and the ballerina spring supply concrete constraint—repair requires specific parts and steady hands. Rain "ticked the windows like patient fingertips" anchors sensory hierarchy and modulates with pressure. The clockwork heart as micro-setting charges the final image when its ticking becomes the model for sustained work. Spatial choreography remains clear. Dock for minor generic atmospherics: "vibrant hush" repeats without evolving function mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting details (acid sea, saltglass towers, rain-whale, iron spindle corroded to lace) are vivid, selective, and voice-filtered. The workshop's gears and the sea's fizzing pressure return at closure ("gears clicked into a new patience"), charging the final image. Micro-setting (cart glider, kaleidoscope bolted to gearcase) constrains transliteration method and enables the protagonist's actions. Spatial choreography (dock, sea, spindle summit) tracks cleanly across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    The archive's layered geography (Sargasso, After Echo Vaults, rack eleven slot three) constrains navigation and discovery. The patch—a physical object—is handled twice (estate-sale duplicate, overlay against rack map) and directly enables the final drive discovery. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "dry rain," "blue like tide," "anaerobic layers." The micro-setting (terminal, drawer, racks) charges the final image when the narrator shuts down and the "room keeps whispering." Spatial choreography is coherent throughout descent and return.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lighthouse orchard and shifting ice floes constrain choice throughout: floes "scraped and parted like arguments," the fracture at Gull Rook becomes the tactical goal, and the lantern's sweep stitches pan to pan in the final image. Micro-setting also functions—mirrors, crates, ladders, globe—as tools that enable action. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the peacekeeper's priorities (sap, frost on boots, slush underfoot). The environment evolves causally (ice moves, lantern turns) and the final spatial choreography (standing with globe, light sweeping coat) charges the closure image with clear geography.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    The drift-ice marina is sensuously rendered and constrains action: "ice drifted between hulls," "whole place hummed like a throat clearing," the crack that "leapt with a violin's mercy" directly enables the boy-rescue beat. Tools (magnets, ropes, skiff, parasol tip) are handled across beats and charge the final image. The setting is filtered through the narrator's tuned attention to "frequencies" and "hollow places." Minor slip: "mouth of the breakwater" and specific dock choreography occasionally blur, but the marina's pressure on choice (trawling daily, listening to pilings) is consistent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    The amber pavilion frames the encounter with seasonal specificity ("leaves gather like coins"), and the gravel road, station lights, and vine rows supply legible spatial choreography. The burned letter edge functions as micro-setting, handled twice (placed between them, traced by the traveler) and charging the closure when folded into the wallet. Sensory detail is filtered through the sentinel's professional idiom (cane-tying, pruning wounds, windbreak metaphor) and reflects urgency selectively (cold cheeks, spicy libation scent). The pavilion does not constrain a physical choice directly but anchors the philosophical exchange; the moon/frost/mist motifs support tone without forcing symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Setting elements constrain choice concretely: the load lines and ropes must be cinched "so the wind played scales instead of tearing," the kinetic parapet's pulse beneath the dunes is traced through peripheral awareness, and the clearings are conjured within the murmuring fabric. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"taste of cedar and iron on our breath," "dunes hummed like glass ribs"—and filtered through the narrator's observational stance. The micro-setting (ropes, knots, tension lines) shapes the central work of consecration. Spatial choreography remains clear across the pavilion, dunes, and the buried parapet, with the final scene anchored under stars.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.9)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: lavender steadies heartbeat, rebar becomes harp strings, the smokestack anchors lines. Sensory detail (scent, wind, rain) is filtered through the archivist's professional lens and modulates with pressure. The corridor's spatial choreography is clear across beats, and the final sycamore-to-smokestack span charges the closure image. The micro-setting (map case, fishing line, clothespins) constrains choices throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    The library is particularized—beams meeting plaster shift echo signatures, ivy through the window traced against dust, the wobbling ledger as a stage for the crystal. These details constrain the scholar's method (mapping the room, testing walls) and charge the final return of the crystal to the chandelier. Sensory selection is filtered through his priorities (sonic textures, increments of growth). Minor cap: the setting does not escalate pressure across beats; it supports rather than narrows options. Object-as-setting (crystal) qualifies and charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    The fog sculpture garden constrains tactics: statues serve as surfaces for chalk instructions, the amphitheater provides a listening hollow, and the tide shifts the driftwood markers, forcing the prophet to navigate by remnants. The recorder's warmth, the salt taste, and gravel ticking under rain create sensory specificity filtered through the prophet's priorities. Spatial choreography remains coherent across moves. The garden's tidal edges and statues ("a blade runner, a saint, a bell without a tongue") charge the final departure with mythic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lunar observatory setting constrains choices throughout: quakes threaten the shutters, dust reaches escape velocity, and the viewport frames Earth as "a candle drowned in its own glass." The leaf recording functions as micro-setting, a gravity relic that guides the repair sequence and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (bolts ping like hail, dome hums like a shell), though some phrases lean ornamental without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rooftop setting constrains choice (access granted, elevator journey) and charges the final image (sky as witness, fog and gulls). Micro-setting details (blanket, guitar on rails, monitor) anchor spatial choreography. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (orange rind, salt air, dust on vinyl). The shard as recurring object functions as setting-equivalent, constraining tactics and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    The floating observatory, brass rails, telescope shaft, and sealed pods constrain choices throughout: the isle's buoyancy depends on shadow-fuel, the corridor of pods blocks direct extraction, and the brass floor provides the ritual substrate. The clockwork key and copper pathways function as micro-setting elements that charge the final act. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("blackened like burned tea," "gears ratchating like rain"). The environment actively shapes the ritual method and the closure's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.1)
    The garden's physical elements—ivy-cleaved door, pear tree stitched with moths, root-staircase, tree-knuckle chamber—constrain the search and enable the descent. The tooth placed in the hedge fissure functions as a micro-setting object that charges the climax. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the narrator's bone-setter lens ("rush-whisper where marrow ought to hum," "bark peeled back to reveal a shallow, root-boned map"). The setting shifts from riverbank to garden to underground chamber with clear transitions and coherent spatial choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.1)
    The serpentine grotto is vividly rendered and its coiling shape, mist, and acoustic properties return across beats. The cave "shiver[s] like a sleeping animal" when the pearl is discovered, and later "seemed to inhale and exhale" during the ritual, which charges the environment as quasi-animate. Spatial choreography (tideline, hollow, threads across the grotto) remains coherent. The grotto constrains the protagonist's work (no fire, dependence on mist and reflection) and participates in the closure image, satisfying the 9+ test narrowly; however, the connection between setting and final choice is atmospheric rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.1)
    Setting is established early (abandoned data center, servers draped in moss, fans holding "honeyed hush") and constrains choices: the building's architecture guides the drip-pattern navigation, server ribs become struts for the pendant, pitted steel accepts moss grafts. Micro-setting operates effectively—body and tool (brush from cable sleeving, fishing line) shape work. The pendant as recurring object charges the final image when it catches amber light and marks time. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through the protagonist's priorities (tracing aisles, reading floor patterns). Minor gap: Miri's boots "stained a patient green" is vivid but slightly decorative; her spatial presence could be more dynamically choreographed in the sewing and tray-placement beats.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    The feral nexus, mist, vines, reed smoke, and margin collectively function as a lyric micro-setting that charges the final image and constrains movement (pages "wanted to close over my knees, then my hips, then my chest"). The seashell fragment and paper boat serve as tactile anchors that recur with reweighted meaning at closure. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"wolves of ink padded the margins," "books nodded in their stiff way"—and filtered through the novelist's watchful perception. The circle of standing books at the source provides a concrete locus for the climactic gesture. Economy is high; every detail serves the accumulative pressure and thematic resonance without postcard drift.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.4)
    The arbor and its lattice, bells, and vine provide micro-setting that constrains Lio's ritual choreography: he selects a specific tendril, fixes bells to a branch, rotates to align the shadow wheel with horizon markers. These choices shape the remedy's execution. Sensory detail is dense and purposeful—dew, sap pulse, rosy pollen—filtered through a collective observational stance. The recurring vine tendril returns with reweighted meaning at closure ("the arbor spun its own golden story"), charging the final image. No cap applied for orientation debt waiver consideration; however, the arbor itself does not sharply narrow a choice with visible consequence, limiting the score below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    The subarctic crater orchard is vivid and specific: hoarfrost on skeletal branches, leftover apples under snow, the aurora overhead. Spatial choreography is clean (grid between trees, tripod of broom handles, ice blocks). The setting constrains her work—she must clear snow, balance the plate on ice, listen to bark—and the orchard's memory (her mother's harvest songs) charges the final image of "less dead" trees. The body and tools (charred gloves, canvas bag, press bar) ground her actions throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.1)
    The marble cavern is sensorially vivid—cool breath, veined light, drip intervals—and the chime-and-reed setup offers tactile specificity. The cave's acoustic properties (echo return, reflection angles) constrain the locksmith's method and supply the tempo for the gear train, satisfying the micro-setting criterion for choice constraint. However, spatial choreography remains abstract (no clear layout or movement through zones), and the "daisy of marks" and angle measurements are gestured at rather than tracked in a way that alters tactics beat by beat. The wounded season functions as atmospheric frame but does not pressure decisions or evolve causally across the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.4)
    The bronze grotto, kerosene lamp, and dripstone are vividly anchored and return with purpose. Sensory detail is rich—"salt, pine pitch, and old rope"—and the lamp's blue flame is handled twice, shaping the middle beat and the ending stance. However, the environment does not constrain a choice with felt cost at closure; the grotto lengthens and the shingles shift, but these remain atmospheric rather than tactical. Spatial choreography is slightly opaque during the valley figure's arrival and departure. The micro-setting qualifies (lamp, beads, cord), lifting the score above mid-band, but it does not charge the final image decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    The loft setting (skylight, stove, bench, rain) constrains and enables throughout: the kettle marks time, the ash blank receives her attention, sawdust becomes textural witness. The carved cage—a micro-object functioning as setting—charges the final image by becoming the portable container she pockets. Rain modulates from "soft" to "darker, more insistent" to final "threading," tracking emotional pressure. Sensory hierarchy reflects craft priorities: scent of ash "dry and green as unfinished thunder," steam "like tigers pacing in fog." All details filter through her trained attention as lion tamer's widow.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    The kinetic lagoon supplies vivid micro-setting detail (floating lilies, skimming foam, wobbling pontoon) and the camera wheel's prongs physically interact with the lagoon surface to coax scenes. The halted carousel's "paddles poised like suspended wings" charges the final image when they catch air. Spatial choreography remains clear across the single pontoon and the distant carousel.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    The abandoned spaceport is vividly anchored with purposeful details: ringed benches cradling dust, departure boards stuttering star names, the cosmic-mouth fountain, and the carnival's leftover cable. Mara's engineering lens filters perception—she notices valves, solar arrays, and head calculations—making the setting legible through her professional idiom. The sextant piece and the fountain both constrain her choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography across concourse, atrium, roof, and maintenance door remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    The soundless sanctuary and crystal whispering forecourt constrain the protagonist's choices throughout: silence as "balm for wounded minds" forbids the singing clock, the forecourt's breath guides the bell's stroke, wet quartz "phrases" offer interlocution. The body becomes micro-setting ("ribs skipped no beat," breath paints heat along the bell's lip). The final image—snow accepting a sleeping fox—charges closure by making the sanctuary's acceptance tactile. Sensory hierarchy is consistent (sound suppressed, touch and breath foregrounded). Spatial choreography remains clear across the slate bench, archives, and forecourt.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    The canal constrains choice: the sluice gates hide fraud, the skiff limits cargo ("all we could salvage"), and the viaduct's sightline forces the tactical rearrangement. The sundial's shadow "cut a thin black verdict across the corporate logo"—a micro-setting detail that charges the closure. Sensory hierarchy is sharp: "loaf wrapper clung to a piling, a calendar of hunger fluttering," filtered through the narrator's errand-legend idiom. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from skiff to hatch to rail. The canal breathes like a character, yet the physical mechanics of poling a laden skiff under duress are gestured at, not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting pressures choice throughout: the dock's impending demolition creates urgency, fog isolates the pair, snow marks time, the tar seal requires warmth to open. The fulgurite glass, hemp rope, and silt trough are handled tactically. Micro-setting (body, breath, hands) and recurring objects (rope, glass, sprig) constrain actions and charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The environment is lived-in and purposeful, never postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.1)
    The shadowed garden with lanterns, veiled vines, fig tree, and broken fountain is established early and revisited across beats. The palace carpet weft thread functions as a charged micro-object: tied around the finger, strung between rose canes, and finally used to stitch the map. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("brass polished by tears," "leaves scissor down, bronze on slate"). The thread constrains the narrator's projecting-presence method and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment/object pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    The suspended palace anchored to stalactites is vividly rendered—"chains creaked a lullaby," "the palace rocked as if the stalactites hiccuped"—and the mechanical world (gears, dynamos, piston sighs, Throne of Bearings) is filtered through the prince's priorities. The cradle of brass ribs and mica windows, the pilot light tuned with spoons, and the grate behind the throne all constrain on-page choices. The final image charges when "the palace seemed to lower its shoulders, the stalactites less like teeth, more like roots remembering the patience of earth," linking environment to closure reconfiguration. Sensory selection reflects urgency throughout, though some descriptions (lime dust, condensation) anchor atmosphere more than they alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The obsidian lagoon, volcanic black sand, charred trunks, and kelp-drift peace anchor setting early and recur with purpose. The coin as plumb bob and the grafted trunks function as micro-setting objects that guide wind-reading and charge the closure song. Sand is handled in two beats (jar set down, pockets filled at dusk) and its warmth/memory properties constrain the grafting ritual. Spatial choreography is clean (lagoon shore, trunk to trunk, beach walk). The setting supplies resources (willow, breeze seams) that enable the protagonist's method, lifting the score above postcard description into functional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    The city of forgotten fountains constrains every choice—dry basins guide the search, pitch-stuck panels resist opening, shadows anchor trapped thoughts. The statue's shadow becomes the micro-setting that unlocks the box, a precise environmental constraint that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy filters through the skeptic's testing lens: mica-dusted lantern glow, pitch gummy with age, wind smelling of pepper and lilacs. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from alleys through arcades to the oldest square.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    The nebula garden is vividly particular: "terraces of vapor, domes of slow lightning, corridors of suspended pollen." Setting constrains method (sonar for navigation, no fire) and charges the closure (orrery placed "in a cloth of starlike moss for the next caretaker"). Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. Micro-setting (the orrery, gears, moss cloth) functions as tactile anchor and recurs with reweighted meaning at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.1)
    The greenhouse's fogged panes, iron ribs, misting pipes, and butterfly-laden rafters ground every beat. The woven ribbon roll becomes micro-setting infrastructure, constraining the carver's method and supplying the visual logic of the braid. Spatial choreography (figs, trellises, benches, vents) remains coherent across multiple nights. The environment charges the final image: untying ribbons among ferns, gaps glowing in stone, and the last monarchs lifting outside.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    The pendulum bob, tower cavity, and tidal obsidian ridge constrain choices on the page: the bob's weight cavity enables the pellet ritual, the pause creates the vision window, and the ridge anchors memory and the final pilgrimage promise. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—salt air, brass sound, wet basalt—and filtered through the winder's occupational attention. The bob's physical properties (round, heavy, filled with shot) directly shape the protagonist's adjustment tactics and the story's closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt silo, tapestry, and pocket chessboard ground the ritual convincingly, and sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("dew were made of old silk"). The silo's architecture and the tapestry's physical presence constrain Rowan's ritual—he must climb, align, listen—and the sovereign case's heft recurs with purpose. However, the environment does not decisively charge the final image; Rowan's exit is atmospherically strong but the setting does not alter his closing choice or crystallize the cost, keeping the score below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    The obsidian spire, frozen lake, slate table, brass orreries, and kingfisher quill anchor the narrator's vocation and constrain the central choice: the environment is not postcard but crucible, with the lake's cracking and the spire's "hollow reed" chamber shaping both mood and metaphor. The quill "blue as dawn water and sharp as the chill" and the maps "honest about their gaps" are micro-settings that charge the final image and recur with reweighted meaning. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the narrator's professional lens (glacial wind, basalt nerves, silver ink on sleeves). The environment pressures the choice by embodying the danger of writing "too thick" and the need for openings, and the final image of the spire and lake teaching the narrator integrates setting into closure. Gate met: environment constrains choice and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ember alcove functions as micro-setting, constraining action (shallow dish, coals for light and warmth) and charging the final image ("embers reposed," "thistled calm"). The dust, chalk, ash mixture and the radio's dial glow supply concrete tools that shape each beat. Sensory detail is filtered through Mara's professional bias: "bleached staves," "metronome symbols," "E at the edge of hearing." The moss-walled ridge, far orchard, and shutters anchor spatial choreography during the searchlight warning. Minor: the "wintered valley" and "story famine" remain slightly abstract backdrops; more tactile consequence of the famine on daily routines would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rocking chair constrains the drawing session, its slowing rhythm ("groaning like a ship turning in shallow water") charges the closure beat, and the brass bowl on the floor provides the ash-burning site—micro-setting that shapes the ritual. Sensory detail is purposeful: "air tastes like slate," porcelain "veins under glass," and the ash making "a weather all its own" filter through the narrator's professional perceptual lens. Spatial choreography (Soren seated, mask in lap, portrait held up, kneeling at the bowl) remains clear throughout. The gallery as "house of somber marvel" is established early but remains somewhat abstract; deeper occupational texture (other clients, prior rituals) is omitted but acceptable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    Setting pressures choice throughout: tide schedules salvage windows, sedimentary layers guide navigation, the lighthouse ruins function as star school, and silt-bowed vaults yield both the cog and the ledger. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (canal "scabs over with oil," "sun scrapes it into an abrasive calm," oysters sleeping on lathes) and filtered through the narrator's philosopher-craftsman lens. The chronometer cog constrains the ending by making time itself the charged object; its restoration gives coordinates to the harbor, altering social options. Body and tool (spoon-handle tooth gauges, twine winding) function as micro-setting elements that charge the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear across sewer, vault, and lighthouse.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.1)
    The velvet library in autumn is anchored early with sensory specifics (dust, damp leaves, cold turned warm), and the rosette constrains the singing exercise (twelve petals, twelve counts). Spatial choreography is mostly clear (around the rosette, windows opened at dusk), though the boy with headphones and the positions of all students are not individually tracked. The micro-setting (rosette as compass, nick facing fear) charges the final image when light floods its lattice, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting participation.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rusted greenhouse supplies vivid, purposeful detail—crying hinges, shattered panes threading planetary light, iron ribs vibrating—that constrains the ritual and charges the closure image. Sensory hierarchy reflects the chef's professional filter: taste anchors memory (rain on grandmother's porch, pickled plums, coins in fountain water), while sight and smell support atmosphere (books in rain, burnt sugar of courage). The camping stove and bent workbench ground the poverty of resources, and the spatial choreography (basket on bench, seed in composted diaries, bowls in a circle) remains coherent. The greenhouse as cathedral of patient geometry directly shapes the final image of ordinary care, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tower, harp, lacquer box, matchbox, and coil function as micro-setting that constrains choices: the phosphorus glow reveals the seam, the harp's silence blocks the tower's function, the coil restarts the cycle. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("nectar dusk," "honeyed and smoky," "ghost line that glowed thinly"). The final image—tower holding "the largest flame, steady and speaking"—charges closure. Spatial choreography is clear (queue, stair, bench, panel, brush ring). The recurring objects (lacquer box, matchbox) reappear with reweighted meaning at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    The blue house, bay, and porch are vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (salt wicking air, gulls drawing seams, bottles labeled with "days and winds"). The orris root shard and vial of hush function as micro-setting objects that charge the ritual and final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across rooms. The bay's response to the poured southwester bottle ("pushing a ripple against the pilings") shows environment constraining or echoing action, meeting the 9+ gate partially but not decisively altering a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.1)
    The underwater garden is vivid and purposeful: glassy ferns, statues that blink in currents, foxglove ampoule in bronze ivy, cracks as flutes. Setting constrains action—the narrator threads thoughts through structural weaknesses, the quake tips the plaza and releases the ampoule. Spatial choreography is coherent (colonnade, amphora, vault, chamber, plaza ceiling). The micro-setting (cracks, ampoule, bishop's palm) charges the final image when the city hums and the door unlatches, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice and shaping closure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    The infinite staircase is both macro-setting and constraint: risers as lemmata, landings as hypotheses, the bannister rupture leaking light. The dice (micro-object-as-setting) constrain choice in multiple beats—roll outcomes dictate movement ("two steps forward, three up, snake eyes, turn and look back"), and the chip's tactile presence ("catches on skin") embodies the missed-chance texture. The staircase directly charges the final image: "I pocket the pair of dice... and climb toward a horizon that repeats." Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven—chalk dust, iron taste, copier toner—filtered through a mathematician's perceptual signature.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rooftop greenhouse is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail—saffron quiet, neon smeared on glass panes, ferny breath drifting down stairwells—that reflects Anya's priorities and constrains choices (moon angle, smog thinning, ventilation). Sensory selection is economical and urgent: "city thudding like a muffled drum," "antiseptic" on the nurse's coat. The moon-tipped brush and watering can function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent across all visitor arrivals and the ledger-keeping.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.1)
    The grotto setting constrains every choice: waterfall roar as "ceiling of our days," rosewater used to sweeten damp air, the cold that blues children's hands, and the sluice door hidden in spray. The emerald lenses function as micro-setting—they reveal the hidden door and recharge the final cataloging scene. The trunk's dampness and the bas-reliefs "smudged into night-maps" by smoke track causally through the narrative. Spatial choreography remains clear during the crossing and discovery sequence, and the theater carved "near the spray" directly shapes the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lighthouse and hunger stone constrain multiple choices: the lens feeds on the stone, the yoyo maps to planet gears, and the tidal cycle governs timing. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the narrator's craft bias ("back teeth of brass bit forward," "the house's heart steadied"). The rocky island's physicality—slick weed, silt, cracked lens—grounds the fantastical mechanism. Spatial choreography remains clear across the bunkhouse discovery, the lens chamber, and the final vigil, with the setting charging the closure image of waiting at the margin.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.9)
    The funhouse setting constrains and enables action throughout: mirror maze multiplies reflections to create the trap, the photo booth becomes the ritual site, the revolving floor holds backstory significance. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful ("rotten peppermint coiled with damp sawdust," "mold freckles"), filtered through the protagonist's particular awareness of decay and memory. The clasp functions as micro-setting, its "lingering luminance" threading through silver and charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear across moves (entrance → maze → booth). The setting actively shapes the final tactic (multiplying into a crowd via mirrors) and the closure effect (door left open for luminance to escape).

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.1)
    The driftwood ring, bottles, trees, and sea are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (dry drum note, bellish apples, foams applauding). The orchard-as-instrument setting constrains the prophet's tactics (assigning labor to trees, spacing bottles) and charges the closure image when the ring "did not break but became a corridor." Spatial choreography is coherent, and the micro-setting of body and tool (mallet, bottles, sailcloth) drives choices across beats, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    The turtles as living infrastructure constrain every choice: the protagonist must use the whistle to move them, and their shell-ridges function as navigational texts. The gate, lowest bridge, and watchers are spatially coherent and persistent anchors. The final touch—"Its surface etched with tidal genealogies"—charges the closure image by making the watchers legible as record-keepers rather than threats. Sensory detail is filtered through the cartographer's professional lens (whorls, strake, hexagons) and modulates with urgency: under stress, perception narrows to "heatless cold" and fingertip thought.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    The disused station, ivy, western stair, and shaft are vividly rendered and materially constrain the retrieval (ladder, descent, lamps, brick seam). Ivy functions both as atmosphere and as a charged parallel to the illuminated letter's vines, embedding the method in the setting. Spatial choreography (platform → booth → stair → shaft → bench) remains coherent, and the pit's physicality pressures the choice to descend. The final image—ivy "nails itself to what stands"—recharges the setting metaphorically, though the metaphor announces itself rather than emerging through action.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.1)
    The submerged pavilion constrains movement (tide windows, scaffolding left by masons) and charges the closure: water as "faithful reader" that "praises and erases" recurs to frame the surveyor's acceptance of impermanence. Micro-setting elements—mortar seams, barnacle-encrusted plaque cavity, algae as "patient pennants"—anchor each beat and the inkwell becomes a tactile setting object that links past surveyor to present. Sensory hierarchy filters through the surveyor's professional lens (hairline tremors, precise joins) without tourist catalog. The final image of "coals under river glass" synthesizes prior water/light motifs to land the thematic stake.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sunken library's physicality constrains every choice: brine ticking against mosaics, algae veins supplying light, the dome flexing with tide. The antique stamp as micro-setting object charges the closure when its serrated crescent becomes proof. Sensory hierarchy fits POV (salt-scoring on brass, soot and balm ink pad). Minor slip: "dappled resolve flowing over stone" momentarily elevates diction without clear POV anchor, though it recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating island, glass basilica, tea garden, and the physical work of polishing gems and folding cranes are vivid and specific. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "steam from the shrubs," "rain on iron," "wind slices the bells into ribbons." The spiral path that "descends while ascending" functions as a charged micro-setting that externalizes the protagonist's internal state. The cranes tethered to the waist and the opal-threaded lanterns constrain the final action, meeting the 9+ gate. However, the basilica's interior mechanics (dream-recording, color-organ birds) remain somewhat abstract, and spatial choreography inside the basilica is less concrete than earlier garden scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating observatory, geode, and salt flats function as both literal setting and charged constraint: the observatory's "tethered by cables and guilt" frames the narrator's suspension, the geode under the interferometer translates "micro shudders into notes even trauma can read," and the desert below serves as palm-line metaphor that refuses interpretation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"steam hoods shiver," "dragonflies trapped in bottles"—filtered through the narrator's hypervigilant attention. The geode anchors the final choice: placing it on the boundary stabilizes the readout and enables the refusal. The salt flats' passive acceptance in the penultimate line charges the narrator's attempt to learn that acceptance, closing the spatial arc.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory's telescope slit, bronze cord, and altar plate are tactile and purposeful; the dome mechanism enables the star-mapping attempt. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "cooling stone," "rotors whisper like moths," chip "shivers as if remembering hands and furnaces." The micro-setting (chip on altar plate, drone camera aimed down) directly constrains the pilot's calibration and shapes the final coordinates. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The ancient observatory at dusk charges the closure image by framing the search in ruins and twilight, a deliberate echo of the missing-pieces theme.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    The driftwood shore and its carvings constrain the investigative choice: the groove accepts the watch hand with a "tiny click," and the crescent mark must be levered to reveal the hair coil. The cobalt terrace brackets the piece, charging the final image where "the silence there no longer felt empty but weighted like a scale I could finally read." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (sea-stained paper, kelp smudge, dew-slick cobalt). Minor gap: the terrace itself does not pressure a mid-story choice; it functions primarily as bookend.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    The parapet, mist, moon-phase synchronization, and drawer pull all constrain choices and charge the closure image. Sensory hierarchy reflects the narrator's occupation (weighing words, tracking tide/moon). Spatial choreography is clean across the exchange. The antique drawer pull functions as micro-setting: it recurs with purpose (grandmother's desk → oath chest → final bell-click), shaping the narrator's stance and charging the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    The kayak launch, channel, utility poles, and boatyard ground spatial choreography cleanly. The astronomical compass, a recurring micro-object, charges the final image when the sister closes its lid—blessing the wound. Sensory detail is purposeful: "feathery intertidal sand," "poles hummed like ribs," fog erasing except "thready silhouettes." The tarp and overturned kayak anchor the sister's space. Scope fits the single-scene window; no occupation depth is required beyond navigational idiom, which reads plausible.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The underground bioluminescent lake is vividly rendered ("light algae and stone-bred patience," halos recalling fingerprints) and actively constrains choices: the sentinel demands confession as payment, the algae reply with a chorus, and the ball's seams match eddies to guide navigation. The market fountain at closure provides a concrete anchor for the vial's release. Spatial choreography (cracked boat, midlake dome, city shore) remains legible throughout. The lake's glowing water charges the final image when it sparks recognition in strangers, fulfilling the micro-setting test for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.1)
    The orchard under permanent moonlight anchors the conjuration and the moon "lowers like counsel," constraining the ritual's timing and witnessing the bond. The stone shaped by "hooves and moons" serves as altar, and spice vials are handled across beats. However, spatial choreography remains vague—where exactly the narrator stands relative to beasts, stone, and arriving beloved—and the orchard's fairy-tale descriptor stays postcard-static after the opening. The body (throat growing feathered, shoulders aching) briefly serves as micro-setting under transformation stress.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.9)
    The glade setting—pine, frost, vapor, a ravine of chimes—constrains the ritual spatially and the saucer's crack functions as micro-setting that aligns with the traced palm to open the path. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "pine honey" tastes "like a warning and a prayer arguing," the dew lifts under boots, minutes glint. The body and tools (cards, cloth, brooch, saucer) charge the closure when the protagonist pours saved minutes onto the cloth and it warms "like bread." Minor issue: the mechanics of "cloudbound" and "above clouds" remain slightly abstract; we don't feel altitude or air pressure after the opening line.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    The recycled spaceship supplies concrete constraint: artificial gravity braids to prevent drift, maintenance shafts become accessible only when the narrator lightens, and the waste reclamation ring houses the dimensional lock. The kwan yin's tear functions as both navigational tool and threshold key, charging the final image. Spatial choreography (gallery wall, cot, suture plates) remains clear. Minor limitation: some details (funerary scaffolds, observation dome origin) enrich atmosphere but don't constrain a second choice.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    The black sand, fumaroles, and obsidian flats constrain the rescue path—the "sea cave briefly unveiled" and "shoal path skirting the fumaroles" directly enable the skiff's route, charging the final movement. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's attention ("metallic sighs," "steam instructions," "velvet hem"). The volcanic setting recurs with purpose (setup, complication at the ridge, closure hum), and the body-level texture of "slippered like wet sand and granular like grief" deepens thematic resonance. The beach reappears in the final line, grounding the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bronze quill holder functions as micro-setting, constraining the climactic choice: its "balance" and conductivity bridge the wheel's corroded teeth, and its absence afterward marks cost. The fort's architecture—archive door, iron eyelids, floor seam—guides movement and discovery. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "keys clinked like cool birds," "the room exhaled the kind of breath that starts a confession," light "tasted the room first, polite at the lips." The half-painted sundial recurs with evolving pressure, its "pause" a tactical wedge and its new shadows the closure image. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the archive descent and courtyard return, with "luminous fort at twilight" framing and charging the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tidal bluff under aurora functions as active setting: the aurora "spills green and violet like pages," triggering the dust fall that the herder must harness; the slope becomes a surface to ride "as if steering a thought." The painted rocks, bowl carved from driftbone, and eel skins tied to feet are micro-setting elements that constrain tactics (the bowl "rings like a bell," the eels' skins enable slope-riding). The final image—"our feet find traction in the thought we made"—charges the setting with the story's conceptual weight, making the unstable shore a direct pressure on every choice.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stormlit observatory is vividly rendered with sensory specificity: "tin taste of beginnings," "dome rattled like a throat clearing for confession." The setting pressures choices—Ilya climbs until "trees stopped," and the storm's rhythm becomes a metronome for the reading. The darkroom timer and old instruments anchor micro-setting that charges the closure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glass atrium, brook, and sundial are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (glass chiming, water speaking, leaves agreeing). The sundial constrains the decoding action in the middle beat and charges the pact-sealing moment at closure. Spatial choreography remains clear through the duel. The setting functions as more than backdrop, grounding the philosophical posture in tactile particulars, though the orchid-nursery council chamber arrives as decoration rather than constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rusted library setting constrains choices: Mara pries bars, they braid rebar with ivy, stack crates into steps—each detail alters tactics on the page. The coffee tin, bolts, twine, and nails are handled tools that shape the work. Micro-setting (the collapsed window, the threshold, the yard) directs action rather than serving as backdrop. The moon's progression ("as the moon clears the skyline" → "under the luminous fracture of dawn") tracks time and charges the final image, though spatial choreography occasionally blurs when multiple small objects (screws, plank, tarps) appear in quick succession without clear positional anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal arbor functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges the closure: its "bench of salt-bleached wood shaped to my back and to her absence" becomes the site where the prelude is finished and Mara steps back into warmth. The station's ceiling fans as "flickering compasses" and the film projector's mechanics are integrated into action. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the shift from station to arbor and back, and the sensory palette (tide sounds, vapor, salt-bleached wood) is filtered through the pianist's perception without becoming a catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ridge, shells, saltwater bowl, jacaranda shadows, and cliffside sink are vivid and sensory-specific ("perfumed and quietly mathematical," "water answers with names"). The ridge as setting constrains the planting choice (must be "where the island once decided to be real") and the seed's root "tastes stone and decides," charging the closure image. Sensory selection reflects urgency (thunder, reef clicks, monsoon arrival). Minor penalty: spatial choreography of the group moving from ridge crest to cliffside sink is legible but compressed; the transition feels telescoped rather than tracked step-by-step.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    The islet setting (breezy, rain-rinsed, tidal pool cupped by black stone) supplies the ritual stage and the compass/lace/juniper function as micro-setting that constrains choices throughout. The pool's glow and the juniper's shift to cerulean physically charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean (shore → pool → rock) and sensory detail (indigo berries bleeding, needles answering) is filtered through the tutor's patient craft. The environment directly enables the final act of speaking to the tide.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    The observatory setting constrains choices and charges the final image, with sensory details like "rain fired upward" and "chemicals and pine" filtering through Ilya's POV. The storm and dome actively pressure the climax, and specificity is purposeful without generic clichés.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting constrains choices and charges the finale; the sundial's "coded angles" directly yield coordinates, and the glass atrium's "chiming" space shapes the fencing as philosophical argument. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "brook count time more honestly than any clock"), filtering through the POV's urgency to deepen atmosphere without ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting constrains choices: the rusted library's ivy and rebar are welded into the rebuild, altering tactics. Sensory details are selective and purposeful (e.g., "luminous fracture of reflected stars"). The coffee tin and seeds function as micro-settings that charge the final image of "blooming resistance." Spatial choreography remains clear despite poetic density.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    The greenhouse after the flood is rendered with highly specific, lived-in detail—salt and metal on hands, white silt on slats, black rot, brine-drunk orchids, river debris still moving outside—and every element matters to choices. Setting is not postcard; it dictates tactics (which panes to replace, what can be composted, how much light/ventilation they can risk) and charges the final image of children pressing their palms to cracked panes and reading “dust maps.” The professional lens shapes what is noticed, so the environment is filtered through pattern-reading rather than generic ruin-gazing. The recurring glass/dust/orchid motifs culminate in a final image that is both spatially clear and thematically loaded.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    The canyon, frost, kiln, and desert night are vivid, tactile, and consistently filtered through the artist’s sensibility, with glass/heat imagery woven into the landscape. Environment meaningfully constrains choices: frost maps a missed bend; the buried metal door and basalt kiln exist because of this canyon; the final return under stars charges the ending image. Details are selective and purposeful rather than touristic, and the world’s slightly uncanny rules (glass holding “breaths and pauses”) feel internally coherent. Setting and recurring objects (ledger, kiln, frost) clearly charge the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    The winterglass conservatory and frost-laden city are not backdrop but active constraints: without sound, frost, glass, and heat become the only available instruments. Specifics like “frost gardens bloom under skylights,” “glass bells and ice orchids,” and breath-constellations are vivid, selective, and always tied to action. Environmental rules (no noise, responsive frost) stay consistent and directly shape tactics, especially in the bell rectification scene and in how performances are “felt” through glass. The final image of breath on panes recharges the entire setting with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    Setting and atmosphere are exceptional: the shop, sea, and “forgotten underwater city library” are rendered with precise, character-filtered detail that supports tone and theme. The environment constrains and enables choices—the underwater library’s collapsed catalog creates the problem, and its physical drawers, shelves, and silted artifacts define his tactics in resolving it. The recurring object-as-setting of the lens anchors spatial and conceptual shifts through to the final image above the door. “Chased stillness” and other aquatic/archival textures charge the final state with a tangible sense of earned rest.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sanctions-era city, the ridge-top arbor, and the routes through alleys and doorways are vividly and economically rendered, always filtered through function: sound is dangerous, shelves are rationed, watchers patrol. The bell works as a micro-setting/tool whose physical properties (metal, resonance, capacity) shape tactics and charge the final image. Environmental details like the market road, moon rind, wind with “rumor of engines,” and the ridge’s vantage deepen atmosphere without white-room vagueness or postcard clutter. The arbor itself mostly frames beginning and end rather than constraining mid-story choices, which is the only small limit holding this just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    The viaduct, fog, arches, and improvised darkroom apparatus are richly realized and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility; they never read as generic. Setting elements meaningfully constrain action (the arches as camera space, the fog, the river, the sparks) and charge the final image of walking home with prints as a kind of liturgy. The breathing bellows and kwan yin’s tear function as micro-settings/tools that deeply shape the ritual. Description is dense but purposeful, and the environment is inseparable from the story’s emotional logic.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    The living bridge garden is vivid, specific, and inseparable from the story’s logic: root-arches, cambium plates, frost, birds “above and beneath at once” all feel tactile and emotionally charged. Environment actively constrains and enables choices—the hyperbolic, negative-curved layout produces the non-Euclidean maze and forces the protagonist’s trust in the shard as guide. The final image (walking out “along a root-ribbed arch” that has carried her “in a hundred rehearsals, and this time it carried me once”) is fully charged by the setting. Detail density is high yet controlled; almost every environmental image carries thematic and structural weight.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    The abandoned carnival prize center is vividly sensory (old syrup, solder, blistered thumbs) and thematically apt, and the space’s physical logic (bench, hatch, chain, hinge) directly constrains choices. The piano/bench and chained hatch are true micro-settings that shape tactics and closure: the bench cannot be moved without her, and the vault hinge must scream if forced. The seed vault’s atmosphere (“baked coins and damp wheat”) evolves from the upstairs world, and the carnival money/shame backstory deepens both place and stakes without feeling expository. Environment and recurring objects (chain, arrow, bench) unmistakably charge the final image of climbing together.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    The underwater orchard, shipwreck ring, aurora, and ashen forge are not decorative; they sharply filter perception and constrict what kinds of experiments and encounters are possible. The environment’s absences (missing brass, wreck shifts, graft scars) concretely mirror and inform the protagonist’s method of “collecting absences,” and the forge and orchard are instrumental to the imprinting and testing of the device. The final image—“I held that truth and set the orchard to grow”—is charged specifically by this setting; transplanting the story from this micro-world would break its logic and resonance. Sensory detail is rich but always filtered through the protagonist’s technical and synesthetic priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    The emerald station, florist stall, and “destiny’s door” are not just decorative; they are the crucible that channels strangers into charged pauses and literally provides the door the story’s stake attaches to. Details like “cut stems and station metal,” the brass door, and the green-tinged tiles are filtered tightly through the narrator’s sensibility and recur to charge the final images. The jar’s light interacting with the rafters, door, and departures board turns setting into an active agent in revealing and reshaping choices. This environment would be difficult to swap out without gutting the story’s logic and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned control room is vividly, specifically inhabited: “walls of gauges,” dripping panels as metronomes, thawing rafters, lakes of water on the floor, and the generator’s cough all feel tactile and functional. Setting is not postcard-like; it actively shapes tactics and perception—the drip tempo structures breath-counting and timing, the dead intercom becomes the site for the first glass bell, and the environment’s ruinous quiet enables her fragile experiments in safety. Glassblowing tools and procedures are integrated without pedantry, filtered through her craft-trained perception. The ending image—puddles mirroring sky outside, questions and hands steadier inside—beautifully charges space as emotional and thematic container.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “rusted library under stars” is not just atmospheric; its rotten boards and ceiling projector concretely shape the plan and the climax, while rust “constellations” tie into the cipher. Sensory and textural details (rust, salt air, “metal stacks,” “iron and old glue”) are selective and filtered through this stunt-trained, fear-hypervigilant POV. Spatial choreography is clear enough to stage the lunge and fall without confusion. The recurring sky imagery (stars as screen, then steadier in darkness) charges the final image and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    The storm-tossed ridge fort, sea, and last star are vividly rendered and deeply fused with mood: wind “braiding spindrift,” the fort as “driftwood,” the star “scraping the sky.” Environment shapes behavior in a quiet but real way (men stepping softer, wind pacing, the commander in the doorway as if in a “chapel made of weather”). The last star and the fort’s exposed position frame the entire scene as a liminal brink, charging the final beat as the star lowers and the booklet empties. Setting could constrain a concrete tactical choice more explicitly to reach absolute top marks, but as accumulative atmosphere it’s exceptionally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    The frozen courtyard, twilight, and ice violin are exquisitely specific and always filtered through the janitor’s function-focused gaze. Setting is not decorative: ice, frost, steam, and sky reflections literally constrain action (maintenance routines, careful brushing, slowing down) and metaphorically charge the theme. The final puddle shaped like a comma and the courtyard “agreeing to be new” reweight the environment as an active participant in the inquiry about thought. World rules around loops and maintenance remain consistent and legible without expository drag.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.0)
    The museum at night and the “crystal whispering forecourt after rain” are vivid and consistently filtered through the registrar’s sensibility. Setting is not postcard-bonus; it shapes the action (the forecourt as site of public projection, the rain and tiles and lamp halos interacting with the lens and doodles). Recurring environmental details (rain, steps humming, lamp halos, paper confetti) charge the final images of standing in the rain with transparency as a posture. The world’s rules feel stable within this lightly surreal register.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    The garden maze is vivid and functionally central, from “shadows over clover” to vines forming a doorway that literally shapes character options. Sensors, meters, and bar-coded luck integrate seamlessly into the physical environment. Objects-as-setting (marbles, cane, trellis, ribbons) are handled, not just mentioned, and they constrain behavior and meaning. The final doorway and rooted marble explicitly charge the last image through setting.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    The xenobiology station, ice shelf, magnetic nexus, and aviary are richly realized and filtered through Hale’s mechanic’s sensibility, giving the piece a lived, specific texture. Twilight, the ice, and the station’s rules (experiments before coffee, magnet risks) concretely shape what is possible and when, not just serving as backdrop. Environmental details like the snow chevrons and the station’s “careful breathing” evolve with the experiment and charge the final image of the nexus thinning back into ordinary night. The only reason this doesn’t climb higher is that the environment constrains the emotional choice more softly than it might; it frames and enriches, rather than cornering, Hale.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    The flooded opera house, waterlogged pit, trembling lanterns, and unstable mezzanine are vividly realized and always filtered through a musician’s eye (“lanterns flickering like indecisive fireflies over water that smelled of rope and varnish”). Environment directly constrains action: flood delays rehearsal, water damage creates the ghost’s maps, and the mezzanine’s physical failure plus the north exit dictate the life-or-death logistics. The program itself becomes a micro-setting object that charges the ending when it warms “like a small animal” then loses its images. Sensory detail is dense but purposeful, and spatial choreography during the evacuation remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mountain weather station is not backdrop but pressure: altitude, avalanches, service road, and wedding convoy all hinge on this location’s risks and responsibilities. Instruments, aurora, and cold metal grating are filtered through a professional, grieving observer, so occupational detail feels lived-in rather than expository. The setting constrains choice—only she, here, with these tools, can issue the closure that halts the convoy. The final aurora and wind off the mast reappear charged by the decision and the “cleaner model.”

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    The abandoned train tunnel and mill spur are rendered with precise, lived-in detail (rails “slick with old grease,” “stone belly of the bleaching works”), and perception is clearly filtered through someone who haunts such places. Setting constrains choice: the hidden valve, panel, and niche dictate tactics and make the physical discovery plausible. The recurring objects (beaded wheel, tag, ledger, beads in the margins) act as tools and micro-setting that charge the final image. Atmosphere—industrial, damp, haunted by labor rather than specters—perfectly supports the piece’s tone and themes.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is extraordinarily vivid and integrated: vines belting stacks, mineral-sweating arches, roots burrowing through atlases, and the obsidian refuge all feel tactile and lived-in. Environment consistently shapes action—the swan opens physical routes, the tunnels and catacombs determine where refugees can shelter, roots pre-draft tunnels people then use. World rules are implicitly clear and stable, and setting detail evolves with events (library filling with people, ceiling cracking, books greening with leaves). The only thing keeping this from an even higher band is that physical constraints are gentle rather than sharply coercive; choices are influenced by place more than cornered by it.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and purposive: sage scent, dust, crickets, juniper roots, and eclipse phenomena all echo and frame the emotional work. The choice to be under the tree rather than with the crowd, and the ground as “record,” subtly but clearly tie environment to tactic and meaning. Recurring objects (bowl, curl) function as micro-setting and charge the final images. The only limitation is that Sage Ridge as a town feels more atmospheric than structurally necessary; its social texture stays mostly off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting work is superb: the reclaimed silo as a “rolled ear” with “metal ribs,” ash-scored hearth, and freight-speaking wind are specific, tactile, and consistently filtered through the historian’s listening-obsessed attention. Environment isn’t decorative; the curved walls and seams literally determine his methods (climbing the spiral, angling the lantern, fitting shadows into “pits and scratches”). The tapestry and the diaries function as micro-settings that evolve and directly charge the final image. The only thing holding this from a 9+ is that the environment shapes method and resonance more than forcing any painful choice.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse, basalt steps, wind, beam, and Fresnel lens are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Mei’s way of seeing (“glass cathedral built for dots of light”). The environment meaningfully constrains tactics—using the catwalk windows and lens as the projection device—and charges the final image as the beam carries the new “melody” across the water. Weather and sea are present not as wallpaper but as rhythmic counterpoint (“the ocean kept time against the stones”). The space is always clear and evolving, with no white-room stretches.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    The chapel as a “dimensional anchor” is not just décor; it tangibly takes on “more weight” as the confrontation escalates, and its hush, rafters, and brass outlet all function as tools in Ruan’s method. The artist’s palette, ultramarine bruise, and breath-in-rafters create a dense, coherent atmosphere that mirrors and channels the conflict. Setting details are tightly filtered through the ritual—sound outlets, loops, blue tide—and recur in the ending image of the chapel becoming “truer,” so environment actively charges the final beat. The only small limitation is that the larger world beyond the chapel remains abstract, but that narrowness suits the piece’s focus.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glass spire and frozen lake are fully integrated: the mirrored ice becomes a staff, the spire a “throat holding back a first note,” and the environment actively answers in frost and cracks as sections of the orchestra. Weather and cold constrain her body (“cold knives my lungs”) and are repurposed as percussion, so setting shapes both tactics and final image. The nautilus, stair, and lake function as micro-settings whose physical forms mirror the thematic spiral/return. The final moment depends on this architecture; removing the lake/spire setting would break the story’s logic and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.0)
    The viaduct, rain, lamps, arches, and canal are sharply drawn and recur with evolving significance, culminating in the final walk and dimming viaduct; environment and object-as-setting (tablet, arches) clearly charge the ending. Weather and architecture are not postcard backdrops: the slick stones, puddles-as-doors, and “between the drop and the ripple” window literally mediate access and choice. World rules—floating, maze-entry through puddles, the repeat of the same wet hour—stay internally consistent and are taught via lived action rather than exposition. The setting constrains tactics and supplies the closure image (“the world learned how to keep me only once”), satisfying the 9+ gate cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cavern, with its “rooms of hides and wood smelling of rain and hearth” and the filament of hush between stalactites, is not decorative but the functional engine of the story’s transformation. Environmental features (filament, drumhead, stone, “stone breaths”) concretely shape how sound/feeling must be approached and constrain tactics toward restraint. The final images—filament sealing the drum, Lena pressing it to her sternum, the cavern echoing inside each heart—show setting charging the closure, not just framing it. Detail is selective, sensorially rich (especially touch), and consistently filtered through Lena’s deafness.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly particular and filtered through the narrator’s weather-obsessed lens—courtyard, balustrade, quarantine fences, rusted bridge, and “more private weather” all feel lived and coherent. Environmental constraints shape tactics (using the allegedly broken footbridge, stationing at the public overlook, the fences as both physical and political boundaries). Weather is not decorative but deeply interfused with ethics and method, culminating in the night and wind charged in the closing image. The world rules around quarantine/weather politics are sketched with economy yet feel robust enough not to wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    The greenhouse is vivid and functional: “preservation dust,” “systems that impersonated forgotten suns,” and “glassbed” all create a specific, strange ecology that feels lived-in rather than touristic. Environment and tools (the UV lamp, the glass ribs, the chrysalis-like violet) directly shape what can happen and how the memory-mapping can be seen. The setting’s artificial suns and extinct plants mirror the story’s themes of preserved yet altered grief without over-signaling. While the place doesn’t overtly constrain physical movement, it charges every choice with a particular, inextricable mood and logic tied to extinction and revival.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.1)
    The terra-cotta grotto, whale mural, rope, cliffs, and humming highways are richly realized and always filtered through the narrator’s sensibility; there’s no white-room moment. Setting elements actively constrain and enable choices: the mural becomes the vessel that learns “the sound of release,” the grotto’s hush allows the second to be heard, and the cliffs serve as a perch for the visitors’ whispers. Objects-as-setting are central to the final configuration—the whale watching the stars and the rope riding the narrator’s shoulder—charging the closure image. World rules (energy beings, speaking lamps, time-texture) stay internally consistent and are revealed through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, original, and functionally integrated: the sunken orchard, ship ribs, and greenhouse glass are not just decorative but provide resources and constraints (ribs cradle the fire, broken pane feeds the bowl, the greenhouse houses the bell). Sensory specificity is strong across modalities—salt-jeweled glass, dripping eaves, bats as “soft punctuation,” fruit as “slow applause”—all filtered through an acoustic bias that fits Mara. World rules feel consistent despite the surreal premise, and spatial logic (cove, barge, greenhouse, bell’s location) is clear. The final images of the greenhouse, ship ribs, and sea at partial quiet are charged by their earlier uses.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    The amber grotto is vivid and specific (“resinous stone hummed with a low charge,” “grotto dimmed like a patient closing their eyes”) and filtered through the narrator’s sensory bias toward static and scent. The environment actively matters: the charged amber wall and dusk-lit cavern are integral to the narrator’s method and to the final image of possibility ebbing with the day’s “charges dissipated.” Occupational and sensory detail around perfumery and the electrodes feels precise and integrated into action. It stops just shy of 9-band only because the grotto constrains mood and method more than it forces a concrete choice at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.3)
    The harbor town and “breezy library under stars” are evoked with sensory precision (lemon, salt, open windows like sails) and filtered through the broker’s occupational eye. Setting doesn’t heavily constrain choices, but it continuously charges them—the sea as “parentheses,” cranes as stars, the breeze flipping a page all deepen the emotional field. The symphony/wharf split-world feels lived-in and thematically apt without over-explaining logistics. Atmosphere remains consistent and supports the story’s gentle, communal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.1)
    The crystalline orchard, crater, and obsidian arbor are rendered with precise, sensory detail that is always filtered through the narrator’s vocation and yearning. Environment constrains and enables choice: the arbor is specifically where vows are translated into labor, the sigil appears only on its underside, and the bench must be placed there for the vow to take. World rules (crystals chiming, fruit tasting like “rain on linen,” temperature-keeping stones) are consistent and serve tone and theme rather than becoming a tour. The final image of roots from arbor and chest knitting into the crater’s kindness shows setting directly charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rooftop canal system, sky-river stones, hush-basin, and giant-sleeping-under-city are vividly specific and heavily filtered through the illustrator’s sensibility. Setting actively constrains choices: ladders and narrow ledges make her movements risky, the hidden slack-water pocket enables the cadence break, and the hush-basin tiles plus gullets dictate where the pendant must be placed. Environmental details evolve with events (sluice opened, shimmer traveling, giant twitch tilting puddles) rather than staying static. The setting also charges the final image—an echo released back into the canal network across a still-sleeping giant—but the emotional weight rests slightly more in concept than in visceral spatial consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cavern orchard is richly realized and never ornamental: stalactite drips, root-black water, and mosaic stone all function as tools and constraints for the ritual. Environment and recurring objects (glass eyes, chalk-and-salt fruit, apple-shaped stones) directly shape options and charge the final image. World rules (orchard accepts sung measurements, responses in “decimal pauses”) are consistent and learned through action, not exposition. This setting is inseparable from the story’s premise and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.1)
    The shadowed library, ducts, pipe chases, and emergency lamps are not decorative; they dictate how the narrator moves, hides, and intervenes, and make their body/role plausible. Sensory specificity is rich and purpose-driven (“my knees know the screws, my elbows the chalky plaster”), and the environment filters through a maintenance-ghost consciousness rather than a tourist eye. The library’s hush and light conditions directly shape the cache tactic and the emotional register of the climax. The final contrast with the city “ironing its seams” locks the setting into the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is exceptionally vivid and functional: wet limestone, linden, moss, gutters overflowing, and the trellis-as-rib-cage are not just decorative but shape choices (opening channels, allowing moss to “stitch seams”). The weather and micro-ecology constrain the narrator’s tactics and reframe their role from organizer to collaborator. The linden by the gate and the mossy trellis concentrate atmosphere into recurring loci of attention and decision. The final promise to keep returning to the trellis after rain uses setting to charge the closure image with ongoing stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tidal island environment is intensely specific and always doing work: rusted shores, desalination hall, chapel cistern, and tides all constrain where things can be hidden and how they’re found. Weather and water behavior literally shape tactics (following rain trails, timing against tides) and conceptually charge the final image of rain creeping down painted lines. Details are POV-filtered through the painter’s eye (algae as “feral fresco,” mural of prewar clouds) and never feel like tourist cataloguing. The recurring water infrastructure and decay subtly mirror the thematic repair without tipping into heavy-handed symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    The musical crystal cave is vivid, sensorial, and deeply integrated: stalactite “organs,” quartz that “laughs,” and walls that sing to weather all shape what actions are possible. Setting is not mere backdrop—it literally converts intention and breath into sound, and the final act (housing the shadow in a vowel that resonates through the cave) could not occur anywhere else. The environment’s rules are consistent and learned through use rather than exposition. A slight reason this doesn’t push higher is that spatial choreography beyond key features (organs, stalactites, crown) stays impressionistic, though that suits the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    The harbor, rain, quays, and trumpet are richly realized and tightly integrated with theme; details like “wet marble quays glow like dry bones waking” feel both concrete and charged. Environment and object constrain choice: the valve and trumpet on the cliffside dais literally and symbolically govern the city’s breath, and the harbor’s post-rain state cues the return and the archivist’s work. World rules (exile, signals, harbor life) are consistent and efficiently sketched. This is high-level atmospheric craft, only held back from higher scores by the relatively static spatial stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    The city, railyard, and “starlit vault in mist” are vividly realized and consistently filtered through the mapper’s sensibility (tracks as nerves, streetlights as “tuning forks of rain”). Setting and objects (ticket punch, tracks, platform) charge the final image, even if they rarely constrain choices in a hard-physical sense. The spatial progression from boulevard to railyard to vault is legible and supports the shift from mundane to liminal. The only limit is that the environment functions more as charged atmosphere than as an active constraint on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stargazer’s open tower, star table, and ocean-with-whales are richly specific and consistently filtered through the narrator’s perception, creating a tangible, lived-in atmosphere. Setting actively shapes options: the tower becomes the chamber, the tile “will not leave the tower,” and the open parapets and lantern circle frame the ritual and its constraints. Environmental motifs (wind writing, dusk thinning to stars, tidepool of starlight) evolve with the emotional arc and charge the final image. The whales and ocean are not postcard details; they pace breath, tone, and the sense of an unheard but structuring music.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prismatic escondite under polar glass, threaded by auroras and solar storm, is vivid and functions as more than backdrop: it blooms only in certain conditions, focuses the magnetic experiment, and later “rearranged its doors” as a charged consequence. Details like “copper coils into the crystal alcoves” and prisms that “misaligned their rainbows” are specific and integrated into action. Environmental rules—solar storm intensity, magnetic fields, spatial mutiny—remain consistent and shape options. The setting is rich enough that a bit more tactile, bodily interaction under stress could have pushed it into absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prep room, alley, and institutional surroundings are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action—the steel tables, refrigeration, and side door choreography all directly shape the smuggling tactic. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (“wet cardboard and chrysanthemum stems,” headlights “tasting the glass”), supporting both mood and logistics. The funeral home’s infrastructure (drawers, tags, gurneys) also charges the final image when names are matched to drawers, turning setting into a moral ledger. Environment consistently constrains and enables choices in a way that feels organic rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.0)
    The bonsai labyrinth, mountaintop kiosk, and silent valley are richly rendered and constantly in play, not just decorative. Environment shapes action and choice: the narrator walks the maze for steadiness, consults the trees, and the final contingency plan literally relies on the bonsai ferrying pages “leaf by leaf.” Weather/light (thin cold, clouds dragging shadows) and micro-setting (lamp, notepad, kiosk) are integrated into the work of time-keeping. The setting decisively charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    The port and container labyrinth are beautifully and precisely rendered—cranes as metronomes, mud as “archive,” hulls as “choir of locked rooms”—and always filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. Setting actively shapes what is possible: she lives between containers, moves in rows, shelters under tarps, and the bureaucratic office with barred windows becomes a spatialized embodiment of official erasure. The tides in particular charge the ending, reappearing as an ongoing erasing/recording force that frames her work. This is immersive and thematically integrated, with only the mild limitation that environmental constraints don’t directly force a tactical decision at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory-on-a-cliff setting is vivid and lived-in, from “slit windows” and chalk snow to the crack that “watched the sea.” Environmental elements (wind, rain, cliff edge, chalk, dome acoustics) are not decorative; they’re integral to the method (wind playing the cello, shell answering, crack aligning with painted stars) and to the final image of leaving the place humming behind. Objects-as-setting—the shell, cello, journal—are tightly integrated and recur with shifted meaning at the end. The only small limit is that the physical precariousness of the cliff never quite exerts concrete risk on action, staying symbolic rather than constraining choices.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.0)
    The raft-city carnival is richly and specifically realized, with details like “venture boats circled like gulls” and “glitter current around Old Clinic Row” making the environment feel lived-in and functional. Setting continually constrains and enables action: tide charts, docks, piers, and rope bridges all dictate what’s possible and what’s at stake. The foundation stone chip acts as a micro-setting object, charging the final image and the political choice it underwrites. Atmosphere and world rules are consistent and deeply integrated with plot.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    The crater summit, pumice, foil pennants, crater lake, and experimental vial are not mere décor but active constraints and lenses; the mountain’s isolation, cold, and altitude all shape tactics and timing. Orbital mirrors and “logos comb[ing] their antlers across the day” directly reframe the sky as contested setting at the moment of closure. Details are selective and POV-filtered (meteor scars as future clipboard entries, smell through the mask, lake as “pupil”), giving the environment psychological as well as physical presence. The final contrast between stone’s indifferent memory and monetized light charges the last image powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mist-coated depot, harbor, rails, bowls of water, and consoles are richly tactile and consistently filtered through Mara’s sensory priorities, avoiding tourist catalog description. The environment meaningfully constrains tactics: mist and blindness force reliance on sound, light refraction, and the drone’s pings. The recurring bowls and rail/sea/anchor imagery directly charge the final image of a city “relearning balance.” Setting, tools, and weather feel inseparable from how this story must happen.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    The frozen lake, rusted outpost, sastrugi, and under-ice “throat” are richly specific and consistently filtered through the cartographer’s sensibility, giving the world both physical heft and conceptual charge. Environment constrains and guides choice: they must respect the ice, wait for the falcon, and use condensation on a window as a navigational tool. Recurring micro-settings (window, kettle, canteen, outpost door) evolve and culminate in the final image of the canteen by the window and the “soft applause of silvered sweat,” directly charging the closure. World rules—the bargain with stillness, the quiet as threat, water as thinking distance—are stable within the slightly uncanny realism.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and deeply integrated: the ancient archway, cobblestones, skeletal stalls, and “windows brimming with unspent dawn” all filter through the narrator’s sensibility. Environment isn’t postcard backdrop; the arch literally “drinks” rhythm, stones crack or settle according to footfalls, and shutters and market structures respond to the ritual. The archway and cobbles constrain and enable choice—everyone must walk there together—and the final image under the arch is charged by all that accumulated physical response. World rules for this quasi-mystical mechanism stay consistent and learnable through action, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.1)
    The underwater temple is exquisitely realized and never ornamental: cables, nets, air pockets, and the altar all constrain movement and tactics. The environment directly shapes key turns—the snagging net, the need to become “another statue,” the temple “keeping its watch” as part of the price for borrowing the vial’s power. Sensory detail is selective and character-filtered (fish as saints, air as a “sleeping animal”), and the rules of this slightly numinous seascape stay consistent. The final image of why the water tasted different and grief loosened is charged by all the prior environmental specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse prison off the jagged reef is vivid, texturally specific (lantern room, drowned pantry, jars of yesterday, reef, fog) and tightly filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. Environment is not postcard; the rotating lens, narrow door, stairs, and island “ribs” all constrain his path and make possible the central tactic of trapping hush in the beam. The setting’s logic (“sustains impossibilities”) is consistent and charges the final image of copperlight dressing shoulders while the sea rehearses storms. This is publish-ready atmosphere that also functions as apparatus for the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.1)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse and endless night are not decorative; they define the problem (no sunlight), dictate tactics (resonant awakenings instead of normal growth), and charge the final image of “ledger of sap and stars.” Details like copper grafts, stringed flasks, and winter-cracked fields are selective and purposeful, always filtered through the gardener’s practiced eye. The setting’s rules (memory in sap, oaths binding grafts) stay consistent and are learned via action rather than exposition dumps. The environment and recurring bead together constrain choice and deeply charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptionally integrated: the emptied/refilling tide pools, red canyon labyrinth, chalked pier, and tactile stone all shape what’s possible and how choices are made. The labyrinth’s “choir” logic and the stone’s demand for “attention” function as world rules that directly govern tactics and the eventual solution. Recurring environmental elements (tide pools, canyon mouth’s “exhale,” the lighthouse image) reappear at closure to reweight the stakes and charge the final image. The only reason this doesn’t go higher is that physical constraint never becomes outright peril; the pressure remains more spiritual than survival-based.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    The catacomb orchard is a superb, specific environment—figs, damp limestone, roots threading skulls—integrated into nearly every move. Setting is not mere backdrop: roots literally deliver the sundial fragments, the crypt step becomes the repair site, and the orchard’s “breathing” and shifting from fear to welcome charge the ending. The sundial and fig trees function as environmental tools that reframe time, prayer, and bread-making, directly tying world to theme. Description density is high but consistently purposeful and filtered through the narrator’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is intensely specific and integrated: the golden arcade, brass slots, gum arabic, chalked stones, and drones all feel lived-in and of a piece. Environment and objects are not just backdrop; the chalked pavement literally provides the code that guides the safety tactic, and the margins of envelopes/posters become the story’s operative terrain. Tone, world rules, and spatial relations stay consistent, and sensory detail is economical yet rich. The recurring physical spaces (arches, hall, sidewalk) charge the final image of standing by the brass slot with the letter in hand.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    The cobalt observatory, orrery, and candle are exquisitely specific and fully embedded in action; they are not backdrop but the machinery through which Tamsin acts. Environmental constraints (the built-for-echo halls, the calibrated flame, the dome aligning with her cloth) literally define what tactics are possible. The final image—orrery humming, flame steady, futures stitched—derives its charge from the accumulated work the setting has done. Autumn is lightly used but supports the sense of a waning order without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mangrove labyrinth, singing spirits, and stranded houseboat are vividly sensory and deeply integrated with mood (“air tastes like copper and lullabies,” “tin roof ticking with fallen leaves”) while the hospital setting is sharply evoked through smell and sound (“antiseptic and orange peels and rain”). Setting is not postcard: the tide literally delivers her, the boat becomes the liminal stage for the ritual, and the condensation on the window functions as a magic interface that constrains how the moment is accessed. The moonlight and mangrove fold-back in the final beats explicitly charge the closure, tying environment to the healing and the trade. World rules, though fantastical, are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    Setting is exquisitely realized: the “mist-clad atrium,” night-birds, pandanus, and clinic jetty all feel tactile and culturally grounded, filtered through the translator’s sensibility. Environment and recurring objects (the cast, the brain coral) meaningfully constrain choices and charge the final images, especially the jetty as a liminal transfer point. Weather and sea motifs aren’t just pretty—they shape time (“sunrise”), options (neutral meeting ground), and theme (tides of consent and conflict). The atmosphere is dense but never disorienting, with sensory detail tightly tied to stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ruined orchard and fog are extraordinarily vivid and specific, functioning as more than backdrop: the fog as “patient audience” and would-be hoarder of stories directly pressures the protagonist’s tactics and final stance. Details like skeletal pear trees, cracked cistern, and honey crates are integrated into action rather than static description, and the orchard-as-darkroom metaphor shapes how she literally paints with projected light. World rules (fog as emulsion, knowledge network under roots) are consistent within the dream-logic and support the theme. The environment decisively charges the final choice to let the display blur back into branches, satisfying the 9-band gate even if the score stays just below.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sound wave garden and tuned wall are exquisitely specific and fully integrated: humming hedges, braille-like ripples, resonant stones, and the console all shape what the protagonist can do. Environment is not postcard; it actively constrains tactics (filtering tonality, guiding echoes along hedges, the gate-path of shaped echo at the end). World rules about sound-as-architecture stay consistent and are learned through action and perception, not exposition dumps. The final image of the hedge shaping the echo-path charges the setting with closure weight, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is rich, specific, and constantly active: the greenhouse’s hum suppresses microphones, heaters deter surveillance, insects and plants become tools of tactic and text. Environmental details directly shape action (moths on glass, ants smudging the notice, sunflower shadows spelling sentences) and charge the final images of “ledgers in roots and petals.” The world-rule of thought taxation is integrated with drones, Notices, and Bureau visits rather than expository dump. The setting feels indispensable to both logic and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    The gargantuan shell, Spiral Choir, tide, and reef ecosystem are deeply integrated into both atmosphere and action: acoustics shape the choice to use lullabies, the wind-filled corridors carry the proposal, and the shell’s “breath” signals communal change at the end. Details are specific, strange, and filtered through the poet’s sensibility (moss that sings, armor woven from calyx). The recurring postcard object functions almost as micro-setting, its stars and eventual bark charging the final image. World rules are consistent in their fabulist logic, and environment constrains options in ways that feel organic to the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrally used: opal stacks, glass-orchids, the museum of extinct feelings, and stormfields all do work beyond ornament, shaping what she can notice and preserve. Objects-as-setting (orchids, chime, mezzanine window) directly constrain choices and charge the final images of morning and renewed work. World rules—names as nourishment, cracks as maps—are consistently implied through interaction rather than explained. This is near publish-ready at elite level; only a hair more direct constraint from the environment on her hardest choice could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    The extinct language archive, sealed door, and scroll chamber are all vividly rendered and integral to what the characters can attempt; the world rules (doors opened by “symphonies of truth”) feel coherent and consequential. The setting actively constrains tactics—they must work through vows in an old tongue in this specific place—and the archive’s aura of dust, music, and silence mirrors their relational tension. The ink well as a micro-setting/tool recurs to charge both the reconciliation and the final, careful departure. Environmental specificity and atmosphere are excellent, fully in service of character and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dormant-volcano amphitheater is vividly realized and functionally integral: its “breath” governs timing, bats and reservoir make the ecological stakes concrete, and the chain interacts physically with the steps. Setting is not a backdrop but an active system the protagonist must read and cooperate with, culminating in the breathing-based schedule and test. The final image—machinery and mercy keeping time in the “breathing dark”—recharges the entire environment as a moral and physical partner. A hair more tactile constraint or danger from the volcano itself could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    The vintage bookshop attic, cedar drawers, skylight, and dust motes are not just pretty—they function as a lived-in system for training pigeons and for the narrator’s way of seeing the world. The mars meteorite chip, rafters, card catalog drawers, and ledger pages recur and evolve, culminating in the final ledger/dust-mote image, so environment clearly charges the ending. The setting also subtly constrains choices (attic seclusion, stairs, analog birds instead of wires), in line with the anti-paper-trail stakes. Marginally, a tiny bit less description density early on would sharpen how directly place pressures tactics under Ezra’s request, but this is still elite-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.2)
    Setting is rich, precise, and inextricable from choice: the prism terrace, wood grain, and cornfield all function as tools for decoding and as emotional atmospheres. Environmental rules (light through margin holes onto grain; fog softening distance) are consistent and directly shape tactics. The cedar frame and drifting terrace sharply charge the final image, where the terrace “drifts toward evening with me aboard.” Description remains character-filtered rather than touristic, with the wood, prisms, and maze all mirroring her internal reorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    The underwater research city is richly realized and always filtered through the narrator’s sensibility, from plankton auroras to ducts that “breathed the measure of welcome and return.” Setting meaningfully shapes tactics (listening through valves, reading sonar and vents, using plankton and glass as communicative surfaces). The environment and recurring objects (dome, ducts, plazas, mosaics) directly charge the final image of mutual breathing and belonging. A small trim of decorative imagery would heighten, rather than replace, the already-strong sense of place.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.8)
    The iridescent geode-cave and coast are richly realized and constantly active in the logic: the cave “eats footpaths,” the crystal ribs and glow shape how paths can be mapped, and the final “ribbons” of light are themselves a setting-driven constraint. Objects-as-setting—the crater glass and seeds—are perfectly integrated into spatial logic and closure. The environment doesn’t just decorate; it directly governs what’s possible and what must be protected. At times the density of description edges toward luxuriant, but it always remains purposeful and filtered through the narrator’s vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tidal arcade is vividly rendered—salt, damp stones, “cables like kelp,” grid chalked onto stone—and always in play, not just backdrop. The tide and stones literally remake and then erase the board, charging the final image as the chalk is “drank” and the tide “advanced a rank.” Setting constrains what’s possible: nighttime, thinning crowds between acts, and the encroaching sea all shape his tactics and the transient nature of the performance. This is elite, publishable-level atmosphere, only shy of absolute top because the environment’s pressure remains more lyrical than materially coercive.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    The twilight garden, the gravel that “remembers shoreline,” the drones, and the witnessing stars all create a distinct, lived-in setting that is integral to the premise. The garden’s hush and the drones’ refusal to look provide both cover and pressure, shaping how the dance and inscription must happen. The environment actively charges the ending: dawn “like a tribunal” and stars that “refuse to testify” reframe the entire night as a trial they’ve already subverted. Nearly every sensory detail is filtered through the tide-dancer’s sensibility, keeping the world specific and thematic rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting and atmosphere are outstanding: Pearl Bay, the prism atrium, fog, pond, and cranes all feel tactile and lived-in, filtered through a glazier’s sensibility. Environmental specifics aren’t postcard filler; mist, light, glass, and water actively shape tactics and meaning (the light-spectra demonstration, the pond communing, the final “moment before everything shifts”). The harbor’s soft edges versus planned chroming deepen the thematic stakes. The final image of overlapping rings at the pond recharges earlier setting details with emotional and conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mountain, moonlight, telescope, cairn, cones, and porcelain box build a vivid, coherent atmosphere that reflects his internal state without feeling like a tourist catalog. Setting is consistently filtered through his profession and guilt—cones as burned seeds, ridge vs. saddle—as well as Mira’s cosmological lens, so environment and recurring objects directly charge the final image of leaving the box under the cairn and planting a cone. The micro-setting (duff pocket, ridge path, moon’s silver) constrains the ritual they perform and allows the sky/fire metaphors to fuse. A touch more tactile or auditory specificity of the landscape beyond the lyrical could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tide-polished grotto, ocean, and gauge form a tightly integrated environment whose physical and metaphysical properties continually shape what’s possible (updrafts for balloons, tidal cycles for meetings, salt-worn stone for provisional proofs). Setting details are precise and filtered through the narrator’s scientific–lyric sensibility, and the grotto’s “hinge” role across timelines directly charges the final image of adaptable yet guiding patterns. The recurring objects (gauge, decorations, trial balloons) function as micro-settings and constraint tools, especially at the end where the gleaming patterns are “firm enough to guide…light enough to change.” This fusion of atmosphere, symbolism, and functional constraint fully meets the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.0)
    The drowned museum, ivy-veiled passage, tiles “etched like topographies,” and fireplace of half-burned pages are vivid, integral, and consistently filtered through the echo-cartographer’s sensibility. Setting and recurring objects (film negative, ivy, tiles) actively shape what’s possible—how the walls can be read, which corridors can open, how history survives—and they charge the final images of the ivy “full of the museum’s new map.” World rules about echoes, walls, and climate-altered architecture are learned through action rather than exposition. Environment, tool, and object-as-setting all constrain or enable choices, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integral: the echoing terrace, prism parapet, river, and bell-timed morning all shape what can happen and when. Environmental elements actively constrain and enable choices—the terrace’s mirrors as wells, the parapet bending light, and the bells terminating the miracle-window. Details are filtered through a lyrical but consistent sensibility so the place never feels like a static backdrop. The final image of a “second city beside the first” depends entirely on the established physical and acoustic environment.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    The terrace, bowls, river water, and celestial alignment are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through the narrator’s ritual-minded gaze. Environment shapes action: the terrace as historical altar for petitions, the shared-banks river water, and the clipboard on the altar all constrain how peace must be enacted. Recurring objects (clipboard, reed, bowls) charge the final image with memory and cost rather than serving as static description. The only thing keeping this just shy of exceptional is that seasonal/weather elements themselves don’t further narrow choices beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    The salt flat, thunder, and stone throat are not backdrop but active constraints: the manufactured drought, echoing chamber, and storm lull all shape tactics and stakes. Details like “heat torches and ion nets” and the breathing aquifer are filtered through the narrator’s techno-philanthropic gaze, keeping setting and character fused. The recurring salt, bowl, and chamber throat directly charge the final image of thunder carrying the bird’s echo. World rules (cloud-starving, leverage via aquifer) read coherent and consistent across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the “silver courtyard under snow” and “blue hush upon cobbles” are not just atmosphere but a recording medium where echoes thread across the snow and write a new path. The environment and its rules (door only opening between sigh and smile; snow remembering every vow) directly constrain action and enable the unlocking. The prisms and sanctuary space then evolve from instruments of control to neutral “instruments not masters,” charging the final image. A small reason it doesn’t go higher is that while lushly rendered, the sensory palette leans heavily visual and metaphoric; a bit more tactile or auditory grounding under peak pressure could further sharpen immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.8)
    The decommissioned radar dome is vivid and thematically charged—“meteor hush,” “skullcap,” fossilized words—and frames both the introspective pivot and the final earned quiet. The bar setting and tools (bunraku frames, work light, cleanser, old beer smell) are specific and functional, contextualizing the ethical experiment in a gritty, non-idealized space. Micro-settings like the moth at the window and the campfire story stick act as environment-objects that constrain behavior (who speaks, who pauses, who returns). The dome’s return at the end, “holding its breath,” meaningfully reweights the opening atmosphere.

    The verdant grotto above the clouds is vividly realized and integral: the lip, clouds like “sleeping herds,” moss, and wind eddies all shape the practice of building air-readable signals. Environment constrains tactics (orientation to cardinal axes, reliance on wind, the root that receives the final knot) and charges the ending image as the grotto “exhaled green into the high air.” The recurring glass vial and moth wing also function as micro-setting objects that anchor and reweight the final moment. It’s beautifully integrated, though the same effect could arguably occur in another high, windy place, which slightly tempers irreplaceability.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is extraordinarily vivid and purposeful: “icebound sanctum under aurora,” whale-oil lamp, salt-scented rope, and sleeping bellows all feel tactile and lived-in. Environmental details consistently interact with action—the cold, the ice shivering, the aurora’s light and reflections—rather than serving as postcard description. Tools and objects (rope, lamp, pipes, bellows, ice) function as a micro-architecture for the ritual, constraining how she can access and preserve memory. The final image of the aurora “softened like a door left open” and the sanctum as a place to work charges the environment with thematic weight, though the ice’s practical constraints on choice could be sharpened slightly more.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rewilded forest, vine-draped bunker, and approaching storm are vividly rendered across senses and tightly integrated with the action (the bunker “exhales,” mud stamps decisions, vines close like curtains). Environmental elements evolve with the narrative—storm intensifies, bunker shakes, vines reknit—so the setting never feels static. The storm and mud subtly constrain tempo and gait, feeding the metaphor of path-choices. It’s immersive and purposeful throughout, though the constraints are more symbolic than materially limiting.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)
    The ancient Babylonian palace-observatory is rendered with exceptional specificity—“ceiling mapped with chipped lapis…a river of ash,” boiling glue and cedar—and every detail is filtered through an astronomer’s priorities. Environment actively shapes choice: palace proportions, lapis constellations, and the bronze eyelid constrain where he places the tile and how the passage is “uncloaked.” The recurring objects-as-setting (tile, ash basin, ceiling river) charge the final image of mirrored night and diagram reflections with thematic weight. Setting, more than backdrop, is the medium of the covenant and is indispensable to the story’s logic and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “soundless sanctuary” is vivid and functionally integral: its hush numbs weapons, steadies tilted reality, absorbs rage, and literally creates the pause in which war can be renegotiated. Details like dust shifting into braided rivers to map retreat fuse setting with plot and theme. The music box as recurring object-as-setting charges the final image when placed against Mara’s sternum. World rules (the sanctuary reappearing, time braided within) are consistently applied and felt through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ruined orchard and fog are vividly rendered and inseparable from tactic and theme: the fog’s erasure of direction forces Iren’s listening strategy, and frost, mirrors, and sextant all become tools in an environmental ritual. Specific objects—the trellis, shard frames, sextant, apples—are used, repositioned, and finally recharged in the ending image. Weather and time (“twilight frost”) create a liminal pressure zone that feels necessary to the dream’s approach, not decorative. The world’s rules are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition, fully supporting the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cathedral-orchard is vivid and specific—“citrus humming with bees, apples thudding softly, pears considering gravity”—and always filtered through the mender’s practical, guild-trained gaze. Setting isn’t just backdrop; the rafters, irrigation line, bellwater, and composted hymnals all constrain tactics and seed the thematic breach/repair logic. The final images (bellwater giggling along the nave, cathedral remembering fruit) are charged directly by the environment. A hair more direct spatial pressure or hazard could have pushed this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    The astral orchard and station bathroom are gorgeously specific and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility (“stones around their trunks glowed like sleepy moons,” “petals edited the air”). Setting isn’t just postcard: the orchard’s rules (nonlinear inheritance, no touching flowers, seeds that imprint on breath) directly constrain tactics and charge the ending image. The bathroom functions as a micro-setting that enables private thought under “pump noise” and frames both major reconsiderations. World rules are clear enough to feel internally consistent, though a touch more physical constraint from the asteroid environment itself could deepen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.1)
    The mountain-bookstore is richly and economically realized, with details like “Atlases of Abandoned Journeys,” “Stairs of Recanted Promises,” and thyme-and-chalk stairs that both flavor and constrain movement. Setting rules (gaps as doors, grammar fraying on slopes into memory, the living index) actively shape tactics and the nature of the trap. The botanical diary and thread function as tools embedded in the environment, and the fern imprint in the palm charges the final image. World logic is internally consistent and always filtered through the narrator’s professional/poetic lens.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    The abandoned carnival ship and foggy bay are vivid, specific, and omnipresent, from “rust sang a quiet metronome” to rides “under nets like drowned stars.” Setting actively shapes options: the color-coded hinge, the automaton barker, and the tilt-a-whirl garden all function as mechanisms, not mere backdrop, and the ship’s bargain constrains what the protagonist must do. Environmental changes (“As memories alter, so did the bay, fog parting in ribs”) are keyed directly to the story’s central action. This is very close to top-tier work; only a hair more sense of physical risk from the environment itself would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mechanism room is wonderfully specific—gear teeth with “civic patience,” a pendulum that “measured our hesitations,” the ceremonial rope on its peg—and those details directly shape the protagonist’s tactics. The rope and the clockwork aren’t postcard backdrops; they’re the operative tools and constraints for the entire problem and its solution. World rules (doors that appear for confusion, timekeeping with dual schedules) are consistent and learned through her interaction with the environment. This is just a hair shy of 9-band only because the physical environment never quite pushes back or imperil her in a concrete way beyond intellectual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is rich, specific, and always doing work: harmonic caves, ice drums, crawling ice sheets, and stalactites that would fall under harsher light all constrain tactics and tone. The echo chamber stone and drum-of-ice are environmental tools that literally shape the path and charge the final image, satisfying the object-as-setting test. Sensory detail is multi-modal (taste of metal and snow, fragrance like frostbitten thyme) and filtered through a mapkeeper’s professional lens. World rules about resonance and quiet stay consistent and integral to both action and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the glass humming pavilion, inland-crept sea, salt-worn highways, and ruins all feel specific and shape how Kera works (using wind-song and starlight through glass and prism). Environmental details are not postcard—wind pitch, corroded stairs, and sea position tangibly constrain her tactics and lend plausibility and texture to star-tracking and lens-cleaning. Recurring objects-as-setting (the pavilion, the prism assembly, the wheel) materially charge the final image of the beacon sweeping the waterline. World rules (post-collapse, low-tech with odd magic) stay consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: stormlit observatory, reefed fog, and the crystal forecourt all feel tactile and governed by consistent atmospheric rules. Environmental details directly shape method and choice (solid fog allows reading; altitude affects ink; weather encodes memory) and the final “window” in the reefed fog charges the closing image. The world feels fully imagined without digressive exposition, and the specific professional gaze of an archivist filters every detail. It stops just short of perfect only because spatial and procedural logistics of the forecourt’s use remain slightly mystical rather than fully dramatized in action.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    The fortress is exquisitely concrete—lichened walls, ivy, parapets, twisted corridors, bats—and these aren’t just pretty; they dictate where shells go, how echoes work, and when to begin (“when even the bats held still”). The setting functions as an instrument Lio plays, with the mosaic literally inlaid into the walls and the environment answering each burst. The final images (turret, silent bouquet, rampart walk) are charged by that same physical space, making the fortress inseparable from the emotional arc. This is elite-level atmospheric integration, just shy of perfect because a few details are more decorative than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting work is exceptionally vivid and purposeful: the grotto, pools, barnacles, mollusks, and tide all mirror and shape how the narrator thinks and responds. The environment is not mere backdrop; its cycles of ebb/flood and creatures in transition explicitly guide tactics (the tangential answer through observing a snail, crab, foam). The jade cicada functions as a charged micro-setting/object that carries into the final image and reweights leaving as a kind of arrival. This is elite-level atmosphere tightly braided with character and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    The xenial trellis above the clouds, dew bells, gravity inversion, and bunkers form a precise, idiosyncratic environment that shapes every choice (climbing when gravity inverts, hooking ankles, using jars on the trellis). The setting isn’t postcard; the trellis literally “keeps jars for guests” and later sprouts new handholds in response to the alloyed hush, directly charging the final image. World rules (inverted gravity, floating dew) stay consistent and are learned via use, not exposition. The ladder “once looked like a spine of jail bars” then becomes a widening rib cage, letting the environment carry the emotional reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.1)
    The worldbuilding is rich, precise, and always in service of the emotional stakes: drifting prism terraces, cables of light, signal beacons “writing equations,” and the glass orchard where “sound grows brittle” all concretely affect choices (e.g., re-plotting their path to avoid that orchard). The setting is fully filtered through a professional, idiosyncratic eye, so each detail (storm glass vial, noise meter, terrace wind) both builds atmosphere and guides tactics. The environment directly constrains behavior and charges the final hush, satisfying the high-band gate for setting. It’s imaginative without becoming a museum tour, and spatial logic stays legible despite the surrealism.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is lush, specific, and deeply integrated: the kaleidoscopic waterfall, luminous trunks, layered paint, and root-room all constrain Maris’s path and supply the tools for ascent. Sensory work is purposeful (“colors tasted like childhood circuitry,” ozone-and-apple crawlspace), reflecting a lore keeper’s attentional bias toward media and memory. World rules around the orchard, flake, and murals are taught through action rather than exposition, and the environment evolves with the quest, culminating in the waterfall’s “throat” and the rain-radio throne. This is top-tier atmospheric integration; it just stops short of absolute mastery because the physical environment never directly pushes back or complicates her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ashen sanctuary and starlight are not backdrop but active medium: ash holds footprints as “notes,” the missing door shapes the threshold motif, and the ring and walls respond to sound. Setting is tightly interwoven with action and ritual, especially the doorknocker’s chime and the sanctuary “sighing” at the end. The sensory palette (ash, charcoal, dust, creaking walls, star-salt) is vivid yet selective, always filtered through the Keeper’s liminal role. The final image of rain over spent coals and marked embers is charged by all earlier environmental work.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is richly realized and never static; aisles, caps, pumps, and the improvised chamber feel tactile and lived-in. Setting elements constrain action: dampness, tanks, and the cannery-vat chamber shape what’s possible and how pressure works, while the submarine bolt explicitly mediates survival (“respect the sea above”). The final beat with mushrooms dimming for dawn and the bolt being polished recharges earlier environmental imagery. World rules (concepts becoming physical, sideways pressure) remain consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sepia reading room, gramophone, shelves, and portrait are more than decorative; they’re the very mechanism of discovery, with the environment literally tuned to speak. Sensory detail is rich and purposeful (“dust, leather, and something citrus”) and always filtered through the character’s sensibility. The room’s physical properties constrain choices (you must wind, listen, align sigils, use the keyhole) and charge the final understanding of the family’s sanctuary. World rules around resonance and standing waves are consistent and taught through action, not exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.2)
    The orchard-greenhouse is richly imagined and consistently pressures choice: quicksilver glass training trees into letters, canals of “liquid night,” and mirror pears all actively shape what he can do and how he decides. World rules feel internally consistent (alchemical agriculture, celestial fruits, marionette-blueprint magic) and culminate in the final image of him tending the orchard as vocation. The environment both constrains (“follow through forgotten patterns”) and charges the final image, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    The foster care file room is vividly rendered and strongly POV-filtered—dust, shelves, ledgers, vending machine hum—and it materially constrains what the archivist can do (policies, files, mailer, ledger). Micro-setting elements like the dust and button function as quasi-tools for reading history and charge the final image of the mailed envelope. Environment and institutional context feel fully inhabited without excess explanation. A slightly broader sensory range beyond the visual/aural might have deepened embodiment, but the current level already supports theme and action extremely well.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and purposeful: the alleys, relay chamber, culvert, and auric lagoon are all sensorially specific and filtered through Jessa’s aims. Environment repeatedly constrains and enables tactics—the rusted hatch, maintenance tunnels, puddle reflections misdirecting squads, and lagoon as data medium all matter to what she can do. The auric water and infrastructural underbelly directly charge the final image of erased lives returning as light. Detail density is high but rarely gratuitous, and world rules about the grid and the State feel internally consistent for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.2)
    The grotto, fog, dewdrops, and prism atrium are vividly realized and integral: they generate the code, shape acoustics, and allow silence to be “aimed” and refracted. Environmental specifics (“stone pores opening,” “glass rib cage cupping the pale sky”) are always filtered through the musician’s sensibility and advance the conflict rather than stall it. The setting directly constrains tactics—he uses the atrium’s prism to fold light into the breath-oval and redirect the prophecy. The final image of “water remembering how to fall” powerfully recharges the grotto’s role in the story’s moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Ashen skyborne arbor and its hanging villages are vivid, original, and consistently filtered through Fen’s work with seeds and leaves. Setting is not decorative: the risk of tilting the skyborne arbor and spilling villages, the bark as sentences, and the airborne seeds that “sketch relief for dangling homes” all directly charge choices and the final image. Sensory and textural details (ash, resin, moss, lichen, sepia bark) are precise and purposeful. The environment both constrains behavior and embodies the story’s stakes at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is richly evoked and consistently filtered through the tinkerer’s sensibility: the shop, padlocked botanical garden, “wet paper” greenhouse, and subterranean waterfall-clock all feel tactile and lived-in. Environment constrains action (slick ledge, grated stair, corroded ladder) and the waterfall literally powers the machine that redefines his role. The recurring micro-settings of gears, ribs, and pipes reshape his idea of time and charge the final image of the off-phase clocks in the reopened shop. A tiny further tie between specific city infrastructure above and the waterfall below could heighten the sense of systemic constraint even more.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.1)
    The rain-washed foundry is vividly realized and inseparable from both process and theme: gutters sing, slag-light, iron blooms, annealing, and rain literally drinking from the seams. Environment constrains choices (this is a place of fire, metal, and ledgers) and also charges the final image as the rain tests the new disc. The tactile specificity—anvil, gutters, pipes, steam—feels lived-in and consistently filtered through an alchemist’s eye. The setting not only decorates but embodies the story’s concerns with transformation, balance, and persistence under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.0)
    Echo gorge, the misaligned harp, the crocodile tooth, and the hidden sunrise are all vividly realized and filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. The environment isn’t decorative: the gorge’s echoing properties and river history enable the spectral confessions and the drowners’ choir, and the final image of the gorge echoing inside the narrator’s ribs recharges the setting at closure. Sensory specificity is high (“thin silver of sound like grass singing beneath ice,” “enamel crazed like sun on broken water”) without becoming cluttered. The world’s rules around sound, memory, and water remain internally consistent and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ultraviolet forest is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through the narrator (“pollen that drinks whatever light is left…returns it as bruised humming”). Environment and object-as-setting (strap, pool) actively charge choices, especially the pool’s stillness as “equation solved” and the branch where the strap is left as a boundary condition. Rules of the place (ultraviolet penance, liturgical maze) are quickly taught and then embodied rather than over-explained. The setting meaningfully mirrors and pressures the inner journey without sliding into heavy-handed symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.0)
    The alchemist’s market above rooftops is vivid, strange, and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility (“wind bells,” “swinging aisles,” “ladders lowering like rain deciding to forgive”). Setting is not postcard-only: ropes, chimneys, and heights underpin the stakes by tying directly into the erased workers and the act of hanging the painting back “as map.” The lighthouse lens functions as a micro-setting/tool that constrains perception and decisively charges the final image under the coat. World rules feel coherent for a fantastical space, taught through action and perception instead of exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is richly evoked and functionally used: bars, glass, paint cracks, fluorescent light, ceiling slats, dust, hatches, cables, and mirrors all matter to both action and theme. Environment directly constrains tactics—the hidden hatch and overhead mechanism can only be accessed by reading dust, using the barrel, and physically climbing into the ceiling. Recurring objects (ticket window, cracks, hatch, barrel) charge the final images of open wood “mouth” and rain-softened midway, tying place to thematic release. The only thing keeping this just shy of the very top band is that the larger circus world remains mostly gestured at rather than more concretely pressurizing present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.3)
    The glass orchard on a cloud sea is not decorative; its buoyancy and fragility directly shape stakes (a rupture could “puncture our buoyancy”). Details like panes as fruit, leaf-veins as script, and frost-as-type are not only vivid but procedural, governing how knowledge is made and risked. Environmental changes—rustling awakenings, the sea of clouds shifting its spine, the seam opening to “make room”—mark and enable narrative turns. The final image of the cooled page within the still-floating orchard shows the setting charging and containing the story’s cost.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.2)
    The baroque asteroid and visible-time environment are extraordinarily vivid—“baroque arches bulge from nickel cliffs, cherubs cut into ore, and gilt veins rise like liturgy from the crust”—and consistently filtered through Neris’s sensibility. Setting is not mere backdrop: storms, walking seconds, and the physical galleries all constrain behavior (covering mirrors, dimming lamps, storm-timed calibration) and enable the shard’s function. The world’s temporal physics and ritual practices directly shape the tribunal’s conduct and the options at stake (conservatory vs quarry). The final harmonies from the asteroid itself charge the closing image, making environment inseparable from theme and outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: the resonance chamber where sound becomes “drifting filaments,” the broken observatory, and midnight-as-town all feel specific and rule-bound. Environmental details constrain tactics—the chamber’s acoustics, the dome’s trapped whispers, and the keyhole-door formed by a backward scale all shape what is possible. Objects-as-setting (the philosopher’s chip, the lamps, the window hinge) directly affect choice and outcome. The final image of morning settling into gears “like oil that smells of apples” powerfully recharges the world and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting work is consistently vivid and purposeful: the cliffs, rusted trestle, conveyor, and limestone lagoon are all tactile and sensorially rich, especially smell and sound. The environment actively shapes the action—the trestle dictates the path, the seam and water constrain movement, and the cave’s hush and petrichor are the very object of the quest. World rules (psychometry, hinged seams) are introduced through concrete interaction with rock and compass rather than expository aside. The final contrast between the subterranean hush and the village now able to “hear waves it forgot” cleanly ties setting to thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is exquisitely rendered and fully integrated: the storm, turbines, basalt arch, and driftwood all structure action and meaning. The archway and available flotsam directly constrain tactics (she shelters and builds only with what the sea offers), and the turbines’ hum modulates her internal state from panic to steadiness. Environmental detail evolves with the story—from threat to tutelary gate—charging the closure. This is publish-ready atmospheric work, only slightly at risk of over-richness in places.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cathedral, cloister gardens, winter melt, and amber pavilion are vividly rendered and always filtered through the artist’s sensibility, giving the setting a lived and thematic precision. Environment actively shapes choices: the etched glass and moonpaths determine how she investigates the flowers, and the pavilion becomes the crucible for her final stance. Recurring environmental motifs (snow, windows, night blossoms, hush) clearly charge the ending image. The piece avoids cataloguing; nearly every concrete detail does double duty for mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and functional: the zeppelin library, black coast, and obsidian lagoon are not just scenery but tools and constraints (vantage point for reading the lattice, the lagoon as cipher mirror). Sensory details (“held night even at noon,” “smelling of dry glue”) are consistently filtered through Mara’s archivist consciousness. The lagoon and zeppelin both directly shape tactics and charge the final image, satisfying the high-band gate. World rules feel stable despite the lyric strangeness.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.2)
    The paper-lantern cove, brittle husks, tide, and cliff-wall map are vividly rendered and fully integrated with action and theme. Environment repeatedly constrains tactics: tide erases chalked plans, the cliff serves as projection screen, the sea supplies objects and metronomic pressure. The amber bottle functions as both tool and micro-setting, literally shaping what can be seen and built. The final image—map on cliff, lantern light, tide’s “softest applause”—is charged by all that prior environmental work.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    The orchard-on-a-skyscraper setting is not decorative—it is the archive, the medium for oaths, and the locus of the final act of writing, so environment and tools literally constrain options. Details like the fog “like a down comforter,” syrup-colored lamp, and humming roots are all filtered through his professional attention, building tone and world-rules together. The trees’ ability to speak and bear etched bark is consistently used, culminating in the pear tree’s Hittite confirmation and the closing act of inscribing prophecy on living wood. Setting and micro-objects (shaving, lamp, bark) charge the final image rather than sit as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    The icebound atrium, cracked dome, and Maxwell-demon “garden that thinks about disorder” are richly realized and inextricable from the premise. Environment directly constrains tactics: the narrator must sing to frost and entropy rather than break doors, and the atrium’s design dictates the method of reopening. The starlight, frost, hinges, and seed racks all evolve with the ritual, culminating in the charged final image of warmth “that has never met the sun.” Density of description is high but consistently filtered through the narrator’s vocation and purpose, so it remains purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tower, ropes, wind, and microclimate instruments are not just backdrop but continuous constraints on perception and choice, culminating in the storm “splitting around the tower” as a direct payoff of attentive reading of the environment. The bell rope functions as a micro-setting object that shapes tactics (muffling, sensor placement) and charges the ending image. Weather is rendered with specificity and evolution—rime loosening, pressure ticking lower—without slipping into generic storm language. This environmental embedding is what allows the silent choice to feel materially consequential rather than abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integral: the mountain station, antennas, mop water, chalk maps, and cold rails all filter through the janitor’s lived use of them. The environment and tools (receivers, shutters, camera plates, tin cup, lantern glass) concretely shape tactics during the climax and charge the final image of mutual breathing. Weather and sky (meteor showers, “dark spine of air”) are not backdrop but active pressure and resource. The station’s physical presence and rules are so bound to the stakes that changing the setting would fundamentally alter the story.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    The beekeeping oasis, black sand, empty hives, and irrigation channels are vivid, specific, and constantly in play. Setting is not postcard backdrop: the hives become “parentheses,” the box sits on a hive lid, and the final “hives clicked yes” clearly charges the closing image. Environmental logic (scorch, ash, winds, ghosts, bees) remains consistent and strongly filtered through Mara’s sensibility. The desert/oasis covenant meaningfully constrains what action is possible (listening and ritual rather than speech), satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is vivid and thematically fused: the rye “sugar-lit,” the emerald silo, the lilac/graphite scent, and tactile time-textures all read as one coherent world. The silo, capsule, and market/garage sale space meaningfully shape tactics and the final image; they’re not postcard backdrops. Sensory range is excellent, especially in non-visual modalities (taste, texture, smell) that reinforce the core conceit about time. A slight risk of over-richness exists, but the details remain purposeful and filtered through the narrator’s priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cobalt lagoon after rain, reeds, gulls, and wind are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. Environment is not postcard backdrop: it supplies the feather, the snagging reed, and the launch mast, and the wind’s behavior governs both problem and solution. Atmosphere (“burnished hush,” “air holds stillness like a cup warm from someone’s hands”) saturates the theme of attentive, imperfect beauty. The setting tangibly charges the final images of shoulders against bruised clouds and the braid glinting at tomorrow’s dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    The temple orchard and living stone pillars are vividly, specifically rendered and inseparable from the story’s logic: they constrain choices (learning the “electric grammar,” arranging trees to open a door) and fully charge the final image of the listening ceremony. Sensory detail is rich and purposeful across senses (“smelling of nut skin and crushed lightning”), always filtered through the caretaker’s botanical, devotional eye. Environment, tools (copper wire, diary), and body all participate in the closure without excess world-exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is exceptionally integrated: garden sculptures, overgrown paths, lilac, rain, and the “rainwashed tower” all matter to how the experiment works and what it means. Weather and materials (dust ignoring rain, resin, stone) literally shape the method and the final ratio “resin to stone to rain” that encodes home. The tower as threshold and the amber as “pocket fossil of sunlight” charge the final image of stepping into the “rinsed world.” Environment is never postcard; it is the apparatus and metaphor of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.1)
    The jetty, dead reef, birds, and tide are exquisitely rendered and function as constraints and tools, not postcard backdrop: the dead reef becomes fertilizer, the jetty is a shrine/worksite, bird calls map iron and shade. Environmental specificity is deeply filtered through the coachman’s sensibility (routes, treaties, grammar), giving the setting a lived, idiosyncratic texture. The rules of this world—peace written between coral and roots, then undone by bleaching—are consistent and discovered through action. The final images of the jetty at twilight and the garden signing its name are charged by everything we’ve learned about this place.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.2)
    The scrapyard settlement and cracked wasteland are rendered with striking, economical specificity—“constellations made of cranes” and “a river swallowing its shyness beneath our feet” give a distinctive, lived-in world. Environment materially constrains and shapes action: salvage tech enables the phonograph, rusted infrastructure hides the river, scarcity of water sharpens every choice. The recurring objects-as-setting (leaf, cylinders, pipes) actively charge the final image rather than serving as decor. The setting’s tone and logic stay consistent, and the world rules (post-resource-war salvage economy) are taught through action instead of exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.1)
    The time dilation observation deck, glass dome, city, river, and mineral valley are all sharply realized and filtered through the narrator’s scientific and familial obsessions. Setting isn’t backdrop; the deck’s time-smear, the river’s reflections, and especially the bedrock valley actively shape what she can perceive and how she resolves the core problem. The compass and viewport-paper function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image and constrain her method. World rules (temporal gradients, residual echoes) are consistently applied and crucial to the story’s logic and ending.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    The icebound spire, wrong sky, and frozen tide clock are precise, atmospheric, and integral—environment and objects continually constrain or enable choices (the climb, the traps, the niche for the lid). Weather and altitude pressure them physically and spiritually, while the inner architecture (mirror boards, spiraling stair, column of cold light) gates progression. The setting’s rules around time and vows stay internally coherent in a mythic mode. The final image—emerging into a still-wrong, now-adopted sky—feels inextricable from this exact setting.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    The whispering gallery, concentric tiles, oculus, red cord, and altered acoustics are vivid and tightly integrated with action and theme; the setting literally dictates how memory is written and read (“we write by feet”). The environment constrains choices (where to stand, how to walk) and charges the final image, with words inscribed by movement and held by the dome “as a lantern holds the idea of fire.” Sensory detail (iodine, smoke, sirens as a crown) is selective, purposeful, and filtered through the narrator’s trauma. World rules stay consistent and are learned through embodied use rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is extraordinarily vivid and fully integrated: the mountain bookstore’s shifting aisles, thunder-filled rock, and rotunda-atlas all shape what is possible and how choices feel. The environment repeatedly constrains and charges action—the need to offer a key to enter, the reconfigured rooms that “reformat” the narrator, the rotunda where north “refuses to stay,” and finally the mountain reshaping “a small room that opens like a palm.” Sensory detail (smells of glue/ash/rain, mercury-glass reflections, the stone’s “veined… storms”) is purposeful rather than touristic. The final image of a practicable home is inseparable from this peculiar geography.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    The time-frozen village, mid-air snow, pinned crows, and platinum labyrinth create a vivid, coherent environment that shapes options—only the tapestry’s spatial logic allows him to reach each villager. Setting details like the well, bakery, and square are not postcard filler; they are directly tied to specific thread corrections and lives. Weather and thunder subtly influence rhythm and stakes. The final bench by the gleaming platinum and receding thunder beautifully charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    The canyon of bone and echoes and the pale spire are richly imagined and tightly integrated: the environment literally enables the tactic (poems refracting via echoes) and charges the final image. Details are selective and filtered through the narrator’s sensibility (“towers of bone,” “forged hush”), avoiding tour-guide listing. Spatial and rule consistency are strong; the echo behavior becomes a world law that structures action. The only thing keeping this from an even higher band is that we never see physical constraints (terrain, distance) actively change a choice in-scene beyond the echo mechanic.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    The acid sea, floating workshop, and neutralizing vat are not just decorative; they directly constrain his tactics (working “between breaths held underwater,” greasing gloves with limefat, the workshop drifting once the engine revives). Specific, inventive details—storms turning into scrolls, foam into “whispering mouths”—sustain a charged atmosphere that fits his alchemical craft. The statue-as-prow and heartplate function as micro-settings that shape each step of his repair method. A slight trim of purely ornamental flourish could make the setting’s pressure feel even tighter, but as-is it strongly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and lived-in, from the “rented room above the quay” to the “slit in the ceiling” that lays a blade of light across the pool. Environmental constraints (tides, flooded split, lamp light, rising/falling floor) plausibly shape choices and access, not just atmosphere. Recurring objects-as-setting (mirror, pool, shell) charge the final images: leaving the canvas to the tide and returning with the shell reframes the room and harbor light. A touch more tactile interaction with the physical risk of caves and tide could push this toward true 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting and atmosphere are outstanding: the cobalt lighthouse, cooled sea, and garden scent are sensorially vivid and consistently filtered through the keeper’s sensibility. The environment meaningfully constrains tactics—the broken radio and bullying foghorn make his reliance on light and scent feel necessary, not ornamental. The cobalt lens and dawn light charge the final image of angled shutters and low-set beam, making the place itself complicit in the act of calling Mara home. Spatial and sensory choreography stay clear even within heavily figurative language.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is vivid, strange, and fully integrated: signal station, frozen dish, rusting tramline, drowned orchard, and harbor-ribcage are all seen through the navigator’s functional, grief-sensitized eye. Environmental conditions (moon phase, floodplains, sinkholes, shells) directly shape tactics and route choices. The censer foot functions as a micro-setting tool that constrains action and charges the final image of sleep. World rules about signal behavior and landscape are consistent enough to feel lived-in despite their surreal tilt.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    The hanging orchard, ravine, storms, cables, and mycelium are vivid, specific, and filtered through the forager’s sensibility, avoiding generic dystopia. Setting images evolve and recur (“cables after weather,” trees listening, storms returning), charging the atmosphere and the final line. The environment does exert some pressure (torrent crossing, battered ravine), though most of its function is thematic and tonal rather than strictly constraining tactics. Still, it deeply inflects the piece’s meaning and closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is richly specific (opal dock, mist, slate water, lightroom) and consistently filtered through the keeper’s sensibility so it never feels like static description. The lighthouse and harbor directly constrain choices: his only way to act is through beam modulation and ritual returns to the dock. Recurring objects-as-setting—the flower, oilskin, jar of salt—charge the final image with a sense of duty and preservation. A hairline concern is that the intensity of description is uniformly high, which slightly blurs urgency hierarchy between high- and low-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vivid, textured, and always in play: the rising creek, heat-hazed valley, and blooming cavern all constrain movement and meaningfully affect choices. Environmental and object micro-settings (the shop as “high ground,” the chip, the ants) charge the final image and directly inform tactics like stacking pallets as a bridge. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (“sound like torn silk,” “cool breath scented with blossom and stone”) without stalling momentum. World rules, including the fantastical doorway, are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: salt glass halls, cobalt grotto, ember grotto, and “bleeding starlight” are not décor but the actual medium of the conflict and solution. The dual grottoes as “lungs” constrain her tactics and charge the final image of a new, kind wind between them. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with taste (“snow and rust”) and texture (“liquid cloth”) reinforcing the queen’s inner state. A marginally clearer sense of the broader world’s geography or cost beyond the sky wound could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly realized and integrated: the ember nexus, steam, grates, twilight, and plaza all function as more than backdrop, becoming a kind of ritual instrument that listens and responds. The reactor and nautilus spine operate as micro-settings/tools that constrain action and charge the ending image (tucking the spiral to sleep). City details like merchants, courier, and swearing cart tie the metaphysical experiment back to a lived urban fabric, so the altered “sturdiness” of the city at the end feels grounded. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though heavily tilted toward visual and metaphorical texture.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting and atmosphere are exceptional: the mountain ranger cabin, grave on the ridge, birch bark scroll, and unstable clock are sensorially vivid and deeply filtered through the POV. The environment constrains and charges choices—the mountain “answering” through rafters, the grave as locus of return, the scroll as literalized landscape/memory, the stove and wind shaping mood and tempo. These environmental elements recur and actively charge the final acts of reading at the ridge and leaving with the rattling scroll. The specificity feels inextricable from theme and action; swapping this place for another would break the story.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.0)
    The water clock shop, fog, glass domes, and tools are vividly rendered and always filtered through the narrator’s altered sensory priorities. Setting details like “occluded views,” condensation, and the bone pin directly constrain tactics and shape the repair’s mechanics. The environment mirrors and enables the thematic work of time, care, and translation without feeling like mere symbol. The shop as a dawn refuge for “ordinary miracles” meaningfully charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    The floating rock platform, chains, stormleaf tea, and storm weather are not just decorative; they shape constraint (altitude tied to childhood fall, chains going silent, storm timing) and charge the final image (“brewed here between tempests”). Sensory detail is lush yet purposeful, with weather, porcelain, steam, and light all filtered through the rune scholar’s priorities. The tea as micro-setting—its surface behavior constraining success—beautifully satisfies the “object as environment” test. The environment evolves with events (hush, frost, loosening, returning sound) in a way that tracks both plot and internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sheet music archive and doomed orchard are vividly and specifically rendered—“fluorescents hummed like bees drunk on toner,” saws starting outside, the scores smelling of “sap, dust, and last chances.” Setting isn’t decorative; it actively shapes what’s possible (using scores, shelves, copper, generator, bottle) and charges the ending image of music outlasting the trees. The orchard’s destruction and the archive’s interior atmosphere directly mirror and constrain the emotional choices in the scene. A touch more spatial choreography of the room under strain would be the only possible refinement.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “ancient temple library lost in time,” spiral aisles, and dais of spiral arbitration are vivid and integrated; walking the space literally drives the arbitration. Details like “shelves curved like ribs” and a “window that showed no outside” anchor an otherworldly yet coherent environment. The setting meaningfully constrains action—judgment can only occur through circular movement and relation to shelves, dais, and door/breath. There’s still room for more tactile or sensory variance beyond sight and sound to deepen embodiment in this charged place.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fjord, station, hydraulic chambers, smoked glass, and weather are rendered with exceptional specificity and sensory tactility, all tightly filtered through the narrator’s professional eye. Setting isn’t postcard background; it constrains behavior (night shift solitude, dependence on floats, valves, and horizon line) and directly shapes his choices. Recurring objects—the mantle clock, key, petcock, needle, horizon—charge the final image and the thematic arc about measurement and boundary. The piece fully meets top-tier standards here, capped only by global scoring constraints rather than any on-page weakness.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vivid and specific—the glow racks, chartreuse caps, humidity sheets, and membranes that “exhale” are all filtered through an intrusion specialist’s gaze. Environment is not just decorative; the permeable barriers, mycelial network, and light pulses directly shape what constitutes a “breach” and how the characters can move and sense. The final image of the farm answering the sparrow “with a steadiness that felt like morning arriving from within” charges the setting with thematic weight. A hair shy of the very top tier only because some striking images verge on lush for the pressure level, but they remain coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rainwashed library, the mica-paned lantern, and the nearby ward are rendered with vivid, economical detail that’s always filtered through her probabilistic, grief-tuned attention (“clover melancholy” is emblematic). Environment shapes perception and action: the rain, the proximity of ward and stacks, and the leak hissing on the lantern all pressure her toward leaving the archive to tend her father. The lantern functions as a micro-setting, altering light quality and symbolically holding two “ways of seeing” that charge the final image. Weather and interior space evolve with the story’s emotional shifts rather than sitting as static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    The subway utility tunnel, streetlamp hum, and rail vibrations are vivid, selective, and tightly tied to mood; the city “exhales through grates like a sleeping furnace” is a strong atmospheric anchor. The disc and the copper lines function as micro-setting tools that shape tactics (she literally uses the disc to affect calls, the lines to loop people). Environment doesn’t heavily constrain options, but it charges the premise: this has to be a hidden, liminal place for anonymous wrong-number friendships to work. The final return to the tunnel and lamps meaningfully charges the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    The jetty, tide, and sea are exquisitely rendered and always filtered through the archivist’s sensibility (“the jetty blooms as if the water wears a wrist corsage,” “a lung learning itself”), charging both mood and meaning. Environmental details constrain choice and timing: she waits for the tide to inhale and the pier lights to click on before beginning, and the sea’s pulse underlies the covenant’s stakes. Tools and objects (brazier, kettle, hulls, ledger, locket) are physicalized and recur in the ending image. The only reason this doesn’t climb higher is that environmental constraint is primarily tonal/ritual rather than forcing a sharper tactical dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.1)
    The disused, ivy-overgrown station is vivid and integral: it’s not just a backdrop but the structural hub where people converge and trades occur. Recurring objects—the ledger, platform, ivy, and rock—are tightly tied to place and culminate in the final image of the rock on the platform with ivy “testing its patience.” Environmental logic governs behavior (people come because floods spared tracks but drowned the timetable; the station becomes a camp and then “home”). The setting’s shift from ruin to communal anchor charges the ending and constrains how Mara can act (as organizer rather than resident).

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ultrasonic forest and its acoustic-energetic logic saturate the piece and are always filtered through his tactile/listening bias, yielding vivid, original images (cedar “grammar,” deer of echoes, nave of branches). The platinum ring and the clearing function as micro-settings that meaningfully constrain choice and directly charge the final image. World rules are consistent: vibration, tone, and pressure structure both navigation and revelation. The lushness is purposeful rather than touristic, though the atmosphere slightly outweighs immediate jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Station Rursus, the listening well, the gravitational anomaly, and the docking spine are vividly rendered and feel lived-in, with details like “coolant beads” and “a tide with no moon” doing double duty for worldbuilding and mood. The environment does exert pressure—anomaly flexes, docking risks—but more as a conceptual and tonal constraint than as a hands-on tactical obstacle. The pen functions as a powerful micro-setting object that constrains and enables the key choice. Overall, setting is specific, integrated, and thematically aligned without tipping into static description.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    The harbor is not postcard décor; the regatta, tides, moonlight, and physical pier concretely shape what’s possible (the countercurrent performance, the boats slowing, the police launch approaching). Environmental details are sharply filtered through the narrator’s sensibility (“tides hum their patient arithmetic,” “chalk the pier with soft constellations”) and evolve with the action as the harbor begins to “answer.” The micro-setting of the vintage camera’s body and the pier chalking acts as object-as-setting, charging the final home scene. The mood—luminous, saline, nocturnal—perfectly undergirds the thematic work on remembrance and silence.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is exceptionally vivid and purposeful, from the bullet-pocked museum to the salt flats and “archive breathed like a sleeping whale,” with environmental details consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. Crucially, objects and spaces constrain choices: the tapestry fragment unlocks the secret chamber; the stone-mouth doors and “guard of silence” gate progression; the burned block and jarred matches charge the final image. The archive’s world-rules (portraits, niches, breath reels) feel coherent and meaningfully strange without exposition dump. There is minor risk of imagistic overload, but clarity and spatial logic hold throughout, especially in the archive sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sound wave garden is sharply imagined and tightly integrated—hedges as frequencies, the auric lagoon as the interface where memories overlap, rails that pulse warnings. Environmental specifics constantly interact with action (drumming on benches and railings, the lagoon’s gold sheet rising to her ribs), not just decorate. The setting actively constrains and enables choices and charges the final image of leaving with “auroral sorrow like a lantern.” This meets the high-band gate where environment and recurring objects are inseparable from both tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    The port labyrinth and storm are superbly realized and function as active constraints: corrugated steel channels sound, vents and catwalks create tactical options, and the geomagnetic storm disrupts radios, justifying the premise. Details feel filtered through a maintenance worker’s eye—seams, drain holes, grating, panels—rather than tourist description. The zodiac coin and maps also act as micro-setting, charging the final image via the mother’s legacy and the idea of foldable worlds. It stops just short of a higher band because, though rich, the environment could push back once more with a concrete obstacle rather than mostly cooperating.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: the cobalt dock, after-rain hush, black arch, moored boats, and shutter-laced alleys all shape not just mood but method (the guardian’s work literally depends on water, alleys, and shutters). The canal as “keeper of thoughts” undergirds the premise and the final reweighting of meaning. The dental mirror and shutters function as environment-linked tools that constrain how aid can be offered (light must be bent, patterns woven, not voices raised). It stops just short of perfection because the physical constraint of the environment could be made to pinch tactics slightly harder in the rescue itself.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the misty cobalt library, the magnetic grotto, and the town’s windows shape both tactics (using panes, sightlines, magnets) and imagery. Environmental specifics—staggering compasses, humming stones, blue-lit mist—do real thematic work about unseen forces and fragile civic space. The grotto and library meaningfully charge the final beats via the council member at the grotto sign and the kids’ return there. A hairline limitation is that physical constraints (e.g., town layout, bulldozer logistics) stay more atmospheric than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.2)
    The maritime setting is vividly and specifically realized—the “sublittoral fringe,” eelgrass combing the hull, kelp forests like cathedrals—which never feels like static backdrop. Environment meaningfully constrains and charges choices: tides, the disappearing island, and the whale’s call dictate when movement is possible. The scrimshaw and the living island function as objects-as-setting that decisively color the final image. Sensory detail remains POV-filtered and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is deeply integrated: turbines as “law,” farmhouse, jars, kettle, broom, and birds all recur and evolve, culminating in the fence-post markers and “repaired shirt” hush. Environment and objects constrain possibilities (isolated farm, looming state power) and charge the final image. Details feel lived-in and filtered through his sensibility rather than decorative. A minor reason this doesn’t push higher is that the physical environment rarely forces tactical choices; it mostly shapes mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integral: the cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and humming quartz colonnade are not mere backdrop but active constraints and enablers (you must cross ice; you must work with the colonnade’s rules). Sensory specificity is rich and purposeful (“smells like cold ink,” “surface like an opinion”), consistently filtered through the piece’s sensibility. Environmental changes track causally with events, especially the lake’s shift from rigid separation to humming participation. The final images—the path over ice, the empty pier with “blank dates,” the hush—are inseparable from this constructed world.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    The courtyard, kiln, cracked phoenix, and herb arrangements are vividly rendered and always doing work; there’s no white-room drift. Setting actively shapes choices—the need for wind across glass, the presence of the kiln and pedestal, the constant availability of shards all channel what kinds of awakenings are possible. The failed phoenix as an object-as-setting charges the final image once it sings and later bears a wreath coded as “home.” World rules (the city’s phoenix ritual, the plant code) are consistent and absorbed through action instead of exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “laboratory of lost sounds,” carbide lamp lens, club door, and blackout city are vivid, specific, and always filtered through the bell ringer’s sensibility. Setting is not postcard backdrop; the lamp lens, bells, and doors materially shape what can be done and charge the final image. Spatial and atmospheric choreography—the corridor of tones, alcove, control room—is clear despite the lyric mode. A slight reason for not going higher is that external physical constraints don’t sharply limit choice; they’re more thematic than tactical, even though they’re beautifully rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory is vividly realized and inseparable from the story’s logic: its “timeless” stillness, brass dome, and artificial stars create the conditions for sustained attention and the curtains’ operation. Setting details are tightly filtered through the jeweler’s eye and grief-state, making the environment feel lived-in rather than decorative. Crucially, the observatory and its mechanisms (railings, ceiling, curtains) constrain tactics and enable the central act of illuminating the lockets, then charge the final image of leaving and returning. The world’s rules (artificial sky, obedient curtains) are consistent and absorbed through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft, cork map, pins, red string, and kettles form a vivid, coherent micro-world that feels tactile and lived-in. Environment and objects aren’t just decorative: rain, chalk, and steam become the signaling infrastructure that makes the final gathering possible, charging the last image of the humming room. Details are sharply filtered through the narrator’s sensibility (“graffiti as footnotes,” “mutual aid spreadsheets as epics”), which deepens both place and theme. The only reason this isn’t higher is that the physical constraints of the space never significantly limit options or force a hard trade, even as they beautifully atmosphere the action.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bronze pagoda and archive are vividly and economically rendered—“stairwells folded through bronze ribs,” “atoms of nostalgia” in quartz cages—and are always filtered through her professional, haunted gaze. The setting actively constrains choices (patterns summon guardians; architecture reshapes in response to her decision) rather than being mere backdrop. Twilight and the city’s “long dusk” return in the final line to charge the thematic reweighting of promises and truth. It’s superbly done and only held below 9 by the global gate, not by any real weakness.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.3)
    The “blooming library above clouds,” petaled shelves, cloud-floor, storms queueing outside, and the western window form a precise, lived-in environment that constantly interacts with action. Setting is never postcard: the returns desk, the catalog’s chime, and especially the window and river stone constrain choices and enable the ritual that resolves the story. World rules (dream lending, shadows feeding, library as sanctuary) remain internally consistent and are learned through use, not exposition. The final image of storms and clouds interrogating the library decisively charges the environment with thematic weight, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting work is exemplary: the sanctuary yard as “misty workshop under stars,” the shed, tools, vials, and the chameleon’s habitat all feel tactile and lived-in. Environmental details are consistently filtered through the wildlife handler’s sensibility, so tools, mesh, fog, and glass are never postcard description. The recurring objects (vials, workbench, chameleon branch lattice) explicitly charge the final image and embody the ethical stakes. The night’s stillness and weather (“wet fog veiling his face”) subtly shape how and when this conversation can happen, giving the environment quiet leverage over the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tower, plants, and objects (hourglass, coffee cup, knife) are not just decorative; they constrain choices and power the plot (hidden service tunnel, rooted ivy, elm at the stair foot). Environmental details are consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility—scars, rings, weather, roots—so atmosphere and theme fuse. The final image of “tower windows glitter like healed skin” recharges the setting as an analogue for the narrator’s reconfigured relationship to scars. This is exemplary object-and-environment-as-setting work for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    The projection booth is rendered with rich, precise sensory detail—the smell of “ghosted popcorn,” glitter from the ceiling, the purring projector—creating a tangible, lived-in world. Setting elements actively shape action: reels, leader, scissors, envelope, and the projector beam all define what can be done and how closure manifests (the blank leader glowing). The world-building feels internally consistent and thematically aligned with decay, memory, and light. A tiny restraint in score comes from sheer density of imagery occasionally edging toward decorative rather than strictly pressure-guided.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    The aurora-lit archway, frost, observatory-instrument, and ink-and-comet realm are richly specific and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the arch functions as portal and constraint, the aurora “answers” her, and the instrument as object-as-setting shapes what’s possible. Environmental details evolve with action (frost shaken loose, windows unlatched) and charge the final image of the arch lit by aurora and the unwritten calendar. A slight pullback from maximal description around the mid-mission might further align density with urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly particular and integrated: the glowing dune in bloom, algae-fed sand, skeletal train, and buried switching yard all feel of a piece and are filtered through the guard’s vocation and task. Environment constrains choice—the archive is “beneath the dunes,” accessed only via railman’s circle and wave-song at this specific cut—and charges the ending as the dune dims and the clock remains. Recurring objects (rails, lamp, chess clock) are spatially coherent and return in the final cadence with reweighted meaning. World rules (post-forest, algae glow, quantum-ritual rail work) remain internally consistent and legible without expository drag.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mechanical rainforest is richly and specifically rendered—“fern cogs,” “metal palms,” “gears for flowers”—and consistently filtered through the narrator’s questing attention. Environment meaningfully constrains and guides choice: the forest refuses straight lines, enforces spiral movement, and the tower’s mouth/mechanism physically requires the gear and the recalled wind-song. The charged recurrence of the gear and the tower as spatial anchors makes the final ascent feel not just atmospheric but structurally necessary. A slight pruning of descriptive density in one or two non-crucial sentences could sharpen impact even further.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is rich, coherent, and constantly doing work: the inlet, stair, switchbacks, and “veiled ridgeway” all shape tactics (waiting, moving in arcs, keeping to shadows) rather than serving as backdrop. Weather and terrain (“mist,” “briars,” “fold where briars soften”) constrain action and give the search its particular mood and method. The recurring physical elements—ridge, fence posts, stamped stars, fog—culminate in the lantern constellation that literally and thematically guides the way back. Environment and objects charge the final image so strongly that the story’s meaning would collapse in a white room.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt fortress, snow, staircase, and hush-engine are not backdrop but active constraints on behavior and meaning: the wards, rugs, and devices literally enforce silence and shape how characters move. The recurring staircase discoloration and the fortress’s exterior vs interior sounds reappear at the end, charging the final image of wind as a choir’s in-breath. Setting is filtered through POV (“bruise pressed against the horizon”) in ways that mirror internal conflict without slipping into pure symbol. Environment and small tools (the bolt, the bell, the bellhop’s sleeve) concretely shape options at the decisive beats.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    The library and its magical mechanics (rune of drift, shifting corridors, starlit bowls, dust as “thoughtful constellations”) are vivid and tightly integrated with plot. Setting repeatedly constrains and enables tactics—the pause of shifting constellations is when letters lift, corridors realign, and the final ritual can occur. Details are selective and distinctive (ledger bound in bark, signet flaking like pantry salt), filtering the world through the story’s archival obsession. The sense of time/era is intentionally mythical, but never disorienting.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sea level monitoring station, the flats, buoys, and posts are vividly realized and always filtered through the narrator’s professional and personal gaze. Environment directly constrains action—the sanctioned crossings, the danger of wider tides, the need for flexible beacons and a bell—and charges the final images of the humming station and sleeved atlas page. World rules around tides, dredging cessation, and lunar nodes stay consistent and are revealed through concrete practice rather than exposition dumps. The only small limit is that weather and physical peril remain more atmospheric than acutely felt, which keeps the setting just shy of maximal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay and buried stone circle are rendered with striking, specific images (“ribcage without a heart,” cranes “arrested mid-gesture”) and feel fully inhabited. Setting meaningfully constrains tactics: patrol lulls, the cracked panels, and the stones’ grounding points all shape how the protagonist can act quietly. The recurring interaction with the stones and the bay charges the final image of communal reconnection, making environment inseparable from theme. It’s extremely strong, just shy of utterly flawless integration.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.0)
    The volcanic hot springs, scaffolds, seedbeds, and living plants are richly specific and always in play, not postcard backdrop: the springs’ heat is the mechanism for unsealing, the reeds/sedges are interlocutors, the reconstruction architecture frames stakes. Environmental detail is firmly filtered through Mara’s sensibility, with images like “tea held to sunrise” and “newborn moonlight” that feel native to this world. The setting constrains tactics (heat/cool cycles, mineral water, terraces of sprig minds) and directly charges the final image of the glowing frond on scaffolds. World rules around ashfall telepathy and ritual heat are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    The arboretum-on-a-cliff is vivid and specific (“glass ribcage holding breath and salt”), and environmental details like fissured paving, rising spray, and whispering eucalyptus tangibly constrain choice. The storm and cliff risk are not postcard backdrop; they directly prompt the relocation and fuel the thematic contrast between spectacle on the overlook and safety/truth in the glasshouse. Setting details evolve with events (storm peaking, light blinking error) and charge the final image of the basin and niche. The lighthouse history and automated beam deepen atmosphere and theme without confusing the geography.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse-library is vivid and specific—fog feathering railings, lens “swimming its silent circles,” belly of the tower with nets and shutter ropes—and these features actively shape what she can do (read keepers’ notes, retrieve “lamp book,” descend into the wick chamber). Weather and architecture constrain and enable action: the climb, the confined dark, the storm hurling outside all mirror and pressure her inner state. The recurring beam/fog/ocean imagery culminates in the restored light sweeping the sea and her internal opening, charging the final image. A tiny further gain in clarity of physical mechanics during the untangling could push this into the absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    The wind-carved encampment, eclipse afterglow, dunes, and ink all create a dense, atmospheric setting fully filtered through the tracker’s sensibility. Environment is not decorative: wind shapes the camp’s architecture, sculpts the ink, and literally teaches the gate’s patterns; the “leftover shadow” after the eclipse conceptually charges what’s being hunted. The recurring tools (ink, drone, scaffolds, beam) function as micro-settings that constrain action and meaning in the climax. It’s richly textured without losing spatial or rule clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “echoing library under snow,” glass dome, pipes, frost cabinets, and blinking catalog lights create a vividly particular environment filtered through the archivist’s sensibility. Weather and architecture (snow muffling sound, cryogenic stacks, dormant cables) are not mere backdrop; they echo and intensify the themes of silence, suspension, and thaw. The final images—plows as commas, blinking lights as unspoken words—show the setting charging the closure with conceptual weight. Environment doesn’t sharply constrain physical options, but it deeply conditions tone and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and constantly in play: the glass dome, heat-held sky, desert roses, and ballast sandbag all constrain how choices are made (“threading them through fractures like stitches”). The physical properties of the dome and storm directly shape tactics in the climax, and the environment’s danger (“Dust will peel the paint from bones if the dome cracks”) is integrated, not decorative. The micro-setting of the sandbag scrap evolves from memento to tool to planted seam, charging the final image of new cuttings “remembering the storm.” This is extremely strong; the only light brake on a 9+ is that the wider world beyond tower/dome remains more suggestive than truly textured.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sound wave garden, constellations, skiff, and rail spike are richly and coherently imagined, with sensory specifics like “stems of sound shivering, petals of resonance” that feel integral rather than decorative. Setting actively shapes tactics—pockets where echoes pool, furrows he poles through—and the rail spike and star milk charge the atmosphere and choices. The environment also charges the final image (the garden sighing behind, sleeping houses ahead), making space itself part of the emotional resolution. A slight risk of image-density crowding in a couple of sentences is the only reason this doesn’t push into the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.0)
    The observatory above the clouds is more than backdrop; its echoing dome, catwalk, shutter, and primary mirror all actively shape action (where logs live, where the technician can delete them, where confrontations occur). Environmental details are filtered through a journalist’s sensibility (“floor hums like a printing press deciding which stars deserve the front page”), fusing setting with theme. The recurring pen nib functions as a micro-setting/tool that constrains choices and charges the final confession scene. The closing image of dawn over the clouds and the city’s coffee subtly reweights the entire setting with the cost of contrition.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “laboratory of lost sounds” is richly realized and constantly functional: reels, consoles, credenza, and amber are all used as tools rather than décor, and the environment shapes available tactics (tattooing the chassis, breathing into the port, threading sound through resin). The atmosphere (“meteor hush”) and tactile specifics (“ash and lavender,” “tide of mothlight”) are integrated with action and emotion rather than paused description. The setting’s rules—where sounds go, how haunted firmware behaves—are consistent enough to carry metaphysical weight without exposition. This is publish-ready world-building at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.2)
    The grotto, mist, sand, and acoustics are not mere backdrop—they constrain behavior (whispering, enforced hush), enable the mandala method, and literally shape how memories and noise are processed. Recurring objects (tile flake, sand, water) evolve in meaning and directly charge the final images (tile cooling/returned, mandala threaded by water, banister gained). Sensory detail is rich yet purposeful, with the environment mirroring internal states without sliding into blunt allegory. The setting’s rules stay consistent and are learned through action, fully meeting the “object-as-setting constrains choice” gate.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is intensely specific and charged: “ancient plaza,” “shattered sky,” charred cedar, ash, and the collapsed minaret all feel tactile and lived-in. Environmental details actively shape events—the plaza stones and mosaic stepping stone are both memory medium and ritual ground, and the plaza’s status as patrol territory drives the central scene. The shattered sky and ruins also mirror the ethical fracture around mercy and law without lapsing into overt symbolism. The recurring physicality of stone, dust, and glass charges the final image of the tessera and the “soft armored rooms,” satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.8)
    The theater-orchard-hedge-maze complex is richly specific and fully integrated, from chiming pears and humming plums to the hidden prop shed and blueprint crate. Setting is not postcard dressing: the maze’s rearrangement, the concealed orchard, and the after-hours theater directly constrain where characters can go and what they can do. Sensory detail is inventive and strongly filtered through the ghost’s synesthesia, giving the world a coherent, idiosyncratic physics that supports the tone. The only reason this doesn’t climb higher is that environmental constraint, while present, never corners the characters into a truly hard on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.0)
    The light painting studio is tactile and functionally integral: breakers, camera rail, fiber wands, storage loft, and the missing grounding strap all shape what they can do. The muscovite shard as a recurring object-setting hybrid constrains and enables action by turning incoming thoughts into “veins” and a literal path to the loft. Spatial choreography is clear enough to support the discovery of the ladder of light and climb. The environment also mirrors theme—the studio as lab for ethical empathy—without feeling over-signaled.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.0)
    The coastal cave network and mineral pool are richly, precisely rendered, with sensory detail tied directly to action (tight elbow, floating, surge, plankton light). Environment constrains choices—she must skim on her back through the narrowing passage, time movement with swell, and the chamber’s acoustics enable the chord that drives the ending. The elm leaf fossil operates as a micro-setting object whose physical presence charges multiple beats and the final broadcast. World rules around storms, hibernation, and coastal erosion are consistently implied through setting rather than dumped.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.1)
    The “amber warehouse beneath cliffs” and the cliffs/sea themselves are vivid, coherently imagined, and constantly active in the story’s logic. Setting constrains and enables choices: the warehouse’s jars, buttons, and hourglasses provide the method and tools; the cliffs and sea define the prophecy’s threat and the rain road’s payoff. Environmental elements evolve with events (the cliffs “hold their breath,” then open a seam; the warehouse grows “heavier and brighter” with salvaged crates). The final images—the rain road, the brightened warehouse, the re-corked echo—are all charged directly by place, not just draped in it.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting and atmosphere are outstanding: the misted bluff, murmuring sea, rime-patched snow, and gray hut all feel tactile and filtered through a spy’s wary, poetic eye. Environment and object function as micro-setting constraints—the snow enables the codes, the path and cliffs shape movement, the hut and radio define the mission’s physical endpoint. Weather and season (“tilt…toward spring,” thawing drops) subtly mirror thawing courage without becoming heavy-handed. This is fully publishable-level scene-building with both mood and functional constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.2)
    The fog-bound ford, tollhouse, gutters, and ferry chain are vivid and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility, with water and textile imagery braided throughout. Environment directly constrains choice (swollen ford, need to wait for the gutters, fog muting the bell) and shapes the metaphoric logic of the vow as current and channel. Recurring objects — river, chain, gutters — charge the final crossing image, where “the opposite bank” reads as both literal and moral answer. Description remains purposeful rather than touristic, always in service of tension and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.2)
    The “abandoned beekeeping oasis in a scorched wasteland” is not backdrop but the central pressure: collapsed hives, brittle windbreaks, kiln smoke, and clay all constrain what can happen and why it matters. The environment’s rule—curving toward kindness instead of sun—is worldbuilding and thematic engine, and specific objects (honey house, trough, bowl, lantern glass) recur to shape choices and the final image. The setting’s logic is consistent and learned by watching it react, not through exposition, and the final scene with the mended bowl and lantern glass in water is charged by every prior environmental detail. It reads as a fully realized micro-world whose physical texture and metaphysics are inseparable.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is exquisitely specific and always functional: the harbor, roof, stairwell, and fire escape each shape what is possible (moonlight as resource, padlocked door as obstacle, transom as conduit). Environmental details are filtered through the narrator’s sensibility, so images like “harbor spills light like milk” and tar “that keeps yesterday’s sun” reinforce both world and theme. The lock tooth, mirrors, rosebush, and thorns operate as micro-settings/tools that constrain choices and charge the final image. Geography and spatial choreography remain clear throughout despite the lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: the tidal library, cloudlight, hum of the stone circle, wet-lipped spines, and marginalia of hair all feel specific and lived-in. Environment and tools actively constrain action—the moving stacks, the stone circle under the floor, and the sundial’s light determine how the narrator reaches the wing and accesses memory. The final image (“between shelves and sky”) is charged by this environment, which has been steadily elaborated and reweighted. There are no spatial or logical glitches; if anything, the richness is slightly under-leveraged for additional tactical constraints under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, dragonflies, and storm-soaked city are not mere backdrop; they dictate action (coming to dry letters, finding the flood-loosened nest, using the colonnade and balusters as the installation’s armature). The nest at the center, the ribbon, and the prismatic water charge the final image and embody the “thread that connects all things.” Weather and water actively shape what’s possible (letters swollen, nest adrift, people sheltering under the colonnade). The setting’s textures remain tightly filtered through the narrator’s sensibility, keeping it vivid yet purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    The university radio station and its tech are rendered with rich, lived-in specificity—dust, coffee, solder, humming tower, grease-stained charts—and these aren’t decorative; they constrain tactics (graveyard shift access, subsonic-capable transmitter, physical charts that dictate timing). The surrounding campus (vigils, barricades, drums on the quad) heightens atmosphere and stakes, clearly situating the conflict in a social as well as physical environment. The final images—folding the charts, sun sliding up the tower—recharge earlier setting details and charge the ending thematically. Description density is high but always filtered through the narrator’s technical and ethical preoccupations, so it rarely feels touristic or static.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting work is excellent: the mutinous city, the square “where shadows pooled like spilt ink,” and the nave “that smelled of candle ash and wet stone” all feel specific and lived-in. Environment constrains action—she must work during the fallow period, still the writhing streets with organ notes, and act before space tightens again. Recurring anchors (square, organ loft, nail, stones) charge the final image of her touching the stones and promising return. World rules around spatial mutiny are consistent enough to support the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    The quarry, mist, silted water, and tools (pole, metronome, ribbon) are exquisitely integrated into both atmosphere and choice—Lio’s respect for “what slept in mud” constrains his method, and the mist literally and figuratively obscures faces. Environmental details are filtered through his unusual sensory priorities (sound, texture, temperature of grief), giving the setting a distinct POV bias. The quarry’s conditions enable the key tactic (lancing the water) and charge the final image of the painting, making the place inseparable from the story’s stakes. Description is dense but not static; it evolves with the action.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is extraordinarily tactile and integrated: plywood floors that never dry, a coughing intercom, the sweating cliff, and saturated air all shape mood and environment. The station and its tools (kite, intake, box of vials, map room table) directly constrain action and choices, especially the nail bridging the sensor and opening the intake. Weather and water are omnipresent and thematically aligned with drowned histories and shifting routes. The final image of the nail pressed into the map table charges both object and place with accumulated meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting work is outstanding: the mountain pullout, ravine, burnt switchback, and crevice are sensorially rich and always filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. Environment and objects actively shape choices—the scaffold wrap dictates the path, the cairn and flake literally channel light into the crevice, and fireweed/ash mirror the thematic arc of renewal. Spatial choreography is clean despite the lyric density, and the natural world’s behavior (wind, plastic, burned soil) feels both concrete and enchanted. The landscape also charges the final image of a bridge “finding itself,” tying environment directly to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned circus train and the city/office are rendered with vivid, selective detail (“held the last of daylight like a cupped flame,” “notes of straw and grease”) and filtered tightly through the narrator’s sensibility. The setting is not just backdrop: the cars and doors become literal territorial markers that extend his old methods into a new moral experiment, and the river/dark final image recharges the train-as-orbit metaphor. Sensory balance leans visual but integrates smell and tactility strategically. It stops a bit short of 9-band only because the environment lightly constrains choices rather than forcing a hard tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory, dome, and instruments are vividly and economically rendered—the dome “breathed like a sleeping whale,” the lenses “drink the punctured ledger of the sky”—and the environment feels fully inhabited rather than postcarded. Setting actively shapes tactics: decoding literally depends on access to the variable stars and the observatory’s tools, and the dome’s hum and darkness charge the ending beat. The daylily as recurring object functions as a micro-setting element that constrains how they navigate loss and understanding, especially once its petals are tied to amplitudes and then pressed into the ledger. A small limitation is that the physical layout of the observatory is more atmospheric than tactical, but at this length that’s appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is extraordinarily vivid and tightly integrated: the “swirling orchard vortex,” drowned trees, orbiting apples, and disk of ice are not decorative but constitute the problem-space and the mechanism of Ren’s crime. Environmental constraints (the cursed lake’s spin, the ice that can’t be shattered, the exiled roots) shape Issa’s tactics and the necessity of the seed and “expanding circles.” The final image—lake reflecting “nothing but winter sky and a steady woman,” orchard leaning “toward dawn…to stand down”—is charged by everything we’ve learned about this place. The only minor limitation is that physical danger from the environment remains more symbolic than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt glade, roots, dusk, and eclipse are not decorative; they constrain options (the narrator’s literal root-binding), dictate timing (dusk, eclipse/cheated time), and charge the ritual mechanics (paths waking under grass, room beneath the opening). Environmental and bodily setting fuse—roots, scars, and loam are all extensions of place—and this union drives the final image of being “threaded to every quiet traveler.” World rules, though surreal, are consistent and taught through action (pressing the clipping, scars as map). The only small ceiling is that beyond the glade we get little sense of a wider world, which is acceptable but keeps the scale tightly mythic.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “catacomb orchard” with roots between bones, skulls grafted with pear trees, and half-lit corridors is vividly realized and tightly integrated with the conflict—the roots clutch, the pear becomes the graft point, the orchard is finally revealed as a loom. Environmental details consistently mirror and constrain choices rather than sitting as backdrop. The recurring objects (lantern, card, pears) charge the final images of leaving with their own “lantern” and promising to return when the pears ripen. A hairline reservation is that description is almost uniformly lush, leaving few plainer tactile anchors that might further sharpen contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    The quarry and office trailer are vividly realized through sound, dust, and tremors, and the environment’s acoustics are integral to both memory (“free reverb”) and the present task. Echo Bench and the idea of the valley as an amphitheater turn setting into an active pressure: the buried gear and dwindling trucks create urgency and define what’s at risk. Details like the trembling desk, flickering maps, and the cloth pinned “like a moth” are all filtered through a sound-obsessed, road-worn eye. The final step out into the valley, treated as a patient calling its doctor, strongly charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Magnetic arbor, iron boughs, rails, coils, and storm-saturated air are specific, sensorial, and inseparable from the action. Setting actively constrains and enables choices—the cross of rails, the magnetic fields, and the storm-charged height are the very medium of her experiment and translation. Environmental details (“rails answer by ringing like bowls,” “arcs like ribs”) evolve with each step and charge the final image of the arbor as warm with her mentor’s hands. This is an exemplary case of atmosphere and world-building doing story work rather than ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tidal atrium, moonrails, creel, and furnace are vivid, sensorial, and deeply integrated into action rather than postcarded. Environmental rules (tide, moon phases, migrating identities) remain consistent and shape what is possible, especially in the smelting and footprint-calendar moves. The final image of the sea annotating their breaths and the absent tomorrow recharges the entire setting as an active collaborator in meaning. This is very high-level atmosphere work, just shy of flawless due to its largely contemplative rather than constraining function.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    The crystal caves and bunker are exquisitely integrated into action and theme: the glass-hand mountain, mirror pool, singing crystals, and central stalagmite all constrain and shape her choices. The final image of the mountain wearing its circlet “like a bell too wise for ringing” directly charges closure, making environment inseparable from the emotional and conceptual stakes. Sensory detail—sound, light, touch—is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding a tourist catalog feel. At this standard, the setting work is publishable as-is.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    The disused ivy-choked station is vividly rendered and never ornamental; its features—bathroom, graffiti, WSP plate, freight gate, platform—directly shape the investigative path and the ultimate act at the culvert. Sensory detail is economical yet lush (“smelled like wet coins and nettles,” “tracks flashed with mica like dragon teeth”), and the environment clearly constrains choices (she must follow pipes, pry a specific portal, leave notes for city crews). Recurring environmental elements (ivy clicking, culvert as lung) charge the closing image with a living, haunted texture. The station’s decay mirrors her moral neglect without tipping into heavy-handed symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vividly and consistently rendered—fog as handwriting, marsh giving way to “stacked light,” the vapor door with rotating runes—and always filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. Environment and objects (fog, harbor distance, the mist-door) materially constrain choices via propagation delays and timing puzzles, so this is not mere atmosphere. The recurring mist and glow also charge the final image, tying world-logic to theme. A touch more tactile or bodily grounding under stress could push this toward the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    The observatory, velvet, plants, and the ice violin form a tightly integrated environment that constantly shapes perception and choice. The setting isn’t decorative: midsummer heat and indoor plants make melting and root-propagation feel inevitable tactics. The violin as a recurring object constrains the core dilemma (play and destroy vs preserve and collude) and charges the final river image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the narrator’s professional and psychic biases, sustaining atmosphere without white-room gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    The skyborne grotto and aurora are rendered with exceptional specificity and used as more than backdrop: silence, height, and light actively shape the ritual’s mechanics and mood. Environmental details (condensation that “chose not to fall,” ribbons of green like lungs) are strongly filtered through her professional and personal gaze. The aurora’s behavior and the grotto’s “listening” directly charge the climax and the final image of holding the threshold. A slight excess of atmospheric detail in the midsection risks redundancy but does not materially slow or blur the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.2)
    The “umbral grotto above the clouds” and vineyard are deeply integrated and shape all tactics: water scarcity drives fog-catching, scalloped basins, and patience as labor. Environmental details (wind, fog, clay, cliff, spruce) are filtered through the vintner’s priorities and affect choices about pruning and reflection. The hairpin and basins function as micro-setting objects that directly charge the final images. Atmosphere and world-rules remain consistent and lived-in throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse, wind, and chimes are not postcard decor; they’re the operational machinery of the “conscience” service and directly encode the decision method. Objects-as-setting (chimes, cloak, shard, ledger) are tightly woven into action, and the environment’s breeziness literally animates the chime-ritual that guides Mara’s choice. The final image of the shard making a “window in the paper” depends on the spatial and tactile world having been carefully built. It stops just shy of 9+ because the physical constraints of the place don’t meaningfully limit options beyond enabling the ritual—richly used, but not quite binding.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    The environment is vivid and integral: the floating platform, magnetic grotto, iron sand, and sycamores are not postcard details but the actual mechanism and metaphor of the lesson. The pond and iron sand constrain action (must throw pebble, must watch ripples and letters) and directly charge the final image where the message appears and the researcher vanishes. World rules (floating rock, magnetic hum) feel internally consistent and are taught through observation rather than exposition. A hairline limitation is that sycamores and starlight, while atmospheric, do slightly more mood work than pressure work compared to the pond/grotto system.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    The canyon of bone and echoes is vividly realized and constantly interacted with: ribs are tapped, towers keep “ledger and liturgy,” marrow carries ripples, and the space literally maps itself in sound. Environmental constraints—acoustics, petrified bone, absence of river—dictate her still, sonic method of navigation and make alternative tactics (conventional travel) conceptually beside the point. The recurring objects-as-setting (bone towers, dust, arrowhead) all charge the final images: the canyon “breathes a paragraph” and “a book closing on its own spine.” This setting could not be swapped for another without breaking the story’s logic and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    The icebound spire, mist staircase, hanging garden, and city of automated ateliers are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. Setting isn’t postcard background: mist walking, cold, ice, and altitude directly shape what’s possible (the ascent, the keystone touch, the revealed pathways). The keystone and spire charge the final images of “handmade silence” and “brilliant dimness,” giving the environment thematic weight. This is elite-level atmosphere, only held from higher by the already-dense figurative layer leaving little room for further dynamic environmental shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.0)
    The harbor, lantern-filled sky, and underwater “forgotten library” are richly rendered and tightly integrated with action and theme. Environment genuinely constrains choices (low tide bell, pilings, skiff, the sunken ship’s ribs and cabinet) and charges the final image of lantern constellations seen through the wreck. Sensory detail is multi-modal and POV-filtered (“water changed sound the way a dress changes color in shadow”), never feeling like tourist cataloguing. The recurring objects-as-setting (lamps, key tag, wreck) directly shape tactics and the story’s reconfigured ending.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ambered observatory deck, railings, coolant, and arrays are vivid, specific, and integral to action—the setting literally supplies the resource that makes the ritual possible and constrains tactics (“the arrays thirst,” “last drips from the coil”). Environmental detail is tightly filtered through the narrator’s sensibility (“old honey,” “condensed memory of exploded winters and suns”), charging the atmosphere and the final image of being “held by the amber.” The world’s physical rules (amber residue, static interpretation, contraction) stay internally consistent and are learned through use rather than exposition. This is publish-ready scene-setting with both mood and functional constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ancient observatory, dome, projector, and dusk light are not mere backdrop; they are the machinery that makes “scattered light” and crystallization possible. The atlas page, prism, dust, and stone cold are all filtered through the reaper’s sensibility and mirror the emotional work. Environment meaningfully constrains method (needs mirrors, prism, and low light) and charges the final image of the observatory guarding their lexicon. Rich atmosphere verges on luxuriant but remains purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sapphire viaduct, slag-glass mortar, weeping stone, and flat sea are richly specific and consistently filtered through Nera’s ritual focus. Environment is not postcard-only: the arch’s dripping seam literally enables her method, the blue stones and dawn light modulate time and atmosphere, and the bell is physically tied into the structure. The final image—bell slung where the arch weeps, the viaduct ringing in her bones—shows setting and object charging the closure. This is high-level, integrated worldbuilding, only held back from perfection by the story’s small physical radius.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and fully integrated: the drained reservoir town, porches as “ribs,” chimneys that “blink,” and the ridgeway all shape tone and possibility. The levee and water levels constrain action (limited time before reflooding, official oversight) and thematically echo memory’s submergence. Recurring objects—the wind chime, label, lanterns, ridge—culminate in a final image where environment and memory entwine (“the label will slip back to sleep, but the stories will keep the chime awake”). Details are always POV-filtered and purposeful, never touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is vividly particular and fully integrated: the hidden orchard, kaleidoscopic waterfall, moss, brazier, and bees all function as more than backdrop. Environmental features shape both experience and choice—the waterfall teaches rhythm, the moss cradles the crystal, the hidden orchard anchors family memory and vulnerability. The final images (waterfall ribboning her hands, bees keeping time, “ancient freshness” circling back) clearly charge the closure and reweight the opening. This is exemplary, with atmosphere and concrete setting inseparable from the character’s inner work.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    The nocturnal arbor above the clouds is vividly realized and functionally constraining: ropewalks, lantern braids, wooden “arteries,” and cloud/lightning behavior all shape tactics and mood. Environmental specifics (height, trees, clouds, lantern lines) interact with tools (harness, buckle, cables) to govern what is possible in the crisis and to charge the final image. POV filtering keeps description purposeful and professional rather than touristic, with the arbor feeling like an extension of the narrator’s body. This is near exemplary micro-worldbuilding; the only limiter is length-inherent—there’s little room to show the arbor altering multiple distinct tactical choices beyond what’s already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating rock dojo, neighboring rocks, chimes, clouds-as-courts, and “edge of the sky” are vivid and consistently filtered through Kana’s sensibility. Setting constrains choices and charges stakes: holding proceedings on a sky-edge dojo, “urgent air rights,” and clones on separate rocks embody contested ownership and precarious identity. The brain in a jar as a spatial center and the dojo drifting lower at the end give the environment direct thematic and structural weight. This is top-tier atmosphere and specificity, only shy of perfection because some world rules (e.g., “air rights”) are gestured at more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    The escape room, brook, storm, lanterns, and stones are vividly rendered and tightly woven into mood and stakes, with the environment (threatened brookside lot) clearly shaping what’s at risk. Sensory choices—“storm-born silence,” “lanterns warming the rafters,” moss, soil, odor—are specific and consistently filtered through the proprietor’s attention. The corpse flower’s niche by the brook and the rafters with vials all feed directly into the final charged image of the town’s future flow. Setting is not just backdrop but the contested resource, satisfying the high bar for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting work is exceptional: the echo chamber tunnel, the pewter blowers, the house above, and the night outside are vividly rendered and always doing thematic or procedural work. The tunnel and machines directly constrain tactics and shape the closure image (“the tunnel swallowed its own breathing and slept…”). Concrete, sense-rich details like “wet turbulence,” “metal tasting of pennies and dust,” and “wet iron and pears” feel filtered through this very specific professional sensibility. Environment and tools clearly charge the final moments, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    The frozen garden in mist, rime-glossed bench, sundial, and corridor of frost are not just beautiful but functional, repeatedly shaping movement, choices, and the final image. Weather and cold directly inform tactics (following the cold, “interiorizing exteriors”) and the thematic work around waiting and uncertainty. World rules for this liminal space remain internally consistent and are learned via interaction rather than exposition. The only thing keeping this shy of perfect is that spatial stakes remain mostly metaphysical; the environment could arguably constrain danger a bit more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    The environment is richly particular—ember nexus, flues “breathing like sleeping lungs,” mills, and cathedral clock—and these are not postcard details but functional constraints and engines of meaning. The crozier, crucible, bellows, and flues all shape what he can do and how he does it, and the loop planted in slag dripping dew into soil charges the final image. The industrial-religious setting (mills synced to cathedral clock) directly ties setting to stakes. Vivid sensory description is dense but generally purposeful and consistently filtered through the alchemist’s task-focused attention.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    The radio tower city over the gorge is vivid, coherent, and constantly in play: swinging towers, guy lines, catwalks, turbines, and the gorge itself all shape what the characters can attempt. The environment constrains choices (arguing where to aim, accessing the cave only via mapped ladders) and charges the final image of the city “swing[ing] into its next position on the rope.” World rules around signals, gravity, and the gorge’s preserving quality feel internally consistent and discovered through action rather than exposition. A minor reservation is that sensory range leans heavily visual/metaphorical, but it rarely feels like a tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is rich, specific, and thematically fused with the premise: estuary, pilings “that remember more hulls than years,” and especially the spectral grotto under starlight read as lived-in and consequential. The micro-setting of the grotto actively shapes options (a liminal cave only present when “the tide forgets its duties,” where time/space rules permit meeting the other self and performing the pattern-ritual). The empty hourglass and spectral ferry function as tools/objects-as-setting that charge the final image. There’s a slight risk of descriptive overload, but most details are purpose-driven and filtered through the deckhand’s occupational and liminal sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    The optical illusion gallery is vivid, specific, and functional: bent corridors, suspended staircases, and vanishing corners all tangibly shape what visitors do and feel, rather than serving as décor. Environmental rules are consistent (rational enchantment, perspective-encoded instructions) and culminate in the central arena where geometry literally scripts acts of connection. The final image—the curve of two lines that meet without a sharp angle—derives directly from this rule-set and charges the closing choice. Sensory focus is mainly visual, but the spatial logic is so tightly integrated with character and theme that the environment feels indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.8)
    The benthic city, domes, brine, pressure, and cracked patch of dome glass are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through the narrator’s professional gaze. Environment and tools meaningfully constrain choice: the pressure gap, moon pull, and continental “breathing” dictate when and how they can attempt ascent, and the city’s domes and monorail terminus frame where the unfolder is set. The chain link as micro-setting object is beautifully integrated into the teaching scene and the final charting. A slight density of atmospheric description sometimes approaches ornament, but it remains legible and purpose-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mist-clad atrium, fountain, glass panels, and twilight rain are specific and consistently filtered through the narrator’s job and sensitivities, avoiding generic atmosphere. Setting exerts real pressure: the atrium’s hush amplifies the dead’s “call,” the glass panel becomes a literal falling threat that dictates their movement, and the fog lets the suit man appear and vanish. The hearing aid and rain function as micro-setting tools that constrain choices and charge the final image of the city listening back. The only minor limit is that beyond the panel drop, the environment could arguably exert even more tactical constraint, but for this length it’s already doing strong double duty.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally atmospheric and integral: the caves, tide, undersea cables, and decaying facility all constrain tactics and mood, not just decorate. Environmental details (the tidal slack, sump, mineral air, surf “crashing hush”) directly shape when and how Ivo can act, and the undersea cables charge the final image across continents. Sensory specificity is high and filtered through Ivo’s technical/spelunker sensibility. A hair less descriptive density in one or two places might further sharpen the pressure without losing richness.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    The observatory and mountain environment are vivid, specific, and thoroughly integrated, from the “opal observatory under snow” to the heaters choking and icicles trembling at the dome’s whale-note. Weather and architecture constrain history and choice: the cold nearly killed them, the trek for wood is the original mistake, and the descent corridor is literally spatial wisdom derived from that terrain. Micro-setting objects (scope, dome ribs, drains, mug, shard) evolve with the action and charge the final image of walking a corridor traced by glass and ink. The only small limitation is that the mountain’s physical danger at the end is more implied than actively pressing in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    The canyon, towers of bone, and tunnel of echoes are not mere backdrop; they dictate tactics (where to press, how to listen, how the language can be recovered) and literally absorb the narrator. Environmental specifics (birds’ shadows scrolling, lightning scars in bone) are filtered through the narrator’s purpose, creating a coherent sensory hierarchy. The recurring objects-as-setting—the flawed diamond, copper veins, and bone—are central to the final image of the narrator fixed into the canyon. Weather/sky and acoustics impact the process (flock patterns, echoes), tying setting tightly to stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    The underground garden is richly particular—“roots dangled from brick ribs,” spores “gravitationally playful,” jars, beds, and soil all integrated into action rather than static tableau. Environment actively participates: the buried phone, the orbiting pollen, and the fern-shadow bed are the medium through which the harmony manifests and the cryptid unspools. The arrowhead as tongue and Dani’s palm on the soil charge the final image with place-specific resonance. It’s superbly atmospheric and functional, even if it rarely imposes hard physical constraints on options.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is strikingly original and fully integrated: sky-bridge, smokestack clock, enchanted orchard, and living statues all interact with the character’s choices. Environmental details (rails through roots, statues’ copper-threaded veins, fog “stitching ladders”) aren’t just decorative; they shape tactics and the climactic image of the rails rising. The locust shell and violin function as tools that mediate between body and world. A touch more concrete spatial constraint at peak moments (e.g., how close the statues actually are as they shift from policing to listening) could add even more pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and always doing work: the cobalt arcade, salt-sweating bricks, and humming drone lattice all shape tone and tactics rather than serving as mere backdrop. Environmental constraints (forgotten bridge, drone beams, checkpoints) directly affect how the courier moves and when he deploys the storm bottle. The recurring micro-setting of the arcade at twilight anchors both the opening and the closure, charged by the final storm and crowd. World rules around borders and drones feel internally consistent and are learned through action, not exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned circus train is rendered with exceptional sensory specificity—salt grass, coyote willow, sleeping calliope, derelict menagerie—and every locus feels lived-in. Setting is not postcard; it constrains and enables tactics (the rails as “compass,” the cracked water tank oasis, the need to cool bearings and rinse grit). Recurring objects (bells, crown, calliope, rails) charge the final image and align with the restoration theme. The only minor limitation is that weather/environmental hazard never quite escalates pressure beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptionally specific and functional: the “scientific poetry library” with hyperbolic shelves, tessellated tiles, and lung-like stacks not only paints atmosphere but literally determines paths, options, and the climax. Environmental rules (non-Euclidean corridors, the atlas slot, the lungs of shelves) are consistently applied and learned through action. The recurring objects-as-setting (scarf, chalk, atlas, clock) constrain choices and charge the final image of the slightly “heavier” books. Spatial and sensory choreography remain clear even in abstract moments, with the environment reorienting the protagonist at each turn.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    The whispering archipelago, canals, mangroves, and the drifting library are vividly specific and filtered through the librarian’s professional and emotional bias—“to return overdue weather” is world-building and character in one. Setting is not postcard; it constrains tactics (boat journey, first-light timing, using a rock as tripod base) and charges the final image of the unlatched door and tide-like windows. Recurring tools—the camera, palette, piers, and reading room—function as micro-settings that evolve with the story’s stakes. A hair more interaction with physical constraint under pressure (e.g., risk of failure at dawn) would push this into true top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exquisitely specific and tonally unified: blackthorn valley, freestanding door on moonlight hinges, crickets as “clerks,” all filtered through a quietly numinous lens. Environment is not postcard background; the star, the door, and the nexus actively condition what’s possible and how the ritual proceeds. The final image of the valley “settled into the dignity of having witnessed a release” directly charges the environment with the story’s thematic shift. This level of world/atmosphere integration fully supports the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: the sunken orchard, greenhouse glass, and ring of shipwrecks are not postcard backdrops but active constraints on how she moves, breathes, and bargains. Details like apples swaying “like anemones,” rusty prows as “book spines,” and shipwrecks as “old choir lofts” are specific, character-filtered, and support both world logic and theme. The fairy ring, silt geometry, and glazed roof/porthole “broken constellations” all become functional tools for her methods. The final images—spores like first snow in the greenhouse freed from its old debt—are charged directly by the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    The forgotten library is fully integrated into action and meaning: aisles that unlock on the playground’s hush, dust that behaves like script, and lecterns repurposed from sermons to “maps of vanishing alleys” all constrain what’s possible. The environment is not backdrop but mechanism—walls that can be argued with, shelves of “shard-mirrors,” the swing outside—all charge the final image of the archivist still arguing with the walls. Sensory and conceptual specificity are high without feeling like a catalog. Setting and micro-objects directly shape the ritual and the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.8)
    The parapet, waterfall, orchards (both living and echo), and the bridge of roots are vividly realized and functionally integrated into action: the door in the foam, the root-bridge, and the final planting all depend on setting. Environmental detail is filtered through the pruner’s sensory and professional attention, which keeps it purposeful rather than touristic. The final images—the seed’s silver root weaving between worlds, the waterfall glittering again, the parapet remaining “green as a blessing”—clearly charge the closure. A touch more physical constraint (e.g., genuine risk in crossing or pruning) would push it into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prism sanctuary, glass ribs, quartz floor, and buried coffer form a fully realized micro-world that both constrains action and infuses theme. The environment is not decorative: its listening silence dictates hushed behavior, the hanging net and sand are the literal means of exhumation, and the prisms’ refractions mark shifts in pressure (“sanctuary tilts to listen”). The final image of stars leaning closer to the prisms and silence “braided with the shape of a father’s laugh” shows the setting charging closure. This is immersive, economical, and integral.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting and atmosphere are richly realized—the henge, insect-trembling fields, limestone door, rain-scoured saints, and pollen maps all feel concrete and tonally unified. Environmental detail is always filtered through the narrator’s professional eye (tears, crescents, stains), which keeps the world specific rather than touristic. The chapel’s physical qualities constrain choice: it “does not open for shouting,” drafts and abrasions literally cue the opening method, and the vault’s “ear” quality shapes how the space is used. The final image of sealing nothing and letting the place “breathe as before” shows setting actively shaping ethics, not just mood.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sunken ship library is vividly particular—brass numbers “flowered into green,” books “spined like fish,” reels fused like mussel shells—and always filtered through a diver’s priorities. The setting materially shapes action: limited mobility, the need for external power, careful untangling, and the snow globe’s buoyancy at the safety stop. The snow globe functions as a micro-setting/object that decisively charges the final image and the thematic turn. A mild reason this isn’t higher is that the physical threat of the wreck’s environment is more atmospheric than constraining in specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “misty courtyard above clouds,” storm, parapet, and city infrastructure are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through the narrator’s tool-focused gaze, creating a distinct atmosphere. Environment and objects (the balustrade, parapet, mist, LEDs, and especially the grounded metal plate) do real work, constraining what’s possible—contact is only in storms, via conductive surfaces in this liminal height. Weather and altitude charge the final image of the key-plate beneath the mural, making the next storm itself a narrative participant. Detail density is high but rarely feels like a catalog; nearly every environmental element is doing thematic or tactical work.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “icebound spire above the clouds,” rattling elevator, hoarfrosted corridor, and the “room that gathers sorrow” create a vivid, coherent environment that matches the story’s emotional weather. Setting and objects (goggles, bulb, snow, cables) are not decorative: the vertical confinement and cold isolation heighten the sense of a private, perilous ascent into grief. The physical space meaningfully shapes the action, from the shuddering elevator that reveals the diary to the mapped path to the forgetter room. The final image of the bleak chamber and letters going still is charged precisely because the environment has been so carefully prepared.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.0)
    The gondola, sky, tools, and weather are vividly specific and always filtered through the meteorologist’s professional eye (“judge the hush by its grain,” “colder layers where memory is less diluted”). Setting and objects constrain options—she can only experiment within the gondola’s limits, with altimeter, burner, telescope, string—and directly charge the final image of a sky-loom. Environmental details evolve with altitude and time (town lights below, colder layers above) and mirror internal states without feeling forced. The recurring micro-setting of brass telescope, string, and notebook anchors both atmosphere and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.3)
    The tree-trunk library, the guild carvings, dust “like pollen,” and the machinery outside create an extraordinarily specific and coherent environment filtered through the artist’s sensibility. Setting is not postcard; it constrains choices (one room, one tree, one condemned building) and charges the final image of the space as a “bowl that remembers ancient pollen and smoke.” The coin, lime, indigo, and gold dust all operate as tools-in-setting that shape tactics, not just decor. The environment’s fate (imminent demolition) is the silent pressure behind every line and makes the ending sting.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.8)
    The airship, hold, hopscotch board, birds, and the physical behavior of the stranded luminance are vivid and deeply integrated into action rather than postcarded. Environment and small objects meaningfully constrain choices—the hopscotch determines heading, the copper net enables capture, the dog-ear acts as vessel and maps the final image. Sensory details (cumin and oil, pressure kissing teeth, brass bell) are selective, character-filtered, and tonally precise. This is very close to exemplary work in how setting and object-as-setting charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly imagined and specific—“frozen library above clouds,” hoarfrost corridors, goblet stairwells, harbor-scented oil—and all of it is filtered through the locksmith’s craft-minded perception. Environment interacts with action: frost listens and softens, mirrors brighten and rotate, books and maps physically respond to the repaired mechanism, and the final image of the hovering library-as-lantern is charged. The world’s rules are implied rather than explained, but remain internally consistent and legible throughout. The setting shapes mood and symbolic stakes more than tactical constraints, which is beautifully done but just shy of transformative constraint at the 9+ level.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is extraordinarily specific and integrally used: floating arches, deserted sidewalks, and the orchards all shape tactics (the relay route, climbing the arch, channeling sound and vapor). The environment isn’t a backdrop but an active system that must be “rung” correctly to unlock the nebula’s water. Recurring objects—the arches, chalk, and bell—charge the final images of dew beading the last spiral and the planet “ringing best” when voices braid. World rules about arches, sidewalks, and nebula behavior are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse, sea, clock, pane of hush, and puppet together create a distinctive, integrated environment that shapes perception and choice (e.g., the hidden location, the sound-swallowing pane, the sea “combing its own memory”). Setting is consistently filtered through the adjuster’s sensibility as a caretaker of endings, tying atmosphere to theme. Key objects recur and charge the final image: the lighthouse’s lens and the puppet explicitly frame the closing beats, and the pane is the surface he leans on after the sequence. The environment feels indispensable, not interchangeable, and could bear even more overt constraint on physical choice if you ever expand this.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.3)
    The cliffside labyrinth, cursed orchard, mechanical birds, and encroaching frost are richly specific and always in play, never postcard backdrop. Setting constrains tactics—needing to leave wind-like impressions to avoid the birds, timing the journey before frost, using ledges, reeds, and terraces as tools. World rules about the birds reading disturbances and the seeds holding blueprints are consistently dramatized rather than explained. The final image—turning back to the “graceless beauty that still required me”—is inseparable from this environment, which fully charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ravine, its braided streams, and the foam patterns are not backdrop; they dictate her research method, the bridge’s design, and the physical test of reconciliation. The chrysalis and river together charge the final images—crossing above “water that hissed like a stage whisper” and then releasing the chrysalis—so the environment and object directly shape the closure. Sensory detail is vivid yet selective, always filtered through Mira’s chemist-musician perception. The world feels coherent and inhabited without excess exposition, with water, roots, mud, and tools all tangibly handled.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glass orchard library and sea of clouds are richly imagined and consistently exploited—books as glass fruit, librarian trees, the cloud sea leaning in as listener. Setting details are always filtered through function (the booth, counter, jar, ledger) rather than postcard description. The environment actively charges the closure: trees shaking their glass leaves and the library floating as the store “breathed, beginning again” ties world and internal shift. While constraints are more metaphysical than physical, the setting’s logic never wavers and it feels inseparable from the narrative’s stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The desert fortress after rain and the coral pavilion are vividly realized and strongly filtered through the chef’s sensory priorities, especially taste and weather-like emotion. Environment consistently constrains and enables action: emotional contagion via touch, the icebound coral as both source and recipient of the broth, and the fortress walls as a barometer of change. The final return to the walls’ “sturdy brittle” quiet nicely charges the ending image. A hair more use of spatial constraint in the pavilion itself could push this into even rarer territory.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is exceptionally specific and integrated: astronomical clock tower, grain elevator as organ, wheat, tracks, catwalk—all recur as tools and constraints, not mere backdrop. The cuckoo weight as plumb line and the tower’s architecture literally shape tactics and imagery at the climax. World rules (talking elevator, listening clock) are clear and internally consistent within a dreamlike frame, and sensory texture is strong without slipping into catalog. The only small limit is that physical geography during the rapid overnight build is somewhat idealized, though not confusing.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    The moonlit canyon, harmonics, and mirrored moons are vivid and consistently filtered through an engineer’s perception, so the environment never feels like a backdrop. The canyon’s tremors, echoing thunder, and returning hush at dawn all bear on how the narrator times and interprets the procedure. The mirror functions as both setting-object and tool, literally refracting moonlight into the body and conceptually refracting memory, which charges the final image of packing it away. Sensory detail leans visual/auditory, but the selectivity matches the meditative, technical focus of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vividly, specifically rendered—the misted, serpentine grotto, inverted ravine, spores, and “lake of smoke” all feel tactile and unified by the world’s logic. Crucially, environment constrains and enables action: inverted gravity, the wet/dry threshold, and the panel’s transformation all shape what the archivist can do. Details are filtered through the archivist’s professional sensibility (letters in veins, numbers in mist), reinforcing POV. The final image of walking home “shimmering with quiet bells” is charged by the grotto’s physical and sensory strangeness.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.0)
    The grove, riverbank, and wired alders are richly realized and always filtered through the sculptor’s sensory and professional bias (“organ of small gray pipes,” copper leaves, hollow log as body double). Environment tangibly shapes choices: wind alters touch, the insulator’s cool glaze dictates tempo, the river answers the offered phrase by leaning against his ankles. Recurring objects (wires, insulator, hedgehog, river) clearly charge the final image and embody the world’s new rules of listening. The setting is not backdrop but the mechanism by which empathy-in-motion is enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    The magnetic nexus, iron rail, aurora, and humming metal are vividly rendered and tightly woven into action: the board is iron on iron, the compass fails, the needle droops and then rises in response to their moves. World rules—magnetism, eclipses flattening compasses, words as tariffs—are consistent and filtered through the tutor’s sensibility rather than as neutral exposition. Crucially, the environment is not postcard background: it constrains their method and literally registers the covenant’s restoration in the final image. A hair’s breadth more tactile consequence from cold, height, or guards could push this into truly immersive territory.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    The workshop under stars and the city poised for fireworks are vivid, integrated settings that function as more than backdrop; they frame a sanctuary of listening on the brink of explosive noise. Environmental elements (lamp, coils, window, lanterns, night sky) are used as tools and metaphoric constraints that shape how and what the narrator can attend to. The outside fireworks schedule directly pressures the pacing and charges the final images of “green flower of sound” and “sky rehearses endings.” The recurring clasp and devices operate almost as micro-settings, constraining method and forcing gentle approaches that align with the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    The treetop village—with its rope bridges, swaying platforms, and leaf-drift—feels fully inhabited and sensory, especially through smell. Environment materially shapes choices: picking the hardest-swaying platform, panic skittering across bridges, and the placement of damp cedar baskets to “tune” odor travel. The world’s rules are consistent and integrated into action rather than touristic description. A slightly clearer sense of practical risk (height, fall, structural strain) at the ceremony could have deepened how physically constraining the setting feels.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly imagined and constantly functional: inverted rivers, floating arches, and the echo-chamber literally dictate navigation, threat, and solution. Details are not touristy; they’re filtered through a professional pilot’s eye and tightly bound to action (“navigating by water flow,” “arches open their throats”). Environment directly constrains choices at the climax (root sphere, veil, gravity shift), and the final orchard exhale charges the last image. Nothing feels generic or merely decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.2)
    The port-as-labyrinth and “lung” is richly realized and entirely inseparable from plot and theme: wind alleys, empty squares, and container canyons directly cause the disaster and shape the investigation. Specific tools (telltales, chalk, anemometer) and features (soot V, flapping crate door, breathing steel) are not just atmospheric; they constrain choices and generate insight. The final image of softer gusts testing the new grid closes the loop between environment and human intervention. Setting is both stage and engine here, with no white-room moments.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ice cavern, glacier, and aurora are exquisitely realized and fully integrated with action: the environment breathes, threatens sleep, shapes how the protagonist moves, and conducts the bells’ effects. The cavern’s physicality (ribs, veins, thin ice above, “where ice remembers rivers”) consistently mirrors and constrains the ritual. The setting also charges the final image, with the sculpted hush curling beside her “like a cat of light” in that same icy cradle. This is elite-level atmosphere tightly welded to function, just shy of perfection only because the external city/council layer remains more hinted than structurally active.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    The canyon, mist, driftwood, and Thunder-echo range are vividly realized and consistently filtered through the relic keeper’s sensibility (e.g., “gorges whose quiet was avalanchingly quiet, crushing and complete”). Setting is not postcard; it shapes tone and meaning, especially through echoes and the dried riverbed as a place to lay out her regret-compass. The driftwood markers and canyon hush directly charge the final images of redirection and rest. While the environment does not strongly constrain physical tactics, it thoroughly charges the emotional and thematic field.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    The press, chase, rollers, tympan, and halo fragment are tactically woven into nearly every beat, never postcard-like; the setting is a machine they constantly work, not a backdrop. The “Topaz workshop under stars” and the vanishing stars outside create a two-layer environment where interior craft and exterior cosmic decay mirror and pressure each other. The halo fragment and the press itself constrain action at the climax (the fragment to ground the narrator, the lever-drop as the transformative act) and then charge the final image when left as a “hinge to hold the world open.” This micro-setting integration is unusually tight and specific.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.0)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway is exquisitely realized and not mere backdrop; it hums, leans, listens, and effectively functions as a responsive instrument that mirrors and charges the emotional stakes. The ridge physically narrows “to a blade” at the meeting point, quietly echoing the knife imagery of duration/dependence and heightening that ethical decision. The reliquary’s tactile sand, scents, and twitching husks anchor the abstract work of memory in concrete sensory terms. The final movement—feet on stones, heart learning “the instrument below it”—integrates body, tool, and landscape into a charged closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    The quartz arbor, mist, frost, and car interior are rendered with exceptional specificity and integrated into action—the environment is not backdrop but apparatus. The quartz ribs and prism-produced auroras create a physical chapel-space for the ritual, while the frosted windshield literally hosts the “hidden rivers” of emotion. The closing return to road frost and the soft treatment of keys shows the setting’s logic persisting into daily life, charging the final image. Weather and materials (quartz, glass, ice, cooling metal) consistently shape both mood and method.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    The orchard and bamboo grove are not just scenic; they explicitly constrain choice (“the orchard would die if she vanished”) and charge the ending when bees and fruit-like warmth symbolically return. The micro-setting of the blanket, puzzle edges, and well anchors the magic in tactile, lived-in details. Recurring objects (amber bead, frame, bamboo) evolve in meaning without feeling over-signaled. This is richly atmospheric and purposeful, though a hair from the kind of razor-sharp environmental constraint that would push it into the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is rich, specific, and integral: floating arches, orchards, and shafts aren’t postcard scenery but the actual problem space and toolkit for solutions. Environmental features constrain choices (using mine shafts as wind organs; anchors, faults, and rubble dictating tactics), and the orchard/arch nexus directly ties to the stakes. World rules about stone, song, and barter are taught through action rather than exposition. The recurring images of blue sky, roots, shafts, and arches also charge the final sense of a precarious but livable planet.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned spaceport bay is vividly and economically rendered—the “rusted gantries,” “puddle of old coolant,” and maintenance cradle are all used, not just seen. The environment constrains tactics: climbing the gantry to wedge the shard, using the cradle’s hollows, and routing truth through adjacent bays’ public address systems. Sensory detail is rich and POV-filtered (the narrator maps via smell, taste, vibration), giving the setting real textural presence without turning into a catalog. The final image of the shard left in the seam as “a bead in the loom” charges the place as an ongoing tool and memory rather than a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: Briar Neck, the “haunted lantern room,” the harbor’s “breath,” and the teeth of the reef all filter through the skipper’s professional eye. Environmental details are not postcard; they actively shape the logic of his ritual (going up only after the lamp dies, leaving the jar under “the last brass rung”). Objects-as-setting—stones, sea glass, jar, chart candle—charge the final image and serve as tools within the space. The atmosphere of salt, pear-colored dusk, and remembered heat in the glass sustains tone without excess description.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse, bay, harbor mouth, and storm systems are rendered with strikingly tactile, original detail—wind tugging her coat, pilings that remember names, ozone and library paste. Setting is never postcard; the tower height, lamp mechanics, and harbor throat all materially shape what she can do and how she does it. Recurring objects (glass wick, obituary page, clippings the sea refused to swallow) explicitly charge the final image and underpin the world’s “physics.” This is publish-ready atmospheric work; the only restraint on a perfect score is that the wider town remains more symbolic than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating rock tea house and valley are richly specific—anchor lines, valley mist, tether posts, and clouds catching the lines all build a tangible, peculiar world. Setting is not postcard-only: the floating island’s tethers, the shifting light, and the tea rituals directly channel the thematic focus on angle, patience, and receptivity. Objects-as-setting (wing, cloth, kettles, silk) are used in tactile ways that shape perception, not just decoration. The final images of clouds tugging the tea house and the valley’s “cool breath” charge the narrator’s new role as harbor, tying environment tightly to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is extraordinarily vivid—stormlit tower, breathing maze, ring of trees, and the sextant as a kind of micro-setting-object—and nearly every detail is filtered through the worker’s sensibility. Weather, architecture, and trees all participate in the meaning of sorrow, repair, and mapping, with the rooftop scene and final pin on stone tightly grounded. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, it consistently charges choices and images, especially the moonlight’s healing and the parapet keeping “the night from slipping.” This is elite-level atmosphere with purposeful specificity rather than postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.0)
    The greenhouse, mica window, endlessly nocturnal orchard, and mirror world are all vividly specific and tightly integrated with action (the roots answering songs, mica peeling, dawn woven on trellises). Environmental rules are consistent and learned through use, not exposition, and the setting’s constraints (endless night, fragile window, alchemical plants) directly shape options and stakes. The final image of the greenhouse and mica window transformed (“cracks are threads now”) charges the theme and closure. This is exemplary, lived-in worldbuilding that feels indispensable to the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the city, laundromat, and secret library are rendered through Mara’s sensibility (“lights that hummed like soft bees,” “soft lamps…like small moons”). The library’s physical logic—stacks labeled by verbs, the driftwood table with “river scars,” the brass plate that hums at truth—directly houses and enacts the story’s philosophy. Environment supplies the resources (instruction, tools, membership) that enable the final choice, and small recurring objects (detergent shelf, “linted moons”) charge the ending image. The world mostly shapes meaning rather than constraining tactics, which keeps it a bit below the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting work is exceptional: palace courtyard, ivy, cracked fountain, carp tiles, shells, broom, chalk, wisteria, and seasonal markers all feel tactily lived-in and emotionally inflected. Environment constrains tactics—the need to stay hidden from officials, the choice to recloak the wall, the guerrilla quality of gardening in an abandoned palace, the absence of birds protecting the crumb ritual. Details are tightly filtered through the narrator’s noticing ethos and consistently integrated into action rather than static description. The only ceiling factor is that the physical space, though beautifully evoked, rarely blocks or forces a specific high-stakes choice; it tends more toward atmosphere than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    The “frozen library above clouds” is not just decorative; cold, height, and fragility shape tools (woolen gloves, frost-bitten ladders), constraints (fading ink, hoarfrosted cards), and the stakes of vows about keeping the library awake. Environmental details like avalanches, the dome, and the atrium ice interlock with the ritual of measurement and the sense of precarious endurance. The setting directly charges the final image of ledgers hardening “into a shelter the wind could not quite unmake,” making the environment inseparable from both conflict and theme. The specificity of textures (quartz hush, blue ribs of sky) stays tightly filtered through the archivist’s professional gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.2)
    The pirate market under the rotting pier is vividly, economically realized: salt pricing, eels, groaning planks, and rising tide create a tactile, pressured environment. Setting actively constrains behavior (the hush rule, the threat of the law, the unstable pier) and directly shapes tactics—silent bargaining, gestural negotiation, reliance on minute sounds. The pier’s groan entering the fob at the climax beautifully charges the final proof image. The world feels singular and lived-in without excess exposition, and its physical/ritual rules bind the story’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is strikingly specific and fully integrated: lavender bluff, aurora as “terrestrially cosmic river,” pollen-ballot forest, and lichen counters all actively shape the ritual frame. The aurora and bluff constrain the climax (the need to reach the spine when the aurora hits its hinge) and charge the final image of debt-clearing. World rules (trees voting, carriers’ microclimates, taste-weather cartography) feel internally consistent and are revealed through action rather than exposition dumps. Description is dense but purposeful, with the tin ring functioning as a micro-setting object that anchors orientation and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    The subterranean crystal cave is richly realized through smell, light, and sound (“auroral sorrow glows,” “crystals purpling like a pre-dawn bruise”). The environment isn’t decorative: it houses the archive, shapes the secret mechanism, and ultimately functions as a permanent studio immune to foreclosure. Crystals and stone echo the emotional stakes and charge the final image (“the crystals know our names and charge the pages with morning”). Description occasionally approaches saturation, but remains purposeful and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    The greenhouse city under a toxic sky is richly concrete and consistently pressures action: leaves instead of paper, vents closed so “the toxic sky would not breathe on them,” the Ear as an atrium of glass ribs. Environmental rules remain stable (toxic air, rationed breath, dried routes) and directly shape tactics, especially in the Ear sequence and the secret corridor. Setting details are filtered through the narrator’s craft-eye, turning infrastructures into organic metaphors (“rivers that were now ramps of glass,” “irrigation spines”) without losing spatial clarity. The environment also charges the final image—the chamber of scarred panes and breath-filled cisterns—though one more tactile interaction with immediate physical risk could have pushed it into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bluff above the clouds, wind-throat, cypress and brass towers, and aurora are vivid and specific, all filtered through Mara’s craft. Environment isn’t just backdrop: wind and elevation are required for the sculpture, the “listening throat” constrains where the fragment goes, and melting ice generates the water percussion. The final image—fragment’s memory ringing inside the metal—relies heavily on the established setting logic. Description is rich without losing spatial or conceptual clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.1)
    The desert rose farm, glass dome, magnetic sky, and sand function as lived constraints, not mere backdrop: roses that need fire, vents mapped to constellations, and shifting north all shape what tactics are possible. The environment materially forces choices (timing the burn with cooling glass and the shift, using mixers and vents) and charges the ending image of burying a seed along the new needle-line. Details are precise and filtered through the android’s sensibility (“the dome breathes through honeycomb shutters,” “desert speaks in ions”), with evolving environmental states (cooling glass, spidering windows, collapse) tracking the action. Setting and recurring objects clearly inflect the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.0)
    The courtyard, mailbox cluster, thrift store, and even the drone and banner are all sharply rendered and filtered through the curator’s sensibility, giving the piece a distinct spatial and atmospheric spine. The mailboxes and locket function as tools/objects that directly constrain choice and enable the climactic action. Dawn as a liminal time enriches the theme of “outside world intrudes,” charging the final communal scene. The environment feels lived-in and indispensable rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sunken laboratory and the surrounding sea are not backdrop but active constraints: pressure, rust, valves, tanks, bulkheads, and uplinks all shape tactics and imagery. The environment is filtered through the narrator’s sensibility (doors that open on rhythm, alarms as percussion), which keeps description purposeful and character-specific. World rules—stored minds as “message fish,” maintenance daemons, pressurized steel wombs—are consistent and learned through action, not exposition. There’s a slight abstractness to the physical choreography of the hack itself, but it doesn’t harm clarity or the charged final image of the city lifting from water.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The harbor, pier, salt crystal chamber, and beached whale are richly specific and consistently integrated into action—especially the crystals and ear bone, which literally structure the climax. Environmental rules (gravity pockets, salt listening better than machines, the harbor’s stillness) are taught through use, not exposition, and they constrain tactics (waiting out a pocket, arranging cubes, tapping bone). The final image of straight-burning lanterns and the exhaling whale reweights all prior setting detail with thematic force. Description occasionally verges on luxuriant, but it remains purposeful and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    The brookside night is vividly rendered through layered sensory detail (crickets, reeds, sibilant water) and stays tightly bound to the POV’s listening-based practice. Environment is not mere backdrop: the brook carries the coded prophecy, its “simple body” is read for places where sound leans, and the lattice of starlight across water becomes the operative field. The final image of a “gentled current” and a night with a “brighter shade of quiet” shows setting directly charged by the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.1)
    The rooftop garden and meteor shower are not mere backdrop; they’re structurally and thematically fused to the lesson (“meteors stitched quick seams,” “punctuation lesson,” basil as “green encyclopedia”). The environment shapes how communication is conceptualized—roofs as paragraphs, gutters as commas—and the parapet physically receives the seal. The final descent with the impression cooling on the wrist makes the setting’s ritual residue tangible. Removing the garden/meteors would collapse both the story’s grammar metaphor and its closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.1)
    The velvet garden is not postcard backdrop; it breathes, murmurs, consents, and ultimately “less guarded” hedges and more “fluent” fountains show environment reconfigured by the climax. Physical elements (glass bell, archive aisles, oldest arch, gate nail) concretely stage choices and the final image. Sensory and world details are selective, purposeful, and always filtered through the narrator’s work and worldview. The setting’s rules (resonant lattices, quarantine spaces) remain consistent and actively constrain and enable tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sanctuary, aurora, vowstone, and dripping stalactites are richly realized and constantly interacted with; this is not postcard description but a working environment. The setting meaningfully constrains action: the thorn is needed to write on vowstone, the oculus and aurora govern when the counterstrokes are visible, and the sanctuary’s history of endurance shapes the narrator’s patient, non-catastrophic tactics. The final image of the sanctuary “warmer than my fear” elegantly charges the environment with thematic resolution. A minor check is that the density of imagery approaches saturation, leaving little room for contrast or sparer beats that might sharpen key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    The canyon, ribs/heart imagery, metallic-tasting air, and serpentine nexus are vivid and consistently filtered through a sound-centric consciousness, creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting meaningfully constrains action: paths that “return to themselves unless spoken through” and the echo-bartering under the nexus directly shape what’s possible and how she intervenes. The shell as a recurring object-as-setting charges both the revelation of the mother’s bargain and the final image of leaving it to “feed” in sunlight. A hair more concrete spatial choreography at the council platform might have further grounded the climax, but current specificity is already publication-grade.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glacier shrine and the wreck beneath it are superbly realized, with ice, candles, blue slabs, and “windows” that literally and metaphorically frame the action. Environment actively shapes meaning: the ice’s listening quiet, the thinning to windows, and the candles’ smoke becoming frozen requests all charge the ritual and the final walk back through the passage. The snow globe functions as a micro-setting object that anchors the girl’s fate and the ending’s image of direction rather than proof. This category is just shy of the very top only because the setting constrains mood and ritual more than concrete tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.2)
    Setting is exceptionally vivid and integral: the parapet’s acoustics enable the whistle, rain and sluices shape movement, and the estuary ecology justifies Yazhen’s turtle rescues and the need for nets. Sensory detail is dense yet purposeful (stones “sweating,” slugs’ cursive, fireflies as “breathing lamps”), always filtered through the story’s contemplative, water-minded perspective. The parapet, moonlight, and fireflies all return in the closing image, charging the final covenant-like walk home. Environment consistently constrains and enables choices rather than sitting as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    The orchard is vividly and economically realized—the red dust, “polished armor” leaves, auction flags, and lead-threaded coat all root us in a tactile, irradiated landscape. The stillpoint is not just a visual gimmick but a physical rule that shapes behavior (Klay won’t cross, the MC chooses to) and explains the orchard’s survival. Environmental mechanics (dust falling straight down, diamond in a wind harp) directly underpin the plot logic and thematic weight. The final image of dust building at the orchard edge recharges the setting as an active, ongoing pressure rather than a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is vivid, original, and purposeful: the “stormlit observatory above clouds” and “cobalt glass portico” shape tactics (lightning as defense, later as weapon that injures Kestrel) and charge the final image (“spidered but standing”). Environmental details (lightning, stormlight crawling over city maps, thunder that “smelled like pennies”) feel filtered through the narrator’s sensibility rather than touristic. World rules around lightning, radio, and civic power stay internally consistent in a dreamlike but coherent way. The only thing keeping this below 9+ is that some atmospheric flourishes don’t further constrain choices so much as enrich mood.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    The feral loft, dunes, storm, and town are vividly rendered and always filtered through his sonic obsession—sand as “restless coins,” jars as “patient lanterns,” lightning as “crooked essay.” Setting details aren’t postcard; the loft’s vulnerability to the storm and proximity to dunes directly pressure his choices (bracing the ladder, opening specific jars, fox as sentinel). Recurring objects—the jars, the music box, the ladder, the dune fox—evolve in meaning and help charge the final images. The only minor limit is that environment constrains mood and symbolism more than it concretely restricts his tactical options in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    The drift-ice marina, low sun, whale-bone lock, and limestone vault are sensually and specifically rendered, filtered through the engineer’s eye for sound and structure. Environmental features—ice pitch, foghorn, harbor acoustics—directly inform the tactic used to activate the Lens (matching the foghorn’s key and the ice’s pitch). The setting also charges the stakes by tying the artifact’s power to the harbor’s literal and sonic integrity. It’s richly atmospheric and functional, though one more explicit moment where the physical environment constrains options at the climax could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.1)
    The environment is richly realized and tactically crucial: the frozen lake, basalt sanctuary, caldera wind, and magnetite viaduct all constrain choices and define the problem. The viaduct’s magnetic pull literally dictates timing and method, and the frozen/thawing lake frames urgency and possibility. Details are filtered through this particular mapmaker’s eye—“fires low, ambitions banked like coals,” “aurora smudged like thumbprints”—making the world feel both strange and inhabited. The final image of standing watch at the basalt sanctuary with the widened horizon charged by the learned moon-rhythm meets the 9+ gate for environment shaping closure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tunnel environment is vivid, tactile, and continually engaged—silt lines, cracked ribs, rusted echoes, pumps restarting—and always filtered through her professional and personal lenses. Crucially, the setting constrains and reveals: the jammed grate, hidden egress, and under-river geography are the physical facts that prove the deaths preventable. The lantern and tunnel together operate as micro-setting tools that charge the final image, turning infrastructure into a moral landscape. Detail is dense but purposeful, with no white-room moments or postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    The shop is richly particular (“drawers of tiny screws and velveted gears,” the storm against the windows) and tightly fused with mood. Environment and object-as-setting (the music boxes) do real work: they enable the literal repair, the apprenticeship scheme, and the thematic linkage between mechanism and heart. Weather is not decorative—the storm’s thinning and “unstitched” gutters mirror the internal shift without feeling forced. The setting feels indispensable rather than a generic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    The acid sea, floating workshop, and iron spindle are all deeply integrated into action and meaning, not just backdrop; the environment constantly shapes what’s possible and what’s at risk. Sensory and conceptual specificity (“rain-whale…like a cathedral coughing,” “sea fizzes like gossip”) is exceptional and POV-filtered. The setting materially charges the climax (acrid sea responding in “petaled ripples”) and the final charged-poise state of bell/workshop/pilot kinship. It’s hard to imagine this story transplanted anywhere else without breaking it.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.0)
    The social network archive is vivid and functionally imagined: “anaerobic layers,” the “Sargasso,” and “After Echo Vaults” all feel tactile and constrained by permissions, badges, and logged exports. Setting repeatedly shapes choice (she must lie for a memorial key; she cannot email the reporter because exports are traced), not just mood. The patch as a micro-setting tool—aligned with the rack map to locate missing drives—is an elegant, plot-active use of environment. The final bus scene is spare but grounded, letting the outside world briefly intrude without breaking the archive’s atmospheric hold.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.1)
    The lighthouse orchard over shifting floes is vivid, original, and ever-present as a working landscape rather than a backdrop; wind, ice, trees, lantern, and crates all shape what is possible. Environment meaningfully constrains choices (need a truce while ice shifts, routes across fractures, vantage point for messages) and charges the final image (lantern seam over coat, walk toward the fracture). The court of mirrors and vintage store are equally specific and integrated into the world’s texture rather than feeling like a separate set-piece. Weather and terrain function as quiet but real pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered and never ornamental; ice, wind, pilings, and harbor bells all act on the characters’ bodies and choices. The environment directly shapes action (trawling debris, reading wind harmonies, backing away from splitting ice to save the boy) and is inextricable from the euthanasia-waiting premise. The heirloom parasol tip functions as a micro-setting/tool as well, constraining interactions and enabling the rescue of the photograph. The final stance—remaining in this place to “trawl these channels again”—is charged precisely because the setting has become a lived grammar of endings.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.8)
    The vineyard, gravel road, “amber pavilion in autumn,” and moonlit valley are sensuously rendered and constantly filtered through the sentinel’s viticultural lexicon. Setting is not mere backdrop: soil, trellises, pruning, and wind all become the grammar of the counsel given, and the final image with owls and vines “lodg[ing] small claims against dark” recharges these motifs. The micro-setting of the pavilion table, glasses, and poured libation grounds the thematic moves in tactile action. Environmental constraint is more atmospheric than logistical, which keeps it just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    The murmuring pavilion, dunes, and kinetic parapet are vividly rendered and deeply integrated into the concept: they don’t just decorate but define how wisdom can be held (breathing architecture, moving foundations). Environmental features constrain choice—ropes must be cinched a certain way, clearings must be shaped correctly, the parapet must be honored—so the echo doesn’t “bruise itself and fade.” The final images (“pavilion kept murmuring… parapet kept turning… teaching us balance”) clearly charge the ending with setting-as-ethic. At this length, the world feels both specific and internally consistent without bogging in exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lavender field behind factory ruins, the rebar, smokestack, and storm are all integral rather than decorative, shaping both imagery and action (rebar as lines for photos, smokestack and sycamore as anchors for the final wing, storm demanding heavier twine). Sensory detail is selective and charged—the “cool scent of lavender,” wind as “time signature,” lavender hum turning conversation to music. Environment constrains tactics: they must brace the lines against the storm, use what the ruined factory provides, and the open field allows the wing to literally cover the town. The final image of vines continuing to climb and people adding loops cements setting as an active, continuing agent in the story’s meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.1)
    The shadowed library at dawn is exquisitely realized and inseparable from the story’s stakes: the hush, shelving, ladders, chandeliers, and high panes all shape how sound behaves and what he can discover. Setting details are always functional—the ivy, beams, plaster, and wobbling ledger all modulate the echoes and thus his “data.” The final image of leaving the library and carrying its quiet like “patient rain” depends entirely on this environment having become a charged, specific place. World rules remain consistent even with the slightly fantastical sonic properties.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.0)
    The fog sculpture garden is vividly rendered and fully integral: fog, tide, gravel, statues, and amphitheater all shape what he can do and how he navigates. Environmental forces actively constrain and disrupt tactics, especially when a wave “shifted several arrows,” literalizing the instability of his memory. Recurring objects (statues, fog, tide, driftwood) are not scenic garnish but charged components of the story’s logic and mood. The final harbor image is thematically seeded by the garden’s tidal, oceanic atmosphere, making setting essential to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lunar observatory, timing dome, quakes, and dust plumes are vividly rendered and always filtered through the narrator’s professional lens, giving the setting both texture and function. Environment and tools (rails, dome, governor, shutters) concretely constrain action and stakes—if the timing system fails, the comet event is lost. The recurring Earth/leaf motifs work as micro-settings that charge the final image: Earth as “a candle drowned in its own glass” and the recorded leaf anchoring gravity in a place without air. Detail is rich but rarely feels like a static tour; almost every description also advances mood or conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    The hospice ward and rooftop are vividly, economically rendered (“oxygen whispering, plastic hoods faintly ringing,” fog lapping below the rail). The environment functions as more than backdrop: Ruth’s rooftop history motivates the move; the sky, gulls, and siren become witnesses that charge the goodbye. The vinyl shard acts as an object-as-setting, constraining tactics (used as pick, then to stop the chord) and anchoring the final image of “broken things singing.” Sensory detail (especially smell and sound) is precise and consistently filtered through the narrator’s attentiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle is vividly and economically rendered—dew on brass rails, spiral stair by the telescope shaft, lacquered pods “blackened like burned tea.” Setting details are strongly filtered through the apprentice’s professional gaze (runes, calibration, lenses), which deepens both worldbuilding and character. Crucially, the environment is not postcard-only: the sealed awakenings and their harvested shadows literally keep the isle aloft, and that constraint governs tactics (build a model instead of opening pods). The recurring tools (rails, lenses, copper rings, key) charge the final image of a steadied island and a cleared ribcage.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.1)
    The world is vividly and economically rendered: hedge maze, foxgloves, sap-map bark, reed-boy, and the root-stair chamber all feel tactile and lived in. Setting is not decorative; it constrains and enables action—the maze, hinge, and living bark literally determine the search and discovery path. Sensory detail is filtered through the bonesetter’s professional lens and folk background, which keeps it character-specific. The garden’s logic stays consistent and charges the final realization that “the garden had taught me to listen.”

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    The serpentine grotto, tide, mist, and sea-glass environment are vivid, sensorial, and POV-filtered, never generic. Crucially, the setting constrains and enables choice: fire is forbidden here (seals, night), the cave’s coils and hollow deliver the pearl, and the space becomes a “lung of stone” whose breathing is altered by the narrator’s decision. World rules (light via reflection, hush travelling through mist and glass) stay internally consistent and are learned through practice rather than exposition. The final image of days lifting like lanterns a tide can carry is deeply charged by all these environmental particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned data center turned moss garden is vividly specific and fully integrated: server racks, fan housings, cooling lines, and repurposed doors all actively shape choices and tactics. Environmental logic—icicle-drip paths aligning with old data lanes, pendant as sun-catcher for the misting pump—charges the final image of the room’s “almost holy” stillness. The setting continually mirrors and informs the internal project of repurposing harm into shelter without feeling like blunt symbolism. It’s hard to imagine the story working in any other environment without major conceptual loss.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, cohesive, and POV-filtered: pages as water, vines writing cursive, “wolves of ink,” and a “circle of standing books” all feel of one imagined ecology. Environment and recurring objects materially charge the ending—the river/current constrains movement and choice, and the shell, hopes, and books form the ritual space that makes the closure legible. The “feral nexus in mist” isn’t just a postcard; it’s where pressure peaks and where the protagonist must kneel and commit to the truth. Sensory detail is densely figurative but remains coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.8)
    The arbor, trellis, dew, bells, and harvest moon are richly and precisely rendered, with sensory detail that feels both lush and purposeful. Setting is not backdrop; it dictates tactics (listening to sap, aligning the shadow wheel, speaking in “tree’s grammar,” timing to dawn and the moon’s position). Environmental elements reappear at the end—the arbor spinning its own story, the moon finally dipping—recharging earlier imagery. The only reason this doesn’t reach the absolute top is that, while the place constrains ritual mechanics beautifully, it never forces a painful trade-off beyond the ritual’s timing.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exquisitely particular—subarctic crater, hoarfrosted orchard, packing shed debris—and always filtered through her purpose rather than feeling touristic. Environment shapes tactics (she uses shed junk, broom handles, snow-cleared grids; cold affects her body and timing) and the orchard’s history with her mother directly charges the ritual and closure. The final sense that the orchard “seemed less dead” and the tripod points east shows setting participating in the ending, not just framing it. This is elite-level atmospheric work, though the external constraints of the crater could press her choices even harder.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    The marble cavern is vividly rendered—“veined with light that seems fossilized into the stone”—and its physical properties (echo behavior, skylight thread, rock-stored storm) directly shape method and meaning. Environment and tools constrain tactics: echo timing replaces seconds, marble becomes “tutor,” and the final jar is explicitly “measured by marble.” The setting charges the closing image and couldn’t be swapped without breaking the piece’s logic and resonance. This is an elite-level integration of atmosphere and function.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bronze grotto, starlight, shingles of hush, and whalebone atmosphere are extraordinarily vivid and integrated, with sensory detail filtered through the narrator’s vocation. Environment and tools actively constrain tactics—the lamp’s angle, the star’s reflection, the dripstone calcification—instead of serving as backdrop. The setting’s logic remains internally consistent and charges the final images of the lamp set low and the ongoing “reading” of the hush. This is elite-level atmosphere, capped only because other categories don’t quite clear the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.1)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft, stove, bench, ash wood, and sugar jar are vividly rendered and always tethered to her perception and choices. Environment and objects function as micro-setting constraints: the kettle clock structures the scene, the loft “that knows how to hold a storm” mirrors and contains her grief, and the cage becomes a charged tool she can pocket. Sensory detail is precise and purposeful (“dry and green as unfinished thunder,” “tea clouds the cup like tigers pacing in fog”) without drifting into generic atmosphere. The final image is inseparable from these elements, which clearly charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    The kinetic lagoon, cloud machinery, and halted carousel are vividly specific and fully integrated into action: the lagoon stores stories, the wheel plucks its surface, and the halted carousel defines both stakes and options. Environmental rules are learned through use (stories in foam, engines in cloudbanks) rather than exposition, and the final image of paddles catching bright air recharges those earlier details. The setting clearly constrains tactics—her entire method depends on this lagoon—though one or two more tactile interactions with the physical risk (height, instability) could sharpen embodied stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned spaceport is richly realized and functionally integrated: benches, boards, pipes, skylight, cistern, and solar array all become tools or constraints in Mara’s problem-solving. Setting details are filtered through her engineering sensibility, which sharpens specificity (valves, head, resistance) and keeps description purposeful. The sextant, fountain, and light-beam micro-setting charge the final image and concretize theme. A slight excess of atmospheric detail in the midsection risks softening pressure, but it never fully stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, original, and deeply integrated: the soundless sanctuary and crystal forecourt don’t just decorate, they dictate tactics (she must seek a sound that won’t violate hush) and charge the final images. Environmental details like “clocks slept like cats” and rainwriting on quartz evolve with the protagonist’s inner process and recur meaningfully at the end. The sanctuary’s silence functions as a rule-set, and the forecourt becomes a collaborator/chorus that shapes how she experiments. A tiny trim of descriptive density in a few spots could sharpen, rather than blur, the strongest images.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    The twilight barge canal, bridges, sluice gates, and viaduct are not just atmospheric; they dictate movement, access to evidence, and the visibility of the final confrontation. The setting is consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility (“calendar of hunger,” “jealous archivist”), and the canal’s physical structures literally embody the hidden manipulation of water. Objects-as-setting (sundial, siren, crates) are spatially coherent and integrated into action. Environment and tools clearly charge the ending image, though a fraction more tactile constraint or physical hazard would push it into the absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is vivid and fully inhabited: golden dock under snow, fog, rope, and fulgurite all feel tactile and integrated into action. Environmental details meaningfully constrain and charge choices—the threatened dock, the harbor’s hush, and the beach-sand lightning glass are not postcard backdrops but the medium of knowledge and its possible erasure. Weather and tide imagery (“fog makes us a school in session”) shape tone and behavior, aligning with the seed collector’s sensory priorities. The recurring dock/harbor/rope environment decisively charges the final image of leaving with seeds in a pocket and the prospect of “speaking in knots.”

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility (gulls “like hinges,” leaves “scissor down, bronze on slate”). The shadowed garden, the harbor, and the ship’s galley are economical but textured, and sensory details are purposeful rather than touristic. Crucially, the garden and the palace thread are not just décor: they constrain and charge choices (staying where “there will be no ship tomorrow,” planting seeds there, stringing the thread between rose canes). The final image of the map stitched in that same garden clearly meets the 9+ gate by having environment and recurring object charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.0)
    The suspended palace, chains, stalactites, and engines are vividly rendered and constantly present in the prince’s perceptions, giving the piece a concrete, idiosyncratic atmosphere. Setting actively shapes stakes—the rocking palace, the abyss, the hanging court, and the hidden cabinet—and charges the final image (“stalactites less like teeth, more like roots”). Environmental details are filtered through his mechanical/lyric sensibility, avoiding tourist-catalog description. The setting’s physical constraint and symbolic weight both matter for how choices feel, especially nurturing something fragile in a precariously suspended world.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    The obsidian lagoon, dunes, black sand, and burned trunks are vivid, sensorially rich, and tightly integrated with action: they’re not backdrop but the medium of her work. Environmental specifics (wind seams between trunks, warmth of the volcanic sand, lagoon as mirror) consistently guide tactics and charge the ritual. The recurring objects—coin, sand, trunks, lagoon—clearly reweight the final images of the coin singing in the trees and the lagoon as a “kept promise.” It stops just shy of perfection only because the physical geography’s constraints on choice are more atmospheric than oppositional.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.1)
    The city of forgotten fountains, mica-lit alleys, and glass shards is textured and specific, always filtered through the narrator’s priorities. Setting repeatedly constrains and enables action: dry fountains hold tar-like shadows that block memories, the heron statue and its shadow provide the alignment key, and the buried box literally sits under the city’s forgetting. Environmental rules (paused geese, motionless water) are consistent and then deliberately broken at closure to signal change. Details are economical yet vivid (“birds had built nests in dry spouts”), with the fountains’ transformation charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    The nebula garden is extraordinarily vivid and specific—terraces of vapor, moth-whales, pollen corridors—and always filtered through the caretaker’s professional, emotional attention. Setting materially shapes tactics (no fire; coaxed starlight; sonar as navigation; light diffused via petal-clouds) and charges the final image of cooled radiance and long arcades of light. The orrery and gears function as micro-setting, constraining what kind of solution is even imaginable. A few lush descriptions verge on ornamental, but most detail is doing thematic and tactical work.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse is exquisitely rendered and constantly in play: plants guide ribbon paths, glass and iron respond to weather, and the damp, breathing space frames every decision. The environment meaningfully shapes tactics (using trellises and shadows to map grief; choosing this place because “sorrow grows where life insists on staying”). Butterflies and dusk evolve over time into a charged clock and final image. Description density is high but nearly always purposeful, keeping the setting vivid rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.0)
    The clock tower interior, the sea air, and especially the pendulum bob and obsidian ridge are sharply rendered and always in service to the emotional and ethical stakes. The tower’s mechanics constrain choice (he has to act in the pause of the pendulum), and the ridge functions as a charged horizon that both haunts and orients him. Setting details (salt air, “teeth of stone,” the town’s relation to tides) are filtered through his occupational and personal priorities. The final image of the ridge and tower together crystallizes the world as a moral and physical system he must keep in balance.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cemetery, cobalt silo, tapestry, and chess clock are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Rowan’s sensibility as a gardener of both earth and grief. Environment and objects materially constrain action: he must climb the spiral ladder, use the tapestry as interface, and time his ritual with the chess clock, and the final image of the silo “holding its breath” and combed grave paths powerfully recharges earlier details. The tone and world rules feel internally consistent despite the occult elements. This integration of setting with method and theme is strong enough for the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    The obsidian spire, frozen lake, and instruments are vivid, specific, and filtered through the narrator’s sensibility (“ignorance cartographer,” lake cracking as pressure under smoothness). Setting is not mere backdrop; the lake’s ice and the spire’s vibration explicitly mirror and inform the narrator’s understanding of how rigid writing can freeze a city. The environment returns at key beats (the lake’s sigh when the Council softens; the final “lesson of the spire and lake”) and directly charges the ending’s realization. Physical constraint is more metaphoric than logistical, but it’s tightly integrated with the story’s logic and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is rich, specific, and constantly functional: ember alcove, mist, patrol winds, moss-walled ridge, and the “wintered valley” all shape tactics and mood. Environmental details constrain choices (cloak the radio, cut the lamps, use embers and dust to manifest stories, choose the hill with “the oldest silence”). The setting’s motifs—embers, mist, dust, famine—return at the end to charge the image of dust “sleep[ing] as if taught by kindness,” making the environment inseparable from theme. A single concrete anchor for era/tech level beyond “shortwave” might further orient some readers, but the lyric mode mostly earns its slight vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid and integral: “vanishing point gallery,” the rocking chair, brass bowl, and broken mask are not backdrop but active components of the ritual. The environment constrains choices—the gallery’s rule that all ends in ash drives the central refusal and the burning on the floor. Details are consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility (“air tastes like slate,” “house of somber marvel”), and the final image of the mask catching light with “tiny sunsets” is inseparable from place. World rules feel coherent without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is outstanding: the flooded city, oil-scab canal, sewers, and sunken workshops are rendered with tactile specificity and a unified sensory logic. Details are tightly filtered through the narrator’s priorities (plague, tides, brick dust, oysters on lathes, ledgers turned to “black salt”). Environment meaningfully constrains tactics—he must wait for low tide, crawl through sewers, use the lighthouse ruins as star school—and the brass cog as object-setting charges the final image. The world’s rules (post-plague, partially submerged city) feel stable and integral rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.1)
    The velvet library, autumn damp, dust, and whispering pages create a felt place that evolves with the scene (cold air warmed, rain letting go, windows opening). Setting choices—enclosed acoustics, the table, the street just outside—directly shape tactics (breath work, quieting the room, then releasing song to the neighborhood). The zither rosette functions as a micro-setting object that constrains action and culminates in the final light-casting image. Environment and object together charge the closure unmistakably.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rusted greenhouse, broken glass, iron ribs, and planetary light are intensely specific and deeply integrated into action (the need to prune for moonwind and starlight, shattered panes braiding light, soil response). Setting is filtered through a chef’s sensory bias—smells, tastes, textures—which heightens atmosphere and thematic focus on memory. Environment constrains tactics (the greenhouse must be opened, cleared, lit) and charges the final image of trellises and cleaning. A touch less ornamental metaphor and a bit more tactile constraint under peak pressure would make this flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lightning tower, nectar dusk sky, and rooftop world of drone hives are vividly realized and tightly integrated with action—the hidden seam, wind harp, and brush ring all matter to what the characters can do. Details feel filtered through the keeper’s sensibility rather than touristic listing (“a dry fountain over the rooftops,” “honeyed and smoky with far rain”). Setting constraints are literal (the drones must move air past the harp) and conceptual (a city that mechanizes pollination and lightning, yet still needs poetry). The final image of the tower “steady and speaking” and the matchbox kept near shows environment and object charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    The blue house, bay, street, and weather bottles are vividly specific and consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility, creating a lived, tactile atmosphere. Setting details are not decorative: the bay answers the unstoppered wind, the latch points to water then hill, and the porch crates extend the motif of collecting and tending to ambient forces. Environment charges the final image—walking back toward the water under waking streetlights—with a sense of cyclical duty.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.2)
    The underwater city garden is rendered with striking, specific images (glassy ferns, statues that “blink only in currents,” cracks as flutes) that are always filtered through the statue’s sensibility. Setting is not just backdrop; its physical rules and constraints (tides, cracks, collapsed vaults, sluices, bone ladders) dictate how thought and change can move. Environmental features directly shape tactics and closure—the structural weaknesses become conduits for empathy and medicine, and the final rebuilding is explicitly “threading strength through structural weakness.” The final image of the garden remembering voices is charged by all that prior environmental work.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.1)
    The infinite staircase is both physical and conceptual setting, richly rendered (“horizon repeats,” “boundless confinement”) and constantly shaping options—he can only climb, never arrive or step off without proof. Micro-settings (the chalkboard Tuesday, the rupture along the bannister) are spare but precise, always tied to stakes. The final image of climbing toward a repeating horizon with the dice pocketed is charged by all prior environmental detail. The world’s rules stay consistent and are learned through his movement and proofs rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rooftop greenhouse and smog-choked city are vividly rendered and constantly in play: vents, glass, moonlight, and plants all mediate who can come, what can be written, and how the “languages” travel. Environmental details feel lived-in (cracked panes, smut on aloe, coins by the thyme) and consistently mirror the thematic tension between toxicity and refuge. The moonlight/brush/greenhouse triad explicitly charges the final image of the place “breathing in saffron quiet.” A slightly stronger sense of physical precariousness (e.g., structural risks, landlord pressure) could have deepened the setting’s constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto city and waterfall are exquisitely specific and functionally integrated: the roar as ceiling, dripping corridors, cold, wax scarcity, and the timed dawn crossing all shape tactics. The environment constrains key choices (the hidden sluice behind the cataract, the need for emerald lenses to read the water, ovens under stalactites humming like bees). Recurring objects—the lenses, wax, rosewater—operate as micro-settings that charge the final images of cataloging and softening dread. World rules feel internally consistent and learned through use, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid, specific, and constantly functional: the rocky island, hunger stone, and cracked lens all constrain what is possible and shape tactics. The lighthouse and stone are not backdrop but machinery of fate-management, culminating in the beam being turned inward into the stone’s “mouth.” Environmental elements like tide and fog modulate action (stone surfacing, rewinding hours so fog “remembered windows”), and the space feels tactile and inhabited. The final image—tide reversing, yoyo dangling, stone dreaming of rain—draws its charge directly from those concretely established environmental details.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.1)
    The abandoned carnival funhouse is tactile and lived-in, from “rotten peppermint coiled with damp sawdust” to mold-freckled mirrors and the photo booth’s “wet paper and pennies” breath. Setting isn’t postcard; the maze, mirrors, and booth directly shape tactics (using reflections and cursed photography as the trap). The opera cloak clasp functions as a charged object-as-setting, physically interacting with the mirror silver and photo strip. The final contrast—canvas pressing into her back, sky promising “something ordinary, like weather”—reweights the entire atmosphere with a subtle but decisive shift.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is extraordinarily specific and functional: the orchard ring, lashings, bottles, and open sea are not just decorative but integral to tactics and risk. Environmental details (clouds as scores, roots woven through driftwood, bottles tuned along the rim) continuously shape choices and embody the premise of turning landscape into instrument. The physical constraint of the ring potentially breaking under the swell grounds the otherwise dreamy lyricism. The final image of the orchard relaxing and the sailcloth map tucked under pear roots demonstrates the environment charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    The city-on-turtles setting is vivid, specific, and embedded in action: bridges sway, barnacles pearl planks, shells are “nautilus hearts” and “furrowed desert.” Environment directly constrains and enables choices—the rusted gate, the elder turtle’s movement, the watchers’ glare, and the shell patterns literally are the navigational system and the medium of revelation. The final image of a listening city on moving giants is inseparable from this world’s physical logic. At this tier, it’s excellent; any higher would likely require one more moment where physical constraint forces an unexpected tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    The disused, ivy-choked station is vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action: the overgrown stair conceals the pit, the ivy mirrors the illuminated letter’s vines, and neighbors appear “between veils of ivy.” Setting details constrain choice (the shaft, rope, shifting brick) and directly shape tactics and imagery at closure. The ivy’s final metaphor—truth “like ivy” nailing itself to what stands—recharges the physical environment into theme. A touch more non-visual sensory grounding (sound, smell, cold) during the descent could make the atmosphere even more immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.2)
    The submerged pavilion is rendered with vivid, specific, and consistently functional detail: tide levels, scaffolding, algae, and mortar constraints directly shape what he can do and when. Environmental features (tide drop, masons’ seams, cavities behind plaques) are not just backdrop but the very means and limits of his project. The setting’s mood—“night here never shouts; it kindles a hushed blaze”—perfectly mirrors the story’s thematic interest in quiet persistence. The recurring physical dialogue between stone and water also charges the final images of coals under river glass.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sunken library, brine, algae glow, and failing pumps are vividly rendered and constantly integrated with action (“brine tick against cracked mosaics,” “blue algae veins seep their muffled luminance”). The environment meaningfully constrains choices: the blackout both endangers seals and enables the “listening grace” necessary for forensic reading. The stamp, lamps, and dome flex all charge the final image of leaving in darkness, making the setting inseparable from theme and tactic. A touch more direct physical interaction or risk tied to the environment at the climax could push this into the absolute top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating tea garden, glass basilica, spiral path, and gem-lantern workshop are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action: patrons arrive, steam is “raked” into cups, lanterns are delivered along the path that “descends while ascending.” Setting logic (island buoyed by memory, dream-archive basilica) shapes what’s possible and charges the ending as cranes rise inside the glass bell. Environmental specifics (rain-on-iron smell, panes vibrating “like held water”) deepen mood without feeling like a catalog. The world remains deliciously strange yet internally consistent, with the basilica and island directly constraining the ritual of release.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating observatory, desert, and instruments are rendered with striking, purposeful specificity (“creaks like a cathedral lantern,” “decks hum like dragonflies trapped in bottles”). Setting is tightly filtered through the narrator’s trauma—sky as verdict, salt flats like unreadable palm lines—and the observatory functions as a literal shelter that makes her work possible, not just a backdrop. The geode works as micro-setting/tool that directly charges the turning point when placed at the boundary and later as a “small planet of quartz” in the final image. I’m holding just below 9 because while the environment deeply colors meaning, it only lightly constrains tactics in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory is vivid and specific—cracked comet mural, bronze cord, cooling stone, telescope slit—and every major action is mediated by this environment. The dome and altar plate literally enable the experiment, and the closing of the dome to “keep our warmth penned” recharges earlier physical details in the final image. Tools (drones, ham set, telescope) are integrated as extensions of place and vocation, not props. The piece could edge even higher if weather, darkness, or physical dilapidation imposed a clearer obstacle or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting work is superb: the cobalt terrace, grassed dunes, and carved driftwood system feel tactile and idiosyncratic, and the world of “births and wrecks” notched into planks is original and lived-in. Environment and object-as-setting constrain choice—pressing the watch hand into the groove to access the hidden compartment is a literal mechanism. The return to the dew-slick terrace at the end charges the final image with place-specific weight rather than generic melancholy. Slightly more interaction between weather/terrain and physical difficulty could intensify the sense of embodied cost, but at this length the atmosphere already does significant work.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    The parapet, mist, tide, and lantern are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with tone and ritual, never reading as postcard description. The antique drawer pull functions as a micro-setting object that carries history and charges the final image, shaping how the negotiator understands their task. Weather and height (gusts clawing the tower, stones widening at the edge) inform staging and neutrality, though they rarely constrain physical options in a way that changes tactics. The sensory specificity feels lived-in and filtered through this particular profession and psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is vivid, precise, and entirely motive-shaped: launch, channel, breakwater, pylons, road, and marsh all constrain navigation choices and echo his professional habits. The astronomical compass and utility poles double as micro-setting and tools, actively guiding action (how he paddles and later walks) and charging the final image. Weather, tide, and light are present but never postcardy—they mirror interior states without leaning on blunt symbolism (“gulls stitched errant commas…editing my stubborn sentence”). The environment’s constraints and resources matter at every stage, especially the parallel road/poles that make his chosen route and ending possible.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    The underground bioluminescent lake is sensuously and functionally rendered: halos answering touch, currents as “petty tyrants,” ceiling dome, and the city market/fountain above. Environment constrains choices (boat, tunnels, midlake meeting, having to return to a specific fountain) and directly shapes the plot’s mechanics (empathy as algae to be transported). Details consistently filter through the narrator’s sensibility—cynical yet enchanted—so the setting never feels like a postcard. The final image of the market fountain seeded with lake-light cleanly recharges the earlier subterranean atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    The orchard under permanent moonlight is richly sensory and more than decorative: petals, hooves, and moon all respond, guide, and “host our listening,” charging the final image. Spices, animals, and the stone are integrated as micro-setting elements that directly mediate conjuration and metamorphosis, not just backdrop. Environmental details (moon lowering like counsel, petals as “small moons”) mirror and intensify the emotional arc without slipping into incoherence. The setting constrains what is possible—this is a place where beasts gather and vows take root—so its removal would fundamentally alter the story’s logic and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    The midnight glade above the clouds, pine and frost, and the cloud-path with chimes are sharply concrete and filtered through the narrator’s cartomancer sensibility. Setting and objects (cloth, saucer, brooch) aren’t decorative—they actively shape what’s possible (a high glade where minutes pool, cloth as doorway, saucer as vessel). Environmental and object details charge the final image of walking home “under a thinner moon” and tracing the baby’s hand. The specificity and consistency of this micro-world feel fully integrated with character and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.2)
    The recycled spaceship and the locked dimension are vividly concrete—museum glass hulls, funerary scaffolds, waste reclamation pipes “like sutures,” the breathing room “flexing like a lung”—and always filtered through the narrator’s caretaker-pacifist sensibility. Environment actively shapes tactics: artificial gravity must compensate for the narrator’s lightness, the inaccessible maintenance shaft is only reachable when joy loosens them, and the lock’s placement behind the reclamation ring dictates where and how they act. Kwan yin’s tear functions as a micro-setting tool that constrains choices and charges the final image at the narrator’s chest. The final transformation of the ship from “cobbled” to “quilted” cinches the environment’s thematic and structural integration.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally alive: black sand, ashfall, fumaroles, and celestial tides aren’t just scenic but directly shape tactics (the low tide exposes the shoal path and cave; fumaroles and volcanic rumblings frame danger). Details are consistently filtered through Mara’s sensibility, so even cosmic motions feel tactile (“pulling the sea like a velvet hem”). Environmental constraints—tide window, cliff seam, sea cave—govern what’s possible at each beat. The landscape meaningfully charges the final image of the beach “rethreading itself around the saved,” integrating place with thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    The fort, archive, courtyard, sundial, and hidden chamber are all sharply realized and filtered through the sentinel’s sensibility, creating a tactile, atmospheric world. Setting and objects meaningfully constrain and enable choices: the half-painted sundial encodes movement, the archive floor seam opens the way, and the cradle of sparks plus wheel physically embody the revolution. The luminous fort at twilight, initially a magistrates’ boast, is recharged in the final image as communal property, with the sundial’s “new shadows” crystallizing the shift. A touch more sensory breadth beyond the visual/metaphoric (e.g., bodily stakes in the dark) could deepen immediacy, but the integration is already excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly particular and fully integrated: the tidal bluff, frictionless world, aurora shedding star dust, and eel ladders all directly constrain tactics and resolution. Environmental rules (“everything slides unless persuaded by pattern”) are dramatized through action, not exposition, and the cliff’s “grip” in the final image recharges those earlier details. Objects-as-setting (painted rocks, bowl, eel-skin shoes) function as tools within that environment rather than decorative props. This is elite-level atmosphere and specificity, capped only by the global Q2-based high-band rule.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    The observatory above the clouds, the storm, and the darkroom remnants are intensely specific and sensorial, anchoring every move. Setting is not postcard décor: the altitude, storm timing, and darkroom history literally shape tactics (waiting for thunder’s in-breath, using the timer, reading to the lightning and town below). Environmental details evolve with the scene—rattling dome, hissing storm, clearing wind—and directly charge the final image of ink drying on sky. The world rules (photographic plates, storm-scratches, failing town lights) are consistent and thematically fused with scars and redaction.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glass atrium, brook, sundial, and orchid nursery are vivid and functionally integrated, with light and water literally enabling the code work and shaping tactics (waiting for noon, angling the sundial, “waiting for the light to shift”). Setting is consistently filtered through the narrator’s sensibility (“the atrium light shatters,” “brook count time more honestly than any clock”) and mirrors the thematic concern with measured, disciplined negotiation. The recurring objects (brook, sundial, needle card) meaningfully charge the final image. A slight sense of aesthetic luxuriance over constraint keeps this just shy of perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and specific throughout—“rusted library under stars, a shipwreck of pages and iron,” condemned by developers yet porous enough for trespassers, seeds, and neighbors. Environment and objects (bars, rebar, ivy, tarps, crates, the coffee tin) meaningfully shape tactics and options; the physical decay dictates their improvised methods. The recurring library space evolves from ruin to breathing, communal architecture, and that evolution charges the ending image. This is elite-level atmospheric work integrated tightly with action and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    The station, film booth, and tidal arbor are richly realized and deeply integrated with character and theme; details like the wobbling bench, ceiling-fan compasses, and salt-bleached seat are all charged, not decorative. Environment and objects constrain options: the broken clock and its minute hand become tools, the arbor becomes the only venue where the prelude and the reunion can occur, and the compasses’ behavior signals shifts in the rules of the world. The final passage back “through hidden sections in a black-and-white film reel” is inseparable from this world-building. At this length, the setting feels both vivid and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “ancient ridge in bloom,” stone hollow, cliffside sink, and reef are all sensuously drawn and consistently exploited as ritual sites, not just scenery. Environmental factors (the ridge’s chosen-real spot, the sink’s dormant memory, the reef’s treaty-power, the approaching monsoon) constrain where and how the protagonist can act. The final images—the sapling with ink-veined leaves, rain as “a library walking”—are charged directly by the setting’s properties. Description is dense but purposeful, consistently filtered through the narrator’s perceptual biases.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    The islet, rain-cleared atmosphere, tidal pool, and wind are vivid and tightly integrated into action; they are not postcard backdrops but the mechanism by which the “tides of remembrance” manifest. Tools and objects (bonsai, compass, indigo, lace) function as micro-settings that constrain how the ritual can proceed. Weather and stone literally shape the final image: the cupped black rock pool becomes the crucible where grief is “buried” and made to whisper. These details feel both sensuous and necessary, though one or two images verge on decorative rather than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is an active participant in the triage; specific details like the "brine" on the orchids and the "bowed frames" directly constrain the protagonist's choices. The use of butterfly dust to map the wind's pressure points is a brilliant, site-specific utilization of the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    Vivid, textured sensory details ("morning frost," "fused sand," "blackened crates") effectively ground the abstract themes. The setting actively shapes the discovery (frost map) and serves as the primary constraint for the final art piece.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.5)
    The setting is not merely a backdrop but the instrument of the story’s action; the "winterglass" and "frost" are the physical media through which the plot advances. Sensory details are shifted masterfully from sound to temperature and sight ("thermal lines," "panes fretted into lace"), creating a fully immersive and specific atmosphere that constrains and enables the characters' art.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    The underwater library is rendered with exceptional vividness ("arches ribbed with coral," "stacks of marble and silt"), transforming the setting into an active pressure on the narrative. The environment is not just a backdrop but a participant that forces the protagonist's realization about the "bottleneck" of grief.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the bell and arbor are tactile anchors that constrain action. Sensory details ("stars floating in it like distant coins") effectively ground the sanctions atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "breathing lantern" mechanics and "steel wool" light painting ground the ethereal premise in vivid, tactile specificity. The setting—a twilight viaduct with "fog collecting in the longer stones"—creates a cohesive atmosphere. The fusion of technical photography terms (aperture, salted paper) with body-horror elements works well.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptional—active, vivid, and integral to the plot. The "lung of green shadow" and breathing roots function as an antagonist that constrains movement and forces the protagonist’s choices, elevating the environment beyond mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the piano serves as a mechanical lock, and the redemption center's debris provides the tactical tools (tickets, arrow). Sensory details like "old syrup" and "damp wheat" create a vivid, distinct atmosphere that grounds the fable-like tone.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is vivid and highly specific, with the underwater greenhouse and "frostlight" constraining the sensory experience. The physics of the "ashen forge" underwater implies a habitat system that is atmospheric, though the spatial connection to the shipyard cavern requires slight inference.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)

Butterfly-wing dust is a recurring object whose bronze refusals guide which frames to replace; final image of dust lifting through taped cracks recharges the map metaphor. Spatial choreography is immaculate—river outside, trays numbered, eastern panes flagged. Environment directly shapes the “gradual change” tactics; without these specifics the slope strategy collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    The frost’s “quiet cartography” and the kiln’s “throat clogged with fused sand” are tactile, choice-guiding specifics, not postcard garnish. Environment literally gates entry: frost etch → hidden door → kiln, each constraining footfall timing. Small-object pressure: the brittle ledger strip’s bolt-pattern is a literal key. Final image of “stars cooled above like unlit kilns” recycles the setting into conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)

Weathered specificity (“rusted library under stars”) is irreplicable; swap setting and the trap-door beat collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fort, storm, and gold booklet constrain every beat: wind “threads sea breath through arrow slits,” flakes become “small harbors where wind could kneel,” and the ambered hush literally glazes the table, shaping the scribe’s hand.

Final aurora bruise recharges the opening “auroral sorrow,” charging the image with closure cost.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Tunnel, wheel, beads, ledger, tag—each object is handled, not catalogued. The beaded valve wheel constrains the final act: its glass/plastic beads bite skin, turning memory into wound. Grease-slick rails and lye-damp air evolve as gate opens; smell shifts from metallic to paper-bleach, guiding descent. Micro-setting succeeds: the lunch pail and ledger in the niche are the entire world for the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory filament is exquisitely selective—“stone arches sweat minerals that smell of thunder”—and every descriptor is filtered through the keeper’s loosened grip on reality. Library, river-refuge, and origami swan are re-used, lived-in, tactically functional; the swan finally constrains the exit paths. Micro-setting succeeds even if the global geography is dream-logic.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.2)
    Juniper roots, crushed sage, and shifting eclipse light are not backdrop but instruments: shadows lacework the shawl that lets Felix feel hidden enough to tap.

    Silver courtyard under snow functions as micro-setting: the reflective surface doubles as recording medium for footprints and refracted echoes, constraining how quietly Lira must move. Snow’s crunch resistance literally times her breath-metronome; frost bite threatens her toes—environmental cost felt on skin. Door that “grows from story” is object-as-setting: its material (braided narratives) is later dismantled, so environment itself is rewritten. Final image of path newly written in snow recharges the opening “blue hush” with agency rather than stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    The decommissioned dome functions as both skullcap and auditorium, its curvature literally steering echoes and metaphorically steering conscience. The campfire stick’s charred tally-notches are micro-setting that constrains who may speak next. Sensory economy is disciplined—rain as “distant pencil scratches,” moth as “soft percussion”—and these images recur to charge the final quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.0)
    The grotto’s altitude and wind currents materially shape the apparatus and the butterfly’s glide path; “clouds like sleeping herds” is filtered through a builder’s need to read air.

Final image reuses the ash basin as mirrored night, re-weighting the same object with covenantal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.9)
    Micro-setting triumph: the music box’s broken pin, the sanctuary’s hush, and Mara’s sternum function as tactile geographies that constrain every tactic. Sensory economy is ruthless—no visual sweep of dunes, only the glitter of a thorn learning mercy—yet the dust motions rewrite campaign maps underfoot. Final image recharges the broken pin pressed to skin, making the object the charged lens through which surrender is re-seen. One whisker from 9+ only because the outside world’s “reality shifts” remain a label, never a felt environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.0)
    Fog, rime, and apple skeletons are filtered through Iren’s tool-maker eye—every sensory note (velvet-clapper bell, hoarfrost routes) constrains his next move: where to place the next shard, when to exhale. The irrigation tower’s absence becomes the glass-mountain crest, charging the final image. Micro-setting (cracked sextant arc, frozen mud under sole) directly shapes tactical choices. No static tour; weather evolves with each breath beat.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cathedral-as-canopy is not postcard scenery; it literally supplies the drip-pressure that forces the repair and the final image of “a cathedral that had forgotten its congregation remembered fruit.” Micro-setting objects—spoon, copper wire, ribbon—function as portable terrain, constraining every twist of the fix. Spatial choreography is flawless: bodies on overturned pew, irrigation line traced along nave, water beadwork visible at eye-level. Only the faintest excess adjective drift (“thick drip returned to soil”) keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    The orchard is never static wallpaper: aurora leaves edit meteor-dust, stones glow like moons, the bathroom mirror wears frost—each detail filters through the narrator’s curator-eye and either guides choice (don’t touch flowers barehanded) or supplies the final image (seed slipped behind the frame). Spatial choreography is immaculate; we track shell, book, mirror, and pollen without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    The greenhouse is not a backdrop but an active instrument: quicksilver ribbons constrain pruning choices, the canal carries liquid night that literally rewrites the map, and the hovering pear charges the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate—armor drops in a legible sequence, shadows spell legible letters—so the orchard passes the 9+ gate test of constraining tactics. The slight undershoot is sensory overload: citrus constellations, syrup stars, and bell fruit sometimes compete for the same beat, muting selectivity.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    File room operates as micro-setting: “third shelf, Row M” constrains movement, dictates archival ritual, and supplies the button. Dust is tactile tool—read as ledger, map, memory—charging the final image when envelope is “weighted so it will not blow away.” Sensory hierarchy stays archivist-specific: fluorescent hum, brass greened by sweat, paper smell of neglect.

Cobalt grotto door dissolves into her “own nights,” a concrete reconfiguration that charges closure. Ember grotto’s slow cool under palm-pressed basalt directly enables the inter-cave wind birth—environment shapes outcome. Selective sensory economy (taste of rust, weight of filigree) never stalls momentum; texture propels rather than decorates.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Plaza, reactor, and spiral constrain every tactical decision; the grate’s circle literally shapes the final pebble stop. Twilight’s velvet lines narrow sensory bandwidth to heat and breath, matching escalating focus. Micro-setting (palm-gold stain, sleeve chalk) repeatedly alters options. No static cataloguing; every detail is handled or stepped on.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Creosote, spruce, shale cairn, and the cabin clock are not backdrop but instruments: the smell guides feet, the cairn rewrites identity, the clock sabotages chronology. The birch scroll’s pale scars literally serve as map and mirror, constraining the final editing act on the ridge. Spatial choreography is flawless; the hawk’s tilt is an environmental response to spoken grammar. Only the mirror moment drifts toward emblem, not tool, preventing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glass dome, fogged by deliberate breath, becomes micro-setting that must be negotiated before the screw can be eased; its condensation stripes guide the wire angle and directly constrain the fix. Tool specificity—bone pin drawer, thin wire, felt washer—grounds occupational plausibility without exposition dump. “Water binds at the screw” gives tactile physical logic that governs the climax beat. Spatial choreography is clean: three bodies around the bench, hands, dome, screw tracked without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    Floating rock platform and stormleaf lattice act as micro-setting that physically constrains inscription: tilt shifts with wind, crystallization blocks or releases the rune.

    Dome as “sleeping whale,” console dust deciding “where to land,” daylily edge “like a small star stuck in paper”—selective, POV-filtered, and purpose-built; every sensory detail is threaded through action (adjusting focus, copying glyphs, pressing flower into ledger). Micro-setting objects (telegram, ledger, monitor glow) constrain choices: the pressed petals dictate timing, the ledger’s scent cue memory, the altar inscription fixes the final vow. Spatial choreography clean; bodies track around telescope and console without drift. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism—dome breathes as they begin to breathe together.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    The swirling orchard vortex is not backdrop but antagonist: its rotation physically constrains Issa’s ritual steps and must be un-bent for progress. The flesh-eating seed acts as micro-setting/tool hybrid, its sieve-mouth determining how gently the ice can be breached. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she notices root-shivers, apple-bumps, the hush knit like armor—never touristic. Only the absence of a single weather or body-detail in the final image keeps it from 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glade is no postcard: its grass-paths wake only when the clipping is traced, making setting an active agent that reconfigures choice. Micro-setting—the maze-raised welts on skin—literally maps the route to the center, charging the final image. Cobalt dusk is filtered through a visionary bias that notices sap-memory over sight, grounding otherworldly events in sensory specificity. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies never float or teleport.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    The burned tarot card functions as micro-setting that constrains every choice: its residual heat decides when roots loosen, when the eye blinks, when the graft takes. Catacomb orchard is viscerally tracked—roots lift, pears exhale dust—yet detail never stalls momentum. Spatial choreography is clean: map → grove → corridor return, bodies and lantern positions remain traceable.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Quarry-as-amphitheater is immediate, sonic, and stakes the entire emotional history; every reverb image is rooted in acoustics, not decoration. The trailer’s dust, flickering maps, and coffee “old enough to have a pension” ground tension in breathable particulates. Spatial choreography stays clean—Lark waves him in, drawer handle snags, they step out—no floating bodies. Environment constrains the final choice: only the valley’s stone throat can convert his failure into a new “choir,” so setting directly charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    Micro-setting dominates: iron boughs, humming rails, “yellow as a candle” fruit—objects constrain every action and charge the final cradle image. Night ocean and skyward lattice are sketched with two senses each, never stall momentum. Spatial choreography is exact: climb → kneel at crossing → rotate rails → seed set → coil roots → fruit cradled; no impossible positions. Weather is causal: buried storms animate rails; ozone taste triggers memory. Orientation anchors early; environment mirrors internal gradient shift from haunted ambition to horizon acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal atrium’s shifting floor and moonrails constrain every cataloguing act; the creel’s weave literally accepts the alloys, charging the final image. Sensory triangulation—salt, tea, wet velvet—anchors without cataloguing. Spatial logic is clean across shards; the atrium’s “pupil” ceiling opening is a precise, camera-ready reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    The crystal caves are more than backdrop—they supply the only source of “tuned-bowl” acoustics that cue the inspector’s listening stance and later amplify the crowned stone’s resonance. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track lantern, clipboard, tin, shell, ledge, stalagmite in continuous, unconflicted motion. Micro-setting (the padded tin, hoop gasket) functions as portable altar and crown, literally constraining the final gesture. Environment charges the closing image: the mountain’s “new circlet” becomes the literal light source that replaces the lantern—setting is indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is lived-in instrument, not backdrop: ivy clicks like metronome, mica flashes like dragon teeth, the accordion’s taped scales mirror river skin, all filtering through the chronicler’s cartographer gaze. The station’s spatial logic is tracked cleanly from platform to waiting room to bathroom to freight gate; bodies and tools never float. Environment constrains the climax—only by kneeling at the rusted portal can the choke be reached and the confession written. One hairline slip: the culvert’s “cough” is acoustically vivid but never physically located relative to the platform, keeping the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    Fog, mist, vapor, and reeds function as both atmosphere and gate: the library door is literally vapor unlocked by timed pulses, so environment constrains tactics and charges the final image. Micro-setting (the watch, the veil) acts as navigational instruments whose physical states alter next moves. Spatial choreography is clean—harbor → marsh → lanterned spine—with sensory selection filtered through the POV’s bias for hush and delay. No credibility slips; the glowing library’s internal logic remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    The ice violin itself functions as micro-setting, constraining every beat—its cold limits handling time, dictates velvet surface, and finally forces the choice to release it before total melt. Velvet, jasmine scent, and cosmic dust create tactile, olfactory specificity filtered through the researcher’s plant-attuned bias. Spatial choreography is clean: velvet → courtyard vines → river stones; no impossible prop jumps. The river recharges every prior sensory motif, making environment the agent of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Skyborne grotto functions as micro-setting: aurora light supplies the literal power source for the emerald and dictates the hush-timing. Spatial choreography is flawless—stalactite beads, gull shadows, arch aperture all track without drift. Final image re-weights the grotto itself as threshold keeper.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grotto’s west-opening umbra and fog-to-water mechanics constrain every horticultural decision; the antique hairpin serves as micro-setting/tool that literally shapes the clay rims and finally the cane-tie, charging the closure image. Sensory economy is high—always filtered through vine-tending priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    Micro-setting rules: the taped mirror shard functions as both lantern and window; its hollow center literally reframes what Mara sees, constraining her final stance. Lighthouse wind-chime constellations are not backdrop—they are the decision engine; notes stand for cost/benefit/ghost and directly output the plan she will present. Salt-stiff cloak hung on nail evolves from emblem to prop: its removed weight allows the exhale that enables signature. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: city planner notices hinge-point homes, tidal maps, shell-stacking child—details that later become negotiation chips.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.2)
    Setting is protagonist: floating platform, magnetic grotto, iron-sand alphabet each constrain attention and later choice. Micro-setting rules (pebble → rings → readable iron) directly enable the thematic re-pricing; without the pond’s literal surface the lesson of “vanishing to appear” collapses. Sensory triangulation—bone-hum, starlight, water-crown—keeps orientation almost tactile while remaining lyrically compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.0)
    The canyon’s bone towers actively constrain—sound sketched by marrow, gulls braiding a boundary the pulse will not cross—so environment shapes tactics. Micro-setting (arrowhead as tuning wedge) charges closure when it warms, reweighting grandmother’s legacy. Sensory hierarchy obeys the skimmer’s ear-centric craft; visual detail is filtered through acoustic consequence. Spatial choreography remains flawless across bird flocks, echo ribs, and the river-ghost seam.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    The icebound spire and hanging garden are vividly selective—“ice scaled the granite,” “moonmilk saturated into stone”—and the micro-setting of the keystone pedestal constrains the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean: mist staircase, doorless landing, pavilion lean. Sensory hierarchy reflects the mage’s poetic bias; no tourism catalog. The environment does not merely mirror mood; the keystone’s temperature literally directs his slowing perception, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.2)
    The pier’s vertical ladder, weed-slippery pilings, and the ship’s rib-scrolled spine are navigated tactically—rope coil, skiff, window—and the final lift of the lamp is charged by that spatial memory. Sensory hierarchy matches urgency: tin-to-velvet sound shift narrows perception during descent, algae-lit spines widen it inside. Environment constrains the climax: only inside the drowned library can the tag become tuning plate; without that sideways hush, the new color never vibrates. Specificity is irreplaceable—no generic underwater scene could supply the same acoustic-cum-chromatic epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ambered deck, glass coil, and coin-speakers form a micro-setting that constrains every choice: coolant must be distilled from dawn-tears, antenna geometry is set by coin scatter, the room’s taste changes with signal. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: metallic hum, honey light, cold syllables. Spatial choreography is crisp—coins glitter, collide, carve a listening curve; receiver lowers its hum after coolant gift. Setting details evolve causally: residue beads, is coaxed, consumed, then bowed back. The final image recharges the amber as both cradle and launchpad.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cracked prism and foxed atlas act as micro-setting that literally steers the crystallizing ritual; dusk observatory breathes cold that numbs fingers and forces haste. Spatial anchors hold from first stone echo to final stair vanish; the dome’s ribs and tape corridors track cleanly across moves. Environment constrains the final image—night “takes the steps,” enforcing departure with the lexicon now internalized.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    The viaduct’s blue-glass mortar and weeping stone actively constrain the ritual—each drip is a metronome, the wet rope a liability. Body-tool-environment fusion: arch, bell, and clapper become one instrument; the setting literally supplies the music. Spatial choreography is flawless (line tied under seam, bell aligned with hairline in stone). The final image of “lukewarm magic proving exactly warm enough” could not exist without the specific slag-glass dawn that filters the light that calls the fish-memories.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Reservoir mud, re-emerging porch ribs, and the sapphire label function as micro-settings that actively constrain movement and choice. The draining water is not mere backdrop; it enables every beat of salvage and discovery. Sensory hierarchy mirrors the warden’s vigilance—sound of footsteps, glint of glass—keeping detail selective. Spatial choreography is clean: ridge → tavern silt → church steps → photo line; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.2)
    The orchard’s stonefruit-iron scent and refracting waterfall constrain her breathing cadence and chalk-mapping tactic; setting is not backdrop but instrument. The frozen dew crystal functions as micro-setting—its lattice and chill literally direct her gaze and the story’s final gesture. Spatial choreography is flawless: brazier, crystal, moss bed, and chalk circles track without drift. Kaleidoscopic waterfall returns in the last line to ribbon her hands, charging the exit image with the same prism that opened the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    The arbor-as-lung, silk rope, lantern braid, and treetop court function as micro-setting that directly governs movement and perception; every gust is counted, every footfall paddles bark.  Sensory hierarchy obeys professional priorities: sound of buckle chatter overrides sight; touch ladder overrules verbal jargon.  Night-time altitude physics stay credible—pressure wave up the cable, glide path widened by wind shear.  Final lantern light pooling inside cloud hollows charges the closing image, capping the arbor’s role as witness.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating rock dojo isn’t backdrop—it supplies the aerial courtroom whose sky-edge air rights are literally at stake, forcing the hearing to be held there. The bamboo blade and brain-jar function as micro-setting: their tactile handling (strike, palm-press) constrains the verdict moment. Spatial choreography is crisp: bodies move from separate rocks to joint jar-carry without drift. Weather is integrated—the chimes measure thought like weather, then still to signal assent, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lantern-gold on wet stones, mossed postbox, scent vials in rafters—selective sensory detail is braided through action and constrains tactics (where the seed is planted, how the room is built). Brook and storm-born silence return in the final image, re-weighted from menace to guardianship, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is the tunnel-as-throat, its oils of “hands that had pressed against this world” constraining every sonic maneuver; the blower nozzles literally cannot angle away from that skin of grief.

The tuning fork on the sill is micro-setting that charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    The frozen garden is not backdrop but tactical: the rime-covered bench is where they “practice the plain bravery of letting minutes pass,” making weather a coerced room that later stops shivering; the pendant’s crystal eye and the comma-sliver are micro-settings that literally reconfigure vision and hence choice.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ember nexus is not backdrop but lung: five furnace-flues “breathe,” guiding his micro-moves (distance to crucible, heat bent toward hollow). Frost petals on stone mirror the internal frozen bloom he will grow, binding atmosphere to tactic. Wire-and-frost lattice and slag soil evolve with each firing, constraining later choices. Final image—loop planted, dew dripping into soil—recharges every prior ember/frost pairing with patience made tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tower-gorge rig, moon-tugged cables, and bottle-cap coupling are tactile constraints that dictate where the horn can aim; the final “lullaby water” recharges the gorge from void to archive, earning the 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    The spectral grotto’s star-holes and breathing water constrain the ritual choices; the empty hourglass acts as micro-setting that must be tipped to channel starlight. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—professional deckhand notices “pilings that remember more hulls than years,” not tourist scenery. Environmental mirror (“surface breathing in time with my ribs”) integrates external state with internal stakes. One notch off 9 only because tide-forgetting rule is asserted rather than shown affecting prior commutes.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    The gallery itself—mirrors that “discipline dreams into sentences,” stairs that ascend and descend at once—functions as both arena and tool, constraining every micro-choice. The sinew thread’s tacky resin and the floor’s “skin remembering touch” provide tactile specificity that charges the final image of re-approach.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.1)
    Benthic pressure is not backdrop but actuator: cracked dome patched to scumble, anchor ring warming under projector, tidal sky of kelp-shadow latitudes.

Environment directly shapes tactics and final image—clears 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.0)
    The littoral cave, copper housings, and gold-fleck electroscope function as micro-setting that directly constrains every beat: tide governs entry, temperature shift revives circuits, mica square frames the final quiver. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—air tastes of kelp and copper, cables “croon” interference—never catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: console, bench, mugs, doorway track without drift. Final image of vigil “riding the sheath” recharges the undersea cable motif, locking setting to theme.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    Observatory-as-body: frost on lenses, whale-note dome ribs, draining ink rivers anchor every beat. The porcelain shard functions as micro-setting that literally scores the sky at closure, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    The canyon’s bone towers, copper wire, and flawed diamond function as micro-setting that physically constrains tactics: palm-placement dictated by bird veer, diamond bite fixing the braid. Sensory hierarchy is POV-specific—metal-skinned patience, friction-voice transduction—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography remains coherent across palm-press, wire-tether, crosswind split. Final image of diamond set in “gentle bite” fuses body-tool-environment, charging closure under Q3 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    The garden’s brick ribs, dangling roots, and “spores…in rings” are sensuously particular and constrain tactics—pollen orbits only after the willow-spark ritual, making the micro-setting an actor. Frost, soil, and cordless-phone static cohere into an inhospitable yet breathable bubble that the final image recharges.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.0)
    Enchanted orchard is not backdrop but antagonist: iron rails threaded through roots literally shackle choice; statues’ copper-lidded eyes track motion and later slacken under sound. Micro-setting (locust shell wedged under violin bridge) determines timbre and thus revolt. Weathered bells, brass leaves, and “pages groan” charge the final image. Meets 9+ gate: environment constrains tactics and is reconfigured at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cobalt arcade is evoked with sensory precision and constrains movement: the courier must bow to drones, hug walls, time the drop. The river-bridge “forgotten by maps” is a micro-setting that literally reroutes fate. Weather is not backdrop but tool—one sigh of storm buys passage—so environment shapes tactics and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is the pressure crucible: rusted bolts become reliquaries, calliope pipes turn crabgrass chimneys—details constrain what restoration is possible by hand. Micro-set piece “hidden oasis” cracks the water tank into usable mirror/pond, directly supplying the coolant the bearings will need, hence environment shapes next tactic. Sensory hierarchy stays carpenter-biased—touch, rust grit, wind-bell pitch—no tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography survives thornbrush squeeze, sleeping-car gaps, and carousel climb without drift or impossible body placements.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Micro-setting triumph: the scarf, atlas hinge, and floor-tile tessellations constrain the path and charge the final image. Hyperbolic shelves function as both labyrinth and lung, guiding the narrator’s movement and reconfiguring at closure. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—“smell of pencil shavings and rain”—and never drifts into tourist catalog. The environment actively collaborates in the turn, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment is not backdrop: the canal’s rust taste, the prayer-flat rock’s spatial constraint, and the palette’s salted corners all shape the tripod placement and color-matching tactic. The “coastline made of letters” final image is charged by these micro-settings, satisfying the 9+ gate. Whisper cadence acts as live clock, tightening time. One minor slack: “stone mouths” is vivid but not re-anchored later, leaving one spatial cue floating.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)
    Blackthorn valley, crickets-as-clerks, and the moon-welded hinges are not scenery but instruments that must be read before the lock will turn. Micro-setting triumph: the freestanding door’s grain, keyhole pupil, and dust-moth wings constrain the locksmith’s tools to breath and hair. Starlight re-anchors spatial relations at the climax, making the final step across the threshold a navigable move rather than a symbolic leap. Only the “reed song” coda drifts toward postcard, but it is outside the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sunken greenhouse constrains every move: broken panes dictate star-maps, silt geometry forbids careless fin strokes, the mushroom circle literally gates the past; the setting is not backdrop but the mechanism that retrieves memory and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Forgotten library operates as micro-setting: dust turns to glittering script, lectern becomes hinge, mirror shard reorients space. Every sensory detail is filtered through archivist’s archival gaze—air “preferring to be archived.” The empty swing outside is audible through walls, tightening the clock. Environment directly constrains the final choice: the aisle opens only when hush is allowed in.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    The parapet waterfall and mossy stone remain tactile and constraining: the pruner works at the cliff’s lip, shears in belt, mist on skin. The heirloom seed’s burnished thumbprints and the root-bridge’s violin tremor charge both tool and environment so they alter tactics (seed planted in warmed soil, bridge crossed with hook). Spatial choreography holds across the mirror-orchard and return. Minor over-packaging of lyric adjectives (“radiant hush,” “starlit mouths”) nicks economy but never obscures the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prism sanctuary is not backdrop but working machinery: its glass ribs refract moonlight into “patient geometry” that guides the ritual steps; the quartz floor hides the coffer whose barnacled surface is handled on-page. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—salt smell, kelp sack, cold threads, wet compass silt—selected by a restorer who thinks in tides and knots. Spatial choreography is immaculate: daughter at threshold, net above coffer, shard fitted to bench, sack exchanged—their positions track without drift. The micro-setting (needle, coffer, net) constrains every tactical move and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.1)
    The limestone door, rusted tongue-handle, and rain-scoured fresco vault are tactile, lived-in, and constrain every move; the protagonist’s decision not to force the tongue is dictated by the chapel’s physical whisper. Sensory hierarchy follows professional map-framer priorities: fiber grain, salt blooms, draft angle. Final image of the breathing panel is inseparable from setting’s prior damp exhale. World rules (draft, hinge hiss, lichen growth) stay consistent and charge the Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    The library-as-body, barnacle-etched brass numbers, and the globe that “knocked my wrist as if impatient” act as micro-setting that constrains each splice, photograph, and final release. Sensory triangulation (salt taste, crackling helmet mic, glove friction on tape) is selective and POV-filtered. Environment charges the final image: the globe ascending alone literalizes the “physics of letting go,” satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    The flower press bolt plate functions as micro-setting: it physically braces the stencil, grounds lethal static, and finally becomes the literal “key” left for the next storm—meeting the 9+ gate. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“steel glinting like a coin minted for rain,” “petals crackle with ozone”). Spatial choreography is immaculate across the parapet, railing, and distant towers. Weather is not backdrop but conductor: lightning precedes every causal breath the ghost takes.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.0)
    The icebound spire is not backdrop; its rattling cage, hoarfrost corridor, and crystalline map physically force the servant’s choices. The goggles act as micro-setting, refracting both light and meaning, and their final stillness in the “forgetter room” reweights the entire ascent. No other 600-word piece this cycle uses environment this integrally.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Gondola, telescope, notebook, graphite line, and “dusty starlight” function as micro-setting; each constrains gesture and charges the final steadiness. Vague town-lights below remain un-detailed, but airborne capsule’s creaks, burner cough, and fogged lens track spatially across every beat. Weather details (colder layers, ozone scent) alter tactic and body—exactly the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is texture engine: the tree-trunk library’s warm sap, swelling book-spines, and migrating cracks actively constrain where paint can adhere and where stars must be gilded. Sensory hierarchy mirrors the protagonist’s perceptual bias—sound of held breath, smell of old lime—so environment and body fuse. The imminent demolition clock charges every detail; the crane’s cough is a metronome. One micro-gap: spatial relation of “chemistry shelves” to the tin could be cleaner, but it never confuses action.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.9)
    Airship ribs, cumin hold, chalked hopscotch, and pressure-kissed teeth are selective, tactile, and steer choice. The hopscotch board literally sets the climb vector; the thinning blue dictates the net’s timing. Starling murmurations function as both weather and chorus, their cursive shaping the cadence of ascent. Environment constrains tactics and charges the final fold.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Frozen library, hoarfrost corridors, and the gear-as-micro-setting constrain every motion; cold literally slows breath and oil viscosity, charging the final thawed ladder.

Spatial choreography is clean: gear unrolled, panels overlapped, note weighted.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.8)
    Floating rock arches function as both atmosphere and mechanism: their shadows literally braid the fields and their hollow throats later answer the bell’s note—environment constrains and enables the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (dust braiding into silver spirals, dew beading scars). Spatial choreography is clean: relay handoffs, climb sequence, bell tilt at height track without drift. The orchard planet rules are learned through action, no expo dump; tool (bell) and micro-setting (archway lip) charge the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse, pane of hush, and puppet head are not backdrop but tools that constrain each ritual step; the pane literally swallows sound, altering what the adjuster can hear before acting. Spatial choreography is immaculate—hand, key, finial, lens move in tracked succession. Weather and tide evolve from bruised dusk to confident starlight, mirroring the clock’s slackening. Only missing is a sharper bodily risk from the environment to reach 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cliff-orchard is not backdrop but tactical terrain: the iron-taste olives, copper-thyme corridor, and frost deadline physically shape every subterfuge. Mechanical birds act as moving walls whose gear-nut vulnerability is discovered through lived handling, not exposition. The final image recharges the setting as the caretaker turns back into “graceless beauty that still required me,” fusing body & place. Spatial choreography is flawless—no impossible positions across ladders, terraces, reed-ledge, frost-line.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.0)
    The braided ravine is not backdrop but active constraint: forked channels dictate filament placement, foam patterns teach polymer design, alder roots serve as anchors.

Spatial choreography is immaculate; distances and water hiss track across every step.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.0)
    The glass-orchard library is not backdrop; its humming branches dictate the rule-set—parole is granted only when a story is released. Micro-setting (moonlight-filled cut in the counter) literally becomes the door the narrator leans through. Spatial choreography is immaculate: counter → shelf → wrist → ledger → cloud sea, each object handled and altering next moves. One minor over-description (“mountains in a lake”) does not dull the final image’s charge.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Desert-rain grit, petrichor, and copper bowls are filtered through chef-perception; every sensory pick is action-anchored (kneeling to trace filigree, ladling amber). The clay brazier’s “lip remembered kettles” exemplifies object-as-setting that constrains the chef’s tender handling of fire and ice. Spatial choreography clean: gate → dunes → pavilion → return, with distance tracked by “east toward the dunes like ribs.” Final image of steaming bowls inside the kitchen re-weights the earlier “brittle music” walls into “weathered warmth,” satisfying micro-setting payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clock-tower gears, pendulum shivers, and spilled-grain syllables are filtered through Mara’s tuned ear; every descriptor doubles as actuator (gears “click like castanets,” grain “coughs with chaff”). The elevator-as-organ metaphor is sustained without physics violation and constrains final action—chute offers boards when respected as social lung. Micro-setting (body + weight + zodiacal face) charged in final palm-press image satisfies 9+ gate. No orientation drift; astral hush is cue, not confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    The broken periscope mirror functions as micro-setting: its tilt angles moonlight onto spine and decision, constraining the final calibration. Canyon walls supply harmonic feedback that times breathing; moon doubles as metronome—environment literally paces the neural experiment. Sensory triage is POV-driven—engineer notices solder, theta-wave dials, not tourist geology. Final image packs the mirror away, proving the setting has been internalized as tool and conscience. Weather stays consistent, never decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    Environment is not backdrop but interface: mist-thickness governs walkable sky, grotto coils force cork-screw pathing. Sensory hierarchy obeys archivist bias—light refracts, spores luminesce only in peripheral vision. Micro-setting “panel scored like sea-creature ribs” becomes the lock that demands touch-rhythm, constraining success. Final image of “lake of smoke” above the head reweights prior space rules and charges the exit.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    The porcelain insulator, copper leaves, and hair-thin wires function as micro-setting; their tactile handling constrains every tuning gesture and re-appears in the final image, mending air like fabric. Spatial anchors (fern roots, river ankle-lean) are clear by line 8; no orientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.0)
    The magnetic rail, basalt stone, and aurora-constrained board function as micro-setting that literally guides piece placement; removing any one breaks the tactic chain. Cold iron’s hum, snowmotes on wool, and the guard’s lantern create a sensory hierarchy filtered through the tutor’s risk-calculating ear. Spatial choreography is immaculate: bodies, pieces, compass needle track cleanly across the parapet. Weather and metal jointly decide the final quiet widening that recharges the covenant.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bench-top micro-setting functions as crucible: coils, clasp, and fennel sprig constrain every tactical move; even the lamp becomes a character that “likes applause.” City-scaffold and star-scaffold outside mirror the interior scaffolding oflistening machines, tightening perceptual hierarchy to the tools at hand. Sensory triage is POV-driven—“tremble like stage curtains,” “tastes of tin”—never cataloguing for its own sake. One hairline slip: “scaffolding of constellations” is repeated with only a comma’s difference, blunting freshness a notch.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.1)
    The swaying platform, cedar baskets, and wrapping-paper galaxies are not garnish—they steer tactics (where to plant, how to slow stench). Olfactory landscape replaces visual postcard, turning odor into geography that literally reroutes bodies. Final image of “braided hands” of air and villagers fuses micro-setting to theme, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.0)
    “Orchards glowed like lanterns under floating rock arches” is an instant, unforgettable postcard, yet every detail is filtered through pilot-utility: harness, spill, spray, root-braid tether. The hollow root-sphere and black-glass shard are micro-settings that directly constrain choice—no plug, no song, no safe lane. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: under the veil only “drips crawl upward like silver insects,” wider vistas vanish. Final seed tucked “near my heart” makes the body itself setting/anchor; this micro-object charges the closing image, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    The container labyrinth is not backdrop but ventilation chamber: its “narrow lungs” actively funnels gusts that buck the plane, so environment directly shapes the crash and the fix. Micro-setting—the salt-stiff patch, the scuffed bulkhead—constrains the investigator’s next move (trace the curve). The final image of fluttering notes that “settle” against the grid shows the setting has been rewritten by human geometry. Gate met: environment charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.2)
    Ice-cavern micro-setting is continuously handled—frostbitten palms, breath on glass, aurora rib-glow—each sensory beat doubles as tool/constraint (cold can kill sleep, ice refracts tone); the sculpted hush itself finishes as the “carved harbor,” a setting-state that houses the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Canyon walls, dried-river shale, driftwood markers, and the flute-as-micro-setting constrain every move; the final image of dew-lit driftwood arrows reweights the stake. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven, never touristic; spatial choreography remains exact.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Topaz panes, citrus-ink smell, and the halo fragment’s tide-coolness act as micro-setting that constrains action: the fragment literally steadies the chase and later steadies the apprentice’s palm. Star intervals serve as a live clock, tightening the room’s hush. Spatial choreography holds across roller-lever-cleanup moves; no floating props. Final image of the proof “hung like a small constellation” reuses the stellar motif to reweight the setting itself as earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dragonfly-wing pendant operates as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice; its quiver paces every beat. Aurora and ridgeway supply tonal silk/ribbon imagery that mirrors the pendant’s shimmer, integrating macro and micro environments. Thyme-scented sand inside the reliquary charges the final image with sensory specificity. Spatial choreography stays clean: cairn → slope → blade-narrow ridge with no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.0)
    Quartz arbor, mist, and frost-covered sedan function as micro-setting that literally refracts and records emotion; the prism’s auroras on the ribs are the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys mystic’s priorities: visual breath, tactile cold, auditory tick. Spatial choreography is clean—hand to hood, palm to dash, prism angle to windshield. Environment constrains the only possible “communion”—no other surface could hold transient frost memory.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    The orchard-bamboo grove is never backdrop: fruitless branches drop the single pale leaf into her hands, a causal omen; the loom’s frame and bead are micro-settings that constrain every move. Sensory hierarchy is spinner-biased—air as thread, silence as wool—guiding the jigsaw placement and breath-weaving. Spatial choreography is clean: edges nest, bead slides across the threshold, distance stacked like silent layers. Final image recharges the same moon-stippled blanket and whispering bamboo, now fermenting warmth and bees.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    “Orchard planet riddled with floating rock arches” is never backdrop: the leaning trees, bruised apples, and drift-scale anchor every tactical move. Mine-shaft wind-organ mechanics are taught early and constrain how repair can occur; the lamp, bell, and silk function as micro-settings that determine what can be attempted in tight spaces. Sensory hierarchy obeys blacksmith priorities—iron-cold scent, dovetail clatter, hoist’s oil fragrance—keeping description tethered to tool-use. Final image of polite, measured ellipses re-configures the same arches, now safe to hand-craft, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is micro-scaled yet omnipresent: cracked concrete, rusted gantry, coolant puddle become extensions of the narrator’s sensory kit. The green glass shard functions as mobile setting-object; its temperature and hum constrain every tactical choice. Spatial choreography is immaculate—tap, climb, wedge, swallow—each motion maps onto tactile surfaces. Final image of shard left “a bead in the loom” shows environment altered by action, steadying futures. Atmosphere of deferred intentions brewed from mint-and-burned-dust coolant remains consistent across parallel overlays. Gate met: environment charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lantern room glass, brass rungs, and green shard function as micro-setting that constrains the final act—oil must be poured inside the jar, sea glass locked under the rung. Weather and automation rumors press inward, guiding the silence the narrator chooses to protect. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies never float.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Selective, POV-filtered coastal detail: salt-fog, groaning docks, pollen from vanished forests—each mirrored in narrator’s body and tool. Lighthouse interior is micro-setting whose convex lens and hairline fractures constrain every tactical move. Spatial choreography holds as narrator climbs, cools, rewraps wick while gyre threads harbor. Final image of pollen on future orchard ground charges setting with conceptual cost, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.2)
    The tea house island, tether posts, and valley mist are not backdrop but pressure mechanics: the floating rock’s drift literalizes “iridescent caution” and the sun-tracked cloth becomes a navigational tool. Micro-setting extends to the body—the scar and new pulse—constraining every beat. Final image of “slung light along the ridges” recharges the sun-trail map, proving environment shapes the closure. Specificity is so tight that removing any spatial detail would collapse the story’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tower, forest canopy, and moon-polished parapet act as micro-setting that literally enables the climax: the sextant must touch sky and bark simultaneously to complete the sorrow-meter. Sensory hierarchy is POV-tuned: custodian notices flake-patterns, mop-scuffs, dream-dust “like mica” because his job is reading seams. Weather is causal: moonlight heals walls, stormlight hums the shell, both dictating when maintenance can map sorrow. Tool-as-setting (broken sextant) constrains the final alignment, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is not backdrop but instrument: the greenhouse’s glass, sap, and lamps constrain every tactic—warmth bargained for, songs angled toward panes, dawn cloth draped over trees. The mica window reappears cracked yet luminous, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys the keeper’s alchemical priorities; no tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate across the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    The laundromat-machine portal, detergent shelf breathing inward, anchors who-where-when with tactile specificity and pressures entry; the brass plate that “hummed when truth touched” later constrains membership, charging closure. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no impossible moves—while “air tasted of paper, wool, and patience” filters environment through sensory hierarchy of a bookmender. Micro-setting triumph: the driftwood table’s “map of old river scars” steers the final epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Secret tea-house, ivy, cracked fountain, koi tiles, tatami, shell path—details accrue as tactile resources that shape tactics (where to plant, how to sweep, what to hide). Micro-objects (bread, bell, kettle) double as setting when they constrain sharing or ritual timing. Sensory hierarchy follows the narrator’s caretaker bias: scent of cedar, whisper of sesame, weight of shell. Final image of dew on chalk re-weights the courtyard as mutable sanctuary—setting actively participates in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.2)
    The frozen library is no backdrop; its “quartz hush” and frost-bitten ladders constrain every gesture—gloves smell of cedar and ice, the barometer is cracked, the dome flexes. The magic-lantern slide functions as micro-setting: its velvet hood and migrating constellations of light directly shape the decision to archive or farewell. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—catalog cards curl “like tired tongues,” a tactile metaphor born of lifelong handling. Weather (avalanche sigh) and spatial choreography (lantern ribs, terrace of ice) evolve causally with each projection.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rotting-pier market is evoked through salt, hook squeals, and a crate “iron nails blooming with orange,” each detail filtering the protagonist’s professional eye for contraband. Micro-setting success: the crate surface becomes the bargaining altar and its swollen wood directly shapes the hush-truce pacing. No static catalogue; every sensory note is braided into the next false-start gambit. Final image—the fob “holding open a breathing door”—re-uses the object-as-setting to charge the exit beat.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lavender-bluff-under-aurora is not postcard scenery; pollen ballots and lichen counters turn forest into polity, constraining the timing of the converge action. The tin ring functions as micro-setting: its changing tastes dictate direction, charging the final image when “salt binds storms.” Bodies move through fog-leaking pockets and steaming kettles, so every object is handled, not lectured. Spatial choreography stays clean across the climb to crest.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.1)
    Subterranean crystal cave is not backdrop—its quartz shards, lantern glow, and returning chime constrain every beat and supply the literal key mechanism. The scarf, tin, and blank mica-bound book each act as micro-settings that alter tactics. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and objects track without drift. Final image of cave “charging the pages with morning” reweights the entire archive, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glass-lung city is not postcard flora; it literally breathes for its citizens and therefore sets the oxygen-tax stakes. Micro-setting—floorboards curled “like tongues bitten too long”—is tactile, lived-in, and later pried up to yield the map shreds, so the same object first sets atmosphere then enables plot. The greenhouse corridors, cisterns of undecided air, and the Ear’s corroded slot each constrain movement and force the confession payment. Sensory economy obeys POV: a calligrapher notices glue breath “sharp and clean like a reprimand,” echoing both ink solvent and moral sting. Spatial choreography is flawless: map spread ➜ vents closed ➜ slot tested ➜ ribbon coil—every object trackable. The final image of fingertip-grease-scarred panes reuses earlier noticed detail to charge the closing vista. 9+ gate met: the copper spindle and scarred panes together charge the ending image and shape the release tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.0)
    The kinetic sculpture itself functions as micro-setting; its brass frames and wind-throat constrain every tuning choice and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Mara notices temperature of metal, taste of copper-leaf rain, tilt of shadows. Spatial choreography is immaculate—rail, basins, reed channels track without drift. Environment evolves: iceberg sweats → channels → new percussion, causal ripple that reconfigures the bluff into reciprocal listener.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dome’s honeycomb shutters, copper shavings, and terracotta shard packets are not backdrop but tactical gear: the corridor width “thin as a wrist” constrains flame spread; vials of cultured scent become portable futures. Desert roses that “bloom brighter after fire” mirror the android’s own carbonized evolution. Final image—buried packet teaching roots “to find morning in this revised geography”—makes setting itself the mutable compass. Sensory hierarchy obeys machine perception: magnetic hum, glass cooling clicks, ion tongue.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.3)
    The courtyard, mailbox cluster, and locket function as micro-setting that directly constrains action (who can approach, how the lock is tried). Sensory detail is selective (dust like hush, spoons clinking enamel) and filtered through the curator’s thrifter eye. The “vibrant courtyard at dawn” reappears at closure, re-weighted from anxious waiting to shared release, satisfying the 9+ gate. Light cap for one slightly generic “developer’s banner” tag.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sunken laboratory constrains every move: pressure quivers Neri’s shoulders, grating dictates heel-toe grammar, frosted tank glass forces brow-press whisper.

Dice scarred with gallows and rust that “remembers” supply micro-setting objects that charge final image. Spatial choreography clean: bodies track from corridor to bulkhead to hatch without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Harbor, pier, workshed chamber, whale carcass—each is filtered through Ilya’s lantern-tending gaze; salt cubes function as micro-setting that alters choice (he must wait for gravity slack). Weather is iron-tasting air; spatial choreography stays clean as he moves pier → chamber → whale. Sensory hierarchy privileges salt, cold, metallic sound; no exposition dump. The whale bones charge the final image, satisfying 9+ gate. Selective detail never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.1)
    The brook, reeds, and origami wing function as micro-setting: the water’s “simple body” and star-lattice grid literally constrain how the prophecy can travel, providing the only pathway the code could ride. Sensory economy is perfect—sound thins/heavy spots are named, never catalogued—and the final ordinary haven is charged by prior cosmic stakes. Environment directly shapes tactics and final image, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rooftop garden, basil scent, broken tiles, meteor shower, and the seal as micro-setting all filter through a consistent perceptual signature; the seal finally brands the narrator, charging the last image. Spatial choreography is clean across the single scene. Sensory selection mirrors emotional tempo—meteor flashes narrow attention, cooling stone widens it. Environment both constrains (only parapet for stamping) and resources (beeswax, candle) choices, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.1)
    The velvet garden, shell, and twilight operate as micro-setting: the garden’s breathing hedges and glass bell constrain every move and literally house the archive.

The final image of the shell left “on a nail, an ear for travelers” charges the setting with forward-looking cost. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating props or impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Marble, oculus, stalactite drips, and refracted aurora are filtered through a calligrapher’s eye for line and texture; the sanctuary’s cold surface and micro-condensate literally become ink, constraining the act of rewriting; spatial choreography is clean; only the river guilds remain off-page abstractions, a minor loss of specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    The serpentine nexus functions as micro-setting: its coiled walls force the singer to crawl and later to stand where breath can reroute echoes. Shell, body, and stone each constrain choice; the final image of sunlight feeding the shell charges the closing beat. Sensory hierarchy favors sound over sight, matching the POV’s profession.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.0)
    The glacier shrine is not backdrop but tool: its candle-warmed seams decide when the ghost can arrive, and the thinning ice literally windows the starlight that baptizes the name. Micro-setting—the melted snow globe—constrains the final gesture: only because its base is scarred can the letters be read, making the object the fulcrum of closure. Spatial choreography is immaculate; the narrator’s knees, the girl’s blink, the smoke writing frozen pleas all track without drift. Every sensory detail is filtered through the POV’s professional lexicon of salvage and breath.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sweating stones, slug cursive, and the whisk-as-anemone are sensuous yet purposive: the wet parapet enables the whistle’s echo slide and the firefly lanterning that guides the descent. The bamboo whisk recurs as micro-setting, constraining the philosopher’s gestures and charging the final image when hung “to dry, its bristles remembering… constellations.” Spatial choreography across bastion, sluice, and courtyard is clean. Only the estuary’s geography stays vaguely sketched, preventing full 9+ entry.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dust that “blew red and bright,” leaves like “polished armor,” and the scarecrow’s welded rebar create tactile, POV-filtered specificity. The stillpoint itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice—without its vacuum-quiet the diamond’s song would not re-tune the narrator’s compass. Spatial choreography is clean across the grove, shack, scarecrow. One minor over-description cluster (“dust fell straight down as if on strings”) keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stormlit observatory anchors by line 3; cobalt glass portico returns as both lightning rod and stage, constraining the final image. Sensory selection is urgent—penny-smelling thunder, whale-skull hum—filtered through the narrator’s radio-tuned ear.

Spatial choreography is flawless—wheel-scratches, hinge-grit, and hidden walkway angles are tracked while the stopwatch ticks. The lantern itself serves as micro-setting: its shifting circle on the wall literally reveals the secret egress, fusing object and environment into one choice-forcing surface.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    The shop’s “velveted gears” and “drawers of tiny screws” constrain choice—Mara must cannibalize a ballerina spring—and the heart itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory economy is tight; storm light sliding across felt anchors emotional stakes without tourist detail. Spatial choreography stays crisp as Mara’s fingers “small bridges over a chasm of contraptions.” Only the penitentiary exterior remains vague, but it never affects on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    The acid sea, saltglass towers, and iron spindle lace all constrain flight path and tool integrity; the bellframe’s “throat clamp” literally shapes the climax. Micro-setting objects (kettle that “smelled like pickled thunder,” kaleidoscope bolted to a gearcase) are handled, not catalogued. Sensory hierarchy skews tactile-chemical, matching a scrapper’s priorities. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from workshop to spindle summit. Environment, body, and tool all charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.7)
    Cold archive corridors and pocketed fabric patch locate action and metaphor; no grand world-build, but enough object/body choreography to let choices breathe. Patch overlay on rack-map supplies the micro-setting constraint that final image re-weights.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.1)
    “Lighthouse orchard,” “ice floes scraping like arguments,” and the velvet runner in the mirror-shop anchor every beat. The globe-as-tool and lantern beam function as micro-settings that constrain final action. Spatial choreography is flawless—bodies, crates, boots, floe edges track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.1)
    Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but instrument: floes nudge cleats, a split ice-shield sounds “violin’s mercy,” forcing retreat and saving the boy. Wind harmonics against masts tutor the narrator in listening, directly shaping the final decision. Parasol tip operates as micro-setting-on-body, constraining movement and ticking passage of time. Sensory hierarchy skews auditory/tactile, matching the lesson of “approaching endings.”

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment is not backdrop but tool: the vines’ need for struggle, the pavilion boards drinking wine, the gravel road that delivers and carries away—these constrain the sentinel’s philosophy and the traveler’s next step. Sensory hierarchy is biased toward taste and touch, suiting a vintner’s ontology. The burned letter edge functions as micro-setting that recharges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies never float. Weather is invoked as moral analogy (“storms become music”) yet stays plausible. Meets 9-gate: the pavilion and letter jointly charge the closing stance.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.0)
    The kinetic parapet is not backdrop; it breathes easier once the thread is stretched across it, so the environment literally modulates under the characters’ hands. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Lio reads the dunes “sideways,” the way a hawk reads thermals. Micro-setting (rope tension, canvas seams) constrains every move; remove it and the consecration fails.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lavender scent steadies heartbeat, rebar harp strings, smokestack as spine—every detail is sensory, selective, and filtered through the archivist’s curatorial eye. The factory ruins and lavender field act as micro-setting that literally supports the catwalk of memories; removal would collapse the spatial logic of the installation. Weather (storm, returning sun) is not backdrop but tension wire that forces extra clothespins and communal lean, charging the final wing image.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is micro-precision: chandelier crystal as tool-body, ledger as seedbed, ivy grammar on dust.

Final image recharges the “suspended hush” and is inseparable from the decision; environment is agent, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.3)
    Fog, chalk, recorder, and driftwood are not backdrop but tactical environment: the fog erases footprints as soon as they are made, the chalk is the only anchor against that erasure, the recorder drinks the fog like broth, the arrows are literally the path. Spatial choreography is immaculate—every statue, plinth, and amphitheater step is tracked as the prophet circles and re-circles. The setting’s oldest inhale becomes the final harbor, charging the closure image with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lunar dome, rail shivers, and floating governor are tactile and constrain tactics: the loose governor literally prevents capture.

Weather is not backdrop but the radiant haven that permits the flawless goodbye.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    The observatory’s dew, rails, and humming floorboards texture every beat; the key-as-axis literally steers the ritual, so environment constrains choice and charges the closing image of “noon that pools with lost silhouettes.”

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    The secret garden is not backdrop but actor: sap-constellations physically redirect the pair, root-stairs literally lift them into the changeling chamber, and the pear-tree moth stitching narrows perceptual focus to the found objects. Micro-setting (the narrator’s palm, the fox’s paw) doubles as surgical theatre where literal mending reweights metaphysical doubt. Final image—“I carried him up through the hinge”—makes the garden’s architecture the visible cost of re-entry, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    Serpentine grotto, tide-lantern threads, and salt-fog are filtered through watcher’s patient perception; micro-setting (pearl, glass shards) constrains every decision.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.3)
    The pendant, server ribs, and drip seams function as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice—where shade is hung, where spores are tucked, where the lens finally rests. Environmental logic is lived-in: condensation maps to obsolete data lanes, cooling fans become bee resonators. Spatial choreography is flawless across the single continuous scene. Setting evolves causally as moss thickens and steel continues to oxidize beneath the stitches.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.0)
    The paper-breathing archive, ink-wolves, and mist-choked vines are never decorative; they physically resist the narrator—pages clutch knees, mist thickens to a growl. The spiral seashell constrains tactical choice: pressed to the ear, it dictates where the story broke and where the river must be re-entered. Spatial choreography remains exact: entry → shallows → circle → shore again, each move tracked against liquid depth. Final image of the shell’s single ring is environment-as-tool, charging the hush with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.3)
    The arbor is not backdrop but instrument: dew-catchers, sap stir, and branch-spokes physically constrain how Lio strings the bells and how the villagers rotate the shadow wheel. Micro-setting (vine tendril as bow, copper coil as luthier wire) directly shapes the culminating knot. Sensory economy favors touch and sound over visual plenty, keeping the world rules consistent. The final image of steam rising “light by light” recharges every prior surface.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    The withered orchard is not backdrop but instrument: bark creaks, apples thud, frost forms on lashes—sounds become the metronome for pulse-mapping. Micro-setting migrates to the copper plate itself, its grooves a winter riverbed that dictates direction. Spatial choreography is exact: tripod of broom handles, ice blocks, paper roll—each placement alters what can be read. The final image of warmth printed onto bark satisfies the 9+ gate by charging the exit scene.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Marble cavern is not backdrop but instrument: its fossilized light and drip-intervals physically constrain how time is re-measured. The timer’s gear-train is literally cut to the cave’s echo-lengths; setting and tool merge into one micro-environment that dictates the final beat. Spatial choreography stays clean—angles are chalked, chime placed, echoes routed—no floating props.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    The kinetic lagoon/cloud-carousel engine rules are taught through motion-silence contrasts; the camera wheel acts as micro-setting that literally prongs the water, constraining how stories surface. Sensory hierarchy (sound of dust, shivering lilies) mirrors Mara’s narrowed crisis attention. Spatial choreography holds: pontoon, paddles, ghost-distance track cleanly. Environment charges the final image—carousel flexes in response to vow-payment—meeting 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is not backdrop but toolkit: corroded valves, cistern of rainwater and confetti, sputtering solar array—each is handled, rerouted, and repurposed. Spatial choreography is clean; panels → cable → pump → basin track without drift. The sextant shard functions as micro-setting that constrains the final beam-aiming choice, satisfying 9+ gate. Sensory palette is selective (bone-cold metal, lemon-tar tape) and filtered through engineer’s gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is the micro-environment of forecourt and bell; wet quartz, slate bench, and glass lip constrain how gently the protagonist must move. The crystal forecourt returns at the end as the receptive “page” that accepts the new hour, charging the closure image. Spatial anchors (archives, bench, drain) remain stable; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    The canal is not backdrop but archive: every piling, sluice gate, and crate constrains movement and memory. Micro-setting supremacy—sundial face, ledger scratches, padlock key—functions as topography the protagonist must physically navigate and morally read. Spatial choreography is immaculate: skiff, hatch, viaduct, balcony vectors track without drift. Weather is agentive: the breeze rises “as if witnesses exhaled,” charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Golden dock, snow, fog, hemp fibres, tar bead—each is tactile, specific, and filters through the collector’s instrumented perception. The fulgurite glass and rope jointly function as micro-setting that constrains the only possible “reading” method. Final image of wool-wrapped sprig is charged by prior salt/sand cues. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 30.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    The palace carpet weft thread functions as micro-setting: it constrains every projection, physically knotting the narrator’s finger and narratively knotting each new obituary into the map. Shadowed autumn garden supplies sensory hierarchy—bronze leaves scissor down, lanterns veiled by vines—mirroring internal state while guiding the choice to plant seeds instead of sail. Spatial choreography is immaculate: thread-string between rose canes, fig shading broken fountain, shoots curling around the thread—each shift tracked without impossible positions. Final image of thread-stitched city map charges the closing resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.1)
    The suspended palace is not backdrop but tool: its rocking constrains the prince’s decision to steady the cradle, and the final image of stalactites as “roots remembering the patience of earth” directly recharges the setting. Micro-objects—brass ribs, mica windows, pilot light—function as setting-extensions that channel choice. Spatial choreography is clean across bridge walk and grate entry. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV bias: oil-stained cuffs, piston sighs, lime dust felt as theological evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    Obsidian lagoon, volcanic sand, salt-streaked coin, and charred trunks are all specific, sensuous tools that constrain grafting technique and tune the final sonic image. Micro-setting (the scored bark cleft) functions as operating table and sound-box; environment is handled in lived, tactile ways. Weather is literal pressure—wind that the coin must find—so setting actively guides choice. No postcard catalogue; each detail is filtered through fire-trained attention to airflow and cambium life.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.1)
    City of motionless fountains is more than backdrop—it withholds water, coins, bird-nests, and memory-shadow, forcing the narrator’s choices (whispering, prying, thumb-press). Glass-shard breadcrumbs function as micro-setting that guides literal footsteps; heron statue shadow serves as the final lock-pin, so environment actively constrains tactics. Sensory economy is high—lilac-pepper wind, gummy pitch, mica dust—each image returns charged. Micro-setting beats macro-description, but the square’s spatial layout remains coherent across the pivot from panel to basin to sky, earning the high band.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade>
    <comment>Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories to restart the city—surfaces in paragraph 3 and escalates through each breadcrumb and dry-fountain failure. The single meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator must confess a never-spoken fear to unstick the panel; this micro-turn forecloses the option of remaining purely rational observer and prices the victory with intimate exposure. Under Accumulative lens, pressure intensifies by pattern completion rather than new obstacles; cost remains conceptual but legible. No luck saves the day—only the aligned heron star and the narrator’s thumb-press—so agency stays intact.</question>
    
    <question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade>
    <comment>Theme emerges as the cost of empirical vigilance: total skepticism freezes the world, while selective vulnerability—admitting love-derived fear—restarts it. The stained glass box literalizes the idea that memory is fragile, communal, and constellation-ordered; its release re-prices the city’s rule-set without moralizing. Subtext resides in gesture (father’s pump lesson) rather than thesis, and the final “defiant hush” chorus keeps ambiguity alive. Insight feels earned because it is tied to the narrator’s concrete renunciation of emotional armor.</question>
    
    <question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade>
    <comment>First-person voice owns a distinct perceptual signature: scientific diction (“test,” “valves like bones”) layered with glittering lyricism (“sunset blood,” “pepper and lilacs”). Syntax flexes from patient cumulative clauses to fragment bursts under pressure—“Shapes flew out, not birds, not paper, but laughters…”—without losing clarity. No dialogue, so voice coherence is judged solely on internal monologue, which passes. Filter verbs are minimal; when they appear (“I felt a small one press”) they serve tactility. The risk of poetic overwrite is flirted with but never breaks the narrative clock, earning near-top band.</question>
    
    <question>7</question>
    <grade>8.4</grade>
    <comment>Sentence rhythm modulates effectively; long breathy clauses mirror sidereal patience, then tighten into staccato releases at the un-sticking. Metaphors are dense but purposeful—each returns charged (mica lantern light reframes the glass box constellations). No mixed metaphors or paraphrase loops detected; information density is high. A few adjective-clusters (“gummy with pitch, edges stuck…”) could be trimmed, but they occur low-pressure and do not dull the final image, so the penalty is minor.</question>
    
    <question>8</question>
    <question>8.6</question>
    <comment>The memory-fountains nexus feels freshly synthesized: frozen city awaiting avian signal is imaginative, yet grounded by tactile detail (coins, nests, tar-shadow). “Stained glass box of constellations” objectifies collective memory without slipping into allegory; its maker’s fingerprints literalize the human trace. Risk is taken in the lyrical-accumulative structure, but it pays off when the heron-shadow key completes the pattern. Not quite 9+ because the core quest is a classic “find the magical MacGuffin to restart the world,” albeit lushly re-skinned; the thematic reweighting is what elevates it.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.0)
    The nebula garden’s vapor terraces and moth-whales are not backdrop; their very porosity demands the sonar workaround and enables tempered-light harvest, directly shaping the climax. Micro-setting—the twin gears—function as mobile “stars” whose re-orbited dust petals physically deliver the softened daylight. Sensory hierarchy filters through caretaker bias: what “petals remember” and how “shadows choose to sleep” determine transit paths. Final image of gears cradled in starlike moss charges the closing beat, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse’s fogged panes, iron ribs, and butterfly-laden roof constrain every move: the carver must work around living stalks, uses the misting drops as metronome, and lets the vines dictate ribbon paths. Tool-as-setting (chisels, ribbons) and body-in-motion ground each beat; the final image of slackened ribbons among ferns is charged by prior crossings. Sensory hierarchy favors damp breath and wing-beat over visual catalog. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.3)
    The tidal obsidian ridge is not backdrop but moral lens: it flashes like a cut, mirrors the bob’s knife-edge, and physically receives the rake at close. Micro-setting (the pendulum cavity, the brass cap, the salt-burned lungs) constrains every tactical move; tower stairs, town bell, and moonlit ridge form a single pressure chamber. Weather is not described but breathed—salt burns, tide recedes—guiding when the protagonist can act. Spatial choreography is flawless: boot-swallowing stairs, window-framed ridge, handle pressed to rib-cage—each object location tracked without drift.

    Obsidian spire, reed-shaped chamber, cracking lake—each detail is filtered through cartographer priorities and subtly guides the decision to model rather than decree. Micro-setting (the slate table’s brass orreries) doubles as tool and garden, charging the final image. Weather is causal, not decorative: lake-sigh softens Council resistance. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ember alcove, velvet-shawled radio, and phosphor-stained hands form a micro-setting that actively constrains every tactical choice: cloak or uncloak, ash or silence. Selective sensory hierarchy—sea-green arithmetic, salt of static—mirrors copyist attention. Spatial choreography holds as neighbors drift, boots pass, shutters lift. The ridge above the mill enters late yet charges the final tap with geographic specificity that forecloses escape.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    The vanishing-point gallery is evoked mostly through micro-setting—the rocking chair’s cadence, the brass bowl, the shifting texture of charcoal under fingertip—each object constraining the ritual and charging the final image. Air tastes of slate, the mask holds “tiny sunsets,” and these sensory shards accumulate rather than decorate. One hairline slip: the spatial relation between chair, bowl, and scatterer is slightly floaty; a half-sentence anchor would have nudged this to 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.0)
    Micro-setting triumph: the brass cog’s teeth, oyster-encrusted lathes, and lighthouse-star school act as embodied tools that constrain tactics—without them, no chronometer, no harbour proof. Silted safe and vinegar bath are tactile, POV-filtered, never tour-guide. Spatial choreography clean: vault door bowed inward keeps current vectors believable. Weather and tide are not backdrop but antagonist, dictating when dives, lessons, and final demonstration can occur.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    The velvet library’s dust, cold-to-warm shift, and zither-rosy light-pattern on the wall give tactile, changing environment; the micro-setting of the 12-petal rosette literally paces breathing and thus song. Seasonal rain and dusk timing open the window so the song can physically leave the room—setting directly enables the final outreach beat. While vivid, the exterior street only briefly flickers; a sharper spatial sketch of the hostile neighborhood earlier would have constrained stakes more tightly.

    Lightning tower, nectar dusk, and copper wind harp are specific, sensorily balanced, and filter through the keeper’s poetic perceptual signature. The lacquer box and matchbox function as micro-setting that constrains choice. Spatial choreography is immaculate. One minor overload: “nectar dusk” is repeated twice; still, the final image of sky writing cursive light recharges the motif.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    The quiet bay and the blue house’s micro-rooms function as a single, breathing setting that constrains every micro-choice (chair angle, drawer gap, latch compass). Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—salt air, porcelain tilt, rug weave—never touristic. Weather bottles and orris root return to charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is impeccable; no impossible positions or white-room gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    The garden-as-body is vivid and selective: “glassy ferns,” “bronze ivy,” “fallen rooms” all filter through a sculptor’s eye. Spatial choreography is impressionistic yet coherent; distances collapse lyrically but never contradict. The environment actively constrains—cracks are literal channels for thought—so the 9+ gate is met. Minor drift: a few adjectives (“moon freckles”) flirt with prettiness, but they’re brief and payoff in the final reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The staircase as recursive topology is evoked through repeated, self-similar risers and horizon lines; sensory selection stays tight to POV (copier toner, iron of missed chances). Spatial coherence is intentionally fluid—the steps can leak light—so the slight floating quality is thematic, not negligent; still, anchoring bodies or distances could sharpen threat.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    The smog-choked city is filtered through Anya’s lungs and fern breath; greenhouse glass refracts neon into exhausted fruit, constraining visibility and forcing tactile navigation. Terracotta pot, cracked pane, and rain barrel act as micro-settings that determine where glyphs can be written and thus who will enter. Spatial choreography is flawless: courier → violinist → nurse → boy, each arrival cued by a new written surface. Only the saffron quiet risks atmospheric sameness, but it modulates to mint steam and thyme coin, keeping the sense palette alive.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grotto’s limestone nibbles, dripping corridors, and sluice-door initials are never backdrop; they guide when and where the party can cross. The waterfall’s roar acts as ceiling, metronome, and eventual curtain—its pressure charging the final lens-reveal. Micro-setting (the opera lenses, bread as alphabet) doubles as terrain and tool, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hunger stone, brass cradle, cracked lens, and counterclock teeth are handled, weighed, traced—objects become micro-setting that constrain every mechanical reversal. Lighthouse shifts from outward beacon to inward lung, spatial choreography exact. Stone’s “mouth that never closed” reappears at closure, now fed by the narrator’s yearly regret, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Funhouse is evoked through rotten peppermint, mold-freckled mirrors, wet-pennies breath—details that constrain movement and camera-shy choices. The clasp’s “patient glow” and the booth’s pink flash function as micro-setting that charge the ending. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we track every placement of clasp, mirror, and strip. One minor over-crank: “revolting allure” is used twice in close proximity, a synonym loop that dulls sonic edge.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is the story’s engine: every plank, bottle, and branch is tuned, so the environment literally constrains tactics. Micro-setting (xylophone mallet, bottle throats) doubles as tool and terrain, charging both escalation and closure. Sensory hierarchy skews aural—perfect for a tale about resonance—avoiding tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible positions across the circular rim.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is not backdrop but navigational instrument: barnacled planks, shell ridges “blazing like a furrowed desert,” tidal genealogies etched on watcher-stone. Each tactile detail constrains footing, breath, whistle tone. The turtle’s living shell functions as micro-setting that reconfigures when the city tilts, directly shaping the protagonist’s balance and path. Final image of “sunwashed dread” reframed as cautionary map shows environment charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    The station clock swallowed in ivy and the oilskin bundles hauled into lamplight are tactile, choice-guiding objects; the whistle’s cracked note literalizes the call to witness. Spatial choreography is clean: platform → shaft → bench, bodies track without drift. Weather is kept implicit, narrowing focus to the tactile crunch of ivy and paper. The western stair as “mouth finally uncorked” recharges the setting with conceptual cost, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    The submerged pavilion is rendered through haptic, tidal, mineral details—“algae flutter like patient pennants”—that constrain access and timing. Micro-setting objects (brass inkwell, barnacled plaque) physically shape the note-placing tactic; their weight and corrosion dictate hand moves. Spatial choreography is flawless across scaffold, seam, and tide-line. Environment directly mirrors internal state—water as archival reader—charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    The drowned library is rendered through salt-furred spines, algae veins, domed avenues—selective, tactile, choice-guiding details. The brass stamp’s serrated crescent is micro-setting at its best: a grain-level flaw that decides authenticity. Spatial choreography is clean; the headlamp thread, shutter-battering drone, and chalk arrow all track. The environment’s damp silence literally enables the acoustic detection of forgery, so setting constrains tactics and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Floating tea garden, glass basilica, and lantern tools are concretely handled—steam poured into hull-cups, cranes threaded with kite-string—so setting constrains tactics. Selective sensory hierarchy (scent of rain on iron) mirrors emotional stakes. Spatial choreography stays intact across the spiral ascent. Environment charges the final image: vibrating panes = crystallized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    The floating observatory, salt flats, and geode crystal form a micro-setting triad that actively constrains every tactic: tilt calibration depends on deck flex; desert silence cues the pulse beat; geode placement stabilizes the readout. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—engineer’s ears catch circuit-cool clicks, survivor’s tongue tastes iron. Spatial choreography is clean across gimbal moves and cable tethers. One notch below 9 only because atmospheric prose occasionally decorative rather than choice-forcing.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cooling-stone smell, bronze-cord throat, and cracked comet mural are selective, POV-filtered, and directly guide the dome-opening act. Micro-setting (the chip as altar plate) constrains the final choice—no letter can be cast, only space. Spatial choreography is clean: drones ascend in spirals, pilgrim kneels, receiver cables tense. Weather is limited to dusk air and starlight, but that economy matches the beat’s urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Cobalt terrace boards, brined alphabet of driftwood, and the hair-in-crescent hollow are tactile, POV-filtered tools that constrain decoding choices.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Coastal launch, pylons, moonlit utility poles, and the brass compass form a tactile, POV-filtered micro-setting that actively steers every decision. The “feathery intertidal sand” underfoot at landing anchors the final image. Weather and tide are not just backdrop but dictate pace and route. Only nit: one “torn blue tarp” is named without texture or interaction, a rare generic instant.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bioluminescent lake is not backdrop but hydraulic conscience: its halos print fingerprints the narrator can’t scrub, its algae choir heats ribs, its vial constrains later urban tactics. Spatial choreography is clean—skiff-to-skiff mid-lake, eddies matching ball seams—bodies track without drift. Micro-setting (the baseball’s spin as compass) charges the exit map. One 9+ gate met: environment constrains tactical choice and charges the fountain finale.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    The orchard functions as micro-setting: its spice-laden breath is the sole vector for transformation, constraining the protagonist to barter with scent rather than spell. Spatial choreography stays clean—fox circles, ravens fold moon into wings, stag blossoms remain tracked. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (“cinnamon unspools a road animals trust”) and mirrors internal state without overt symbolism. The moon’s refusal to sunrise and the stone shaped by hooves are reused anchors that evolve into the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Glade, frost, pine-needles, and cloud-ravine are not postcard prettiness; they supply the literal reservoir选题 of minutes and the only path the narrator can walk. The brooch, saucer, and tablecloth function as micro-setting—each constrains the hand-tracing ritual that powers the closure. Sensory hierarchy mirrors breathless altitude: scent of pine-honey arrives as “warning and a prayer arguing inside the same throat.” No world-rule lapse; spatial choreography is clean across the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ship’s patchwork hull and sutured pipes physically constrain how the lock can be approached—no blast, only needle and thread. Micro-setting rule: the maintenance shaft becomes reachable only because joy lessens gravitational weight, turning ship geometry into tactical terrain. Kwan yin’s tear refracts starlight into coordinates, fusing sacred object and astrogation tool; its glassy fragility charges the final seam. Every described surface (museum glass, funerary scaffolds, waste-reclamation ring) is handled or pressed during the breach, so setting never sits inert.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.3)
    Black sand, metallic sighs, obsidian flats, and fumaroles are not backdrop but tactical terrain—access, proximity, and social context shape the rescue path. The volcano’s “orange breaths” and the moon’s “velvet hem” mirror internal pressure without overt symbolism. Micro-setting triumph: the cracked oar, the skiff’s old buoy, and the lanterned bug-trail literally wedge, nudge, and guide the extraction. Spatial choreography is airtight; bodies track from surf edge to sea-cave shelf to eddy exit with no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    “Luminous fort” and twilight blackout are immediate, sensory, and motive—mirrors, ramparts, and the half-painted sundial constrain patrol routes and smuggle angles. Micro-setting inside the cradle of sparks (ribs, gears, dust) tangibly shapes the bridging act. Environmental detail is filtered through metal-minded POV, never touristic. Final image of new shadows on the sundial recharges the setting as reclaimed commons.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tidal bluff, aurora, and salt-slick stones function as micro-setting that literally constrain footing and dictate pattern placement; the eel skins tied to feet tether body to terrain. Final image of the “path” hardening underfoot proves environment shaped tactics and charges the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    The observatory’s glass dome, chemical smell, and “old star charts peeled like weathered tattoos” are tactile, choice-guiding details; the catwalk height and upward-firing rain physically pressure the final reading. Body and tool function as micro-setting: the darkroom timer’s “mechanical heartbeat” and the “nicked face like a veteran” objectify Ilya’s own timed survival under censorship. Environment directly constrains the climax—no shelter from lightning while reciting—so the 9+ gate is met. Phrases such as “cloud seas” and “tin taste of beginnings” are compressed yet precise, never stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    Glass atrium light shatters across sundial stone, brook counts audible time, and ivy wall angles supply the decisive map—environment actively constrains calibration and choreography. The mechanical arm’s brass knuckles refract light onto half-painted numbers, fusing body-tool-setting into one sensory system.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Micro-setting (seed, bowl of saltwater, stone hollow) repeatedly constrains and enables the ritual action; the hollow literally accepts/rejects bodies, charging the climax. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-tilted (“silence that tastes of pandan”). Spatial choreography is clean—“circle around me, not touching”—with no impossible positions. Weather (monsoon) is causally synced to the rite, not decorative. No 9+ because the reef’s “distant knitting” click stretches physical credibility without prior rule cue.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    Micro-setting triumph: juniper, compass, and tidal pool function as handled geography that constrains every snip and apology. Weathered rock and rinsed air evolve with the beat; black-stone pool becomes final altar. Specificity anchors rather than decorates. Tool-states (open compass, indigo bowl) are tracked cleanly.

    The storm-damaged greenhouse functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice: bowed frames dictate pane replacement, silt-covered benches limit salvageable trays, and fractured glass channels ventilation tactics. Sensory detail is filtered through the researcher’s dual lens—scientific precision (“forensic meteorology”) and grief (“her pages... weighing each sheet with a stone”). The recurring dust maps evolve from forensic trace to teaching tool, charging the final image where children “steer by windows.” Deduct 0.1 for slight overreliance on visual texture at the expense of other senses in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.3)
    The canyon functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: its frost maps hidden routes, its silence shelters fugitive artists, its stones bear “drifting resonance.” Sensory detail is profession-filtered—glassmaker notices “pearled sand,” “fused sand and ash,” “thin white script” like annealed stress patterns. Final image charges setting: stars as “unlit kilns” reweights celestial vastness through craft lexicon. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography (canyon path → metal door → chamber → kiln) remains coherent and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.4)
    The winterglass conservatory isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and resource: frost blooms become staves, panes fret lace at smiles, glass bells channel sunlight. Recurring objects (tuning forks, ice-harps) charge the final image: the bell’s rim laced with forks, frost scoring warmth. Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis (tactile heat-mapping over sound) and calm (auroral light). Every detail serves the verb of music-making, avoiding white-room syndrome or generic winter clichés.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.4)
    Setting functions as both macro-environment and micro-tool: the underwater library’s coral-ribbed arches and silt-shelves directly enable the resolution, while the broken lens constrains choice by scattering signals until properly placed. Sensory detail is filtered through the undertaker’s trade—salt-stained rags, fingernails on coffin—and evolves causally (water shifts from “heavy” to “chased stillness”). The lighthouse stump’s final image charges closure by echoing the opening’s absence.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    The antique silver bell functions as micro-setting: its curve catches moonlight to signal movement, its “homesick” shiver embodies exile, and its mouth “swallows bottles” of donations, directly constraining tactics (only what fits is carried). The terra-cotta arbor isn’t backdrop—it’s where “earth… remembered our names,” making geography sacred and tactical. Sensory detail narrows under pressure (wind carrying “rumor of engines”), and the bell’s evolving role—from donation bowl to moonlit beacon—charges the final image. Every setting element serves the Accumulative lens without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.6)
    The twilight viaduct isn’t backdrop but active crucible: cracked mortar births “tiny trumpets,” fog collects in “longer stones,” and vines lean closer post-revelation. Crucially, the camera obscura box functions as micro-setting—its bellows stitched to ribs, its aperture opened by breath—constraining every choice. Kwan Yin’s tear physically alters optics (“soften like fruit left in shade”), charging the final image where droplets condense as “wildflower seeds.” Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: early fog gives way to tactile heat (glowing steel wool), then intimate breath sounds.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    The living bridge garden functions as a dynamic micro-setting that actively constrains choice: roots groan when time bends, bridges double crossings, and the willow chamber demands surrender. Sensory detail is purposeful—“ribbed and furred” bark, “black ripples” of bird calls—and filtered through the designer’s professional bias (noticing hyperbolic curves, sap, pulse). The setting charges the final image: cambium accepts the halo dust, and old rain hammers dry leaves, making environment inseparable from thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.4)
    The abandoned carnival prize center functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: syrup-solder-stale-ticket smells ground the surreal; the piano bench hides both memory and map; dangling keys become a cipher. Every object—from chain to seed tin—pressures choice. The final image (“We climb together”) is charged by the spatial choreography of descent/ascent and the tactile residue of baked coins, damp wheat, and fragile verbs cupped in palms.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.6)
    The sunken greenhouse functions as micro-setting: shipwrecks supply brass for mics, kelp whispers tin against scaffolds, aurora light tempers coils. Every object constrains or enables—cochlear organoids beside apple scions literalize the fusion of biology and tech.

    The emerald silo functions as micro-setting: its green light, watery heartbeat, and glass panes directly constrain action (breathing door, grounded comet capsule) and charge the ending (panes clear after healing). Sensory specificity—copper minutes, rye sugar-lit fields, graphite-smelling air—is filtered through the narrator’s tactile obsession. Environment never stalls momentum; even “dust along the sill” echoes the story’s decay-and-repair motif.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.4)
    The cobalt lagoon functions as a dynamic micro-setting: it supplies the feather, reflects sky/water ambiguity, offers reeds as both snare and mast, and its light acts as loom-shuttle. Every sensory detail serves pressure or choice—the “ash and silver” drizzle threads the narrative fabric, the “warm cup” stillness heightens anticipation, and the reeds’ applause validates the new song. Crucially, the setting constrains tactics (using the snagged reed as mast) and charges the final image (the glinting braid of patience, wind, laughter). No white-room syndrome; spatial relationships (poet in shallows, boy across path, kite in reeds) track cleanly through rising and falling action.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.4)
    The temple orchard isn’t backdrop but active crucible: living stone pillars constrain movement (“paths kinked into dead ends”), demand ritual (“copper wire wrapped around oak branches”), and yield only to patience. Tools and body function as micro-setting—the diary’s sap-iron scent, the forearm tremor from wire circuits—charging the final image where seeds ringed with weather-runes affirm reciprocity. Specificity never stalls momentum; every detail filters through the caretaker’s tactile reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.6)
    The rainwashed tower, museum gardens, and stone animals aren’t backdrop but active constraints: vines obscure paths, bronze sculptures anchor aromatic vertices, rain interacts with alien dust.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.3)
    The blooming jetty functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: it’s where pods are planted, birds decoded, veterans met. Coral dust becomes fertilizer; hibiscus fenders saint the wheels—environment actively shapes tactics. Sensory detail (pollen, guano ink, husk-breathed vows) is selective, urgent, and filtered through the coachman’s ritualized attention. The final image of wings and oars sharing pace charges the setting with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting functions as active crucible: scrapyard supplies phonograph, spindle, tin for transcription; rust conducts river sound; cranes become constellations. The “cracked wasteland” isn’t backdrop but pressure—dictating scarcity, shaping barter logic, and forcing innovation (doors as roofs). Final image charges setting: rusted cranes raise arms as chorus forms, transforming decay into communal instrument. Micro-setting (wax leaf, phonograph horn) constrains key choices and reweights closure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.6)
    The time dilation observation deck functions as both macro- and micro-setting, actively distorting perception (“hands moving twice”) and enabling the core action (sketching delayed starlight). The gilded compass rose and emergency strips are tactile anchors that charge the final image—warmth above the valley mirrors the applique’s earlier flash. Sensory detail is selective (aurora of grief, ink drag, machine heartbeat) and filtered through scientific yet poetic POV. Environment directly constrains choice: bedrock becomes true north only because the dome presses time like clay.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.3)
    The icebound spire functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: frost names intentions, false kings melt into stairs, gleaming traps demand piece-swaps.

    The cobalt lighthouse functions as micro-setting: its lens purifies intention, its brass hums under salt, its stairs wake to hummed notes—all constraining tactics (whispering into rails, using scent-laden cork). Weather (post–heat wave clarity) directly enables the story’s resolution by allowing meaning to travel unburned. Spatial choreography is precise: skiff at shoal, lee of the rock, hatch to dawn-lit stairs. The vial cork and garden scent charge the final image with irreplaceable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.4)
    The starlit signal station functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: the frozen dish demands bodily substitution, the tide wheel and censer foot become tools born of place and past. Sensory detail—ozone, rust, salt-burned voices—is filtered through the navigator’s trauma and profession, never ornamental. The drowned orchard, rib-cage pilings, and burnt-cloth stars all evolve causally from flood and forgetting. Environment directly shapes the climax: the dish’s arc is calibrated by moon, tide, and bronze.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.3)
    The hanging orchard in a storm-battered ravine is not backdrop but active constraint: iron lines staple trees to cliffs, brine slicks leaves, runoff hums during confessions, and truffle beds become burial sites for relics. The setting directly shapes tactics—the ravine offers psychological safety precisely because it’s battered yet rooted—and charges the final image (“cables after weather”). Sensory detail is selective and urgent (slick leaves, mica-flecked iris, warm oil), filtered through the forager’s professional attention. The glass eye functions as micro-setting, its stormgreen spiral echoing the ravine’s tempests.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    The opal dock, mist, and lighthouse aren’t backdrop—they’re active constraints. The dock’s erasure-like mist enables the “page ready for writing” metaphor that fuels Old Partial’s investigation.

Final image—scroll rattling like a tamed wild animal—charges closure by merging environment and object.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.4)
    The water clock functions as micro-setting: its occluded dome, stuttering drip, and lodged screw directly constrain action. Fog, condensation, and bone pin are tactile, not decorative—each alters perception or repair tactics. The shop’s atmosphere (“hush,” “long bench”) supports quiet revelation without stalling momentum. Final image (“condensation stripes the dome, a kind of rain script”) charges closure by merging environment, tool, and emotional legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.3)
    The floating rock platform isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint: chains clink only when tension eases, wind tilts the surface, height isolates. Tools (quill, bowl, sugar pebble) and body (forearm scars, wrist pulse) function as micro-settings that directly shape choices. Sensory hierarchy narrows under stress: during the failed first stroke, perception collapses to frost and breath; in recovery, taste (stormleaf), touch (earstone), and sound (taps) return. Final image is charged by setting: stormlight brushing everything as descent begins.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.4)
    The sheet music archive functions as a charged micro-setting: fluorescents hum like bees, shelves tremble as ladders, paper rind protects flesh.

    The infinite staircase functions as micro-setting and constraint—it dictates movement, supplies chalk for proofs, and embodies “boundless confinement.” The dice (chipped), chalk, bannister rupture, and sensory details (copier toner, rain) are purposefully selected and recur with evolving weight. Final image charges the setting: horizon repeats, yet now carries proof and texture. Every detail serves pressure or closure; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.1)
    The rooftop greenhouse functions as a charged micro-setting: vents invite footsteps, cracked panes carry painted tongues, terracotta warms Anya’s palm. Smog and neon smear the glass, contrasting the interior’s votive order. Every object—watering can, rain barrel, stairwell—is tactically used and altered by visitors. The moonlight isn’t backdrop but active agent, pooling “like milk” along bristles to spark daydreams that shape the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.6)
    The grotto city isn’t backdrop—it constrains and enables. Waterfall roar shapes sentence rhythm; damp corridors dictate candle use; the tiny theater’s spray limits performance to echoes. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: initials on bread match sluice markings, linking limestone, flour, and lineage. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—rosewater dread perfumes apothecary stores during crisis; children’s cold-blue hands ground awe in bodily reality. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography (drawer → sluice → trunk) tracks flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the lighthouse, hunger stone, yoyo, and tide actively constrain choices and charge the final image. The stone’s etched mouth, spidered glass, and cracked lens evolve meaningfully—from omen to conduit—and directly enable the climax. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., “tasted like iron,” “dry thunder moving”), never decorative. The rocky island isn’t backdrop but a sentient participant (“the island sighed”), shaping tactics through tidal rhythm and latent radiance.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.1)
    The abandoned carnival funhouse functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and enables choice—the mold-freckled mirrors multiply flaws, the photo booth responds to truth, the clasp’s luminance threads through silver. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered (“rotten peppermint coiled with damp sawdust”), avoiding white-room syndrome. The opera cloak clasp and body (photographically cursed skin) serve as setting extensions that charge the final image. Environment directly shapes tactics: bare truth tricks fear because the space rewards exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.6)
    The floating orchard isn’t backdrop but active constraint: roots woven through lashings, bottles tuned along the rim, trunks struck as instruments. Every detail serves the central conflict—“fractal generating” requires specific spatial relationships mapped on sailcloth. The blue hour’s liminal light charges the final image (“dusk between day and night”), and tools (mallet, bottles) directly enable tactics. No white-room syndrome; the setting breathes as a character.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.4)
    The turtle-shell city functions as micro-setting and macro-world simultaneously: barnacles pearl planks, ridges blaze like deserts, and bridges lean with sway—all constraining movement and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective (taste of copper, heatless cold of watchers) and filtered through the cartographer’s craft. Spatial choreography remains coherent across giants’ backs, and the environment directly enables the climax—stepping onto the elder turtle’s shell is both act and metaphor. The reed whistle’s sound alters the city’s physics, proving setting is active, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.3)
    Ivy functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (swallowing the clock, veiling witnesses) and charges closure (“living margin around a reopened page”). Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara’s historian POV: lapis margins mirror ivy, chisel marks align with serifs. Spatial choreography remains coherent—western stair, ticket booth, shaft—and evolves causally (ledgers hauled up alter the bench’s use). The station’s decay isn’t backdrop but active participant, enabling concealment and revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.4)
    The submerged pavilion functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: tides dictate timing, fissures channel breath, columns frame absences. Tools (inkwell, nail, tide-chart fibers) and body (stooping, prying, sealing) are woven into action, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and profession-filtered—silt, lime, brass tarnish—not tourist catalog. Algae, mortar, barnacles evolve causally with the protagonist’s interventions, never static.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.3)
    The sunken library functions as micro-setting: brine-ticked mosaics, salt-furred spines, and algae-lit fractures directly shape perception, method, and final action. The blackout isn’t backdrop—it enables the “listening grace” essential to discovery. Every sensory detail (soot-and-balm ink pad, serrated crescent) constrains choice or charges closure. The dome’s tide-flex breathes with the protagonist, merging environment and epistemology.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.6)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the glass basilica constrains choice (cranes require lift), the tea garden supplies resources (jasmine steadies hands), and opals become dream-cradles. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—steam raked from shrubs, rain-on-iron scent during humming—while spatial choreography (spiral path descending/ascending) charges the climax. Final image (“tea garden is my sea”) reweights the garden from refuge to vessel, fulfilling the 9+ gate via environment shaping tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.4)
    The floating observatory isn’t backdrop—it’s a crucible that constrains action (tethered by cables and guilt) and charges the final image (geode anchored beside viewport). The salt flats below mirror thematic acceptance, while tools like the interferometer and geode function as micro-settings that enable and limit perception. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and filtered through trauma—steam hoods shiver, decks hum like dragonflies—never decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.3)
    The observatory isn’t backdrop but active crucible: cooling stone, bronze cord, telescope slit, and altar plate all constrain or enable key actions. The “brilliant dimness” modulates with emotional pressure, and the type foundry chip functions as micro-setting—its physical state (gnawed, warm, shivering) directly shapes tactics and meaning. Final image (“tables” vs. “walls”) is charged by the observatory’s legacy of naming and listening. Every detail serves the central question without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.4)
    The cobalt terrace, sea-stained paper, and brined driftwood aren’t backdrop—they’re active constraints. The watch hand only fits its groove on the shore; the “sieved hush” of dunes mirrors his stifled conscience. Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis: touch dominates (cool boards, splintered planks), then sound (wind, surf), then sight (dimmed windows). The final image of dew-slicked terrace gains charge because it’s the same space now re-seen through earned truth.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.6)
    The parapet functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice—the neutral edge dictates where parties stop, the watch niche houses the chest, and the spiraled approaches choreograph ascent. The antique drawer pull (tool-as-setting) charges the final image when it “clicks like a small bell inside fog,” tying grandmother’s lessons to present duty. Sensory detail is purposefully narrowed under stress (cold metal, minnow-flickering light), and weather (mist, tide, gust) mirrors emotional states without overt symbolism. The bruised water “unresentful” crystallizes the setting’s thematic role.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the astronomical compass and utility poles constrain choices and charge closure. The coastal launch isn’t backdrop—it pressures decisions (tide as excuse, breakwater as threshold). Sensory detail is selective and urgent (“wind buttered the water,” “poles hummed like ribs”), filtered through a navigator’s bias. Final image ties environment to internal shift: walking home “by utility poles” reweights their meaning from disorientation to guidance.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.3)
    The bioluminescent lake functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: its algae respond to touch with judgmental halos, demand confession as payment, and generate the empathy-vial. Sensory detail is purposeful (“humming matrix of light algae,” “glassy black” water) and filtered through the protagonist’s guilt. The baseball’s seams matching eddies ties object to environment, charging the final image where ripples redraw maps. Every description serves pressure or closure—no white-room syndrome or static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.6)
    The fairy-tale orchard under permanent moonlight isn’t backdrop—it actively enables the ritual: petals listen, trees lean, stones bear hoof-marks, and spices summon beasts. The setting constrains choice (only here can the dead be conjured) and charges the final image: petals scatter as the couple flies, moon lowers “like counsel,” and fox tucks the fortune into root-earth. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—cinnamon roads, clove sparks, anise galaxies—all filtered through the whisperer’s grief-saturated perception. No white-room syndrome; every detail serves pressure or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    The midnight glade above clouds functions as micro-setting that pressures choice—it demands repentance, lifts a path “like a throat,” and supplies the reservoir of lost minutes. The dolls’ saucer and birthday cloth are tactile tools that constrain action: the crack must align, the hand must be traced. Sensory detail (pine honey, frost, chimes) is selective, urgent, and filtered through maternal exhaustion. Final image charges the setting: sky accepting footprints “like a mother” reweights the glade from omen to grace.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the ship’s patchwork hull, waste reclamation ring sutures, and observation dome glass constrain choices and charge the ending. Kwan Yin’s tear—cut from a drowned temple—transforms starlight into a star map, making environment instrumental to navigation. Spatial choreography remains coherent (maintenance shafts, humming plates), and tactile details (“bent suture needle,” “oxygen hood”) ground the surreal in lived-in specificity that shapes action.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.5)
    The black sand beach, fumaroles, and obsidian flats aren’t backdrop—they enable the shoal path, dictate the tide-dependent cave opening, and supply the metallic sighs that texture transformation. The recurring lightning bugs shift from “portable constellations” to tactical lanterns to “borrowed breath,” charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure (glowing jars, steam instructions), and the volcano’s mutter remains a live constraint throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.2)
    Setting operates as active constraint and thematic amplifier: the archive’s “iron eyelids,” the sundial’s half-painted rim, and the cradle’s “ribs and sleeping gears” all shape tactics and charge closure. Twilight’s transition to memory mirrors the shift from imposed order to organic light. Spatial choreography remains precise despite lyric density (“slipped through… let the dark blink me past”). The fort isn’t backdrop—it’s a character whose honesty is recalibrated by the revolution.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.6)
    Setting functions as active constraint: the tidal bluff supplies painted rocks; the aurora births star dust; frictionless physics demand mathematical persuasion. Every tactile detail—the driftbone bowl, eel skins on feet, salt-tasting primes—shapes tactics. The final image (“rocks shine their fragile logic”) charges closure by merging environment, tool, and belief. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: touch (cold stone), taste (salt numbers), sound (dust ringing like a bell).

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.3)
    The observatory functions as micro-setting: its dome, catwalk, and chemical-scented bench constrain movement and charge the climax. Weather isn’t backdrop—it “hisses,” “rattles,” “breathes,” directly shaping perception and timing. The darkroom timer and peeling star charts are tactile anchors that evolve from relics to instruments of resistance. Final image (“ink drying on sky”) fuses environment, body, and object into irreversible thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.4)
    Setting functions as active constraint: the glass atrium’s shattering light enables sundial calibration, the brook’s “honest” timekeeping counters artificial urgency, and ivy-scarred stone anchors the overture’s inscription. Micro-setting (mechanical arm, needle card) intertwines with environment—sunlight through perforations stitches rhythm to shadow. Final image (“follow the brook like a line of treble”) charges closure by merging geography with musical notation. Spatial choreography remains precise throughout the duel.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)
    The rusted library isn’t backdrop but active participant: its collapsed window demands prying, its scars host vines, its stacks “remember the weight of hands.” The coffee tin, moonlight, and broken bricks all constrain choice—the false bottom hides contraband, the lunar timetable dictates action, the condemned structure forces improvisation. Sensory detail is purposeful: “callused fingers finding syntax in rust,” “tea and stories” from neighbors, the “hush” that answers wind. The final image of green cursive on brick fulfills the setting’s promise to “breathe again,” making environment indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.6)
    Setting functions as active crucible: the station’s “compasses in its bones” and wobbling bench constrain early choices, while the tidal arbor—a surreal extension of the pianist’s grief—directly enables closure by materializing a space where time can be retuned. Sensory specificity abounds (“glass dome crazed with hairline rivers,” “surf laced itself into bowers”), filtered through the pianist’s musical perception. Crucially, the arbor’s salt-bleached bench is shaped to “my back and to her absence,” making environment inseparable from emotional stakes. The final return “through hidden sections… as if surf could learn to speak in cinders” ties setting mechanics to thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ancient ridge functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: the stone hollow “blooms with jacaranda shadows, perfumed and quietly mathematical,” and the seed must be planted precisely “where the island once decided to be real.” Tools (shells, saltwater bowl, chalk and pepper) are tactile extensions of the environment, and weather (monsoon) pressures timing. Final image—the ink-veined sapling—charges closure with environmental specificity that reweights all prior action.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    The islet functions as micro-setting: rain-rinsed stones constrain the compass ritual, wind shapes bonsai instructions, and the tidal pool’s black cup becomes a crucible for remembrance. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—early calm admits lace textures; climax narrows to blue light on needles. Final image charges closure: the juniper’s cerulean shift embodies the tutor’s internal reconfiguration, proving setting as active agent, not backdrop.
