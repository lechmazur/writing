  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse is vividly anchored with sensory particulars (shattered glass, mossy stone, watery sunlight) and pressures Elena's understanding through accumulated decay evidence. The butterfly on the path and its transferable wing-dust function as micro-setting that charges the final image when the dust is brushed onto moss. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The radio telescope's "pocked" surface in the final beat extends the decay motif and constrains her future work, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraint/charge.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    The canyon under stars, frost patterns, and father's furnace are vivid and anchored early. The frost constraining Kael's path (matching ledger numbers, guiding steps into the chamber) and the warm furnace enabling glass-shaping elevate this toward the 7-band, but the final act—melting the shard, shaping the vessel—lacks tactile specificity in how tool, temperature, or material properties constrain his choices. Sensory detail is present but leans visual; the "dew-kissed grass" and "soft amber" sky remain postcard description rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.1)
    The winterglass conservatory is anchored early with frost, heating-system crackle, and glass panes that serve as resonant surface for the tuning forks. The glass constrains Mara's method (she needs a medium) and charges the final image (frost patterns as canvas). Spatial choreography is minimal but clear. However, sensory detail tilts heavily visual (frost, heat-maps, colors); other senses are sparse, and the conservatory's layout—number of rooms, sight-lines among survivors—remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    The underwater library with its "impossible architecture of air pockets and pressure-bent shelves" and the central atrium where "water and air refused to separate" constrains the undertaker's choices and charges the final image. Materials (silver wire, pearl, blood) are gathered with purpose. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The library itself functions as both crucible and tool, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment/object constrain choice and shape closure—only minor descriptive excess in the middle ("rooms that existed simultaneously at thirty fathoms and sea level") prevents higher placement.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.4)
    The terra-cotta arbor is anchored early and hosts all action; the silver bell is handled across beats. The storm sequence briefly shows environment constraining movement. However, the ridge and arbor remain descriptive backdrops rather than pressuring choices—spatial choreography is clear but the setting does not force a tactical shift or charge the final image. Sensory selection defaults to visual moonlight and generic weather without POV-filtered urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    The viaduct, fog, blooms, and iron rails supply vivid sensory anchors filtered through Mira's lens as a camera obscura artist. The crystal tear's prism effect and the "corridor of light" constrain her perception, and the blooms "breathing with her" participate in the final image. However, no environmental detail forces a tactical choice or alters the outcome; setting functions as backdrop and metaphor rather than a crucible that shapes decision.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    The living bridge garden is vivid and specific: cedar arches, willow-bark pathways, hyperbolic corridors. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's designer eye. The garden constrains her final choice—she stands at the hyperbolic center, the bridges absorb her—so it participates in closure. Spatial choreography is coherent. The setting earns its role without resort to generic placeholder description.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.1)
    The carnival setting is vivid in opening lines ("rusted carousel horses," "stale popcorn and decay") but degrades into postcard description; the chained protagonist never uses spatial constraints or tools to solve problems in ways only this setting permits. The piano bench and arrow appear as generic puzzle pieces, not environment-specific resources. The micro-setting (body, chain, piano) charges the sentry encounter slightly, lifting the score above ornamental, but the final kneeling in "dry ground" outside offers no tactile resistance or consequence tied to the carnival's particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.9)
    The sunken greenhouse, black water, bioluminescent remnants, and corroded pipes create a vivid, pressure-laden environment. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: algae glow becomes chimes, copper whispers brass, water prunes hands. The forge and nutrient bath function as micro-setting elements that constrain action (ash collection, device immersion). Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. The shipwrecks "leaning closer, listening" in the penultimate image charges the ending without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.1)
    The emerald station is anchored early with vivid repeated motifs (copper sky, emerald tiles, moonlight), and the jar of moonbeams functions as a tactile micro-object handled across multiple beats. However, the setting remains postcard atmosphere rather than a constraint that alters choice—platform three's bench and hidden compartment are discovered without spatial friction, and the station's "breathing" tiles are metaphorical decoration. The flower arrangements seed the code but do not pressure Lux's tactics; she decodes them off-page between paragraphs. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through a lyric voice, but no environmental element blocks or redirects her at a key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    The control room functions as both setting and constraint: frozen gauge at forty-two percent, cracked observation windows, bird's-nest wiring, and the leak that drips onto Lena's chair all pressure Marek's ritual and charge the final acts. The portable kiln, glass pipe, and meltwater are handled tools that enable his craft. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "residual hum of stored current," "rhythmic pulses" of seeping water. The east-wall fracture that bleeds onto the chair becomes the literal anchor for the bowl placement, and the gauge's final flicker from forty-two to forty-three charges the exit image.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.4)
    The rusted library under a transparent dome offers vivid, recurring imagery—observation deck, corroded shelves, spiral staircase, starry void—that anchors spatial choreography and reflects Mira's isolation. The child's cast and seashell function as concrete tools that constrain her approach (decryption, rhythm-focus), elevating the micro-setting. However, the library itself does not pressure a key choice; it supplies atmosphere and props without forcing a tactical trade-off, keeping the setting functional but not indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.1)
    The storm-tossed ridge fort, pebble shore, and narrow stair provide coherent spatial anchors. Sensory detail is selective ("cold stone walls," "wind screamed a hollow note") and the map's "surface cool as a tombstone" constrains the traveler's final choice to carry it against his heart. The fort's marbled hush charges the final image sufficiently to reach mid-6s, though the setting never limits tactics during the journey.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.1)
    The frozen courtyard supplies vivid, selective detail (granite statues wrapped in frost, ice crystals forming glyphs, bruised purple sky) filtered through J-3's sensors. The transparent violin anchors as a recurring object that charges the final image (melting into a perfect circle). Spatial choreography is clear throughout the loops. The setting's transformation (pathways twist, statues turn heads) reflects the looped-timeline mechanic and heightens pressure, meeting the micro-setting constraint test. One gap: the "thin sheet of ice" and drifts are established but never constrain J-3's movement or sweeping task, remaining atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.4)
    The crystal forecourt is vividly rendered—"sheen that caught the light," "whispers of the crystals," droplets as prisms—and returns at closure to signal harmony restored. Spatial choreography is clean (forecourt, stage door, lobby, manager's office, back to forecourt). The lens as a recurring object constrains one choice (Elara uses it to reveal hidden doodles) and charges the final image as "a symbol of clarity." However, the setting does not materially narrow Elara's tactical options; it functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    The garden maze anchors space early and the cracked marbles function as micro-setting, constraining the reveal choice and charging the spiral arrangement. Sensory detail ("pale sun filtering through tall hedges," fireflies mirroring marble glint) is purposeful and filtered through Silas's familiarity. However, the maze's physical layout remains vague—no spatial choreography or tactical use of paths—and the luck gauge and soil additive remain ornamental world rules that never pressure a beat.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Station details (frosted copper valves, observation dome, sensor arrays) ground action and reflect Kael's mechanic expertise. Kepler-442b's twilight and the Aurelians' crystalline wings create vivid, purposeful atmosphere. The holographic projector constrains her approach and the magnetic nexus charges the closure image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: tactile warmth of her hands, visual grids, auditory whispers below thought. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.1)
    The flooded pit, lanterns, and waterlogged program supply vivid, purposeful detail that constrains Mara's movements and charges the atmosphere. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (shin-deep water, submerged stands, half-collapsed balcony). The antique program functions as micro-setting, returning with reweighted meaning when it dissolves at closure. Sensory selection (water lapping, lanterns flickering, cello neck cold) reflects the contemplative urgency. The environment directly shapes the final choice: water patterns and lantern flares respond to her playing, making the space an active participant in the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.2)
    The mountain weather station and instruments provide atmospheric grounding, and the aurora functions as a recurring visual motif. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it remains postcard description. The scale used to weigh the botanical illustration is the closest micro-setting moment, but the needle's wavering is metaphorical rather than tactical, preventing entry to the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.1)
    The abandoned train tunnel and rusted rails anchor locale early; "damp concrete breath," "phantom looms," "spectral cotton dust" are vivid and voice-consistent. The valve wheel constrains the climactic choice (twist to release), satisfying the micro-setting gate for 9+. Spatial choreography (junction, sub-basement door) is coherent. No major setting errors, but the ghost-shift looms could have been more tactilely grounded in how Elias moves among them.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.1)
    Vivid sensory fragments (moss-covered spines, obsidian refuge, ink pool, river murmur) anchor mood and recur across beats. The swan functions as micro-setting, constraining the tunnel passage in one beat. However, spatial choreography between library, catacombs, and refuge remains abstract; no environmental detail pressures a choice at closure. Meets the minimum bar for coherent setting but does not charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sage Ridge hospice is anchored with sensory detail (cedar-scented halls, lavender quilt, amber twilight) and the eclipse transforms the room's light, charging the final image. The keepsake curl and guitar case are handled across beats. Micro-setting (the room, the bedside chair) constrains Mira's proximity and enables the shared moment. Spatial choreography is clear and the environment subtly mirrors the internal states (eclipse darkening = veil thinning).

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    The reclaimed silo library is vividly anchored with "bronze cylinder of rusted metal," "seventh level," "thick with dust and the metallic scent of old rain," and "ancient ventilation." The sealed fireplace discovery provides spatial constraint, and the tapestry fragment returns at key beats. The setting shapes Elias's work environment and the final act of placing diaries "where the walls were thickest" integrates architecture into closure. Micro-setting (the fireplace, the bronze quiet) charges the ending image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lighthouse and its Fresnel lens function as both setting and constraint: the lamp's turning beam becomes the metaphor and literal mechanism for "directing flow," and the specs only reveal their secrets when held to the lamp. The keeper's quarters, dock, bilge, and ferry are spatially coherent and used across multiple beats. Micro-setting shines: the industrial mixer, beer coasters with microdots, and the leather case behind the loose stone all pressure Mei Lin's tactical choices and charge the final image of the shell-as-map.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bell tower and loop pedal constrain Miriam's method (she layers silence *in this space*), and the dimensional anchor monastery charges the ending by holding "between breaths." The indigo palette recurs with shifting meaning (limitation → focus → doubt's shadow), and the pedal's mechanics shape the exorcism tactics. Micro-setting qualifies: the tower's confined space and the pedal as tool both drive choices and charge the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.1)
    The glass spire and frozen lake provide vivid, recurring anchors (mirrored horizon, groaning ice), and the nautilus shell is handled physically across multiple beats. Spatial choreography remains coherent (desk, balcony, return to desk). However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental detail constrains a choice or alters tactics. The "mirrored horizon" appears often but never pressures the protagonist's options, keeping the setting in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glowing viaduct supplies vivid anchor and recurs across beats, but it never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it remains scenic backdrop. The phosphorescent moss, rain, and crimson glow are consistent and sensory, yet the protagonist floats above consequence without spatial friction. Micro-setting exception: the tablet warms and cracks, but these states do not force a tactical shift. Falls short of the 9+ gate (environment must constrain choice or charge final image) and lacks integration with the dominant conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.7)
    The cavern is anchored early with cold stone air, damp walls, and the phonograph in the darkest corner. The drum and needle function as micro-setting objects that constrain the ritual, and the needle is later embedded in the drum skin, charging the closure. Sensory selection favors sound-adjacent detail (vibration, shimmer, air shiver) filtered through Elara's deafness. However, spatial choreography remains generic; we do not track how she moves through the cavern or how proximity to objects alters her choices during the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    The courtyard functions as micro-setting that enables the pigeon exchange: "forgotten pocket," fig tree, stone benches create a sanctuary that contrasts the rooftop chase and charges the final image of solitude. Sensory detail is selective (slick tiles, evening dew, rustling leaves, faint scent of paper) and filtered through Elias's priorities. The rooftops constrain his escape route, and the courtyard's stillness allows the decision beat. The recurring storm motif (opening notebooks, closing rain) brackets the piece and reweights at closure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout; the environment meaningfully shapes both tactics and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.1)
    The terra-cotta grotto and starlight anchor setting early, but details remain postcard-static—"walls seemed to breathe," "sediment band a page in a book"—without constraining a choice or charging the closure. The rope is handled minimally (coiled, trailed) and its frayed state is described rather than used tactically. Spatial choreography is clear, but the environment never presses the protagonist or supplies resources that alter outcome, keeping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.1)
    The sunken greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is vividly named and returns across beats, but it remains postcard description—no spatial constraint alters a choice. The driftwood is collected without friction, the fire simply "catches," and the shattered glass functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a tactile problem. The mendicant's bowl sits near the fire but does not shape action. Sensory detail is present but ornamental, not purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    The amber grotto is vividly rendered through honeyed light, resinous scent, stone texture, and the water-drip clock. Dusk timing and the pulsing walls create atmospheric pressure. The blotter petal and static electricity function as micro-setting elements that constrain the dealer's method and charge the final tactile moment. Spatial choreography (stone bench, exit, grove beyond) tracks cleanly. The setting charges the closure image (amber fading, night claiming warmth) and the static on skin acts as a recurring sensory anchor, meeting the 9+ gate of environment constraining choice and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.1)
    The library setting is vivid in early description ("glass-and-iron building," "scent of old paper," "breeze") and recurs at the ceremony, but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The locket is handled twice (discovery, presentation) yet its physical properties do not alter tactics. The harbor context remains generic; no tool, environmental pressure, or spatial detail narrows Lena's options at a key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.1)
    The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (humming frequencies, refracted light points, glass branches absorbing light). The arbor constrains Kael's understanding—its shadows are a map he cannot read—and the tag's location "where branch met earth" matters spatially. Marsh and crater rim supply recurring micro-settings that filter Kael's isolation. The crater's "shimmer" and solstice light pulse charge the discovery beat, meeting the 9+ gate of environment shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rooftop canal system, moss growing during exhalations, phosphorescent algae, and the belfry with vines of reverberation provide vivid, purposeful detail. Spatial choreography is coherent—Elara runs across towers, reaches the highest spire, the folio is left behind. The giant's body as macro-setting and the infinity pendant as micro-object both constrain the final choice: she must act during the Gasp, and the pendant's borrowed time limits her window. Environment directly shapes the climax, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.9)
    The cavern orchard is vivid and purposeful: stalactites drip to nourish obsidian-and-pearl trees, the mosaic stepping stone provides a tactile surface for Vesper's ritual, and the cool stone against her knees grounds her physically. The setting constrains her method (she must work within the mosaic's chipped patterns) and the final image—mosaic under moon, eyes watching—charges closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Vesper's focus (moonlight as "liquid silver," stone warmth echoing her heartbeat). The orchard's silence and the dripping water create atmospheric pressure that supports the tone. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    The library's infrastructure—pipe chases, vertical chases, crawl spaces, wire conduits—constrains Mara's movements and defines her world in tactile, specific terms. The "sapphire-hush moments between darkness and true morning" and the flickering lights create temporal pressure and sensory specificity. The children's annex seventh shelf and loose baseboard become micro-settings that enable the boy's discovery. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout (Mara descends the vertical chase, resurfaces, watches from a vent). The environment charges the final image: "Below the floors, in the dark arteries of the library, her methodical heart kept time with his words."

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mossy trellis constrains Elena's repair attempts (vines resist, wood won't hold) and returns charged in the final image. Rain functions as both atmosphere and pressure (forces her outside, soaks her in the climactic moment). Sensory detail (damp earth, cool leaf surface, drip rhythm) is selective and voice-filtered. The nursery setting enables the central conflict and supplies the recurring objects (leaf, trellis, vines) that drive beats.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tidal island supplies recurring sensory details (salt-scarred stone, wet sand, rain trails, sodden earth) that anchor the painter's movements and prime the brooch discovery. The watchtower ruin and the studio hut provide spatial grounding for the exchange and closure. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains atmospheric rather than causal. The amber brooch and canvas function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image, lifting the score into the 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.4)
    The crystal-cave setting is vivid and sensory-specific (luminescent crystals, silver-violet hues, chiming pillars). The pearl appears in multiple beats and its surface changes (glowing, pulsing, rippling) in response to unseen forces, constraining Lira's final choice. Spatial choreography remains clear (cavern, walls, path). The micro-setting (pearl as conduit) charges the ending image, meeting the 9+ gate material, but the cave itself does not constrain a middle choice beyond atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.2)
    Ivory Harbor after rain supplies vivid images (stones "gleamed like blank pages," "bottles of captured spray lined the walls like bottled starlight"), yet spatial choreography remains vague—archive location, harbor layout, and navigator's path never cohere. The setting does charge the final image (wet stones to "true ivory" under sun, spray writing on her skin) and the valve's case with "salt-crusted velvet" grounds the archivist's work. Sensory detail skews visual; brine and old paper scent opens strong but other senses drop away. Micro-setting allowance applies (bottles, valve, stones), lifting the score slightly, but the piece never uses environment to constrain a choice—rain clears the sky, stones gleam, yet tactics remain unaffected.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered throughout: "mist thickened until it became a vault," "air tasted of ozone and old iron," phosphorescent cracks as glyphs. The phantom ticket punch constrains the central choice—she must use it to open the door—and the rusted service door's hinges "crying out in a language of forgotten arrivals" charges the threshold moment. Spatial choreography remains clear (apartment → old quarter → alleys → condemned station → fortress interior), and the setting evolves causally with each step following the luminous arrows.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.1)
    The open tower is anchored early and the whale migration timeframe is signaled, but setting functions mostly as backdrop—spatial details (telescope, floorboard, stone walls) do not constrain choices or supply resources under pressure. The murals and magic square tile receive vivid description yet remain static objects rather than tools that alter tactics. Micro-setting opportunity (the tile's pulse, the tower's acoustics) is mentioned but not leveraged to shape a beat or charge the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prismatic escondite is vividly rendered with specific sensory detail ("stone weep liquid rainbows," "infinite refractions") and constrains Althea's action by trapping her awareness. The amulet fragment's physical presence (obsidian, pulsing, growing hot) shapes the peak choice when she presses it against the central crystal. Spatial choreography is coherent within the single chamber. Setting charges the final image through the escondite's fracture along "impossible geometries," each shard revealing different post-goodbye landscapes.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prep room functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the embalming machine's wheeze marks time, the steel counter stages the ink pot discovery, and the chemical atmosphere charges the final metaphor. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"chemical persistence of memory" ties environment to theme. The funeral home's dual function (death commerce and refugee smuggling) creates spatial pressure that makes Sam's choice legible. Minor gap: the director's office geography is sketched quickly without the tactile specificity of the prep room.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.1)
    The bonsai labyrinth, fluorescent lamp, and mossy stone supply vivid particulars and sensory anchors (hum, dew, gold leaf scattering light). The lamp's hum and the bonsai's responsiveness shape her ritual across multiple beats. However, these elements do not constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure—they remain atmospheric backdrops rather than forces that test or transform her. Micro-setting (lamp, notepad, stone) is present but does not charge the final image with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Grid's spatial logic (containers stacked twenty high, vent holes, salt-stained concrete) remains coherent and constrains the survivor's collection method. Tidal rhythm functions as micro-setting, shaping when fragments appear (lowest tide, high tide) and charging the final image when water "licks the edges" of the box. Sensory selection is purposeful: salt on skin, corrugated metal, "wet hours." The poison bottle wedged between Container B-7734 supplies both a concrete object and a spatial anchor that drives the recognition beat. The box's refusal to float depends on the tide's physical presence, fulfilling the 9+ gate (environment charges the final image).

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    The observatory with its rusted dome and obsolete star charts supplies vivid anchor images, and the cliff setting creates spatial coherence. The painted seashell and half-finished cello function as micro-setting elements that recur across beats, though their physical properties (the shell's warmth, the cello's hum) don't constrain Elias's choices in a legible way. Sensory detail is selective and atmospherically consistent, but the environment never pressures a decision—Elias could conduct his meditation anywhere without altering the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    The floating carnival setting is vivid and specific (blackwater, raft city, strobing Ferris wheel). The foundation stone chip constrains Mira's choices as a tactile anchor and charges the final image when she slips it back into her pocket. Spatial choreography across the raft city remains coherent. Sensory detail is purposeful but leans visual; the turpentine-and-hope moment stands out as embodied specificity that shapes a beat.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.1)
    The moonlit summit, regolith crunch, and crystalline bloom are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (violet petals refracting light, the faint tremor underfoot). The camera tripod and hourglass function as micro-setting that enables the flare action, and the bloom's placement "in the shadow of eternal night" constrains the inspector's window. Spatial choreography is clear, and the setting participates in the closure image (sunlight erasing the bloom).

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.1)
    The water features—mercury basin, glass sphere, prism, flowing test chamber—constrain and enable Miren's diagnostic method throughout, shaping the repair sequence and the teaching moment at closure. The mist-coated depot supplies atmospheric pressure and the *Prospect*'s horn marks time. Micro-setting (the workbench array) functions as tactical ground. Spatial choreography is coherent across all moves.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and ice provide vivid micro-setting that charges multiple beats: Kael traces condensation on glass (a method), walks onto ice (a spatial constraint), kneels and feels currents beneath. The phrasebook's physical warmth against his chest and the feather's placement on the map integrate setting details into action. The final image—ice cracking, water weeping—uses environment to charge closure. However, the ice itself does not meaningfully constrain Kael's choice to step onto it ("subtly confident that the ice would hold"); the environment enables rather than pressures, which limits the band.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ancient archway functions as both spatial anchor and constraint: its geometry amplifies sound, and Kael must stand beneath it to strike the fork and reset the town's frequency. The ebony tuning fork is handled twice (carved from the belltower, then struck against his palm) and its subsonic wave drives the ending. The cobblestones are tactile and specific—they remember original arrangements and shift millimeter by millimeter in response to footfalls. The "wild hush" recurs and charges the final image when death-hum transforms into the hush of possibility, giving the setting a felt presence that shapes the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    The underwater temple's "pulsating wall," "central conduit," and "corridors [that] realigned with geometric clarity" provide vivid spatial anchors that constrain Lira's path and charge the final choice. The quantum core as "fragile star trapped in a cage of frozen time" integrates setting with stakes. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("cold and absolute"). The temple's architecture functions as micro-setting that enables the unsnarling and thus reaches the 9+ gate, but some descriptions ("snarled in dimensions that defied mapping") lean abstract without concrete spatial consequence mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lighthouse prison, reef, and lattice are described vividly but remain static postcards; no environmental feature constrains a choice or alters tactics. The "narrow door left ajar for decades" and its scuffs briefly gain function when he traces a pattern and presses the lattice, but the mechanics are asserted rather than shown to limit or enable. Spatial choreography is unstable: spiral corridor → chapel → door → spiral staircase → chamber with no consistent anchoring of distance or adjacency. Sensory hierarchy is generic (copper glow, cold air, hush) without POV-specific filtering. The lighthouse beam "swept the reef" in the final third, but this detail does not interact with the protagonist's actions or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.7)
    The greenhouse is vividly sketched (frosted panes, twisted vines, ancient gnarled tree) and the bead's placement at the root is spatially clear. The "endless night" and "winter-cracked fields" frame mood but do not constrain a tactical choice. The bead as micro-setting object charges the final image (luminescent tendrils sprout, bead fuses to root), satisfying the 9+ gate partially. However, the setting does not pressure Elara's decision—she moves from observation to compliance without environmental friction.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.1)
    The red canyon labyrinth is named early and recurs, yet functions as backdrop rather than tactical constraint—Elara's path through it is narrated in summary ("following the silver thread") without spatial choices or obstacles that test her. The orchid alcove appears late and resolves the village's problem without prior setup, reading as coincidence rather than environment shaping outcome. Micro-setting allowance (the loom, the tapestry) is present but not leveraged to constrain a choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly anchored—gnarled roots snake between ribcages, moss and memory, dappled sunlight on bone—and the environment shapes Lina's choices: roots guide her to fragments, the sundial's placement honors the bones below. The orchard functions as a living archive, not mere backdrop, and the final image (shadows lengthening, light moving with deliberate slowness) charges the closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Lina's reverence and hope. High-band entry achieved because setting constraints and charges the final image; the sundial as tool and the bones as micro-setting qualify under the expanded allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.1)
    The golden arcade at dawn is vividly rendered (dormant holograms, frayed awnings, weathered flagstones) and establishes futuristic nostalgia with economy. The setting constrains Kael's window (thirty minutes before the carrier departs) and provides the physical stage—pavement for chalk, rafters for the pigeon—that enables the method. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("sepia tones," "cool morning air," "worn smooth by generations"). The ebony clipboard and chalk stubs function as micro-setting elements that charge the final beat when Kael pockets them. However, the arcade's spatial choreography remains static; no environmental shift or obstacle alters Kael's approach, and the holograms flickering to life at the end are atmospheric rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.7)
    The cobalt observatory and eternal candle are vividly rendered and recur throughout, establishing a coherent atmosphere. The flame functions as both sensory anchor and symbolic constraint (its flicker signals narrowing possibilities). However, the setting mostly serves as backdrop; spatial details (stone floor, iron stand, corridors) do not materially constrain Mira's choices or tactics. The autumn leaves scraping the floor and the observatory absorbing light are atmospheric but do not directly shape the final decision or image.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mangrove labyrinth, shard, and condensation on glass are vivid and purposeful. The swamp "breathed in time with the moon" and the gnarled root perch are specific anchors. The shard constrains the ritual (placed on bark, traced with a pattern) and charges the final image as a pocket-weight reminder. Sensory detail is balanced (scent of salt and sorrow, voices like wind chimes of broken glass) and filtered through grief. Spatial choreography is clean across the boat, root, and water.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mist-clad atrium and brain coral texture charge the final image by mirroring neural/emotional labyrinths. Spatial choreography clean (gurney, chrome railing, cast). Sensory hierarchy filtered through anesthetic drift serves POV well. The atrium functions as micro-setting that constrains perception (twilight condensation = fading clarity). Minor: banyan tree silhouette and Honiara village references approach postcard in one beat but remain anchored to translation backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.7)
    The orchard district (fog, skeletal apple trees, lichen glow) is vividly rendered and constrains Lyra's search; the fresco fragment functions as a discovery object that charges her re-creation. The light-painting tools and portable screen are handled on the page and enable the climactic display. However, spatial choreography during the display setup is vague (how she "erected" the screen, where spectators stood relative to the mural), and the fog's convenient thinning at the climax reads as symbolic rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.6)
    The sound wave garden is vividly described (steel sculptures, wind-to-melody mechanism) and the hobo nickel is handled across multiple beats. However, the garden's acoustic properties do not constrain a choice or alter Elena's tactics; she places the chime and angles the nickel without friction. The nickel reappears on the pedestal at the end but does not charge the final image with cost. Micro-setting potential is present but not leveraged for pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.1)
    The greenhouse is vivid and functional: orchids, terrariums, jewel-toned beetles, milkweed clusters, mangrove roots. Sensory detail is purposeful (humid air, ribbed seed surface, bee cloud). The environment constrains the auditors' detectors and enables the resistance's tactics. Spatial choreography is clean (Aris kneels, Chen releases bees, auditors scan). The gourd seed and mangrove roots charge the final image by embodying the resistance's future spread.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.8)
    The gargantuan shell is vivid and anchors the setting early, but it functions mainly as backdrop rather than constraining choice. The galaxy postcard and pearl of verse ensconce micro-setting objects that charge the final beat slightly. Sensory detail ("phosphorescence," "kelp in a calm tide") is selective and POV-filtered. The setting does not alter tactics or impose resource limits during key turns, capping higher-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.1)
    The opal library and glass orchids supply vivid textures but function as postcard backdrops rather than constraints that shape Lyra's choices. The cracked bamboo tube is handled in multiple beats and its fracture is thematically charged, lifting the score slightly. However, spatial choreography remains vague (where Lyra stands, how she moves between galleries), and no environmental detail alters tactics or charges the final image beyond label-level mood.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    The extinct language archive and pneumatic tube system provide vivid anchors, and the glass ink well is handled across multiple beats. However, spatial choreography is vague (how far apart are the offices? what does the central chamber contain?). The quicksilver ink with "trapped starlight" reads as ornamental fantasy rather than a constraint that shapes choice. Sensory detail is mostly visual; the archive never pressures a tactic or alters the plan.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.1)
    The amphitheater and volcanic setting are vivid and purposeful: "scarred by ancient fires," "sulfurous sigh," groaning stones. The surveyor's chain and envelope anchor tactile detail that drives discovery. Spatial choreography (valve, flagstone, basalt blocks, council arch) remains clear. The mountain's breath functions as micro-setting, constraining action and charging the final image when "the mountain breathed again, a low rumble…affirming the new harmony."

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.1)
    The attic—skylight, beam, dust—constrains Elias's physical stance and charges the recurring dust-map motif. Sensory hierarchy (old paper, rain, creaking boards) reflects his retrospective focus. The meteorite chip's warmth and the ledger's tactile presence anchor micro-setting effectively. The bookshop below remains postcard gesture, but the beam as tightrope and the skylight as window satisfy the micro-setting standard and link to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.8)
    The drifting prism terrace and wooden grain offer vivid, recurring images that anchor the voice. However, spatial choreography remains abstract—thresholds "emerge" and dissolve without clear geography or physical constraint. The grain map and pilot logbook return across beats, charging the final image with some resonance, but they never block or enable a tactical choice. Sensory detail is selective and voice-consistent, lifting the score into functional range despite the lack of micro-setting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    The underwater facility is vividly rendered with specific sensory detail: "ozone and ancient seawater," "coral reefs of brass and glass," "drowned courtyard open to the abyss." The burnt feather as a recurring object constrains her investigation and charges the final image when she releases it. Spatial choreography is clear through the descent, and the pressure at 3000 feet below the Pacific registers as a persistent constraint. The bioluminescent bacteria and the facility's decaying instruments contribute texture that supports the theme of belonging through dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.1)
    The iridescent cave, crystal geode, and crater glass constrain Lira's search and charge the final image when she places the glass in the tide pool. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "glittering throat," "shimmered with a thousand hues," "jagged edges hum." The micro-setting (tide pool) becomes the stage for closure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the descent and assembly. The setting earns its keep by shaping the search and reweighting the glass at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal arcade is vividly anchored with salt-worn railing, black water, bioluminescent plankton, and the creaking dance with the moon. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Ezra's analytical lens. The bishop as micro-object constrains his method across beats and the starlight glint at 9:47 enables a turn, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment/object constrains choice. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout multiple vantage points.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.1)
    The garden is named and evoked repeatedly but never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. Spatial choreography is unclear—silvered leaves, dew-laden petals, and star-iron exist as atmospheric tokens without affecting Lyra's movements or tactics. The moonstone dust is handled twice (reach, grind) but the garden itself remains a postcard backdrop. No environmental pressure forces the tattooing decision or the final departure. (Capped at 7.0 per Q2 orientation debt.)

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.1)
    Pearl Bay, the lighthouse prism atrium, and the hidden pond are named and revisited with purposeful detail. The pond functions as micro-setting—the glazier kneels, tosses a stone, reads the rings—and the prism atrium returns in the final third "bathed in golden light," reweighting the opening image. Sensory selection is present (iridescent water, spectral shards, reeds) and filtered through the glazier's professional lens. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains backdrop for contemplation, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.1)
    Moonlit ridge, porcelain box fractures catching light, and fire-scarred hands anchor the scene with vivid sensory detail. The box's willow patterns and cracked glaze recur purposefully, and scars function as micro-setting (tissue thin as rice paper, each a letter). However, spatial choreography between ridge, stone circle, and station blurs; the environment observes rather than constrains. Celestial bodies (Jupiter, Saturn) are noted but do not pressure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.9)
    The tide-polished grotto anchors the piece with vivid particulars (bioluminescent anemones, quartz veins, urchin shells, sea glass) and the setting supplies materials for Kael's decorative patterns, directly enabling her method. The grotto's tidal rhythm and "ancient limestone dust" subtly mirror the thematic work of renewal. Spatial choreography is clear (she sits against the wall, arranges objects on the floor, launches balloons from the grotto's mouth), and the midnight tide rearranges her patterns, feeding forward into the next cycle. The setting constrains and charges the final image, though it remains more atmospheric scaffold than tactical pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ivy-veiled passage and frost-vine hybrids anchor the post-climate setting with vivid sensory detail. The fireplace's surrender of diaries and the milky sun through cracked ceiling provide tactile, purposeful images. However, the passage functions primarily as backdrop; no on-page moment shows Mira navigating a physical constraint (blocked corridor, unstable floor) that alters her approach or charges the final image. Spatial choreography is stable but minimal—most action involves static handling of objects rather than movement through the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prism parapet and echoing terrace are vivid and purposeful, constraining the painter's brief window and charging the final image with its glistening witness. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through a lyric voice, with rain, light, and stone interacting across beats. Spatial choreography is coherent. The environment shapes the painter's choice to work before the bells, pushing the piece above mid-band; the micro-setting (parapet, mirrors, terrace) functions as active constraint and closure anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ancient terrace and its ceremonial circle are established early and return at closure, grounding the ritual's spatial logic. The ebony clipboard functions as a tactile, handled object across multiple beats (placed on stone, touched by many). Midsummer planetary alignment supplies atmospheric texture but does not visibly constrain a choice. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.1)
    The salt flat is vividly rendered ("fractured mirror," "crystalline surface," cracks forming a map) and its acoustics directly enable the climactic act: the resonant hollow cradles the egg's note. Spatial choreography is clean (edge of riverbed → convergence point → hollow). The storm's return and rain erasing the map charge the final image, making environment essential to closure. Sensory detail is purposeful and reflects urgency without catalog padding.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    The silver courtyard under snow, the prism sanctuary, and starlight all provide vivid sensory anchors. The prism's "crystalline walls beneath the ice" and "facets holding whispers" create a charged micro-setting. The sanctuary directly enables the unlocking action and appears in the closure image ("its walls remained as testament"), satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, some details trend ornamental—"snowflakes fell like forgotten syllables"—without altering Elara's tactics or constraining her choices in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.1)
    The decommissioned radar dome is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: "cracked parabolic ceiling," "rusted girders," "single functioning CRT monitor." The setting meaningfully constrains the final image—"the parabolic dish above them concentrating the quiet like a prayer"—charging the closure moment. Spatial choreography remains clear (curtain of parachute silk, front row, bar) and the Cold War relic functions as both literal stage and thematic echo of Adrian's project to reverse manufactured truths.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.1)
    The verdant grotto is vividly rendered with moss respiration, cloud pools, and volcanic glass, and it constrains Esme's actions (building temporary structures suited to the high-altitude environment). Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric—"blushing stillness," "beard-moss," "wind-harp"—and filtered through Esme's priorities as a witness-builder. The moth wing as micro-setting object charges the final image by vibrating against gut strings. Spatial choreography is clear across her movements from grotto floor to reed tower.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.1)
    The icebound sanctum, aurora, and rope constrain choices and charge the final image effectively; "frozen dome," "workbench," and "aurora's torch" are vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography is coherent (wall ice, workbench, rope beside her). The rope's glowing braids function as micro-setting that enables the climax. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her artisan POV, though some descriptions ("shifting greens and violets") risk postcard mode.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bunker and vines constrain her entire existence and charge the final image: she climbs vine-draped walls, emerges into the rewilded forest, and the bunker's collapse completes the story's spatial arc. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—condensation spirals, mortar dust, rain washing years away—filtered through Mara's pattern-seeking perception. The storm functions as temporal and atmospheric pressure. The laughing fox stamp, moss tea, and Archive anchor the micro-setting and recur with shifted meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.1)
    The abandoned Babylonian palace is vividly anchored with sensory specifics: lapis-inlaid floors, cuneiform tablets, myrrh scent, moonlight filtering through the observatory. The tile itself—a fired-clay square with sixty-four numerals—functions as micro-setting, constraining Kael's nightly work and shaping the final schematic activation in the central courtyard. The "between regimes" temporal pressure is legible, with servants packing and new banners unfurling, creating urgency. The tile's warmth under moonlight and its eventual vanishing charge the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion that environment or object constrains choice and charges the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.4)
    The soundless sanctuary with shifting architecture (marble/sandstone/organic) is vivid and filtered through Mira's perception as a clock. The music box pin is handled across multiple beats and charges the final exchange. However, spatial choreography is vague—no sense of distance, proximity, or how the two figures move relative to each other or the shifting walls. The "reality shifts" timeframe is asserted but never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting detail is vivid, purposeful, and filtered through Kael's craft-based perception: "frost-silvered trunks," "stone walls held the ghost-scent of apples and stardust," "sand fused with frost." The ruined orchard and collapsed observatory supply the broken sextant, which becomes the vessel for transformation, directly enabling the climactic beat. The final image—glass mountain range of luminous trees—charges closure by manifesting the dream's reconfiguration of the physical space. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (orchard hollow → workshop → orchard exterior).

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard-in-rafters premise is vivid and purposeful: rotting ladder, apple boughs, moss-laden stone, quartz eyes, and the beam where roots split the cathedral's spine all constrain the mender's work and charge the setting with decay and renewal. The ribbon tied to the graft is a micro-setting detail that anchors the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (ladder, rafters, threshold). The squirrel nest and the ray of sunlight are sensory particulars that reflect the mender's state without forced symbolism. One missed opportunity: the daughter's position when she speaks from "the shadows" lacks spatial grounding—where exactly she stands and how she got there remain vague.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    The astral orchard setting constrains choice throughout: its rules forbid inquiry, its trees "speak" through fruit, the bathroom's privacy protocols enable the breakthrough. The pistachio shell functions as micro-setting, warming in his palm and requiring memory-carving. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through POV (silver branches, humming frequencies, recycled air). The orchard "tilting toward him" and branches swaying in vacuum directly charge the final sequence. Minor slip: "crystalline paths" and "liquid memories" lean decorative in the opening without immediate tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.8)
    The mountain bookstore is vivid in metaphor ("rose like a forgotten organ," "stone chambers humming") but never constrains movement or choice; spatial choreography in the catacombs is vague. The glass-ceiling mosaic and herb-scented air are atmospheric postcards without tactical relevance. The warden's "eyes glowing like muted brass" and "silent chord" offer tone but no physical pressure. Sensory selection tilts heavily visual and generic; the "perfume of forgotten herbs" does not alter Elara's path or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.1)
    The carnival ship setting is vividly rendered with concrete sensory detail (calliope pipes, mildew, popcorn smell) and spatial choreography is mostly clear. However, the environment remains largely decorative; it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The emerald swatch card unlocking the passage is the sole moment where setting details enable action, lifting the score above ornamental. The garden's glass dome and blooming names provide atmosphere but do not pressure the protagonist's final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.1)
    The clock tower mechanism room is vividly rendered—brass gears with "submarine precision," cold air from the passage, the ceremonial rope suspended between weights—and constrains choice by existing only at 3:47 AM and vanishing after use, creating temporal pressure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: the rope's "subsonic resonance," the seal pulsing "warm as living skin," the midnight chime's extra beat. The university archives and tower anchor the academic setting with specificity (mislabeled folio from 1643, floor plans, convocation portraits), and Elara's perceptual filter emphasizes precision and pattern recognition. The hidden chamber and its impossible door charge the final image by literalizing "temporal ambiguity," though the broader campus and archive stacks remain lightly sketched backdrops rather than lived-in spaces that apply further pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.1)
    The harmonic caves are vividly realized through sensory particulars: "discordant storm," "frozen pool reflected the chaotic light," "fractured lines" in ice, and "intricate shadows on the frozen walls." Spatial choreography is coherent (deep caves, ice pool, pedestal). The echo chamber stone and crack patterns constrain Lira's choices—she must align the cracks to conjure silence, and the ice's response shapes her tactics. The setting charges the final image ("the caves humming softly, a lullaby for the world"), qualifying for the 9+ test. Minor deduction: the energy beings above remain abstract placeholders without spatial grounding, and "harmonic caves" as a phrase is repeated without evolving texture.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glass humming pavilion constrains the final action—she must wait for the Navigator constellation and align the shard within the pavilion's star-path markings. The pavilion's resonance ("humming grew louder as starlight struck") charges the closure image. Sensory detail is purposeful: "low thrum that matched her heartbeat," starlight through cracked glass. The post-collapse wasteland is gestured at but remains generic; the tower interior and pavilion are vivid and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stormlit observatory, fog-become-solid plateau, and crystal forecourt are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (obsidian stairs, tessellated hexagonal crystals, scent of thunderstorms and old ink). The body and tools (summer-quill, measuring cord) are handled on the page and the forecourt's whispers constrain the archivist's approach to memory. Spatial choreography remains coherent across moves. The setting participates in the closure image (morning light touching the observatory dome), charging the final moment with the contrast between storm and dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.7)
    The kerosene rag knot is handled concretely (wound, looped, struck, charred) and charges the fire-spin beat, meeting the micro-setting test. The fortress's blooming vines and broken tiles supply vivid anchors, and the mosaic archway constrains Cinder's path at midpoint. Spatial choreography drifts slightly—archway is "half-buried" yet tiles "gleam with reflected glow" later—but sensory detail (floral perfume, clink of ceramic, scent of kerosene) is selective and purposeful, filtered through urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    The grotto, stars, tidal pool, and jade cicada are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (starlight "like liquid silver," cicada veins "mimicked the lines of a leaf"). The setting constrains the conversation spatially and the rising tide provides a temporal anchor. The jade cicada's tactile presence and the water's "soft give" charge the final image, grounding the abstract theme in concrete texture.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=5.6)
    The bunker's concrete walls and porcelain doll provide tactile anchors, and the xenial trellis offers spatial specificity during the inversion hour. However, the gilded hush and silence flavors remain abstract; no sensory hierarchy filters detail through the protagonist's claustrophobic urgency. The trellis does not constrain a choice—it is climbed without obstacle—and the doll's "silvery threads" are declared invisible, reducing their capacity to charge the final image with concrete cost.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    The drifting prism terrace functions as micro-setting that constrains Kael's work (buoyancy ratios, refractive wind shear, harmonic balance) and charges the final image when its ancient gears whisper and turn beneath her. The brass meter, storm glass vial, and resonance panels are handled across multiple beats, shaping her tactical choices. Spatial choreography remains clean (terrace edge, gondola, docking clamps). The "prismatic light" recurs purposefully, shifting from neutral description to emotional lens (diplomat's tears as refracting droplets). One minor slip: "Eastern Platform" and other districts are named but never visualized distinctly enough to ground the transit's stakes in specific geography.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.2)
    Vivid sensory details (acid rain, silver bark, compressed starlight steps) anchor the futuristic-decayed world, but the kaleidoscopic waterfall and hidden orchard function as backdrop rather than constraint—she steps through without friction, the grove doesn't pressure her choices. The murals are discovered but their content doesn't alter her tactics or force a spatial puzzle; the observatory dome and throne chamber remain postcard-beautiful rather than shaping action. The ruby flake's pulse charges the final image modestly, lifting the score slightly above pure decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight" recurs but never constrains a tactical choice—it functions as atmospheric backdrop. Spatial choreography is unclear: walls, corridors, altar, and threshold appear without coherent layout or distances. The doorknocker ring is placed on an altar, but no prior mention of the altar exists, breaking continuity. Sensory detail defaults to visual abstraction ("loaded emptiness," "shadows dancing") without haptic, auditory, or olfactory grounding that would anchor the POV's professional or survival priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.2)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm supplies vivid sensory anchors (blue glow, sapphire cast, mycelium) and the submarine porthole bolt is handled concretely. Spatial choreography is clear within the cavern. However, the setting does not materially constrain Kael's choice—he adjusts irrigation and turns a bolt without environmental resistance or resource scarcity shaping tactics. The final image uses the glow as backdrop but the environment itself does not charge the closure decision. Capped at 7.0 per Orientation Test application in Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sepia reading room is vividly rendered with cracked spines, amber lamplight, and mahogany gramophone, and the gramophone's physical presence (tarnished crank, mahogany shell) constrains the protagonist's ritual. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. However, the room functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; no environmental feature (locked door, missing tool, fading light) alters tactics or charges the final image when he departs into the night.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.1)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse supplies vivid texture (silver vines, luminescent fruit, glass cathedral) but does not constrain a choice or charge the final image with micro-setting pressure. Spatial choreography is coherent (potting shed, hidden door, chamber, doorway) yet the "endless night" and shifting reality remain atmospheric without affecting Aldric's tactics. Per Orientation Test cap from Q2, this category is capped at 7.0; the score reflects functional setting that remains largely decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    The file room's "metal shelves sagging under boxes" and dust patterns function as both setting and diagnostic tool, constraining Marianne's method throughout. The button's patina and envelope dust layers provide concrete micro-setting that charges the final discovery. Sensory detail is purposeful: "stale air and forgotten stories," dust thickness revealing sequence. The setting enables rather than decorates—dust becomes the medium through which history is read and small kindnesses magnified.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.9)
    The auric lagoon supplies a vivid, purpose-driven anchor that enables the climactic turn when the key activates the hidden door. Spatial choreography (city streets, compost bin, lagoon shore, relay station interior) remains clear throughout. Sensory detail is selective—golden bioluminescence, humming water, flickering screens—and filtered through urgency. The phone booth key functions as micro-setting, constraining choice and charging the final image as a totem.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.1)
    The grotto, mist, and dewdrops are vividly rendered through selective sensory detail (prism refraction, fog texture, dewdrop trembling). However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it remains a postcard backdrop. The "prism atrium" appears repeatedly but does not shape the saxophonist's actions; he could perform the same ritual anywhere. Micro-setting test fails: no tool, body constraint, or spatial pressure charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ashen skyborne arbor is evocatively named and receives atmospheric detail (twilight, mossy light, silken roots), but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint. Spatial choreography is vague—Lira "moves through branches," "climbs the ashen bark," "reaches the hollow"—without legible distances or effort that would pressure her choices. The arbor's blooming at the end is a reward, not a resource or obstacle that shaped tactics earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.1)
    The greenhouse and subterranean waterfall are vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (moss-covered drain grate, mineral deposits as "frozen tears," spray-coated crystalline gears). Spatial choreography remains coherent through the descent. The compass rose and the mechanism constrain Elara's choice at closure—she must jam the rose into the socket—elevating the setting's causal role. Minor: the workshop's "oil and burnt wire" and the greenhouse's "swirling leaves" recur but do not evolve with events.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    The foundry is vividly rendered—"wounded dragon," "copper-smell," embers pulsing—and the rain-washed setting charges the atmosphere. The anvil, furnace, and collected rainwater constrain Elara's ritual choices (quenching the coin, placing it on the grate). The final image of the foundry's golden shadow directly participates in closure, satisfying the 9+ gate test for environment charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Echo Gorge is established early with vivid, purposeful detail: "a throat of stone that swallowed sound and regurgitated memory." The misaligned harp and crocodile's tooth function as micro-setting elements that constrain action—only distorted notes shake loose confessions, and the tooth's angle produces the sob-like scrape that draws the child's laughter near. The hidden sunrise's "luminous ache between darkness and day" charges the final transformation. Sensory hierarchy reflects Kael's professional focus (sound, texture of notes) and the spatial choreography of descent/ascent brackets the action clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ultraviolet forest is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (moss compression, ozone scent, violet haze, UV lamps), and the pewter strap functions as a tactile anchor. The setting recurs across beats and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement of environment participation. However, spatial choreography is loose—Elena's position and movement through the forest lack clear progression—and the forest does not meaningfully constrain a choice or alter her tactics; it remains backdrop for internal reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    The alchemist's market—rope bridges, swaying stalls, sulfur and spice—anchors early and returns at closure ("market swayed in the wind"). The lighthouse lens fragment constrains the translator's choices (running thumb over it triggers memory, holding it to canvas reveals hidden figure) and charges the final pocket image. Spatial choreography remains mostly clear (market → stall → canvas corner → descent), though the painting's exact location and the alchemist's proximity shift without anchoring movement. Sensory detail is vivid but occasionally generic ("scent of salt," "storm-tossed coast").

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.1)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is vivid (collapsed counter, water-stained poster, sagging ceiling) and the dust spirals constrain Marlon's investigation. The mainsprings hidden above the tiles directly enable the closure discovery. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; spatial choreography (climbing the counter, reaching into darkness) is clean but the environment does not pressure a choice or force a trade-off. The final exterior glance at the cracked façade charges the theme but does not alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass orchard library is vividly rendered with selective detail (thousand panes, glass trees bearing memories, frost on northernmost wall) that creates a coherent surreal space. The bottled whisper and letterpress constrain Elara's method—she must transcribe and print, not simply think words into existence. Spatial choreography is clear through the rupture sequence (easternmost pane crack, mirrored library below). The environment charges the closure: shattering glass and merging libraries embody the conceptual shift, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.1)
    The baroque asteroid's spires, visible time layers, and cracked marble boulevards create vivid atmospheric specificity. The mirror and shard function as micro-setting elements that charge the climactic storm beat. However, spatial choreography during the storm scene is vague—Kael's position relative to Voss, the hall's dimensions, and the mechanics of pressing the shard against the covered mirror lack concrete grounding. Sensory detail is primarily visual and ornamental rather than filtered through urgency or POV bias.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.1)
    The resonance chamber is vividly rendered ("sound folded upon itself," "silver veins," "quartz pedestal grown in dark for a thousand years") and the setting does constrain: the pedestal amplifies the melody, the chamber's acoustics matter. Sensory detail is dense and purposeful. The final image of dawn "unfolding petals across the sky's black canvas" charges the ending, and the chamber's physicality shapes the repair sequence. Micro-setting (the box, the chip, the tweezers) also functions as constraint, lifting this above postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.1)
    The subterranean lagoon is vividly rendered: "water so still it seemed to be a hole in the world," stalactite rhythm, calcite-slick ledges. The compass and petrichor vials function as micro-setting elements that constrain Mira's choice at the waterline. Spatial choreography is clean through the quarry descent. However, the factory setting (dominant in the timeframe element) remains generic—"broken windows," "emptied desk," "loading dock"—and does not pressure any choice; it serves only as a launch point. The lagoon charges the final image strongly, but the above-ground half lacks specificity that would distinguish this valley from any shuttered industrial site.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archway, turbines, rocky shore, and magic lantern slide all contribute purposeful sensory detail filtered through Mara's sculptor attention. The archway's "carvings of waves that seemed to move" and the projected light revealing "layers of meaning" both constrain her final choice: she carves a shape to fit the niche "as if the stone had waited for it." Sensory hierarchy reflects her craft priorities (grain, salt, light). Minor deduction: the storm massing at the end arrives as atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure that alters her tempo or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.1)
    The amber pavilion and cathedral windows are described with vivid texture ("wooden ribs glazed with honeyed light," "stone arches rose like ribs"). The postcards recur across beats and charge the final collection moment, crossing the micro-setting threshold. However, spatial choreography at the cathedral is vague—how Sable "pressed her palm" and what she physically does as dawn breaks lacks concrete anchoring. The setting provides atmosphere but does not materially constrain a choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.1)
    The floating zeppelin library is a vivid anchor, and the coastal dunes return as a spatial motif. The beach debris (shells, driftwood, coral) constrains Elara's translation work and she physically arranges them in the parley scene, pressing the Under-Minister with tactile evidence. The obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes is referenced repeatedly but remains offstage, a memory-space rather than a site that shapes on-page action. Spatial choreography in the map room is clean, and the zeppelin's drift south at the end offers a purposeful closing image, though the setting functions more as backdrop than active constraint through most beats.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cove is anchored early with "paper-lantern," "boardwalk," "bay," and sensory particulars like "rain-slicked morning" and "amber reflections that danced on the water." The setting supplies the amber bottle on Kael's doorstep and provides the bay for the lantern ritual. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or meaningfully alter tactics—Kael could perform his ritual in any location. The cove functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure, capping the score below 7.0 per the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    The rooftop orchard, phonograph, reflecting pool, and vault are vividly rendered with purposeful detail. The wax shaving's immersion in water and the leaf mirroring the recorded hum charge the final image. Spatial choreography (rooftop to spiral stair to vault beneath roots) is coherent and the medlar's roots anchor the closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.1)
    The icebound atrium is vividly anchored with frost, starlight, and frozen soil, and the oak acorn cap is handled across multiple beats (scooping starlight, splitting to sprout). The setting pressures Elara's urgency (ice threatens to claim everything) and the cap's transformation into a sprout charges the final image. However, the atrium itself does not constrain a tactical choice—Elara moves freely through the vortex without navigating locked doors, failing tools, or resource scarcity tied to the ice.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.1)
    The windblown sanctuary, observation deck, instruments, and bell rope are vividly anchored with selective sensory detail (frost-kissed stone, frayed hemp, clouds churning below). The bell rope's glue-stiffened state constrains her choice in the middle beat, and the observation window frames the decisive moment when she sees the gap in the clouds. Spatial choreography (spiral stair, bell chamber, observation deck) remains clear throughout, and the setting's altitude and isolation subtly amplify the stakes of a false alarm. The final image—shutters open, solstice hush deepening—charges the ending without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.1)
    The station's "dim corridors," "fractured windows," and "rusted gears" provide atmosphere, but spatial choreography remains vague—no coherent map of Sola's movements. The yellow glass and luminescent moss function as motif more than constraint; neither alters a tactical choice. Sensory detail leans visual and metaphoric ("silken shroud," "amber light") without grounding in touch, sound, or POV-filtered particularity. The alcove and highest window appear when needed but don't pressure decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.1)
    The wasteland, hives, and stained glass box anchor space clearly. The box returns across multiple beats and gains slight meaning (note → vow container), touching the lyric-reprise threshold. However, the oasis itself supplies no resource constraint or tactical pressure—Elara moves freely among hollow hives without the environment ever limiting a choice. Sensory detail ("dust motes," "brittle light") decorates but does not filter through urgent POV selection.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.1)
    The Emerald Silo's copper-to-green oxidation is vivid, and the interior shelving provides spatial grounding. The ammo box and porcelain fragment are handled concretely. However, the silo functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain Elara's choices or supply resources that alter tactics. The "shadowless meeting place" paradox is asserted rather than spatially dramatized, and the final image relies on metaphysical abstraction (lifelines as roads) rather than environment or object that charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cobalt lagoon, wet sand, dunes, and driftwood are consistently anchored and sensory (iridescent feather, damp pages, gulls' cries). However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—the poet moves freely without spatial friction. The recurring driftwood shrine (paragraph 13) and the feather placed inside the notebook (paragraph 26) are symbolic gestures, not pressure points. Micro-setting potential exists but remains ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    The temple orchard is vividly particular: living stone pillars, coral and bacteria growth, oak roots threading like nerves, bioluminescent moss. The copper wire functions as both tool and motif, its hum and warmth charging multiple beats. Spatial choreography is clean across the quadrants, and the orchard's responses (insects rerouting, gecko supervisor, parrot votes) ground the fantastical in tactile detail. The final image—warm pillars, singing wires—directly charges the closure. However, the six-month timeframe and Elias's physical labor under illness are abstracted; we never feel the island's weather, the weight of the spools, or the pain in his hands beyond a single mention of shaking.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.4)
    The rainwashed tower, overgrown sculpture path, and bronze-paneled chamber anchor the journey with sensory specificity (wet stone, gravel crunch, amber warmth). The fly amber functions as a micro-setting element that charges the final image and recurs with purpose. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the protagonist simply walks, kneels, and records data without spatial friction. The setting is vivid but does not pressure the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dead reef, barren plain, blooming jetty, and battlefield are vivid and purposeful, creating a post-war landscape that constrains the coachman's project. The seed pods and gull are handled concretely (scattering, digging, following guidance). Spatial choreography is clear and the jetty functions as both anchor and stage for the ritual. However, the setting does not tighten a choice at closure; the final garden is described rather than shown altering a present tactic or decision.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cracked wasteland, scrap mountain, and vault constrain Wick's route and the leaf-pattern hatch mechanism requires the preserved object to open—setting directly enables closure. Micro-details (crushed radiator water, ration packs, buried uniform scrap) ground survival choices and the scent memory navigation. The corroded shipping container and vault's cylinder-lined chamber charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy fits a bloodhound POV (scent-first perception, "wild hush" as absence of bird cries). Spatial choreography remains clear across the three-day trek.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.7)
    The observation deck's time-dilation property is vividly rendered ("seconds into minutes," "stretched time"), and spatial anchors like the glass ring and outer walkway provide coherent choreography. However, the environment primarily serves as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining a choice or supplying a resource that alters the final move. The compass rose (object-as-micro-setting) does charge the closure image but does not impose a visible tactical constraint. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the protagonist's stargazing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.6)
    The icebound spire and ice mirrors provide vivid visual anchors, and the obsidian chessboard is specific. However, the labyrinth's spatial choreography remains vague—no sense of distance, duration, or navigation difficulty. The pocket sundial lid and chess pieces are described but do not constrain a choice or alter tactics; they function as keys rather than resistances. Sensory detail skews heavily visual with minimal tactical pressure from the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.1)
    The whispering gallery is vividly named and its acoustic properties ("echoes of a thousand voices") are invoked repeatedly, but spatial choreography remains vague—arches and alcoves are mentioned without clear layout. The chessboard on its plinth is a static motif; it does not constrain Kael's walking pattern or alter his tactics. The interregnum setting ("pale, expectant light") provides atmospheric color but does not pressure his choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.7)
    The labyrinthine bookstore is vividly anchored—"maze of paper and ink," "stone shelves that spiraled up into fog," corridors that rearrange nightly. The alcove "masked by a curtain of shadows" and the black basalt pedestal supply spatial pressure. The feather's "barbs soft as silk" and the stone's "pitted symbols" offer tactile specificity. However, the environment does not *constrain* a choice—Mira's discovery of the alcove and subsequent action proceed without spatial obstacle or resource limit that alters her tactics. The setting decorates and amplifies but does not gate or shape the climactic decision.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.1)
    The time-frozen village, platinum tapestry, and cobblestone square are vividly anchored. Sensory detail—"threads shimmered like platinum," "breaths misting in the suddenly crisp air"—grounds key beats. The tapestry constrains the tutor's method and charges the climax. Spatial choreography is clear. However, the setting does not pressure a difficult choice; the tutor's work is uninterrupted, and the village functions more as backdrop than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.1)
    The bone towers and pale spire anchor the setting vividly, and sensory detail (ivory, ash, mist, violet paint) is purposeful. Spatial choreography is clear—Kael climbs, Mara follows, Elders process below. However, the canyon functions primarily as backdrop; at no point does the environment constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. The spire's smoothness and the canyon's acoustics enrich atmosphere but do not charge the final image with micro-setting pressure, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The acid sea, failing exchanger, and corroding workshop create coherent pressure: waves crack support beams, mercury spills, the atmosphere exchanger whines and fails. The statue's pockmarks function as micro-setting, constraining Elara's procedure (she must match specific craters). Sensory detail—green foam hissing, verdigris stains, gaslight casting scarab shadows—is filtered through her alchemist's focus. The final image of the statue warming and workshop floating steady directly charges closure: the golden logic that mends the statue also stabilizes the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.1)
    The coastal cave network and hidden oasis are vividly rendered with turquoise pool, shaft of light, dripping water, and wet stone—sensory detail is purposeful and layered. The oasis setting shapes the final act (painting with pool water, placing shell on ledge) and charges the closure image with spatial specificity. However, the cave navigation itself remains generic; the "wrong turn at a fork" appears abruptly without prior spatial choreography or stakes tied to the path choice, weakening the causal link between setting constraint and discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt lighthouse functions as more than setting: its blue stone walls, singing crystal, and fresnel lens constrain Elara's final act (she must use the lens to purify her intent). The storm's breaking anchors the timeframe and the cool salt air after fever-heat mirrors the emotional shift. Spatial choreography is clear: cottage to spiral stairs to lantern room. The cork, jasmine garden, and lens glass charge the final image. Minor excess: "seam of crystal that sang when struck" introduces a detail that doesn't return or constrain a later choice.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    The signal station is vividly rendered with salvaged copper wire, glass lenses, rusted speakers, and starlit windows. The censer foot's lunar pulse and the station's frozen dish constrain Kael's work and charge the resonator build. The environment actively shapes his choices: he solders the foot into the machine, lets the moon's pull guide the circuit, and the station "shudders" during activation. The final image—station as "sentinel of starlight"—reprises the setting with reweighted meaning, and the broken hydraulics bookend the piece functionally.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.1)
    The hanging orchard, ravine, and storms are vividly rendered and purposefully recur, but they function primarily as backdrop rather than constraint. The storm-scarred trees provide sap for the binding ritual (a late functional detail), and ropes anchor the orchard in the penultimate paragraph, yet neither choice is shown to alter tactics under pressure—they're solutions introduced after the main turn. The antique glass eye (a micro-setting object) does charge the final image, lifting the score modestly. Sensory hierarchy is consistent (rain-blackened fruit, bitter sap) but the ravine's spatial choreography never forces a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.1)
    The opal dock, mist, and lighthouse are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (amber glow, trembling shadows, the low hum of gears). Nautical twilight and the persistent mist constrain Cornelius's investigation spatially and temporally, charging the final beam-sweep image. The edelweiss boutonniere functions as micro-setting—its "fragile veins" and glass-jar preservation anchor the memory physically. The boat's barnacled hull and the letter add concrete detail, though the alpine air flashback risks postcard brevity without local grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    The blooming cavern with bioluminescent fungi and nectar-dripping stalactites charges the final image and provides a spatial container for the climax. The creek's rising water operates as a live clock that tightens decisions. The matrix chip, though small, recurs across beats and its phosphorescence constrains Merrick's path. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) all contribute to closure, satisfying the 9+ gate in principle, but the cavern itself remains more postcard than pressure—beautiful description that does not force a tactical choice within the space.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ember grotto and cobalt walls supply vivid sensory anchors (heat melting ice, mineral water catching starlight) that evolve across the climb. The grotto's dual temperature states (heat/frost) create spatial pressure that charges the final image. Micro-setting detail (thorns defying gravity, frost's lacy menace) reflects urgency and POV filter. The environment constrains the queen's path and supplies the transformative site, meeting the 9+ gate requirement of choice-shaping terrain.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ember nexus supplies vivid atmosphere ("dying stars breathed their last," "swirling embers") but never constrains a choice or alters tactics. Spatial choreography is vague—two characters stand in a visually rich but functionally static location. The nautilus curl and vials are handled but do not impose physical limits or enable a tactical shift; they serve as symbolic props rather than setting elements with mechanical consequence. Sensory detail is present but ornamental, failing to narrow options or charge the final image with environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.3)
    The cabin, scroll, graveyard, and mountain air are rendered with vivid sensory specificity ("cedar-shake shack," "pine resin and old snow," "bark bleeding sap like ink"). The birch bark scroll functions as micro-setting and constrains the chronicler's act of writing across multiple beats, charging the final image. The mountain setting pressures the chronicler's stance (holding breath, ghost being born) and the scroll's physicality ("scraping my palms") anchors abstract time-confusion in tactile present. The environment actively shapes the closure image, meeting the 9+ test for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    The water clock shop provides tactile constraint throughout: the float valve adjustment, the screw's worn threads, and the clock's chambers become instruments that teach Elena new perception methods. Fog as occluding medium shapes both literal view and metaphorical stance, recurring from opening to lift-off at closure. The ylang-ylang vial's golden viscosity and rosemary's oil beading are micro-settings that substitute for scent and charge the final shift, making the environment essential to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating rock tea ceremony platform supplies vivid spatial grounding and the crow quill, ink vial, and crystalline rune function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. Sensory detail—stormcloud berry ink, polished stone, rain drumming—filters through Kaelin's purpose-driven attention. The platform's "pulse" and the crystallized rune's glow constrain the ritual's progress and shape the ending, meeting the gate for 7+ when environment or recurring object charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive—musty, yellowed sheet music, scarred piano bench—grounds the scene with sensory particularity and professional detail (gossip-column notes, music metaphors). The perfume bottle's scent (old roses, damp earth, burnt cinnamon) is specific and purposeful, anchoring memory. The orchard's impending destruction provides temporal pressure, and the final image of stumps and lingering scent charges the ending. However, spatial choreography becomes vague during the climax: we lose track of where Mira and Linden stand relative to the piano, bottle, and door, and the transition from archive interior to "stepped outside" compresses without clear movement.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    The temple library supplies vivid images—dust motes, shafts of light without sun, halls that lengthen into paradox—but these remain atmospheric rather than constraining choice. The dictionary grows heavier and its pages flutter, yet this weight never prevents an action or alters a tactic. Spatial choreography stays coherent (stacks, corridors, nautilus center) and the setting's timeless quality supports tone, but the environment does not shape the witness's decisions at any pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.1)
    The fjord, cliff, and hydraulic clock chamber are anchored early with sensory detail ("still as glass," water dripping). The mantle clock key returns in the final paragraphs and is handled across beats, lending some micro-setting function. However, environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; description remains atmospheric postcard rather than pressure-shaping. The 9+ gate (environment/tool constrains choice or charges final image) is not met; cap at 8.8 even if vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.9)
    The rainwashed library and subway are vividly anchored with sensory detail (clover-melancholy, scent of old pages, graffiti-covered bench). The lantern's mica pane charges the final image as a beacon. Spatial choreography across library, subway, and hidden alcove remains clear. However, the "forgotten alcove sealed after a fire" and circular table with equations materialize without prior spatial seeding, reducing inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.1)
    The subway utility tunnel and glass booth anchor early with vivid particulars (iron beams, glass walls, rotary phone, stale air). The glass harmonica disc supplies recurring sensory detail (hum, vibration, final shatter cascade) and constrains the climax choice. Spatial choreography remains coherent across beats. However, the "hum of streetlamps" timeframe floats as lyric atmosphere without affecting access, urgency, or tactics—setting detail ornaments rather than pressures most beats.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    Setting details are vivid and purposeful: cedar shelf, walnut ink, blooming jetty, moss-covered stones, night-blooming jasmine. The jetty functions as a charged site that anchors both memory and renewal, and the steep hillside climb provides physical texture. Sensory selection (scent of jasmine and rain, water lapping, twilight cool) reflects urgency and filters through the archivist's preservationist lens. The jasmine bouquet left on the jetty charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test—environment constrains ritual and the recurring object (jetty, ink, jasmine) reweights meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ivy-clad station anchors setting throughout and the rusted clock tower frames the climax, satisfying the Micro-setting test. Sensory detail is present but generic ("cracked," "crumbling," "shimmer") and spatial choreography remains vague—where are characters relative to the tower, the platforms, the ivy? The fragment embedded in the cornerstone is a purposeful reprise, but the station itself does not constrain a single choice or tactic on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ultrasonic forest is vividly rendered through tactile and vibrational detail (vibrating bark, frequencies beyond hearing, lichen-etched notes). Sensory filtering reflects Elara's blindness consistently; she navigates by touch and skin-absorbed language. The stillpoint as micro-setting constrains her final choice—she must kneel and press her forehead to the ground to receive the note. Spatial choreography remains clear (westward pull, tighter trees, undergrowth, treeline exit) and the platinum ring functions as both compass and tactile anchor throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.4)
    The gravitational anomaly is vividly rendered ("light bent into whispered spirals," "time pooled like honey") and the pen's physical details (exotic nib, spirals mirroring anomaly contours) anchor the setting concretely. However, the anomaly functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain a key choice or alter tactics in the middle beats. The pen's interaction with the anomaly (bending light, unbending curves) charges the closure image modestly, but the final paragraphs shift to abstract reflection rather than grounded sensory detail that pressures the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    The luminous harbor is anchored early with concrete sensory detail (salt, moonlight silvering waves, creak of pilings). The moon's low position and the liquid-light path recur and charge the final image when Elias signs into the night. The vintage camera functions as a micro-setting object: its empty shutter becomes "a metronome marking time," constraining his ritual and evolving into a conductor's baton. Spatial choreography (pier, shoulder-to-shoulder positioning) remains clear. The setting's particulars—harbor stones, water slapping hulls—filter through Elias's perception and the advisor uses them to teach him to "see the harbor's sounds."

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    The archive setting is vivid and functional: steam, sulfur, limestone chambers, bioluminescent fungi, and three natural skylights all anchor the space concretely. The dawn-angle geometry constrains the final reveal, and the pigments Kael mines by hand charge the murals with physicality. Minor slip: the spatial choreography of "hundreds of chambers" and "winding passages" remains vague during the weeks of work; we never learn how Kael navigates or prioritizes them.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sound wave garden is vividly rendered with silver rings, quartz trees, copper vines, and the auric lagoon, all filtered through Kael's urgency and grief. Micro-setting elements (the black stone, the water's surface, his own body as percussion) constrain and enable his final composition. Orientation anchors are present but delayed slightly: "the resonance platform," "below him," "the garden's heart" establish spatial relationships after substantial interiority. The garden's sensory details are specific and purposeful, and the lagoon charges the final image by becoming the medium of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    The container labyrinth is vividly rendered with corrugated walls, seven-high stacks, and acoustic properties that actively constrain Marek's method. The geomagnetic storm amplifies metal surfaces into resonating chambers, directly enabling the whisper's travel. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (central junction, eastern edge, north gate). The environment shapes tactics and charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt dock, rain-slicked planks, and boathouse shutters provide tactile grounding and appear across multiple beats. The dental mirror functions as micro-setting, recurring in the guardian's hand and the child's palm to charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid ("iron and old rope," "bruised sky") but leans visual; the canal's stillness and the dock's weathered planks modulate with the guardian's ritual, though spatial choreography of the child's approach and the guardian's position at the shutters remains slightly vague.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cobalt library and mist recur as atmospheric anchors, and the grotto's "magnetic pull" charges several beats. Spatial choreography is loose (students move "through the mist" to the grotto without clear geography), but the cobalt hue and stone texture create a coherent visual signature. The setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it functions as backdrop rather than pressure—but the final return to the library with "faint scent of change" attempts to charge the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.7)
    The sublittoral fringe and disappearing island are vivid and purposeful, anchoring the liminal-space theme. Spatial choreography is clear (dock → skiff → island shore). The scrimshaw functions as micro-setting, constraining the guardian encounter and charging the final image when it "rested in her hand." However, the island itself does not pressure a choice; it offers sanctuary without obstacle. Sensory detail is selective and poetic but occasionally drifts toward postcard ("floating mound of sand and shadow") rather than lived texture. The warm sand and brine scent are effective but underused as tactical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.1)
    The farmhouse, wind turbines, and wooden figurines are vivid and recur across beats, charging the atmosphere. The turbines' "relentless hum" and "massive shadows" pressure the performer's routines and recur in the final image. The knife, pine block, and dried bouquet function as micro-setting tools that the performer handles repeatedly, grounding the rituals. However, spatial choreography within the farmhouse is vague—no clear room layout or distance cues—and the turbines remain postcard backdrop rather than a constraint that alters a tactical choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.8)
    Setting details are vivid and consistent: cobalt atrium, frozen lake, humming quartz colonnade establish a coherent atmosphere. Sensory description (lantern-moth hush, quartz vibration, ice crackle) is selective and purposeful, filtered through the poet's aesthetic lens. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it remains a canvas for metaphor rather than a pressure source. The colonnade's hum and the lake's ice are richly described but do not shape the protagonist's decisions or charge the final image with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.1)
    The courtyard anchors setting with jasmine, ferns, ivy, and furnaces; plants respond to the reed tongue, creating one functional micro-setting moment. However, the phoenix and spire remain ornamental backdrops, and spatial choreography is vague—where Elara stands, how Dorian moves through steam, and the layout of vases are never clear enough to constrain action. The glass droplet charges the final image, lifting the score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    The laboratory is richly detailed—salvaged acoustic panels, holographic grid reconstructions, centrifuge modified to whisper-speed—and these elements ground the action. The carbide lens suspended in the centrifuge constrains Kaelen's experiment and charges the final image when Mara touches it. Golden shadows function as micro-setting, thickening the air and becoming "a landscape she could climb." Spatial choreography is clean (lens on workbench, then suspended, then touched), and the environment shapes the peak choice: the one-degree off-center adjustment that reveals hidden harmonics.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.8)
    The observatory's metaphoric architecture ("curtains of intention," "dying stars hung like frozen breath") is vivid but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The vellum stencil and origami figures do small spatial work (illuminated beneath lens, left in airlocks), yet no environmental detail forces a tactical choice or meaningfully charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains abstract—Elara moves through quadrants and observation decks without grounded proximity or access friction. The setting reads as lyric texture rather than pressure apparatus.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rain-beaded skylight and measuring tape anchor micro-setting effectively, with the tape constraining Mara's ritual in multiple beats (measuring the loft, extending it across the spread). The loft's spatial details (east wall, floorboards with pencil lines, fire escape) create a coherent geography. The measuring tape functions as both tool and symbolic constraint, shaping how Mara maps disaster coordinates. Sensory detail is purposeful (rain as metronome, onyx ink pooling) and filtered through Mara's professional lens, though the "flooded city streets" and distant sirens remain generic backdrop rather than pressing on choices.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.8)
    The archive's physical layout is scenic but never constrains a choice: crystalline shelves, obsidian pillars, and amber light are described yet Lyra moves through them without spatial friction or resource pressure. The bronze pagoda appears at twilight as predicted, spinning and casting reflections, but its mechanics (how does she locate it? how does spinning encode purification?) remain atmospheric rather than tactical. Micro-setting option is missed—her saffron veil catches light twice but never alters a decision. No 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.1)
    The blooming library above clouds is vivid and purpose-driven: glass-and-steel petals, shelves glowing with new light, the contrast of earth-memory (river) versus cloud-world. The river stone functions as micro-setting, constraining the protagonist's choice and charging the final image when its absence is felt. Spatial choreography is clean (archive room, monitor, table). The world after shareable dreams is consistently invoked but remains slightly abstract—how dreams are shared or what that changes about daily library operations is left vague, weakening the setting's pressure on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    The workshop is vividly anchored (fogged windows, cedar shavings, jasmine) and micro-setting elements constrain choices: the amber jar of salve enables the tail-tip care, the wood stove consumes the fraudulent brochures, and the enclosures structure her sequence of attention. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional priorities (texture of scales, pulse under her thumb). The gravel road car arrival tightens the temporal frame and charges the final image, ensuring the setting participates in closure rather than merely decorating it.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.8)
    The tower, hourglass, and tunnel are anchored early and described with sensory detail (cool stone, damp moss-scent). However, setting remains largely atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint—the tunnel opens easily, the pebble floats accessibly, and spatial elements do not force tactical choices or alter Elara's approach. The frosted hourglass returns at closure but as symbolic decoration rather than a tool or constraint that shapes the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    The projection booth is vividly rendered with purposeful detail—carbon arc housing, Simplex projector, Maltese cross movement—that grounds Mira's work and charges the final image. The crystal and film strip function as micro-setting elements that constrain psychometry action. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira's professional focus (mechanical heartbeat, amber sludge hum). The booth's architecture as "storage unit" directly shapes the thematic closure, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint/charge.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.1)
    The aurora and archway are vivid but static—postcard description without constraining a choice. The sextant appears twice (attic, then placed on ice) but is handled ceremonially rather than as a tool that shapes tactics. Spatial choreography is loose: the attic's location, the journey's terrain, and the archway's physical relationship to the ice block remain unclear. The body and the ice are present at the ending but do not charge the final image with cost; the protagonist simply "woke" and returned.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.9)
    Vivid, purposeful imagery throughout: "sand remembered chlorophyll through some stubborn mutation of nostalgia," "grain of sand a tiny sun," "corner so unlit it had never learned to burn." The glowing dune and the unlit corner function as micro-settings that charge the final planting action, and the sensory details are filtered through the guard's metaphysical lens. Spatial choreography remains abstract—"seven clicks south," "beneath the dune"—but the body and archive (sternum-located) anchor the protagonist's physicality. The piece reaches high-6 range because environment and recurring objects (dune, archive, charm) constrain the guard's tactics and charge the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.1)
    The mechanical rainforest is vividly described with specificity (copper leaves, brass bark, piston-tree, steam-mangroves, crystal-fern valleys). However, setting remains decorative rather than constraining choice—the environment never pressures a decision or alters tactics. Spatial choreography is loose; translocations occur without clear geography. The gear placed against the sequoia is the closest moment where setting interacts with choice, but it still reads as symbolic rather than mechanically consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory texture is present—salt, pine, mossy stone, fireflies—but remains postcard description. The ridgeway and cove do not constrain or enable Lin's choices; the dog is simply waiting. The ferry and lantern anchor the scene visually, yet spatial choreography across multiple locations (shore, boat, opposite bank, ridgeway, cove) blurs without clear distances or thresholds.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cobalt fortress, snow, spiral staircase, and bolt are concrete and constrain choice: the staircase is her assigned penance route, the bolt in her pocket a tactile reminder that charges the final beat when she gestures toward "the tools." Sensory economy is strong (three feet of snow, moisture seeping through stone, cold heavy bolt). Does not quite reach 8.5 because the fortress interior remains somewhat generic (east wing, refectory, music room) beyond the staircase and the snow functions more as atmosphere than tactical constraint at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ancient temple library is vivid and atmosphere-rich ("crumbling pillars wrapped in vines of silvered starlight"), but remains postcard description rather than a constraint on choice. The ink pellets and slender green-leather volume supply texture, yet spatial choreography is vague—Sylvar "moved through the aisles," Vael "found a slender volume"—and the library's "graceful collapse" operates as metaphor, not tactical pressure. The setting does not narrow options or alter the final image's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    The floating monitoring station is vivid (moored disc, steel railing, mildewed archive) and pressures the isolated, drifting tone. The atlas page as micro-object charges the final image (waterproof case, tapping a new rhythm). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—faded ink, raised contours, the needle's rise—filtered through Lina's witness role. No spatial incoherence; the tide gauge and archive function as constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned spaceport is vivid and purposeful: corroded hulls, metal grating underfoot, dust of failed uprising, launch pad seven. Kai's bare feet supply micro-setting constraint (tingling against grating, pressing stone monoliths) and sensory filter is consistent—stargazer priorities shape what she notices. The stone circle provides the resource (amplification) that enables the ending action. Spatial choreography across repair bay, observation deck, and stone circle remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.7)
    Volcanic hot springs, Chamber of Resin, and recovering forest are anchored early and recur with purpose. The springs enable the unsealing (vent heat cracks amber), meeting the constraint test. Sensory details – "scalding water," "iron and smoke," "mineral-rich" – are vivid and purposeful. However, spatial choreography of the settlement and reconstruction scaffolding remains sketchy; we never learn how far the Chamber is from Mara's home or what "mosaic of wooden scaffolding" practically means for her climb. The ferns and bamboo function more as thematic motifs than lived environment that alters her tactics in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.1)
    The arboretum's cliff edge, wind-scarred cypress, and exposed orchid roots charge the ending image (body as lighthouse, somatic markers as beam). The Monterey cypress and eucalyptus bark constrain Elias's method—he needs tactile surface to anchor memory. Sensory hierarchy reflects his forensic eye (grooves, pressure, cool roughness) filtered through grief. The automated lighthouse vs. human arboretum contrast supports his thematic shift. However, occupational detail (forensic architect) is mentioned but never operationalized in a choice; the skill becomes metaphor rather than constraint. Spatial choreography is clear across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.1)
    Library-within-lighthouse ("third spiral," salt and silverfish, "astronomy section hollow") is vivid and constrains discovery of the threads. Sensory detail is selective (velvet darkness, humming threads, mortar weeping salt) and filtered through an artist's eye. The walls' breathing and closing-in drive urgency at the peak beat, and the final lighthouse beam cutting through charges the ending image. Spatial choreography (forty-seven steps above vs. down here) is clear. The five-places-at-once premise remains abstract and does not constrain a choice, slightly weakening the setting's leverage on action.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.1)
    The wind-carved encampment is vividly anchored with sensory detail (stone walls etched by gusts, low humming arches) and the eclipse/shadow framing provides temporal atmosphere. The disappearing ink functions as a micro-setting element that is handled multiple times (quill sketches, spilling on the drone, pooling on stone) and constrains Kael's experimental method. Spatial choreography is clear and the dunes provide consistent backdrop. The setting does not, however, pressure a choice at closure; it remains backdrop rather than an active force shaping tactics or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    The subzero Alexandrium is vividly rendered with nitrogen-cooled servers, pneumatic tubes, and spatial depth ("three kilometers of ancient snow," "deepest level"). The setting constrains Elara's choice by providing the dormant pneumatic network as the delivery mechanism, and the "ceremonial fountain in Central Atrium" becomes the tactical target. The piece satisfies the micro-setting gate: the schematic knowledge and manual pump are tools that enable the climactic act. However, some descriptions lean decorative ("frozen lullabies," "fiber-optic ghosts") without altering Elara's tactical options in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass dome, desert roses, and sand filters create a vivid micro-setting that constrains Lyra's world (she must clear clogged filters using the sandbag scrap as counterweight). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (perfume as "quiet fire," burlap texture, dust storm rattling glass). The sandbag scrap's physical use to clear filters demonstrates that objects constrain choice, elevating this above pure description. However, the desert beyond the dome remains generic ("fractured mosaic of warring factions") without specificity that would ground the threat or make the enclosure feel more urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sound wave garden functions as micro-setting that constrains Avery's path (zigzag to avoid shattering threads, silence patch as anchor site) and charges the closure image (echo settling into soil as seed). Sensory details—humming soil that exhales color, violet tones from constellation light—are vivid and filtered through the fantastical premise. The rail spike as tool constrains her method (moon-cooled iron transliterates emotion into vibration) and reappears in the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    The observatory is vividly rendered—domed ceiling, marble walls, telescope, mahogany table—and the rosewood nib functions as micro-setting that charges the final signing gesture. The fog-to-gold transformation at closure reweights the opening mist imagery with purpose. However, the setting functions more as atmospheric backdrop than constraint; the memo could have been written in any study without altering tactics. Sensory detail is strong and POV-filtered through Victoria's observational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.1)
    The laboratory of lost sounds, phonograph cabinet, and amber all constrain the corrective ritual and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is vivid and purposeful: "silence fell like cosmic dust," "golden weight pressing into ancient mechanism," "cold absolution of forgotten things." Spatial choreography is clean (amber → phonograph plate → needle descent → slot behind). The tattoo gun as modified stylus grounds the method. No occupational overreach; the setting's logic (time-folds, haunted firmware, celestial ink) remains internally consistent and the amber's fossilized chirp reweights the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.8)
    The grotto is vivid in opening texture ("lilac unease," "damp stone walls breathing") but does not constrain a meaningful choice or supply resources that alter the outcome. The sand mandala and tile flake appear as symbolic objects rather than tools that shape tactics; the artist's chalk and scraper are mentioned but never handled in action. Spatial choreography is loose—her position relative to the mandala and walls shifts without clear blocking. The "whispering grotto in mist" charges the tone but does not pressure the protagonist's moves; it remains atmospheric postcard rather than micro-setting crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky" and "charred pillars" establish post-fire atmosphere early with selective sensory detail (ash, burnt spices). The mosaic stepping stone and tessera are handled on the page and constrain the renaming action. However, spatial choreography is vague—Arin's movement through the ruins and the relationship between pillars, stones, and the distant new minaret remain impressionistic rather than navigable. The setting provides mood but does not pressure a choice; Arin's actions proceed without environmental obstacle or resource scarcity.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.4)
    Setting is vivid and layered (theater, backstage, hedge maze, orchard) with strong sensory specificity (petals that "chimed like glass bells," fruit glowing "like soft lanterns"). The orchard functions as more than backdrop: it houses the tarot coin toss and frames the final gesture. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—doors open without resistance, the maze is traversed without navigation, and the garden "folds back" without consequence. Spatial choreography is clear within each location, but the sequence of spaces feels more like a tour than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.4)
    The light-painting studio anchors who/where/when early and supplies concrete tools (dimmer switch, metal table, chemicals, software) that Lina uses in the experiment. Sensory detail—acetone smell, fluorescent buzz, geode hum—grounds the action. The setting enables the experiment but does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off; Lina has unfettered access to materials and time. The geode as micro-object charges the final image (fractal tree on canvas), lifting the score into mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.7)
    The coastal cave network is described with vivid sensory detail ("walls wet with salt and memory," "thick with the scent of salt and something older"). Spatial anchors track cleanly across moves. The setting pressures Lira's descent and provides the fossil, but it does not constrain a key choice at closure; she emerges unchanged by environmental friction, and the final image relies on her unchanged stance rather than a spatial or resource limit.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.1)
    The amber warehouse, petrified sap glowing with trapped fireflies, and the mason jar all supply vivid, purpose-driven images that anchor the accumulative design. The buttons' "unique pattern of wear" and their resonance with sound fragments give the cataloging a tactile, material presence. The final image—pressing an ear to petrified sap—charges closure by transforming the warehouse from a solitary vault into a resonant vessel for shared wisdom, meeting the 9+ gate for setting constraining choice or charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.9)
    Zephyr Bluff is anchored early with concrete details (wind-carved stone, accumulated snow, mist turning to golden threads at dawn) and the snow layering functions as both setting and cipher storage, constraining Kael's retrieval method. The bluff's edge and drifts guide the excavation beat. However, the spatial choreography of the exchange (courier stepping closer, Kael digging) remains generic; the environment is vividly described but does not pressure a micro-choice or charge the final image beyond serving as backdrop. The timeframe (predawn to dawn) tracks cleanly, and the silver-mist tone integrates with atmosphere, but the setting stops short of compelling a tactic shift or forfeiting a resource.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fog-bound river crossing, rain gutters, and ferry landing are richly textured and constrain the scene's atmosphere. The yarn needle functions as micro-setting (object-as-constraint) and charges the final image when both needles align. Sensory hierarchy is controlled: Silas perceives through ambient awareness (vibration before sound, fog geometry), filtering detail through his coachman's expertise. Spatial choreography is clean (tollhouse, landing, far bank). The gutters' ticking operates as both setting and clock, shaping the waiting with physical presence. Minor gap: Gloom-Hill itself remains somewhat abstract—"windows shuttered against memory" gestures at history without grounding it in concrete visual or social detail that might pressure a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    The beekeeping oasis is vividly realized through selective detail: silvered hive boxes, wild rosemary in cracked flagstones, hidden spring clay. The setting constrains Kai's final action—she uses oasis materials (rosemary kindling, spring clay) to create the bowl, and the "thrum" she feels guides her wheel work. Spatial choreography is coherent. The oasis functions as more than backdrop; it teaches and supplies, charging the final image when she leaves her offering "on the central stone."

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the fire escape vertical garden, the abandoned cannery lot, the luminous harbor by moonlight all anchor Maya's shift from constrained to expansive planting. The bitting gauge tooth—handled across multiple beats (scoring soil, gleaming in dirt, slipped back into pocket)—functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (salt and nostalgia, machine oil and pipe tobacco, warm concrete) and filtered through Maya's locksmith-gardener perspective, though some phrases ("cathedral of fragrance," "canvas waiting for moonlight's brush") veer toward generic lyricism rather than character-particular perception.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.1)
    The tidal library, stone circle, and brass sundial are vividly described with striking imagery (clouds, celestial tides, atomic reflections). However, these elements function as backdrop rather than constraining choices or supplying resources that alter outcome. Spatial choreography is coherent but the environment does not pressure Mara's actions in any decisive beat. The micro-setting allowance is not met; no tool or recurring object shapes a choice or charges the final image with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lotus temple and lily pond anchor setting vividly with strong sensory detail ("rain kissed petals," "fragments of stained glass"). The thrush's nest as micro-setting object constrains the installation's form and charges the spiral image at closure. Setting supports atmosphere and the public/private thematic tension. Spatial choreography (willow, water's edge, courtyard) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.1)
    The booth's vintage equipment, peeling paint, burnt coffee, ozone, and vinyl records create vivid, purposeful texture that filters through Mara's professional lens. The spectrogram display and turntable needle are handled in scene and contribute to the discovery beat. Spatial choreography is clean (console, charts, transmitter tower), and the subsonic pulse vibrating the needle concretizes the threat. The booth constrains her choice (ancient amplifiers, risk-averse administration) and charges the final image as a "shield" space, lifting this into the 7+ band despite the campus and tower remaining lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.4)
    The church, catacombs, and starlit chamber are visually rendered with purposeful detail ("constellations painted the ceiling," "mosaic of fractured geometry"), and the compass point recurs as a tactile anchor. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though "walls began to close in" is metaphorical rather than a material constraint that alters her path. The nexus setting contributes atmosphere but does not force a tactical choice—she descends, aligns the compass, the door opens. The micro-setting test is partially met: the compass point charges the final act, lifting the score above mid-band despite the lack of environmental friction on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    The quarry setting is evocative ("furrowed hush of stone," "mist coiled between limestone walls") and the ribbon fragment constrains discovery. The studio and quarry return bracket the narrative, and the ribbon's placement in the fissure charges the ending. However, the middle beats (portrait work, vendor scan) lose spatial anchoring and the micro-setting does not alter Elara's tactics; the environment illustrates mood more than it pressures choice.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.1)
    The experimental weather station is anchored early with concrete details (instrument towers, main console, observation deck) and the valley below becomes the spatial crucible where Vance's camp emerges, constraining the librarian's final choice to stand and point. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through urgency: wind "with frozen claws," the scent of "thawed permafrost and something organic and wrong," the ghost camp "emerging like a developing photograph." The copper nail, journals, and monitors function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Minor slip: the director's sudden arrival on the deck lacks spatial choreography (how did he know she was there?), and the station's interior layout remains generic beyond the console and deck.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    Setting details are selective and vivid: pine air, scaffold wrap fluttering as "secret map," moonlight through canopy painting silver patches. The mountain pullout and hidden grove anchor the action spatially, and the scaffold wrap functions as a micro-setting constraint that prompts the protagonist's descent. However, the environment does not meaningfully alter tactics or charge the closure—objects are handled (glass flake, tin box, photograph) but their physical properties do not constrain choice at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.4)
    The circus train supplies vivid recurring images: rusted rails, broken windows, sawdust floor, faded posters, popcorn scent. The foreign bill placed between them functions as micro-setting that charges the final exchange. The train's spatial details (caboose, car, shadows) anchor the conversation clearly. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Leo could refuse or accept the son's plea anywhere—so Q3 remains mid-band despite strong atmospheric work.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.1)
    The observatory setting (brass telescope, wooden ribs, photometer) is vividly rendered and the daylilies anchor the thematic image. However, environment does not constrain a choice—Elara's work proceeds without spatial friction or tool limitation. The variable star data and telegram are handled, but neither object blocks or enables a tactical shift. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, supporting tone effectively, though the setting remains largely backdrop rather than pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    The orchard vortex and cursed lake provide vivid, consistent spatial anchors. The ice block, seed, and expanding circles all constrain tactics: the druid kneels at water's edge, chants to create silver ripples, plants the seed into a crack. The flesh-eating plant's transformation (scarlet vine → red berries) charges the final image with renewal. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through urgency (ash taste, greedy water pull, ice groaning). The environment directly enables and shapes the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.7)
    The cobalt glade and maze topiary clipping anchor the setting with sensory specificity ("leaves still warm with captured sunlight," "hedge walls whispered"), and the mirrored maze functions as micro-setting that constrains Elara's journey. The scar on her palm, the gnarled roots, and the eternal eclipse supply tactile and visual particulars filtered through Elara's visionary lens. However, spatial choreography inside the maze remains abstract—central clearing, two paths, figure from shadows—without concrete distances or physical limits that test movement or choice. The final image of dawn "bleeding across the horizon in ribbons of gold and ash" charges the closure moment but does not constrain the planting decision; setting enables rather than pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.1)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly anchored: tree roots snaking between bones, the Keeper's form "bent like the trees above," packed earth between ribs and femurs. The root functions as a micro-setting that constrains the climactic choice—Elara must kneel and place the card on the thickest root—and the glowing wood charges the final transaction. The half-lit corridors frame the entire descent and return, modulating atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's urgency, though the "roots no longer whispering" on the return could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.1)
    The quarry trailer and valley setting anchor the piece early and recur with purpose. Sensory details—rust, old paper, metal walls, cool air—are filtered through Mara's appraisal mindset and support the tone. The speaker cloth functions as micro-setting, constraining her final choice and charging the closure when she pins it above her desk. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the environment subtly mirrors her isolation and potential for new resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    The magnetic arbor constrains action: Elara must carve cuneiform into its pathways to redirect the field, and the star-iron stylus "sang" as it scored the lines, providing tactile and auditory anchors. The floating groves "sagging beneath their own impossible weight" and the "cavity of absence and refracted starlight" charge the setting with urgency and sensory specificity. The knowledge fruit seed functions as micro-setting, pulsing with copper light and warming with each sign, and its transformation into a flower inscribed with final signs directly enables the closure. Spatial choreography remains clear across the climb, the throne-room, and the descent through trembling branches.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tidal atrium functions as active constraint: flood cycles deliver artifacts, geothermal vents enable partial transmutation, pressure glass frames her watch. The creel (bamboo texture through sensors, river-reed smell) triggers the protocol contradiction and becomes the micro-setting object that charges the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through her brass exoskeleton and fluctuating identity. The "warming stones where tide and geothermal met" provides the exact environmental gradient that enables her compromise solution, directly shaping the closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.9)
    The quartz-dusted walls, sagging bunk frames, and crystal caves are vivid and specific. The caves constrain Mara's movement (she "squeezed through") and the central pillar becomes the locus of the climactic act, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's professional eye (dosimeter clicks, resonant hush). The environment actively shapes the closure, elevating this category near the 8.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.4)
    The disused railway station is vividly rendered (ivy, rust, graffiti, accordion bellows) and anchors the journey. Sensory detail is selective and atmosphere coheres. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop and metaphor rather than constraining a choice or shaping the final departure; Mira could leave from any ruin with similar thematic effect. The accordion's presence is noted but not handled in a way that alters her movement.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glowing library, mist, and spiral staircase are vivid and consistently rendered. Spatial choreography is clear across the forest, library entrance, and descent. However, the setting remains decorative—no environmental constraint forces a choice, and the final chamber's "unspoken words" are abstract rather than tactile. The watch and scroll function as portable objects rather than setting elements that pressure tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.2)
    The velvet observatory at midsummer is vividly rendered with night-blooming jasmine, brass dish, and velvet-draped telescope; these details anchor POV and create a lived-in sensory world. The jasmine plant constrains Lira's final choice by whispering "Plant the seed in the heart of the observatory," directly shaping her action. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the "central garden" appears only at the planting beat without prior establishment. The setting charges the final image and the micro-setting (plant as informant) alters tactics, meeting the 9+ gate criteria for constraint and closure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    The skyborne grotto, aurora pulses, and crystal floor constraining Elara's stance are vivid and purposeful. Sensory detail (green fire, silver thread, radiant hush) is selective and filtered through Elara's professional attention. The emerald chip—handled, aligned, warmed—functions as micro-setting that constrains the capture ritual and charges the final image. Spatial choreography (kneeling at threshold, leaning to void) remains clear. The archive of ten thousand chips anchors scale and stakes without touring.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Umbral Grotto's perpetual twilight, cloud-sea, and terraced vineyard are rendered with selective, purposeful detail that filters through Elara's professional attention. The scalloped hairpin and the antique yew recur with functional weight, and the easternmost terrace where Mrs. Chen's grief pools becomes a micro-setting that enables Elara's sigil-and-witness tactic. Spatial choreography (tree → terrace → cottage) tracks cleanly. The environment constrains choices (overripe clusters must be pruned to avoid tainting the cycle) and the moonlight-filled sigil directly shapes the transformation beat, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lighthouse, wind chimes, and mirror shard are vividly sketched and sensory details (salt scent, jingle, spectrum of light) ground the reader. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; the iron lantern hook and staircase serve as stage-setting rather than tactical obstacles. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    The floating platform, pond, grotto, and starlight create a vivid atmosphere that remains consistent. The platform and water constrain Mira's final choice—she steps off into the pond, using the environment as both medium and metaphor. However, the grotto itself is described but never directly encountered; it pulses from offstage without altering her tactics. Sensory detail leans heavily visual (starlight, shimmer, rings) with minimal embodiment of temperature, texture, or physical resistance that would ground the meditation concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.4)
    The bone towers, canyon, and rose quartz disc are vividly rendered and purposefully atmospheric. The environment supplies the harmonic framework (towers amplify tones, birds signal in flight) that the protagonist interprets, meeting the micro-setting standard. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure; it functions as a stage for revelation rather than a crucible that forces tradeoffs. Spatial choreography is clean and sensory detail is selective, but the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is not met.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound spire's frozen air and cathedral of dying light constrain Vorrin's final choice by preserving the keystone's luminance where algorithms can't reach—setting as thematic pressure. Mist-walk embodies his body dissolving into droplets, grounding the method in sensory detail. The valley mist "not yet programmed" and the balcony of frost establish a coherent cold-preservation logic. Spatial choreography (mountain base → mist climb → balcony → repository top) tracks cleanly. Minor gap: the pedestal's positioning "at the very top" lacks a physical cue for how he ascends within the cathedral.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sunken ship's library and the pier are vividly rendered with purposeful detail ("shelves bowed like the ribs of a whale," "water lapping at his boots"), and the sky lanterns create a coherent atmospheric envelope. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice: Elias swims through the library and surfaces without spatial friction or resource limitation that alters his tactics. The key tag warms and glows but does not function as a tool that shapes the outcome, remaining ornamental despite its recurring presence.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ambered observatory deck recurs with purposeful specificity (resin walls, compressed nebulae, deck shuddering) and constrains Elara's ritual casting of lots. The telescope's brass inscription anchors the backwards prophecy, and the amber walls "glowed from within" charges the final image with evolutionary resonance. Strong setting work lifts the score, though the void-beyond-void telescope moment reads ornamental rather than action-shaping.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory's instruments—meridian circle, sextant, prism, great lens—constrain her method and charge the closure image (scattered light crystallizing the void into a mirror). Dusk's fading sun becomes a tactical resource: she works "until darkness swallowed the sun," and the shift to starlight marks her descent. Spatial choreography is clean (spiral stairs, stone room, brass telescope base). The atlas page functions as micro-setting, its ink and blank void anchoring the final act. Sensory selection leans visual (gold light, blue ice, amber) but serves the POV's task.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sapphire viaduct is vivid and returns throughout: "arches dripping with dew," "shadow met the rising sun," "crystalline arch captured the tone." The dawn light striking sapphire and cascading into water directly enables the bell's resonance, constraining Kael's timing and positioning. Spatial choreography (central arch, reeds, ocean) remains clear. The viaduct functions as both setting and tool, charging the final image when it glows "softly in the morning mist." Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the ritual's demands.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ridgeway, reservoir, mud, and levee station provide concrete spatial grounding. The sapphire label and photographs function as micro-setting objects that guide Nora's path and charge the final writing scene—the lantern casting blue glow across workers' faces directly shapes the closure image. Sensory detail (damp earth, old wood, coyote call) is selective and filtered through her warden's attention. Minor slip: "midnight ridgeway at twilight" is a temporal contradiction that slightly muddies the opening anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    The orchard, waterfall, and silver apples are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (humming apples, singing waterfall colors, bark holding equations). The crystal and flame are handled as tactile objects that constrain the protagonist's ritual action, and the starlings' flight patterns function as micro-setting that charges the final recognition. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The environment does not force a choice but does supply the ritual architecture for the protagonist's insight, meeting the lower threshold for setting-as-crucible. Strong descriptive texture but no decision-altering constraint pushes the score into mid-7s rather than higher.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.1)
    The nocturnal arbor is anchored early with vivid sensory particulars (mist, swaying branches, starlight) and the tether's fluctuation creates spatial coherence. However, the arbor functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no environmental detail narrows the protagonist's tactical options or charges the closure image. The parachute buckle and control interface are handled, but neither object forces a choice based on proximity, access, or physical limitation. Sensory selection (soundless echo, faint vibration) is consistent but decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    The floating rock dojo and formaldehyde jar supply concrete sensory anchors (stone altar, liquid time, crystalline fragments). The dojo's dissolution at closure charges the final image with physical consequence. Spatial choreography is clean (sensei, clones, altar, jar). Deduction: the "vast sky below" and wind are evocative but do not constrain a single on-page choice; the jar's weight and the shattering glass do more work. The setting remains vivid and purposeful but stops short of the 9+ gate (environment must constrain choice or charge the final image decisively).

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    The echo chamber tunnel is established early and constrains Eleanor's tactics: amplification ("turning breath into chorus") is the mechanism she needs. The pull cord handle is tactile and evolves (grows hot, dissolves). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (tunnel below, Sarah above at sink, later in hallway). The autumn setting and leaf-blower callback anchor memory without becoming static postcards. The tunnel's concrete walls and groundwater texture the ghost-world without over-description.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.2)
    The frozen garden, mist, and pendant provide recurring anchors, and the ice/stone tablets constrain movement. However, spatial choreography remains abstract—"between dimensions," "courtyard," and "garden" float without clear boundaries or physical layout. The pendant's role as lens and the ice as archive create micro-setting pressure, but the environment never forces a concrete tactical choice that alters outcome. Sensory detail leans heavily visual and conceptual (geometry, angles, glyphs) with minimal tactile or temperature grounding despite "frost" and "frozen." The guardian's body and the pendant qualify as micro-setting elements that recur and charge the final image, lifting the score into mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ember nexus at twilight is established early and twilight recurs as a charged temporal state ("it would always be twilight"). The broken crozier functions as both tool and constraint—its destruction enables the transmutation. The "frozen bloom" final image concretely embodies the story's paradox. However, spatial choreography remains vague; we never learn the physical layout of the altar, nexus, or Elara's positioning within the space, which weakens the setting's ability to guide movement and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    The abandoned radio tower city, lunar perigee gravity, and gorge create a vivid, purposeful setting that pressures Mira's work. Concrete details—rusted ladder, moss grooves, swaying platform, copper wire—ground the action and reflect her practical methodology. The tools (amplifier modules, waveform analyzers, listening crystal) constrain her approach and are handled on the page. However, the "hundred spires webbed with cable" and gorge remain largely atmospheric; they do not alter her final choice as directly as the shard and equipment do.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ferry hull, wheelhouse, empty hourglass, and spectral grotto are vividly sketched with selective sensory detail (damp rail, sideways clock, silver starlight threads). The grotto's walls hum in harmony and starlight pools in hollows, and the empty hourglass warms and glows, charging the final image. However, spatial choreography during the merge—"three places at once: the dock, the grotto, and the sea"—remains abstract; we do not see how Lina's body or the ferry's physical constraints shape her radio transmissions or securings. The setting constrains choice lightly (the grotto must be reached, the hourglass positioned) but does not force a tactical trade-off that alters the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Optical Illusion Gallery is vividly rendered with concrete, purpose-driven detail: impossible geometries, stairs that descend into the floor, mirrors that crack and scream. The gallery constrains Mira's actions (weaving patterns, threading sinew through depicted corridors) and the upward-flowing water charges the climax. Spatial choreography remains clean throughout, and the final image—mirrors showing "only depth without reflection"—reconfigures the setting with thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.4)
    The benthic city, dome, airlocks, and thermocline establish a coherent underwater world, and the anchor link recurs with tactile specificity (corroded, pitted steel). Spatial choreography is legible across moves. The micro-setting (anchor link as star map) charges the final teaching moment, satisfying the 9+ gate in principle. However, the city itself remains backdrop; no environmental constraint (pressure limits, failing seals, resource scarcity) alters Mara's tactics or sharpens a choice, capping the score below 7.0 despite vivid detail.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mist-clad atrium is vividly rendered through sensory detail ("pillars loom like ghostly sentinels," "surfaces slick with dew") and the hearing aid functions as both tool and micro-setting, constraining the protagonist's perception. The photograph on the bench and the broken window anchor spatial choreography clearly. The atrium atmosphere modulates with pressure, supporting the tonal shifts from eerie curiosity to medical urgency. However, the hearing aid's mechanics—how it distinguishes or confuses living and dead pulses—remain vague when they should constrain the protagonist's interpretation at the key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    The flooded facility, tidal window, and phase-transition chambers constrain every move: Marek must sync entry with the forty-seven-minute air pocket and retreat before drowning. The codex (gold flecks warming, then cooling) tracks invisible residues and charges the closure image. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Marek's augmented perception ("electromagnetic ghostprints," "glaciers calving"). Spatial choreography remains coherent across moon pool, corridors, and server cradle. The undersea-cable setting informs world logic but does not directly shape a peak choice beyond serving as the data repository.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.1)
    The opal observatory, snow, server room, and terminal are anchored early and maintained. The porcelain shard functions as micro-setting, present in her pocket and used twice (pressed to screen, then "went cold"), constraining one choice and charging the closure. Sensory selection (ink veins, soft chime, faint pulse) reflects urgency. Small penalty: the "midnight glow" and "quiet curtain" veer toward stock phrasing in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.4)
    The bone towers, canyon, and tunnel are vivid and mythically coherent. The tunnel's "throat of polished calcium" and "fossilized thunder" create sensory texture filtered through the storyteller's copper resonance. However, the setting primarily serves as backdrop; spatial choices do not constrain tactics. The diamond is pressed to the wall, but no alternative surface or access problem shapes the attempt. The spinebirds' flight is observed from a distance without proximity or wind affecting her stance. Micro-setting (her body, the copper veins) charges perception but does not alter a key choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.1)
    The underground garden supplies vivid images (moonwort, vines coiling, frostbitten crust) but remains a backdrop rather than a constraint that shapes choice. Spatial choreography is vague—we never learn layout, exits, or how the arrowhead "unlocks a door in the air." The recurring "frostbitten hope" and "gravitational playground" motifs are atmospheric but do not pressure a single on-page decision. Late in the story, the garden "erupts in laughter" without prior sensory build that makes the personification earned.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.1)
    The enchanted orchard and sky-bridge are vividly anchored with sensory detail: ash falling, iron orchard, clockwork gears, granite eyes. The locust shell functions as micro-setting, constraining Elara's final choice by providing the rhythm pattern. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the orchard's magical rules are consistent. Entering the high band requires that setting constrain a choice or charge the final image; the locust shell does both, and the orchard's "roots deep in old magic" surge through the bridge at closure, reweighting the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt arcade is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (neon veins, ozone smell, forgotten coins) and returns at the ending to frame the mailman's watch. The setting functions as a neutral zone that enables the drop, thereby constraining the action window, and the final neon shadows charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (rooftop, fire escape, alley, arcade entrance). The bottle itself acts as micro-setting, glowing and crackling, and its storm masks the drone—meeting the constraint test for high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: "peeling paint, shattered mirrors," "rust-eaten corridor," "cracked glass" filtering sunlight. The hidden garden car and silver spring constrain the halo fragment's location, shaping Silas's path. The final image of the spinning carousel and breathing train charges the closure. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the train's maze. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, filtered through the lyric lens rather than a close third-person urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=5.1)
    The scientific poetry library and hyperbolic-geometry shelves are vivid and specific, anchoring the voice in surreal detail. Spatial choreography (stacks, threshold, pedestal) is legible throughout. However, the setting remains decorative: the non-Euclidean architecture does not constrain a choice or force a tradeoff—it simply opens when the scarf is folded. The zeroth volume's chamber and "frozen sound waves" charge the atmosphere but do not alter tactics or cost. The library breathes and sighs in the final image, but the effect is metaphorical flourish rather than a pressure point tied to the protagonist's options.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.1)
    The whispering archipelago and watercolor palette constrain the librarian's attempts: islands arrange themselves, palette wells fill with hours of light, and the painted bridge dissolves in real time. These details are filtered through allegorical perception and shape tactics. Spatial choreography (volcanic rock, water's edge, channel) remains clear. The empty well charges the final image, qualifying for the 9+ gate test, but some setting elements (mist, palms) remain postcard-pretty without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.4)
    The shadowed nexus, starlight, and twilight setting are vividly rendered and establish a coherent atmosphere. The first star (Venus) functions as a constraint that times the ritual and shapes the locksmith's action, satisfying the micro-setting criterion. Spatial choreography is clear (alley, pawnshop roof, cobblestones), and sensory detail is selective and purposeful. However, the setting's impact on choice remains light—the nexus enables the ritual but does not meaningfully constrain or complicate it, and the recurring star imagery, while resonant, does not force a difficult tactical decision.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sunken greenhouse and shipwreck constellation are vivid, purposeful, and constrain Elias's method—he must climb rusted masts, measure angles through broken glass, and place the mushroom at the precise vertex. The bioluminescent mushroom matching lagoon plankton charges the closure image. Sensory detail (salt, spores, cracking ice) is selective and integrated. The "missing seventh sister" detail elegantly seeds and pays off the central puzzle, making the setting indispensable to the plot's geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.1)
    The library (moss-covered stone, marble floor, reading table, window) provides spatial grounding and the recurring swing image charges the final image with resonance. The shard, teapot, and parchment constrain the archivist's annotating action concretely. However, the library itself does not force a tactical choice—setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure source. The swing's outside presence is more lyric echo than spatial constraint, keeping the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.9)
    The verdant parapet and waterfall are vivid and recur, but they function as backdrop rather than constraint: the waterfall's mist and spray are poetic elements, not resources that alter Vespera's tactics or choices. Spatial choreography is unclear—scale, proximity, and the mechanics of "weaving liquid into threads" remain abstract. The setting does not pressure a single decision on the page. Sensory detail leans heavily on color and light metaphors (violet, amber, silver, gold) without grounding in tactile or embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prism sanctuary is vividly rendered (fractured walls, spectral geometry, starlight refraction) and returns at closure ("hung the empty net across the sanctuary doorway, where starlight could pass through"). The net itself functions as micro-setting, though its physical properties (weight, texture, spatial position) remain generic. The pearl at the ending charges the final image but does not constrain a prior choice. Setting details are filtered through Elara's professional lens (mask restorer, tapestry needle) but spatial choreography during the unraveling is vague—where she sits, how she moves, how the net is positioned. Meets the 9+ gate narrowly via the net and starlight at closure, but lacks the tactical constraint needed for the high 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rain-scoured fresco vault and the henge stones are vividly rendered and return with reweighted meaning at closure. The fresco's "rectangular seam" that becomes "slightly more pronounced over the years" supplies the key discovery, and Elena's tactile engagement ("pressed her palm," "feeling the textured history") grounds the moment. The micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) test is satisfied: the fresco vault constrains the search and charges the final image when rain washes the hillside again, preserving the whispers.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sunken library setting is vivid and functional: anemones, dissolving pages, coral threads, and the brass chest all supply tactile detail filtered through Cassian's analytical gaze. The snow globe itself acts as micro-setting, constraining his attention and shaping the final choice to pack it carefully. Spatial choreography (porthole, instrument case, ascent) remains clear. The environment charges the closure image—"leaving the library to its slow return to sediment"—and the globe's physical properties (density, viscosity, refractive index) directly enable his method of study.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.1)
    The misty courtyard is vividly sketched with sensory detail (mist, thunder, stone walls blooming with graffiti). However, the setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no environmental feature pressures a choice or alters tactics. The flower press bolt plate, mentioned repeatedly, is never handled in a way that changes the outcome; it glows decoratively at the end. The courtyard's suspension "above the clouds" remains a postcard image rather than a spatial pressure that shapes the balladeer's or scribe's moves.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    The frozen spire is vividly rendered with purpose: ice walls scatter light to enable the encryption, altitude matters for refraction, and the elevator's climb structures the revelation. Sensory detail is filtered through Kai's professional attention (geometric precision, brass polish). The goggles function as micro-setting, constraining Kai's ability to read until the impulse to wear them at the fifth floor. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The final image—goggles on the empty desk—charges the closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain choice or shape the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.1)
    The gondola at twenty-three degrees tilt, brass telescope, and manual recorder constrain Mara's final actions (she must use the chute, can only record manually). Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered: "metallic whisper," "dusty starlight," "clicking like insect wings." The cloud formations function as micro-setting, charging the closure when "acceptance" envelops the gondola and it "settled, finding a new equilibrium in the arms of the cloud"—the sky physically holds her station, literalizing her thesis. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting drives the core choice (record for the sky, not rescue) and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.4)
    The tree-trunk library is vivid and anchors early. The coin's tactile indentations and the "faint ridges transfer a hidden blueprint" moment provide micro-setting detail that drives one key action. Spatial choreography is clear (stacks, wall, book safe). The demolition timeframe pressures the frame, and the scent of "old paper and fresh paint" charges the final breath. However, the setting does not constrain a choice at closure—Kael's walk away is unopposed—so it misses the 7+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.1)
    The antique airship is vivid and recurring: brass fittings, wooden hull creaking, humming in approval. The dusty hopscotch board constrains Elara's discovery method and the Whispering Crag's "stranded luminance" charges the ending image. Starling murmurations frame time and atmosphere across multiple beats. Minor slip: "porthole," "chart room," and "deck" anchor space, but the spatial relationship between chart room and deck remains vague during the hopscotch discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.1)
    The frozen library and hall of mirrors are vividly described ("crystal shard embedded in the sky," "hauntingly bright luminescence") but function as backdrop rather than constraint. Spatial choreography is loose—she "ventures deeper" and arrives at locations without navigating obstacles or using environment to solve problems. The uncapping of the gear and insertion into the mirror keyhole involve objects, but the library's frost, shelves, and mirrors do not pressure her choices or alter tactics. Sensory selection lacks POV filter; details read as catalog rather than lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.1)
    The floating rock arches and butterfly garden establish vivid setting, but they function as backdrop rather than constraining choice. The watering bell's mechanics (droplets spiral upward, fill hidden reservoir) are described but never complicate tactics or introduce friction. Spatial choreography is clean in individual beats, but the micro-setting doesn't pressure the central conflict—the bell simply works when rung, and the orchard thrives without visible environmental resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.2)
    The lighthouse, spiral stairs, circular room, and ocean-as-mirror provide spatial anchors and vivid sensory detail (sunset bleeding, ocean forgetting waves). The "pane of hush" recurs but functions as metaphor rather than constraint; it does not alter a choice or tactic. The puppet head is handled across multiple beats (pocket, spindle, dissolution), meeting the micro-setting test for object-as-setting, which lifts the score into the 6-band. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.1)
    The cliffside orchard, labyrinth, and mechanical birds constrain every choice: nut placement at the sundial stone, shadow alignment, frost timing, and bird patrol patterns all function as spatial and temporal anchors. The nut's microscopic grooves and the bronze birds' clockwork eyes provide tactile, specific detail filtered through Elara's practiced attention. The environment charges the final image: "the cursed orchard above them...poison in the fruit...balanced by the precision of the shadows." Micro-setting (the nut, the sundial stone) acts as setting at this length and directly enables the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.1)
    The braided ravine is vividly anchored with sensory specifics (foam arabesques, dual channels, river merge). The foam's transient geometry constrains Elena's research insight and charges the final lab image. Spatial choreography is clean across ravine and lab. Micro-setting via chrysalis and polymer film also shapes closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement of environment constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.7)
    The glass orchard library and swirling clouds establish vivid spatial anchors, and the vendor's bottles function as recurring objects that organize the scene. Sensory detail (glimmering parole, clinking bottles, glass floor) is selective and voice-filtered. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or pressure a decision—the library floats as backdrop rather than shaping the vendor's tactics or the woman's transformation. The bottles' physical handling remains light; they are described and uncorked but their material properties do not alter the outcome, capping the score below high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.1)
    The coral icebound pavilion and tidal pools provide vivid, purposeful setting that constrains the chef's ritual: "each pattern was a memory fossilized, a moment of regret hardened into geometry." The desert fortress frames the opening and closing, and the eastern dunes supply spatial coherence. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered—"metallic, cold, with undertones of stale bread and ash"—though the pavilion's "groaning" and draining pools do charge the final departure. The body (hands, tongue, heart) functions as micro-setting throughout, meeting the 9+ gate test by constraining touch-based choices and charging the closure image of kneading.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.1)
    The astronomical clock tower, grain elevators, and borrowed starlight anchor the world with vivid particulars and purposeful recurrence. The brass weight (engraved with wheat sheaves) ties setting to action when Elara places it in the belfry. Spatial choreography remains clear across vertical (tower) and horizontal (elevators, stage) planes. However, the elevators' constraint is decorative: they "talk across the fields" but never block a choice or alter tactics; the railroad tracks are mentioned as a divider yet never tested. The setting charges the final image but does not pressure the protagonist's path.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.1)
    The moonlit canyon supplies vivid sensory details (phosphorescent minerals, ozone breath) and the broken mirror recurs, but neither constrains a choice or alters tactics on the page. Setting functions as backdrop for philosophical meditation rather than shaping agency. Spatial choreography is vague—she stands "at the canyon's rim," then "at the canyon's edge" with no intervening movement or clear geography. The periscope and mirror exist but are not handled in ways that test physical limits or enable/block action.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (mist, condensation, serpentine spine, inverted gravity revealing hidden alcoves). The grotto's environment supplies concrete resources (hidden alcoves, glyphs visible only under prism light) that affect the protagonist's ability to complete her task. Spatial choreography remains clear through the chase and threshold leap. The prism and manuscript return in the final image, charging closure with a faint rainbow reminder of hidden layers.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.7)
    The alder grove is anchored with sensory specifics (slender trunks, moss, alder cones) and the porcelain sculpture's stress cracks are vivid. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the sculptor's tactics—she wanders, discovers, and strums without spatial friction. The hedgehog and distant animals add atmospheric detail but do not pressure the protagonist's moves. The setting serves as a resonant backdrop rather than an active constraint, keeping the score below the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.1)
    The magnetic nexus is vividly rendered ("lodestone gravel where compasses spun wild," "humming ground") and micro-setting (the basalt stone's dent) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear: Kael sits, correlates pulses, releases the stone into gravel. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("purple twilight," "silver dust"). The nexus constrains Kael's ritual and supplies the resonance he translates, meeting the 9+ gate criterion of environment shaping choice and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.4)
    The shadowed workshop under stars is anchored early with vivid, purposeful detail ("shadows pooled like ink," "worn workbench"). Sensory elements (radio crackle, starlight spill, fireworks overhead) are filtered through Mira's focus on silence and frequencies. The workshop's tools (tuning forks, vintage radio, diary clasp) are present but function more as thematic props than constraints that alter her tactics. Spatial choreography is clear (workshop interior, door opening, sky visible). The setting does not force a choice at closure; instead it provides atmosphere that supports the thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.1)
    The treetop village, perpetual mist, and canopy details establish vivid atmosphere. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's olfactory focus (jasmine, sulfur, corpse flower's "pungent breath"). However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint meaningfully alters a choice at closure. The seed and mortar are handled on the page, but their mechanics do not pressure tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent but lacks the micro-setting detail that would force a trade-off or charge the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The floating-arch planet, gravity inversion, and irrigation streams detaching into silver ribbons create a vivid, purposeful setting. Sensory detail is selective: temperature drop at the threshold, whirling silence as centrifuged sound, and the seed cyclone inside the arch. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout the glider flight. The arrow tip and seed function as micro-setting elements that constrain Kael's final choice—she must touch the scarred seed to access the archive—elevating the score into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.4)
    The container labyrinth is vividly established with selective sensory detail (rusted walls, haze, echoing boots, venturi effect). Spatial choreography is coherent across ground-level and catwalk vantage points. The wind patterns constrain her methodology and drive the survey action. However, the setting does not charge the final image—she simply drives away—and the labyrinth's pressure dissolves once she leaves, missing the opportunity to reconfigure meaning through environment at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ice cavern pressures the ritual (sculpted hush as weight) and the aurora provides the color palette Lyra requires. Sensory detail is vivid but somewhat catalog-like; the bells' arrangement and the glowing ice create atmosphere without deeply constraining a tactical choice. The sculptor's marble studio lacks spatial grounding—his location relative to the cavern is never clarified. The amber music sheet is handled twice but its warmth and glow serve symbolic rather than mechanical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Thunder-echo range is vividly rendered with sensory specifics—"gravel that sang like broken glass," "bruised purple" sky, "forest of stone pillars"—and the canyon hush modulates with the flute's silence. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric; it does not constrain a key choice or charge the final image with causal pressure. The driftwood markers function more as symbolic guide than tactical resource, keeping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.1)
    The topaz workshop is vivid in color and light but remains atmospheric wallpaper. Stars vanish in sympathy, walls pulse, shadows shift—yet none of these details constrain Cassian's choices or alter his tactics. The halo fragment and letterpress are described but not handled with tactile specificity that would ground the transposed-empathy mechanics. Spatial choreography is vague; the mathematician and poet appear and depart without legible movement.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway is vividly rendered with strong visual economy ("blade of light," "green curtain"). The pendant is handled twice (pressed to earth, handed over) and its vibration grounds the magical logic. The setting modulates from transport corridor to sacred ground, supporting the thematic shift. However, the ridgeway does not constrain the courier's choices—no environmental obstacle or social pressure tests his intent to deliver the envelope or give away the pendant—keeping the setting atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.9)
    The quartz arbor, mist, frost patterns, and abandoned Volvo are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Seraphine's scientific attention. The prism's warming and the frost's geometric spirals constrain her communion attempt and charge the final image of the arbor seeming "less solid." Spatial choreography is clean. The setting does not cap at 8.8 because while the prism and frost are handled across beats, the quartz arbor itself functions more as atmospheric backdrop than a constraint that alters a key choice.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    The orchard and loom are vividly anchored with selective, purpose-driven detail ("bamboo forest where silence grew thicker than the morning mist," "candlelight while the amber bead rested on the warp threads, casting shadows like trapped fireflies"). The loom itself functions as micro-setting, constraining Mei's method and charging the final image when it empties. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The piece does not exceed its length's needs, and the setting's sensory texture modulates with scene pressure (deepening hush, dawn breaking). The forgotten orchard's sigh and the falling plum at closure provide a concrete environmental response that charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating arches, azure dust, mine shafts, and heart-chamber supply vivid anchor points that guide Ren's descent and shape the barter's staging. The magician's silk "lifting like a breath" in the chamber and the final image of arches "floating blue against the sky" charge the closure. Spatial choreography in the mine (spiraling deeper, fourth day, heart-chamber) is coherent. The orchards themselves remain somewhat abstract—roots and blossoms appear but the lived texture of tending them does not constrain Ren's early choices, keeping the setting functional but not fully tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.9)
    The spaceport repair bay supplies atmospheric detail ("rusted hull plates," "cracked concrete") and returns at closure ("quiet sanctuary"), but it does not constrain a single choice. The shard's location in a "shadowed corner" and the rift beneath concrete are stage dressing; Lira's weaving would function identically in any abandoned setting. Sensory selection is present ("metallic memory," "low murmur") but filtered through generic poetic phrasing rather than POV-specific bias. The body and tools are abstract: "invisible threads" and "weaving" lack tactile specificity, and no environmental feature alters tactics or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lantern room and cairn are established early and return at closure; the sea glass and bottle function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and mood-driven (salt crust, briny air, moss-covered rocks). However, spatial choreography is loose—cairn placement relative to the lighthouse is vague, and the ghost's "warmth" is atmospheric rather than constraining Caleb's moves. The setting supports tone more than it narrows choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.6)
    The emerald lighthouse, glass wick with total internal reflection, and shadowed echoes offer vivid, specific anchors that recur and charge the mood. Spatial choreography is coherent (lighthouse, sea, approaching ship). The wick's mechanics (crystal shard, hollow channel, starlight capture) constrain her routine and shape one middle choice (adjusting the beam's angle). However, the "digital fog" and "old radio" are ornamental contrasts that do not alter tactics, and the opening newspaper detail vanishes after serving as atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.7)
    The floating rock tea house, valley mist, and blue morpho wing dust supply vivid atmospheric particulars and the setting's aerial isolation charges the liminal tone. The microscopic structures and sun trails through the window anchor the master's method in spatial detail. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; the tea house's reported drift "higher since the master's transformation" is told rather than used. The setting functions as richly drawn backdrop rather than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.1)
    The stormlit tower, spiral stairs, and garden with glowing trees are vivid and purposeful. The sextant—"brass limbs twisted, glass lens cracked," "smelled of salt and stardust"—functions as micro-setting and constrains the moonlight-healing beat. Sensory detail is selective (distant thunder, humming air, rustling leaves) and filtered through Elara's maintenance-worker familiarity. The hidden map on the wall and the sealed door provide spatial stakes that guide action, lifting the score above postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.1)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly established (obsidian glass, fermenting apples, copper scent, silver-leaved trees). The mica window constrains one key choice (placement against the wall reveals threads) and charges the ending when it shatters, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. Deduction for minor over-reliance on color adjectives (silver, amber, rose) that decorate without altering tactics mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.9)
    The bookstore setting is anchored with specific details (water-stained ceilings, "Philosophy—Obscure" shelf, hidden door, cash register) and the midnight timeframe creates atmospheric pressure. The crumpled invitation functions as a concrete object that Mira handles across multiple beats, giving it physical presence. However, the "corridor of light" and "Society of Nestled Paradoxes" remain abstract; we never learn how the door works, what triggers its opening, or what spatial rules govern the hidden library. The body and immediate environment (moonlight through dusty window, highest shelf) do constrain small choices, and the final image of the lined corridor charges the ending, lifting the score into the 6-7 band.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    The secret tea house, overgrown courtyard, and sensory details (frost-nipped streets, moss on fountains, wet earth smell) are vivid and integrated into Mara's action. The stone-hard bread and the act of crumbling it with a stone give tactile specificity that grounds the ritual. The courtyard's ivy, yew tree, and flagstone cracks constrain and enable Mara's guerrilla gardening, shaping her method and the congregation's gathering. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout, and the setting charges the final image (public garden, autumn bread offerings) without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.1)
    The frozen library and quartz hush create vivid atmosphere, and the magic lantern slide offers a recurring concrete object. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop: the chief's actions are not constrained by ice, altitude, or the architecture in ways that narrow his options or alter tactics. The ending claims the shelves "respond" with renewed strength, but this shift is asserted rather than shown through spatial or sensory specificity that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rotting pier and subterranean market create vivid, purposeful constraint: the protagonist must navigate between "those who lived below the pier and those who sailed above." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—slick timbers, salt, moonshine lanterns, wet planks—and the antique watch fob's match to the hidden lock charges the final image by making setting an active puzzle element. The spatial choreography (beneath boards, slipping back, vanishing into shadows) remains coherent. The "final hour before sunrise" functions as both time anchor and pressure device, elevating the setting's causal role.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lavender bluff, aurora, and forest root-networks create a vivid, cohesive micro-setting that constrains Elara's sensory method and charges the final image. Specific details—"iron and forgotten summers," "tin compass ring hammered from decommissioned orbital," "coat of living moss that breathed condensation"—anchor the world without catalog excess. The tin ring functions as both tool and setting-constraint, shaping Elara's sensory access to the vote. Spatial choreography (bluff edge, ridge, descent) remains clear. The setting's recursive mentions (lavender, aurora, taste) reweight at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vividly rendered (humming crystals, mineral-dripped painting, damp floor) and constrains Elena's choices: she hides there to escape art, the crystals remind her of inescapable calling, and the natural alcove conceals the charcoal. Sensory detail is selective (low hum, faint light filtering from above, soft scratch on stone) and filtered through Elena's artist POV. The cave functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—tomb becomes womb—and the stone surface she sketches on ties setting directly to closure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. No gate failures; the environment actively shapes tactics and the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.8)
    The greenhouse city, toxic sky, and archive chamber are rendered with vivid sensory detail (bruised sky, sour air, brittle reels). Setting enables the search—the water-reclamation plant houses the archive—and the guard scene uses spatial staging to apply momentary pressure. However, the environment does not constrain the protagonist's final choice or charge the closure image; the studio and greenhouse serve as backdrop for the transcription without altering tactics. The zinc fragment is handled twice but functions more as talisman than tool that shapes outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bluff, iceberg fragment, and kinetic sculptures supply vivid, purposeful detail filtered through the tuner's mission. The fragment's blue glow and the sculpture's twilight performance charge the final image effectively. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite the abstract setting, and the altitude's "strange magic" keeping ice between thaw and freeze grounds the fantastical element. Sensory hierarchy is strong—light, wind, metal, and ice dominate as the work demands—though the villagers and workshop receive minimal concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dome setting constrains choice effectively: fire-suppression protocols create the safety-override loophole, glass walls contain the burn's geometry. The fear-box and its contents (clock spring, moth wing, photograph) function as micro-setting objects that charge the closure. Sensory detail is filtered through android perception: "ceramic joints creaking," "static crawled through circuits like sand." The desert roses serve as both setting anchor and pressure gauge (weeping golden sap during magnetic interference). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the burn sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.2)
    The courtyard at dawn is vividly rendered ("apricot and rose," jasmine, mosaic benches, cobblestones) and recurs across key beats. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (eastern corner, north side jasmine, terra cotta pot). However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the key discovery beneath the pot and the mailbox's rusted lock are the only moments where environment materially constrains action. The vibrant courtyard motif charges the final image ("colors more vivid now"), but does not shape a middle choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sunken laboratory supplies vivid anchors (rust, green diodes, iron taste, a hundred fathoms) and the spider's web becomes a recurring image that charges the final paragraph. Spatial choreography is clean for a single-character scene. However, the lab's constraints never visibly limit Lyra's choices—she moves freely, and the security camera is passive. The setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure; removing the depth or replacing "sunken" with "isolated" would not alter her tactics or the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.1)
    The salt crystal chamber and gravity pockets constrain Kael's movements (steps drag, breath crushes/floats) and supply the mechanism for memory recovery, directly shaping the climax. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "metallic" salt air, "cotton wool soaked in starlight," lilac scent refracted from the crystal. The dock's spatial choreography is clear. Gravity as micro-setting charges the final image when pockets "quiet" and flames point "true north." Minor deduction for occasional postcard phrasing ("gleaming silence," "fractured light") that decorates more than it constrains, and for the whale's role being more thematic backdrop than lived environment.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.1)
    The nocturnal brook setting constrains Elias's method (upstream placement, narrow log span) and charges the final image (the changed song). Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through his summoner's attention (moonlight on paper, water syllables, moss texture). The cranes function as micro-setting instruments that alter the environment's meaning. Spatial choreography is clean across all placements along the brook's course.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    Setting detail is vivid and selective: bergamot and old paper in 7B, antique desk seal on the windowsill, rooftop tomatoes in salvaged chimney pots, sealed basement with nurses' graffiti. The western corner's dusk sigh, water damage as lament, stairwell asymmetry as question mark all filter through Alex's architectural fascination. The seal—handled twice (windowsill, pressed into plaster)—and the basement wall constrain the final choice, lifting the score. Minor drift: the rooftop meteor shower, while atmospheric, does not alter tactics; it times the ritual rather than pressuring it, keeping the category shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.1)
    The velvet garden is anchored early with vivid, recurring sensory detail (phosphorescent moss, velvet petals, resonance structures) and the twilight-to-dawn timeframe creates spatial and temporal coherence. The garden constrains Elara's choice by requiring her presence at a specific liminal moment and charges the final image when it "held both of them now." Micro-setting succeeds: the seashell and the petals function as tactile anchors that shape her final kneeling gesture and release.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.9)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, and stalactites are vividly rendered and establish a strong sensory baseline. The heritage rose thorn functions as both tool and recurring object, and the hidden altar mechanism provides a spatial constraint that Elara must navigate. The setting charges the final image through the pearl twilight motif, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. However, the environment does not force a mid-story tactical choice; it serves primarily as atmospheric backdrop until the climactic altar interaction, which limits the setting's role in shaping escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.1)
    The serpentine canyon and starlight are vividly rendered through repeated figurative language, but the setting remains postcard description—it does not constrain a single choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The seashell, though handled multiple times, functions as a passive collection device rather than an environmental element that pressures decision. Spatial choreography is clear, and the "throat that swallowed starlight" offers strong atmospheric texture, elevating the score modestly despite the lack of tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.7)
    The glacier shrine and wreck are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (ice cracking "like glass," ribs "jutting like broken promises"). Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the transition from shrine to shore to wreck interior compresses without tracking Maya's physical movement or time elapsed. The pristine snow globe's discovery in a sealed cabin supplies the key object that charges closure, so the micro-setting (the hidden compartment) constrains and enables the turn. Scope is appropriate; occupational wreck-diving detail is light but sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.1)
    The parapet and fireflies anchor atmosphere effectively, but setting remains largely decorative. The bamboo whisk and moon paths are described rather than constraining choice; net-mending by moonlight is asserted as method but never dramatized with tactile specificity or spatial consequence. No tool, body position, or environmental detail alters tactics at a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    The wasteland orchard functions as both setting and pressure point: its impossible thriving drives Elias's investigation, the geothermal vents explain the anomaly, and the orchard's "impossible greenness" frames his final decision. The radioactive dust storms, mulberry roots, and the diamond's physical placement in the council chamber all constrain choices and charge the atmosphere. The conversion of setting details (soil warmth, bee behavior, storm deflection patterns) into investigative clues demonstrates purposeful integration rather than postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cobalt glass portico, parabolic dish, and storm-wracked platform are vivid and purposeful, anchoring Atlas's isolation and the transmission work. The setting provides tactile detail—"greasy smell of vacuum tubes," "pocked like a moon"—that grounds the scene. However, the observatory functions primarily as backdrop; the environment does not constrain Atlas's choices or alter his tactics. The final image of the abandoned observatory and ships arriving uses setting to charge closure, lifting the score into the mid-6s despite the orientation delay penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.1)
    The feral loft beneath dunes supplies recurring sensory anchors (sand breathing through walls, rotting ladder, damp corners) and the jar collection constrains her final choice to open them. "Dawn's earliest whistle" recurs to charge the ending image and structures the temporal frame. The glass jars function as micro-setting that evolves from beach detritus to glowing archive, directly enabling the climax action. Spatial choreography remains coherent (ladder, pallet, floor). One subtraction: the tourist beaches and boardwalk cafés are mentioned but never pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drift-ice marina constrains her planned escape ("the marina's ice had shifted, locking the boats"), forcing adaptation. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "frozen kelp," "crystalline fist," "rose-gold glass." The key's bronze teeth and the whalebone flute function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image when their "duet of protection" forms the harmonic solution. The setting's sonic properties (ice singing, floes as "frozen tongues") are integrated into the climax and coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.7)
    Basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly established and sensory detail is filtered through Elara's professional lens (pressure ridges, lunar azimuth, magnetic flux). The viaduct's polarity shift after rain is specific and purposeful. However, spatial choreography during the climax—Elara on the ice, lights flickering on the far shore, enforcers on the viaduct who "fear the ice"—remains abstract; the enforcers' position and threat never materially constrain her movement or choice, reducing the setting's pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    The subway tunnel is vividly rendered with rust patterns, dripping water, scuff marks, and loose bolts that directly enable Mara's discovery. The lantern's chipped glass and the Underground Railroad etching ground the space in historical specificity. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The environment constrains choice (evidence is physical, located) and the final image of water rising charges the political metaphor, meeting the 9+ gate test for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    The workshop is vividly rendered with selective detail: dust motes, slanted light, hundreds of silent music boxes, velvet cloth, brass and steel tools. Spatial choreography is clear (behind counter, turning the box, placing the heart on cloth) and the setting constrains action—Marlowe must work with what he has in the shop. The repair process grounds the thematic exploration in tactile specificity, and the recurring image of light through storm clouds charges the final beat, giving the setting a functional role beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.1)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop on an acid sea supplies vivid, purposeful detail: phosphor-coated grease, brass camshafts, the hissing hull. Sensory selection is economical and filtered through Zephyr's occupational lens (glider, kaleidoscope translator). The arrow tip's microscopic grooves and the kaleidoscope's prismatic quartz are handled, not merely described, and the workshop's buoyancy shift toward toxic clouds charges the climax. The acid sea recurs at the ending to anchor the final image, qualifying as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.4)
    The archive setting (humming servers, backup tapes, vault) anchors the investigative action and supplies resources (the corrupted data blocks, the sealed vault). The mission patch functions as a micro-setting object that recurs and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective but leans visual; other senses (the mournful hum of tapes) appear briefly. The patch constrains her choice to preserve it and enables the final gesture, meeting the 9+ gate partially, but the city and apartment are postcard backdrops without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lighthouse orchard, ice floes, and vintage store are named and spatially clear. The mirrors function in the middle sequence, and the crystal fragment is handled across beats. However, sensory detail remains generic: "amber pools," "frost-etched windows," "dust hung in sunbeams" read as stock imagery without POV-specific perception. The environment does not constrain a tactical choice at closure, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.4)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (ice groaning, pale gold light, creaking pilings), and the cold environment pressures the protagonist's physical experience. The recurring lace parasol tip appears in multiple beats but remains largely decorative; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (dock, ice, boathouse), and the frozen setting charges the final moonlit image, though the effect is more atmospheric than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    The amber pavilion and autumn vineyard receive vivid sensory treatment ("wooden beams glowed like honey," "fermenting grapes and woodsmoke"), and spatial choreography remains coherent across fire pit, trellises, and table. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental feature constrains the sentinel's choices or alters his tactics. The vines' "reluctant union" and "mismatched pairs" are observed but do not pressure the protagonist's actions at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.1)
    The murmuring pavilion, whisperfield calm, and kinetic parapet are named and described across multiple beats, but none constrains a choice or alters tactics—sand recedes when summoned, stone responds without friction. Spatial choreography is vague (pavilion "at the edge," parapet "beneath," clearings "around") with no legible distances or evolving micro-setting. The recurring motifs (murmuring, clearings, parapet pulse) charge the atmosphere but do not pressure the walker's path. Sensory detail leans heavily visual ("moonlight," "glimmer," "shimmering thread") with minimal tactile or auditory specificity beyond repeated "murmuring."

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.1)
    Lavender field and factory ruins are vividly rendered ("rusted factory ruins," "corroded steel," "purple rows"), but setting remains postcard description rather than constraint. The flat stone altar and dove gray map case are handled across beats, qualifying as micro-setting, but neither object alters a tactic or charges the closure image with new pressure. Spatial choreography is coherent; sensory detail is present but not filtered through urgency or character-specific professional bias.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    The library is lived-in and functional: broken chandelier (source of crystal), locked doors, weak dawn light advancing each day, dust motes like letters. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The crystal's weight and facets are handled on the page; rotating it isolates decades. Minor limitation: the "shadowed library windows" and "cathedral ceiling" anchor scale but not distinct navigational detail within the space. The crystal-as-micro-setting constrains Elias's method (rotating facets, whispering into it) and charges the final image when he returns it beneath the chandelier.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.1)
    The junkyard garden is vividly realized with rusted VCRs, rebar sculptures, and Betamax shells; fog modulates perception and the chalk/driftwood constrain his search method. The "Birthday, 1994" cassette provides a concrete anchor that charges the midpoint. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the fog thickens to frame the climax. The setting does not force a choice but actively shapes the prophet's tactics (arranging markers, kneeling at the spiral site), meeting the micro-setting test for the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.2)
    Spatial anchors (lunar observatory, workshop, sensor plate, back panel of chronometer) are present and the leaf functions as micro-setting, triggering the shutter at a precise instant. The sensor plate and escapement gears guide the solution, elevating setting beyond postcard. However, the broader lunar environment (clouds, black sky, gravitational whispers) remains decorative; no environmental constraint visibly narrows Kael's options or alters his tactics during the adjustment beat.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.1)
    The solarium with clouds below and the vinyl shard as micro-object anchor the space effectively. Sensory detail—antiseptic air, morning rain, old vinyl perfume—is present but leans decorative rather than constraining choice. The hospice setting frames the stakes but does not pressure Elara's or Lena's decisions at the peak beat; the environment remains backdrop rather than crucible. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.1)
    The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle and the fractured sky are vivid, anchoring the reader early. Sensory details (brass glinting, low hum, luminous lattice) are purposeful and integrated into action. The automaton and key function as micro-setting elements that constrain Elara's method, and the noon-shadow phenomenon charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, though the world's "impossible colors" and bent-reality premise remain decorative rather than pressuring choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.1)
    The secret garden and hedge maze anchor the final scene with vivid, purposeful detail (morning glories, cracked sundial, moss-covered bench). The telescope aimed at blooms rather than stars charges the closure image by reweighting the "constellation" motif. However, the quarry and MacLeod estate exterior remain generic placeholders. Spatial choreography is clean and the garden's hidden status subtly mirrors the suppressed truth.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.4)
    The serpentine grotto provides atmospheric grounding (mist, stone walls, wet sand) and the sea glass is handled on the page (lifted, dipped, rubbed). Spatial choreography is clear: grotto to cliff path to village square. The polishing pool and flat rock enable the central action. However, the grotto does not constrain choice or complicate Mira's mission; it functions as picturesque backdrop rather than pressure. The "pearl of stillness" placed on the pedestal charges the final third but the setting itself remains static.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned data center is vivid and specific: moss on server racks, bee hives in rack-mount slots, wild honey, dripping condensation, shattered glass constellations. Spatial choreography is clear, sensory detail is filtered through Elara's focused attention, and the environment subtly mirrors her healing arc. The micro-setting constrains her daily ritual and charges the final image of moss patterns, meeting the 9+ gate. Only minor limitation: the setting's physical details don't force a tactical choice at closure—they enrich but don't pivot the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.8)
    The feral nexus and mist anchor the setting early and recur throughout. The shell is handled twice (raised to lips, pressed into earth), which offers micro-setting function. However, the environment remains atmospheric backdrop—no door, tool, or terrain choice narrows the protagonist's options or alters tactics. The final image involves the shell-as-seed, but the nexus itself does not constrain the planting decision; the protagonist could perform the same act anywhere misty.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.4)
    The verdant arbor at dawn anchors setting early and supplies the tendril as a recurring micro-object. Sensory detail is selective (pale blush, cool bark, silver moonlight) and POV-filtered through Elara's tinkerer lens (toolbox rattle, old copper scent). The arbor constrains the ritual spatially but does not force a tactical choice—Elara always has access. Spatial choreography remains clear across the gathering scene, though the shift from solitary morning to evening crowd skips the transition work.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.1)
    The withered orchard in a subarctic crater is vividly anchored with skeletal trees, brittle leaves, and frozen silence. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric ("liquid mercury," "crack of ice"). The copper plate and the grove's ancient stones are integrated into action, and the cabin's glowing windows provide spatial closure. The environment does not constrain a mid-scene choice—paths and props appear as needed—but the final image (warm cabin) charges the resolution, lifting the score into mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    The marble cavern is vivid and specific: condensation-sweating limestone bench, veins channeling vibrations, six/twelve/eighteen-degree angles mapped across beats. Tuning forks, rose quartz lenses, and the broken timer are handled tactilely across multiple beats, and the final image—angled light dancing on the workbench—charges the closure. Sensory detail is selective (sound, touch, sight) and filtered through the locksmith's craft lens. No significant setting inconsistency or white-room drift; the environment supplies resources (marble's acoustic memory) and the micro-setting (workbench, lenses) constrains tactics, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bronze grotto with copper veins, melting snow patterns, and kerosene lamp burner supply vivid, recurring anchors. The lamp's "brass wick-holder twisted into a shape that remembered fire" and the "shingled hush" layering silence offer strong textural specificity. The burner constrains her calcification ritual (she must orient it toward stars, turn her back to darkness), charging the final image when the sphere glows with "whalebone light." Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.4)
    The rain-beaded skylight, kettle, workbench, and quartz prism anchor the loft vividly. Sensory detail is selective: rust-hued light, chamomile scent, ash wood texture. The kettle's whistle functions as a temporal marker, and the skylight droplet offers a charged micro-image at midpoint. However, none of these environmental features constrain a choice or shift tactics—the carving proceeds unobstructed. The final placement "beside the window, where the light could catch its mane" charges the closure image modestly but does not reweight stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.1)
    The kinetic lagoon and frozen carousel create vivid atmosphere, and the camera wheel functions as a tactile anchor. However, the environment remains postcard-descriptive; the lagoon and carousel do not constrain choices or supply resources that alter the protagonist's tactics. The setting charges the final image but does not pressure the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.7)
    The abandoned terminal is anchored early with concrete detail (cracked tiles, rusted pipes, dust-covered festival flyers). Mira's engineering actions (rerouting water, scavenging solar panels) integrate setting into her problem-solving, and the sextant's geometry constrains her transmitter design. However, the environment does not narrow her choices under pressure or charge the final image—she completes each task without setback, and the terminal functions as backdrop rather than crucible. Sensory detail remains selective and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    The crystal forecourt functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: its crevices accept the gears, its whisper responds to placement, and the "glacial hush" deepens as the ritual proceeds. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (petrichor, pre-dawn light on facets, oil and metal mixing). The forecourt's spatial choreography is clean—Elara kneels, places gears in crevices, stands—and the environment charges the final image when sunlight illuminates the gears and the forecourt "sang." No occupational depth is required here; the engraving tools are mentioned but not used, appropriately economical for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.6)
    The twilight canal, barge deck, moss-covered stone, and phosphorescent chamber are vivid and consistently rendered. However, setting remains postcard description; the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The hidden latch opens without resistance, the chamber reveals itself without navigation difficulty, and spatial details serve atmosphere rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    The golden dock, fog, and lantern light are vivid and selective, filtered through Elara's focus on the rope. The fulgurite glass—a concrete, recurring object—constrains her method and charges the climactic revelation. Sensory detail (snowflakes landing with "soft clicks," salt-stiffened coils) modulates with urgency. The micro-setting (rope, glass, dock) shapes the final image and the decoding action, meeting the 9+ gate criteria for environment constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.4)
    Autumn garden anchors early with concrete sensory detail (moss-covered statues, dark fountain, golden leaves). The weft thread recurs across multiple beats but remains decorative; it does not constrain a choice or charge the final image with new meaning—merely dropped as symbolic offering. Setting provides atmosphere but does not pressure decision or supply resources that affect outcome, limiting the score despite vivid description.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.7)
    The suspended palace anchored to giant stalactites is vivid and consistent throughout. Sensory detail is present (tremor of chains, grinding gears, hissing steam, stale air) but filtered more through catalog than POV urgency. The palace's response to the creature's song—groaning, shifting stalactites, quaking—constrains the final image and charges closure. Spatial choreography is clean. The mechanical city below provides contrast but remains backdrop rather than constraining a choice. The cradle and its assembly are detailed but do not impose a meaningful tactical limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.1)
    The obsidian lagoon, black sand, and driftwood log provide atmospheric detail, but they do not constrain a choice or charge the final image in a way that alters tactics. Sensory selection is present (kelp scent, warm sand, orange rays) yet remains decorative. The coin pressed into sand and the protective circle gesture toward micro-setting use, lifting the score slightly, but neither object changes what Maya can or cannot do at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.1)
    The forgotten fountains anchor the setting early and return charged at closure, shaping the dominant stake. Spatial choreography remains clear across alleys, bridges, and plaza. Sensory detail leans visual and generic ("rust colored evening," "cobalt, amber, and crimson"), missing the micro-setting constraint test: no tool, body limit, or environmental pressure narrows Kael's choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.7)
    The nebula garden is vividly rendered with phosphorescent pollen, quantum loam, recursive bloom, and spectral descent. Setting functions as computational space—petals as bits, garden as Turing machine—which constrains Elara's approach (encoding memory into petals). Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the scale and physics of drifting/falling remain impressionistic. The recurring petal imagery charges the final image, and the gear as micro-object constrains her solution, meeting the 9+ object test. Sensory detail leans heavily visual/conceptual; tactile and auditory specifics are thinner.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.1)
    The greenhouse is vivid and purposeful: glass corridors, corpse flower, orchid leaves with stone dust, monarchs bending light. Spatial choreography is clean across evening visits. The setting constrains Kael's search by creating a ritual space distinct from the village, and the monarchs' departure signals closure. Time of day (dusk) and seasonal migration frame pressure. The greenhouse functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when Kael traces empty flight paths, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tidal obsidian ridge constrains the discovery window ("only until the water reclaimed the ridge") and the inscriptions along the rake handle physically require light angle and close study, both shaping Elara's choice under time pressure. The tower's stones "settle into true alignment" at the end, giving the setting participatory weight at closure. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through POV urgency ("foam hissing between glass shards," "obsidian to burning mirrors"). The volcanic grooves, salt spray, and pendulum bob function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image and constrain action.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt silo is vividly anchored (metal skin, curving walls, dust, starlight) and returns at closure. Spatial choreography inside the silo is clean. However, the cemetery grounds and the chess-clock opening remain disconnected from the silo action—no causal bridge links them—and the silo itself does not constrain a choice; it functions as backdrop rather than active pressure. The final star-pulse and velveteen gloom charge the atmosphere but do not alter tactics or options.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    The obsidian spire, frozen lake, and ice bridge are vivid and purposeful: the bridge's fragility constrains borehole angles, directly shaping Kaelen's solution. Sensory details—"breath crystallizing," "sun broke the horizon, turning the ice to burning gold"—are selective and POV-filtered. The kingfisher quill and pattern stones ground her method in tactile, world-specific tools. Spatial choreography (summit → spiral stairs → council chamber) tracks cleanly, and the setting evolves causally (spire becomes "a beacon rather than a watchtower" as geothermal warmth radiates).

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.7)
    The ember alcove, mist, scarred desk, and radio dial glow are vivid and sensory. The setting provides mood and frames Mira's isolation, but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics in a visible way—Mira works undisturbed, the mist presses but does not intrude, the alcove shelters without cost. The dial glow is handled multiple times and charges the final image, lifting the score, yet the environment itself remains backdrop rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.1)
    The Vanishing Point Gallery and the old rocking chair supply evocative anchors, and the mask's porcelain shards catch light in a purposeful detail. The gallery's "vanishing point" motif charges the final image when "the vanishing point swallows the last of the light." Spatial choreography is coherent (pedestal, gallery, exterior street), but the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome, capping entry to the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sunken city's layered ruins—sewer tunnels, sediment strata, drowned basilica, plague graves—are vividly drawn and filter through Malach's archaeologist-philosopher lens. The cog itself, handled and filed across multiple beats, functions as micro-setting that constrains his choice and charges the closure. Spatial choreography is clean (two hundred feet of brick, the niche behind loose bricks). The phosphorescent fungus lamp and the brick dust in his throat anchor sensory immediacy without catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.1)
    The velvet library and autumn light anchor setting early and recur purposefully; dust motes, drapes absorbing daylight, and the blown leaf pressed between scores provide sensory specificity filtered through Mrs. Kaelin's attention. The rosette's carved voids function as micro-setting, charging the final image when Marco receives it. Spatial choreography (students filing in/out, Mrs. Kaelin at the lectern/desk) remains clear across time jumps, and the velvet library frames both opening and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.7)
    The rusted greenhouse is vividly rendered with "metal ribs bleeding orange," and the spatial anchors (broken bench, cracked glass, soil) remain stable. Sensory detail is filtered through Mara's synesthetic perception (taste of memories, scent of chlorophyll). However, the environment does not constrain a choice or meaningfully shape the closure image—it functions as evocative backdrop rather than tactical pressure. The 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is not met; cap at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lightning collection tower with its ceramic spires, copper receptors, and spiral stairs supplies concrete spatial choreography and constrains Mara's climb. The "nectar dusk light" and "amber emergency lights" create a coherent visual palette that charges the final image when amber light flows into the city. The booth, gearwork, and chamber details are lived-in and purposeful, and the honeycomb's placement on the central plate directly enables the ending's reweighting of routine into wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "quiet bay in spring" and "streetlights daydream" recur as atmospheric labels but never constrain a choice or supply resources. Spatial choreography is vague—houses, shoreline, thresholds, and an oak are visited without legible transitions or cumulative pressure. Sensory detail is generic and decorative ("amber pools," "hushed blaze") rather than filtered through urgent perception. The orris root shard and displaced objects appear as talismans without tactile handling or evolving physical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    The drowned garden is vividly rendered with coral-encrusted statues, foxgloves, green twilight, and the dome's eggshell-fragile eastern quadrant. The structural weakness (crack in the dome) directly enables Petra's threading action and charges the ending when foxglove roots finish the work decades later. Spatial choreography is coherent: Petra at her pedestal, the crack, the garden responding around her. Sensory detail is selective and atmosphere-consistent (violet light, water currents, stone textures). The micro-setting (ampoule, chain, crack) functions as a constraint that shapes the central choice and recurs with reweighted meaning at closure, meeting the 9+ gate for environment-driven action.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    The infinite staircase constrains every choice: Elias cannot rest (becomes architecture), cannot rush (madness), must count and roll dice to navigate. The step-geometry heals itself, the sun neither rises nor sets, and the glitch-step is the only spatial rupture—each detail pressures tactics. The chipped die's micro-setting (clatter against stone, 0.003% bias) charges the final image when the three-face lands. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through mathematical obsession (nanometer precision, corrupted pixel, cosmic indifference).

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.7)
    The rooftop greenhouse, smog-choked city, and moonlight are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (amber haze, saffron quiet, indigo ink mixed with crushed starlight). The greenhouse functions as sanctuary and provides the moon-access required for the brush, constraining when Kael can work. Spatial choreography is clear across the greenhouse and later the derelict factory wall. The final image returns to the greenhouse under the waxing moon, charging the setting with thematic weight, though the body and tool do more causal work than the room itself.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.1)
    The grotto, waterfall, and limestone corridors are vivid and atmospheric, and "rosewater scent" recurs to anchor tone. The emerald-tinted lens constrains one action (focusing sunlight), meeting the micro-setting standard. However, spatial choreography is vague—Liora moves "through damp corridors" and "deep in the grotto's heart" without clear distances or layout, and the climactic scene (loaves around the harp, shaft of morning light) lacks concrete staging. The waterfall's spray and the cavernous kitchen are postcard details that do not pressure choices.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse and its lantern room are vividly rendered and constrain the protagonist's action: she must work in that space, at the moment the tide turns, aligning the yoyo with the gear train. The "slow exhale of low tide" recurs as a sensory and temporal anchor, and the hunger stone's pulsing presence in the lantern room charges the climax. Micro-setting (brass plate, iron ribs, gear train) is integral to the solution. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the clockmaker's professional lens. The island and sea remain impressionistic but sufficient for this length, and spatial choreography is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.1)
    The funhouse setting supplies mirrors, footprints, and skeletal architecture that guide Mira's path, and the "corrupted gold" luminance provides atmospheric texture. However, the space doesn't constrain a choice—Mira walks in, walks to center, asks the question, walks out—so the micro-setting test for 9+ fails. Sensory hierarchy (visual dominance of oily sheen and glowing footprints) reflects the fantastical POV but other senses remain thin during the peak confrontation. The carnival's "bruised twilight" and "plywood grin peeling" are vivid but function as postcard anchors rather than tactical pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating orchard, driftwood ring, and xylophone structure are vivid and specific. The mallet (whale's rib, kelp wrap) and the fractal ripples charge several beats. The orchard's spatial choreography remains clear across the sequence, and the blue-hour light reweights the final image. Environment constrains the prophet's method (must work from the driftwood circle) and the setting participates in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    The turtle-shell city is established early and anchors spatial choreography throughout. Old Merra's shell becomes the site of discovery (crevice with whistle) and the canvas for Kael's carved question mark, directly shaping the closure image. The rusted gate, the watchers on the horizon, and the breathing rhythm of the turtles all constrain and enable Kael's choices. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Kael's cartographer lens (calcium swirls, spiral geometries, salt taste). The highest point and the seventh turtle frame the climactic whistle blow.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ivy-wrapped station is vividly established and returns at closure (ivy "whispering secrets," fireflies among vines), creating a purposeful early-to-final reprise that reweights the abandonment motif. Sensory details are selective and atmosphere is consistent. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Emlyn moves through the space without spatial friction, and the setting functions primarily as symbolic backdrop rather than active pressure. The rosebush bookends provide thematic charge but remain ornamental to the action layer.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    The submerged pavilion functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: seaweed-slick stairs, barnacle-covered mosaics, salt-corroded mortar, and the shuddering pillar all impose tactile obstacles Elias navigates with bolted rungs and crowbar. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through his professional gaze (measuring tape, hydraulic lime, crushed shells) and the water medium (green-filtered light, silt clouds). The antique inkwell and waterproof ledger anchor the present-tense work across multiple beats. The final night scene on the parapet and the swim to embed the cornerstone charge the closure image with spatial and atmospheric specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sunken library, murky water, oil lantern, and silt-filled vault anchor the setting vividly and early. The lantern's sputtering and Mira's need to readjust the wick provide tactile pressure in one beat. However, the environment does not constrain her final success—the blackout lifts at the moment of resolution, removing obstacles rather than forcing a choice under duress, preventing the setting from charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glass basilica, tea garden, and floating island are vividly rendered ("spires catching light," "night-blooming jasmine"), but function as backdrop. No environmental detail constrains a choice or charges the final image; the basilica's "descending while ascending" spiral is named but never used tactically. The leaves turning to glass in the penultimate paragraph is decorative rather than causal. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating observatory, geode, and scanner constrain choices concretely: Kael steadies herself against the scanner during tilt, the geode warms in response to the pool, and the transfer slot is used under a live clock. Sensory detail is purposeful ("sound like distant thunder, or distant bombs," "heavy and cold and perfect"). The dead zone and high-altitude current supply spatial pressure. No cap applied; environment charges the final image when starlight passes through the geode's "crystallized ghosts."

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ancient observatory, brass orrery, and stellar environment are vivid and purposeful. Dusk's "brilliant dimness" charges the atmosphere, and the matrix chip's warmth and the orrery's locking mechanism constrain Elara's actions across multiple beats. Spatial choreography (colonnade sprint, chamber entry, pinion sequence) is clean. The star trails guide her choices, qualifying as micro-setting that shapes tactics. The final image—camp under wheeling stars—reprises the setting with thematic weight, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.2)
    The cobalt terrace and forgotten shore are named but not concretely anchored in sensory detail or spatial choreography; the transition between them is abrupt and ungrounded. Driftwood carvings and the watch hand recur, but neither meaningfully constrains a choice—the protagonist sifts passively until the plaque appears. The watch hand's symbolic charge at closure ("a reminder that time… could be mended") is asserted rather than demonstrated through action. Cap at 7.0 per Orientation Test.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.1)
    The storm-worn parapet, mist, moon, and causeway are vividly rendered and filter through Kael's professional attention. The moon phase governs timing and the causeway's reveal, constraining the exchange window—this qualifies as environment shaping choice. Spatial choreography (narrow ledge, wind, gravel crunch) remains coherent. The antique drawer pull and rope gain tactile weight, and the setting charges the final image of the empty parapet as silent witness.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    The coastal kayak launch, utility poles, and fog are concretely rendered and pressure Elias's navigation choices. The compass returns with reweighted meaning at closure (needle spins, then points inland). Sensory detail is purposeful: "salt spray," "transformer humming," "barnacled rock." The sixth pole and cannery pilings serve as spatial waypoints that guide the final choice. Micro-setting (the rock where he places the compass) charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.1)
    The bioluminescent lake is vivid and recurring (lines 1, 13–14, 24, 31), and the phosphorescent algae guides Kael's path (line 15), shaping one navigational choice. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (room → bridge → tunnels → cavern → elevator), though the sterile room's return (line 26) creates a minor teleportation slip. The lake charges the final backward glance (line 31) with a "silent promise," lifting it into micro-setting territory. Sensory detail is selective but leans visual; the "antiseptic and forgotten water" smell (line 2) anchors early, yet under stress in the cavern (lines 23–24) no heightened sensory narrowing occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.1)
    The orchard supplies vivid images (moon-cinnamon bark, star-anise, ghost-pepper) and a distinct atmosphere, but it never constrains a choice or complicates a tactic. Spatial choreography is vague—beasts gather, the whisperer walks rows, yet no physical obstacle or environmental pressure impinges on the ritual. The recurring spices and moonlight motifs remain ornamental, present at setup and closure but without causal weight. The setting functions as mood rather than crucible, preventing high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    The midnight glade and cracked saucer are vivid and purposeful: the glade dissolves once its ritual function is complete, and the saucer's crack serves as both metaphor and tactile anchor. Sensory detail is selective ("mist curling around her knuckles," "pink fingers through the cloud-floor") and filtered through the cartomancer's ritual focus. The saucer constrains her final gesture (she places it on the deck as a weight) and charges the ending, meeting the 9+ gate test for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.1)
    The *Compassion's Tear* functions effectively as micro-setting: "molecular tape," "salvaged alien tech," and "recycled gravity generators" constrain Maya's embodiment and become the medium for her transformation. The observation deck and quantum core provide purposeful spatial grounding. The ship's alarms and gravity failure at the climax charge the final beats. However, the "locked dimension" remains abstract—no sensory texture distinguishes it from the ship's reality, reducing its pressure on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    Black sand, sulfur, volcanic steam, and tidal pools are vividly rendered and filtered through Kael's practiced attention ("thirty years of collecting"). The crimson bug's unusual light and the synchronized pulse of the collection charge the final image, and the bottles function as micro-setting that constraints the release action. Spatial choreography is clear across the beach, treeline, and village below. The celestial bodies remain atmospheric rather than tactically constraining, but the volcanic seeps and black sand pressure Kael's path inland, meeting the 9+ gate of environment shaping choice and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    The luminous fort, phosphor lights, and eastern magazine create a coherent nocturnal setting that enables Seren's movements. The sundial and bronze quill holder anchor two key problem-solving beats. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the transition from sundial to magazine to commandant's desk compresses geography. The blackout itself functions as micro-setting, narrowing visibility and forcing reliance on memory and touch. The final image of the quill holder "frozen in a smile of complicity" charges the closure, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.1)
    The tidal bluff, aurora, and frictionless sea are vividly rendered and filter through Elara's attention (star dust reacting to the aurora, eels surging). The setting enables the rock-placing and eel-pattern mechanics. However, the environment does not constrain a choice with visible consequence; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure. Micro-setting (painted rocks, dust pouch) charges the final image but does not alter options mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.7)
    The observatory above clouds, storm, brass instruments, and darkroom timer establish vivid atmosphere and anchor the vigil. The timer's tick and the storm's pulse recur purposefully, and the old bus timetable with the envelope functions as a charged object. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—rain, wind, altitude, visibility do not alter tactics—and the final descent is mentioned but not staged, so the setting charges mood without forcing action. Sensory detail is selective and poetic but not filtered through immediate urgency or professional priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glass atrium, brook, sundial, and needle card are vividly described with concrete detail, but they function as stage dressing rather than constraints that shape choice. The sundial's "coded angles" and the card's "etched patterns" are mentioned in multiple beats, yet neither limits Rhen's options or alters his tactics—he simply decodes and proceeds. The brook's murmur bookends the piece as atmosphere, not pressure. Spatial choreography during the duel remains clear, meeting baseline requirements, but the environment does not charge the final image or enable a forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rusted library under stars recurs purposefully: roof peeled back, moonlight casting "silver ribbons across rust," final image as "rusted cathedral." The setting constrains action (scavenging nails, painting walls with quotes) and charges the closure metaphor. Spatial choreography is clear within the library; the coffee tin's false bottom is tactile and functional. Sensory detail leans visual ("luminous fracture," "shimmered with fractured light") with less texture from sound, touch, or smell during high-pressure rebuilding beats.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.1)
    The station's skeletal glass-and-steel frame, the battered upright piano, the film archive, and the tidal arbor are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (yellowed keys, rusted strings, silver branches, moss-covered platform). The arbor's "bark humming with a low, resonant frequency" and the storm raging below establish a micro-setting that charges the final performance. Spatial choreography across the airship ascent and arbor landing remains clear, and the environment constrains the protagonist's refuge, meeting the 9+ gate for setting pressure on closure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ridge as setting constrains the central action: blooming flowers "turned toward him," the fissure "where limestone remembered the sea" becomes the planting site, and the stone's "language of sediment and time" charges the climax. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered (spectrograph readings, equation-white flowers, memory-light). The monsoon functions as both temporal pressure and atmospheric payoff. The micro-setting—copper wire nest, spider silk, stone fissure—materially shapes the ritual moment.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.1)
    The islet, dock, courtyard, and conservatory are anchored with sensory economy (mist "like unspun silk," tide pools, cedar table). The compass, lace pattern, juniper, and pigment constrain Mara's wire-wrapping choice and charge the final image where the compass points to the tree. Micro-setting (the objects as tactile environment) successfully shapes ritual action. Light through lace revealing "hidden contours" provides a purposeful sensory moment that enables the teaching beat.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse and its flood scars are vivid and specific—mossy stone path, concentric watermarks, colonizing mold—and the observatory dish’s decay patterns elegantly echo them. Setting is strongly filtered through a scientist’s eye, so details feel particular rather than generic. The environment mainly charges perception and theme rather than constraining concrete options, which keeps it just shy of the very top band. Still, the recurring greenhouse/orchid/butterfly imagery substantially charges the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    The canyon, stars, frost, and furnace are specific and sensorial enough to create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that supports the themes of light, glass, and silence-as-canvas. Environment meaningfully shapes options: the canyon offers concealment, the frost encodes a path, and the underground furnace concretizes the father’s legacy. Recurring images (stars, frost, glass, resonance) effectively mirror internal states without becoming muddled. A bit more tactile interaction with space under physical duress (post-stabbing) could deepen the functional constraint, but the setting still does real work.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    The winterglass conservatory is vivid and functionally crucial: the glass both houses them and becomes the literal resonant surface for Mara’s experiments, with frost and heat-signatures shaping the “score.” Details like the crackle of heating and frost patterns are specific and filtered through Mara’s sensibility rather than generic winter imagery. The setting constrains tactics—her music depends on that particular glass and environment—and it charges the final image of the conservatory as “cathedral.” A bit more tactile interaction with the space under stress could push this even higher, but it’s already strong and integral.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    The drowned city and impossible library are vivid, specific, and tightly integrated with the premise: air pockets, pressure-bent shelves, and the twilight atrium are not postcard details but the literal mechanics of “between worlds.” The environment constrains options (they survive only via trapped atmosphere, the work can only happen in the atrium) and charges the final image of the undertaker becoming part of the library’s architecture. The world rules—impossible currents, half-air spaces—are consistently strange in a way that supports the liminal theme. The setting’s specificity is crucial enough that the story would collapse without this exact underwater-library concept.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    The terra-cotta arbor, ridge, moonlight, and storm create a distinct, consistent atmosphere, and the bell functions as a recurring object that charges the final image. Sanctions-era scarcity, lantern light, wet clothes after the storm—these details feel tactile and grounded. The environment occasionally shapes action (the storm, the ridge guiding volunteers home) but more often serves as evocative backdrop than constraint. Still, specificity is strong enough to support tone and theme without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    The twilight viaduct, fog, blooms, iron rails, and arches are vivid and consistently integrated into Mira’s experience. The setting evolves with the emotional arc—the arches glow, blooms “breathe,” the fog lifts with her clarity—and Kwan Yin’s tear refracting light ties micro-setting to theme. Environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, but it does shape the ritualistic feel of her actions and charges the final sanctuary image. The specificity is strong without feeling like a tourist catalog, and the atmosphere supports the story’s meditative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    The living bridge garden is vivid, specific, and utterly integral: its hyperbolic geometry and organic architecture are not mere backdrop but the mechanism by which time is folded and Elara is absorbed. Details like “cedar arches intertwined with willow-bark pathways that pulsed with sap” feel both sensory and conceptually loaded. The environment constrains and enables choices (her mapping work, the containment of infinite memory) and charges the final image of visitors touching bark. World rules are consistent within the story’s speculative frame, and the setting’s logic culminates in the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    The abandoned carnival is vividly and economically rendered—the rusted carousel horses, stale popcorn smell, cracked linoleum, and prize redemption center create a distinctive atmosphere. Setting directly shapes action: the hidden vault beneath the floor, the brick wall, and the chain’s physical constraint all govern tactics and outcome. The environmental decay mirrors the parched world outside and the theme of resilience without being over-explained. The final image of planting in dry earth with carnival ghosts watching meaningfully recharges the earlier imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse and ring of shipwrecks are rendered with striking, specific imagery that shapes tone and concept at every step. Environmental elements (black water, ash, aurora, nutrient bath, rusted hulls) are not postcard scenery; they are the mediums of memory and silence, and they charge the final images of the device sinking and the ships “leaning closer.” The world’s rules feel internally consistent for a surreal setting, with the forge and ash operating as plausible magical-tech artifacts. While the space doesn’t tightly constrain tactical choices, it fully charges the premise and ending.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    The “emerald station,” copper sky, and moonlit tiles are vividly drawn and recur in charged ways, especially in lines like “the emerald station by moonlight stood silent, its tiled walls reflecting a mosaic of light and memory.” The setting supports the tone and concept of captured light, and the bench and platform give enough spatial grounding. Still, the station functions more as atmospheric backdrop than as a constraint on Lux’s choices; nothing she does would break if the locale were swapped for another suitably poetic transit hub. The environment charges the final images but rarely shapes tactics, which keeps this level strong but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.1)
    The abandoned control room, dam, and thawing reservoir are vividly rendered and intimately tied to Marek’s perceptions as a glassblower and widower. Environmental details—frozen gauge at forty-two percent, leaks bleeding onto Lena’s chair, frost on the railing—do real thematic and structural work, not just atmosphere. The setting directly shapes his tactics (using meltwater, using the control room as studio and sanctuary) and charges the final image of the gauge flicker. Specificity and integration are at an elite level for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    The rusted library beneath a transparent dome is vivid and specific, with recurrent details like the railing, shelves, and maintenance hatch shaping what Mira can do. Her fear of heights and the visibility of the starry void through the hull translate the environment into a real constraint on her choices.

The atmosphere of decayed knowledge and watching stars supports the story’s mood and identity-question without feeling like a generic SF backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.5)
    The fort on the storm-tossed ridge, pebble shore, and single star are vividly sketched and recur in charged images (the fort as silhouette against the void; the last star vanishing). Details like “pebble shore whispered with the memory of waves” and “cold stone walls breathed a marbled hush” integrate atmosphere with the central silence motif. The setting mainly shapes tone rather than constraining action, but it strongly charges the final images. Spatial and temporal anchors are always clear.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    The frozen courtyard at twilight and the transparent ice violin are vividly realized, with selective sensory detail (frosted statues, bruised purple sky, spectral ribbons of light) that supports the tone. Setting evolves meaningfully as the loops distort geometry and ice crystals form glyphs, so environment feels active rather than backdrop. The final image of the melting violin and water circle charges the scene’s physical space with conceptual weight. Weather and cold are more atmospheric than constraining of choice, so the setting stops just short of fully governing tactics.

    The crystal forecourt after rain, the whispering sculptures, and the lens as an object all give the setting a distinctive, cohesive atmosphere that brackets the story (opening and closing). The environment doesn’t much constrain choices, but it does charge the final image with a shift from discord to harmony. Sensory detail is selective and mostly purposeful rather than touristic. The world feels gently uncanny yet coherent, supporting the tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.5)
    The manor’s garden maze and the firefly-lit twilight create a strong, consistent atmosphere that mirrors Silas’s age and the luck theme. The cracked marbles and the stone table at the maze’s heart provide concrete anchors and a charged final image. However, the maze itself never meaningfully constrains movement or choice; it operates more as a lyrical backdrop than an active pressure. World details about the luck gauge and soil remain mostly conceptual and could be further dramatized through interaction with the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: frosted copper valves, polar orbit over Kepler-442b, crystalline Aurelians shaping the magnetosphere, and the twilight nexus all feel specific and functional, not decorative. Environmental constraints (the 27-minute window, station power routing, magnetic fluctuations) directly shape what’s possible. The recurring imagery of frost, twilight, and beating wings charges the final image with accumulated resonance. This world feels both strange and operational in a way that would be immediately publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    The flooded opera house and lantern-lit pit are vividly rendered and consistently woven into action—the water, stands, and seats literally map the code and respond to notes. Environmental changes (water patterns, dimming lanterns, emergence of emergency lights) track causally with the musical ritual and charge the final image. The opera house’s ruin/restoration arc mirrors the piece’s movement from mourning to possibility without overstatement. A bit more tactile interaction with the difficult physicality of a flooded pit could push this into the very highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.0)
    The mountain weather station, instruments, scale, and aurora are all concretely rendered and strongly fused with mood and theme (measurement vs. unmeasurable truth, external weather vs. internal turbulence). Setting details are perspective-filtered—the professional apparatus and the aurora’s “sorrow” both feel like things this specific oracle would notice—and they recur in ways that charge the final image of the dawn. The environment also lightly constrains options (isolation, reliance on instruments) even if no hard physical predicament is staged. A slightly stronger sense of the station as a working space—how her duties pull against or complicate her introspection—would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    The abandoned train tunnel and the sub-basement are rendered with strong sensory specificity (“damp concrete breath,” “spectral cotton dust”) that consistently reflect Elias’s perception and aim. The beaded valve wheel functions as a micro-setting object that literally opens space and charges the final image, satisfying the constraint/closure test. Spatial relations (rails, junction, door, looms) stay legible and evolve with the plot. There is some density of metaphor, but it mostly serves a unified industrial-ghost atmosphere rather than feeling ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting work is vivid and specific: overgrown library, moss-covered spines, roots cracking stone, obsidian pavilion by the river, and the ink-pool candle chamber all feel tactile and tonally unified. Environment meaningfully charges the story—the decay of the catacombs defines the problem, the river refuge shapes her tactics for recovery, and the final river image recharges prior material. The world rules for the origami tunnel are simple but consistent within this dreamlike frame. A broader range of sensory modalities beyond visual and abstract “silence” might deepen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: Sage Ridge’s cedar scent, weathered steps, and the east wing room frame the hospice as both ordinary and liminal. The eclipse and “beneath the hush of dreaming roots” motif charge the environment with subterranean presence that literally “rises to meet them,” directly shaping the climax’s feel. The keepsake curl and guitar function as micro-settings/tools that carry into and color the final image. This is rich, selective worldbuilding that supports tone and theme without devolving into static description.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    The reclaimed silo library, bronze cylinder, dust, and “metallic scent of old rain” create a vivid, tactile environment that feels singular. Setting is tightly integrated with concept: a former grain silo now stores memory; its walls literally hold the last dreams. The medieval tapestry and ventilation draft are not postcard details but recur to charge the final image of dragons “from mind to wall to thread.” While the environment doesn’t sharply constrain physical choices, it strongly charges the thematic and conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the “finger pointing at guilty stars,” pre-GPS charts, lamp room, bilge, and ferry all feel lived-in and tonally coherent. The lighthouse and island are not mere backdrop: the beam, currents, espionage microdots, and isolation concretely shape her options and the story’s logic. The final shell-as-microdot-map image tightly fuses environment, tool, and theme. A touch more direct physical constraint (e.g., weather or access) could push this even higher, but what’s here already charges the story strongly.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is striking, specific, and functionally integrated: a monastery as “dimensional anchor,” a bell that has never been rung, the bell tower as a sort of studio/exorcism chamber, and silence as a tangible medium. Environmental rules (anchor, realities, acoustic/silence manipulation) are learned through action rather than exposition, and the anchor’s groan at the climax shows the world exerting pressure. The final image of the monastery “hung between breaths” recharges the opening and ties environment directly to the thematic outcome. This is near top-tier atmospheric work with both mood and constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, mirrored horizon, and dawn light are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the music-making—a world where architecture and weather become instruments. Environmental details (the lake’s groan, the spire’s hum) dynamically evolve with her actions and charge the final image. The nautilus operates as a micro-setting/tool that shapes what she can do. While the setting rarely constrains her options in a hard logistical sense, it very clearly charges the stakes and closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.5)
    The glowing viaduct, rain, phosphorescent moss, and chasm of forgotten names create a vivid, consistent atmosphere that supports the metaphysical premise. Setting recurs meaningfully at the end (raindrop, tablet dust in cracks, faint glow) to charge the final image. However, the environment mostly functions as symbolic stage rather than a constraint on choices; the labyrinth shifts abstractly rather than as a tactile, navigated space. Sensory detail leans heavily visual, but the tonal cohesion and object recurrence still work well.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cavern, drums, old phonograph, and autumn mountain are vividly and economically evoked, with atmosphere that tightly matches the story’s concerns about echo and silence. Tools and environment genuinely matter: the acoustics of the cavern, the drum skin, and the vinyl all shape what is possible. The recurring seasonal rustle and stone air mirror her inner thaw without feeling like pure ornament. Setting stops short of constraining hard choices, but it strongly charges the central images and the final sense of an ongoing hidden sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rooftops slick with dew, the forgotten courtyard, the fig tree, dusk light, and the coming rain create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that strongly supports tone. The courtyard and storm are not just scenery; they become a sanctuary and a charged backdrop for his moral choice, with the rain at the end reweighting his resolve. Details are purposeful and filtered through his observational nature, matching the “storm recorder” concept. The environment shapes mood more than tactics, but it charges the final images effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    The greenhouse for extinct plants, the Cerulean Nightshade, the UV lamp, and the crystal vial create a dense, immersive sensory environment, with scent as the dominant atmospheric tool. Setting is not decorative: the plant’s blooming window, the ventilation system, and the UV illumination all actively shape what she can perceive and when. The recurrence of light/dark (lanterns, UV, dawn, “lantern unto itself”) and glass/crystal textures charges the final images. Environment and objects decisively constrain and color her transformation, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto and terra-cotta layers are vividly rendered and thematically integrated, with the breathing walls and sediment bands echoing his project of uncovering time’s texture. Setting is filtered through his sensibility, tying stone, starlight, and rope into one symbolic field. However, the environment rarely constrains concrete choices; it functions more as mirror than obstacle or resource. Still, the recurring grotto imagery meaningfully charges the central metaphors and the contemplative mood.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is evocative and specific—the “sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks,” driftwood harvested from wrecks, stars through shattered glass—and these details are woven into action (collecting wood, housing the ritual) rather than sitting as backdrop. The mendicant’s bowl and greenhouse function as micro-settings that constrain and charge the final image, especially the bowl brimming with sound. Environmental elements (shipwreck hulls humming, greenhouse acoustics) participate in the music, not just decorate it. The world rules remain consistent, with a strong atmospheric through-line that supports the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    The amber grotto is vividly rendered and tonally apt—“honeyed light pooling on stone,” resin scent, water drip—and functions as more than a white room. While it doesn’t strongly constrain choices, it does charge the final images (leaving the grotto’s warmth for the cool city night, the lingering static) and supports the story’s ritual, liminal feel. The brief glimpse of city lights as “a constellation of strangers’ stories” nicely extends setting into theme. A slightly clearer sense of the grotto’s practical limits or dangers could have made it even more structurally integral.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    The harborfront, cobbled promenade, and glass-and-iron maritime library are vividly and consistently evoked, with the breeze, salt air, and starlight giving the story a tangible atmosphere. Details generally feel filtered through Lena’s professional and aesthetic sensibilities (manifests, time-card logs, the library as her chosen haunt). However, the environment mostly decorates rather than constrains choice—neither the sea nor the library architecture meaningfully alters tactics or stakes. The setting enhances mood and distinctiveness but doesn’t yet become an active pressure in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.1)
    The crystalline orchard, crater, and obsidian arbor are vividly rendered and deeply functional: the arbor’s song encodes kinship, its shadows are the map Kael cannot read, and the crater’s shimmer dictates when Dusk’s tag can surface. Setting is consistently filtered through Kael’s artistic sensibility (marsh-reeds, glass, shadows) and the girl’s tactile engagement (moss-stained fingers). At the end, the physical convergence of glass roots and reed roots under the arbor charges the final image and makes the environment inseparable from the story’s meaning. This is worldbuilding doing maximum thematic and structural work without feeling expository.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is striking and specific—the rooftop canals, phosphorescent algae, and a city stretched across a giant’s brow are vividly rendered and tightly bound to the story’s metaphysics. Environmental conditions (the Gasp, reversed canals, the giant’s breath) shape what is possible and directly affect Elara’s tactics and fate. The final images—the new infinity constellation and the folio washed ashore—are charged by this world’s logic, not generic spectacle. There is little wasted description; nearly every detail reinforces tone or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cavern orchard is vivid and specific—stalactites feeding trees, silver droplets, obsidian and pearl fruit—and the setting’s logic remains consistent. Environment is more than backdrop: moonlight-as-liquid and the orchard’s “listening” roots directly participate in the ritual and final humming response. The glass eyes in the mosaic watching the orchard at the end give the place a charged, ongoing presence. It stops short of constraining concrete choices, but it powerfully charges tone and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    The library and its subbasement are vividly rendered as a living organism—“bones,” “arteries,” “pulse”—and Mara’s tactile navigation grounds the space in specific, functional detail. The dawn/outage conditions (indigo light, flickering fluorescents, emergency shelter) actively shape who can be there and how Mara can move unseen, so setting is not just decorative. Recurring objects (tape reel, crayon, blanket, loose baseboard) operate as micro-settings that guide choice and charge the final image. This is high-level work; it just stops short of making the environment impose a hard, inescapable constraint under true duress.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and consistent—storm season, damp earth, mossy trellis, linden leaf—and clearly filtered through Elena’s botanical sensibility. Weather and environment do real work: storms damage the lattice, the trellis becomes a site of choice, and the recurring “mossy trellis after rain” image charges the final beats. Details are selective but evocative, and the nursery feels lived-in rather than generic. A hair more specificity in the work-routines or locale could push this to a rarer level, but what’s here is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tidal island and its post–water war scars are vivid and integrated: rain trails guide movement, tides expose objects, storms carve the landscape, and the island-as-canvas metaphor shapes perception and choice. Environmental detail consistently mirrors inner state without feeling purely decorative. The setting also charges the closure image—painting tides/storms as a map for others—and the brooch carrying her story to another shore relies on this geography. This is strong, purposeful atmosphere that supports both stakes and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    The crystal cave is vivid and specific—“a choir of frozen stars,” chiming crystal pillars, “bright darkness” in silver and violet—and this atmosphere is sustained throughout. The environment is not merely decorative: it sings in response to the pilgrim, channels the unseen forces, and its altered rhythm at the end embodies the new status quo. The pearl and lattice of crystals work as micro-setting objects that constrain what can happen (magic must move through them). Slightly more tactile interaction with the space (movement, physical stakes) could push this into the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ivory Harbor and its weather are vivid, sensorial, and consistently filtered through the archivist’s professional gaze—salt, spray, ivory stones, bottles like “bottled starlight.” The environment is not postcard; it actively enables her method (spray collection) and charges the final images (stones as blank pages, the ocean “writing” archives). The after-rain condition subtly shifts tone to renewal and makes the setting feel like a prepared page for new inscription. World rules around mist-as-memory are stable enough that the magic reads natural within this setting.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting and atmosphere are a major strength: the old quarter, phosphorescent cracks, and the “fortress of unspoken truths” made of crystallized breath and regrets all feel vivid and integrated with her perceptions. Details like air that tastes of “ozone and old iron” and breath that “swirled into maps of places that had never existed” are specific and character-filtered. Environmental rules (arrows, door, mist) constrain action in a clear way and charge the final image of mapping this new space. The density skirts purple at times but remains largely purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stargazer’s open tower, ocean, cliffs, and whale migration create a distinct atmosphere that suits the story’s contemplative tone. Setting details (wind, vibrating stone, murals on the walls) are woven into action and meaning, especially the tower’s evolution into a sanctuary. The tile and tower recur and clearly charge the final image, though sensory texture leans heavily visual and auditory. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but it does meaningfully frame the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prismatic escondite and storm-driven magnetic environment are vividly realized and integral: they trap timelines, conduct the mutiny, and physically implode in the ending image. Setting details aren’t postcard-like; they shape what tactics are possible (using crystals and magnetic fields as “scalpel and suture”) and charge the final cascade of “refracted endings.” World rules (solar storm, magnetic resonance, quantum foam) stay internally consistent in their logic. This is near–top-tier environmental integration, just shy of perfection because the sensory palette leans heavily visual and conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    The funeral home prep room, humming embalming machine, and chapel organ are vivid and tightly integrated with mood and theme. The environment constrains tactics (mapped rounds, blind spot between filing cabinet and office) and charges the final images of fluid and music as moral and economic metaphors. The vintage ink pot functions as both object and micro-setting, a little world of secrets that redirects the plot. Sensory detail is selective and in-character rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bonsai labyrinth, mountaintop, and fluorescent lamp are vividly rendered and continuously integrated into action (refracting light on leaves, trees bending to listen, lamp hum mapping). Setting is not mere backdrop; it functions as living archive and collaborator, and the environment literally shapes her method. The recurring small objects (lamp, notepad, gold leaf) charge the final image of the tome on mossy stone as guardian. The only limit is that the landscape never forces a hard choice; it enriches more than it constrains.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Grid of stacked containers, vent holes, concrete, and tides is vivid and omnipresent, and the port’s rhythms literally shape what’s possible (low tide reveals the bottle; high tide brings a new voice and later tests the box’s weight). Setting and object details (shipping containers, tackle box, bottle, label) are tightly integrated with mood and theme rather than feeling touristic. The final image—the heavy box at the water’s edge—depends entirely on this specific environment and its tidal logic. This makes the setting feel like an active constraint rather than mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.0)
    The abandoned observatory on a cliff, rusted dome like a skull, wind eating stone, and obsolete star charts are vivid and consistent, with objects like the telescope, cello, and seashell functioning as micro-settings that charge the final image. The environment feels lived-in and tonally apt, and the dome/wind/sea interact with the cello’s resonance. However, the setting rarely constrains concrete choices; it shapes mood and theme more than tactics. Still, the final image of him as a ghost in that particular observatory gives the place real narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    The raft-city carnival is vivid, specific, and integrated into action—graffiti-covered planks, strobing Ferris wheel, and storm-weathered paint shape what Mira can do and how. The environment affects tactics (graffiti as the city’s “skin,” kids as natural code-readers, storm washing away lines) and charges the final image. The foundation stone chip functions as a potent micro-setting object that constrains her thoughts and directly colors the last beat. This world feels lived-in and tonally coherent, supporting both wonder and precarity.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lunar setting is vivid and consistently integrated—regolith underfoot, distant Earth, dormant machinery beneath the dust all shape atmosphere and subtly constrain what’s possible. Eternal shadow versus encroaching sunlight directly controls the bloom’s fate and thus the story’s stakes. Tools and environment (hourglass, camera, summit rim, crater heart) are spatially clear and used in action, not as static backdrop. The setting also mirrors theme without feeling like blunt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    The atmosphere is rich and purposeful: mist-coated depot, gaslight, mercury basins, and water chambers are all filtered through Miren’s non-visual perception in a grounded way. The workshop tools and liquids are not mere décor; they directly shape her diagnostic method and the final image of her teaching Kael with a simple glass of water. Environmental cues like the ship’s horn and harbor proximity subtly press the timeline and reinforce the navigation motif. Description occasionally edges toward lushness, but it remains coherent and integrated with action.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and under-ice currents are vividly rendered and tightly bound to the story’s meaning—he literally walks out onto a lake that “had forgotten its own shape.” Environment constrains choice: the isolation, ice thickness, and hidden rivers under the surface define both his risk and the possibility of transformation. The final image—crack racing toward the outpost, Kael stepping into water, the dog-ear on the fissure—depends on this exact setting logic to resonate. A slight reason this doesn’t go higher is that sensory range is mostly visual and tactile; expanding the physicality of cold, sound, and bodily risk could heighten immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vividly and economically realized: the archway, cobblestones, wind, moss, and half-collapsed buildings all feel tactile and specific. Environment is not mere backdrop—the archway and cobblestones are literal instruments that constrain the method and make the rebuilding possible. World rules about sound, memory, and stone are introduced through action and held consistently to the end. The final image of the archway’s hum changing and the ghost town “breathing” is charged directly by those environmental particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    The underwater temple and ship are not backdrop; pressure, geometry-defying corridors, and depth tangibly constrain options and shape tactics. The “pulsating wall,” “corridors snarled in dimensions,” and the cold water invading the cracked helmet are all filtered through Lira’s urgent perspective. The vial functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image when it ends up in the captain’s quarters. Atmosphere stays tightly wedded to environment, though the temple’s physicality occasionally yields to abstraction in favor of the metaphysical hush.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lighthouse prison off a jagged reef is vividly imagined and sustained: copper light, surf, narrow door, spiral staircase, chapel, altar, and cells all form a coherent, oppressive atmosphere. Details are purposeful—the reef’s voice swallowing his footsteps, the scuffed door, the rusted iron—supporting tone and theme rather than reading as set dressing. The environment constrains and shapes experience (isolation, descent, hidden chamber), though it rarely forces specific tactical choices. The final image of the standing lighthouse and its “copperlight repose” is strongly charged by all the prior setting work.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting and atmosphere are vivid and integrated: the “alchemical orchard greenhouse” in “endless night,” frost, and “winter-cracked fields” builds a strong, cohesive mood. The environment matters structurally—the ancient tree at the greenhouse’s heart becomes the ritual site and final resting place of the bead, and the transformed greenhouse (“glowed with the soft light of awakened life”) charges the last image. Details are selective and consistent with the botanist’s perspective (night-blooming fruits, tincture-stained hands) rather than a generic gothic backdrop. The only thing holding this just shy of the very top band is that the environment constrains choice only modestly rather than driving tactical dilemmas.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    The red canyon, emptied tide pools, ancient labyrinth, and orchid alcove are vivid and specific, with strong visual atmosphere and a coherent physical logic. Setting is not just backdrop: the canyon grooves match the tapestry, and the orchid-filled alcove concretely anchors the final revaluation. Details are mostly visual, but they’re selectively chosen and tied to mood and theme. The environment shapes the story’s path, though it could constrain her choices more tangibly to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid, tactile, and original—“roots snaked between ribcages and skulls” and “each tree was a storyteller and each bone a bookmark” marry atmosphere and theme. The setting is consistently filtered through Lina’s diasporic and archaeological gaze, and the sundial within this bone-orchard charges the final image strongly. The environment doesn’t much constrain tactical choices, which keeps it just short of the very top band, but as atmosphere and conceptual frame it’s excellent and integral.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    The golden arcade, dormant holograms, carrier pigeons, and chalk-marked flagstones create a vivid, coherent world where past and future physically overlap. Setting details are consistently filtered through Kael’s reverent, craftsmanlike gaze (the arcade as “cathedral,” the clipboard’s worn surface), which grounds the lyricism. Environment constrains action in concrete ways: dawn light and shadows are required for the code, the tubes and pigeons impose a time-window, and the arcade’s architecture hosts the pigeons. This integration of world, stakes, and final image is strong enough to approach—but not quite reach—top-tier mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt observatory, autumn leaves, and blue-white eternal candle create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s tightly filtered through Mira’s attention. Setting details (echoed corridors, listening walls, the absorbing cobalt) strongly support tone and theme, and the candle functions almost as a character and micro-setting. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical tactics beyond isolation, it decisively charges the final image of her walking the cobalt halls guided by the flame. Overall, the specificity and integration are strong enough for high-band short fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    The swamp and mangrove labyrinth are vividly evoked through smell, sound, and texture, and consistently filter through the narrator’s grief (“scent of salt and sorrow,” spirits’ song, water holding the sister’s face). The environment and objects (swamp, labyrinth, moonlight, shard) actively shape what’s possible: the boat journey, the tide carrying the letters, the moonbound healing. World rules (spirits, moonlight stone, condensation messages) are introduced through action, not exposition, and stay consistent. The final image of the apology living “in the song of the mangroves” shows setting directly charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting work is vivid and purposeful: the mist-clad atrium, condensation on glass, banyan silhouette, Malaita beach, and Minneapolis bedroom are all filtered through Kael’s sensibility as a translator and wounded father. The environment functions as a micro-setting via the coral, cast, and hospital space—these objects and spaces constrain what he can do (only think and touch) and power the final image of coral to cast. The liminal, shifting atrium/hospital/village/bedroom composite reinforces theme without feeling like a generic dreamscape. Sensory detail is dense but controlled and never devolves into postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ruined orchard district and fog are vividly rendered—twisted apple trees, lichen glow, fresco shard—and integrated with Lyra’s emotional state so the landscape mirrors her inner fog. The tools and light (camera, projector, fiber-optic lattice) are grounded in this environment and recur meaningfully, especially the fog thinning and the moonlight kissing the orchard at the climax. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, but it does charge the thematic stakes and final images. Overall, sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Lyra’s artistic gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sound wave garden, steel sculptures, and eastern wall mural are vivid, specific, and integrated into action (she places the chime, angles the nickel, listens to echoes). The environment’s rules—sound reflecting, awakening layers—are consistent and shape how things happen rather than being a static backdrop. The coin functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image and is physically handled throughout. Occasionally the description leans a bit toward generalized lyricism (“like morning dew”) instead of sharpening stakes through constraint, which keeps this from the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.5)
    The entomologist’s greenhouse is richly specific and functional: drones beyond the panes, orchids, beetles, mangroves, and bees aren’t just decor but the very noise that fouls the thought-detectors. The world’s rules—thought taxation, cognitive audits—are mostly learned through how Aris uses the space and its lifeforms, rather than expository aside, and this environment directly dictates tactics (speaking to plants, sowing seeds, relying on pollinators). The setting meaningfully charges the final image of gourd vines across the city as an extension of this one hot, humid sanctuary. A slight overabundance of lush detail in mid-scene occasionally pauses momentum, but it still serves atmosphere more than it stalls it.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.3)
    The undersea setting and the gargantuan shell are vivid and consistent, with strong atmospheric detail (reef-shadow, phosphorescence, trenches) that supports tone and theme. The shell functions as more than backdrop—it shapes how her lullabies travel, and later becomes a “cathedral of peace,” charging the final image. World rules are impressionistic but internally stable for a mythic/lyric mode. The environment rarely constrains tactical choices moment-to-moment, so it feels more like an evocative stage than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and distinctive: “opal library above clouds,” “museum of extinct feelings,” glass orchids, and the cracked bamboo chime all create an integrated atmosphere. Details are consistently filtered through the emotional premise of preservation and loss rather than feeling like a tour of curiosities. The library, orchids, and chime tangibly charge the final image, so environment and recurring objects function as more than backdrop. At times description verges on decorative repetition, but the world’s rules and tone are internally consistent and thematically apt.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    The extinct language archive, pneumatic tubes, and quicksilver ink are vivid, economical details that anchor the speculative premise without over-explaining the world. The setting is filtered through Elara’s professional gaze (e.g., “cathedral halls of memory,” “seven thousand dead languages”) in a way that reinforces theme and mood. The glass ink well functions as a micro-setting object, constraining action (finite magical medium) and charging the final image when Elara packs it as a relic of their reconciliation. Some environmental texture (sounds, temperature, physicality of the subterranean space) could be deepened to push it into truly immersive territory.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dormant volcano and crumbling amphitheater are vividly drawn—“the slow, rhythmic breath of the mountain,” sulfurous sighs, groaning stones—and these details recur meaningfully at the end as the building “breathes.” The environment plausibly motivates Alia’s vocation and the stakes (floodgates, eruptions, preservation), even if it rarely constrains a specific on-page tactic beyond general hazard. The amphitheater-as-living-museum concept uses setting as more than backdrop, charging the final image. Still, the landscape exerts more symbolic than immediate physical pressure on choices, keeping it below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    The attic and skylight are vividly realized and constantly present in Elias’s perceptions, with dust, old paper, and creaking boards shaping both mood and metaphor. The skylight column and swirling dust actively charge the final images and his “mapping” attempts, functioning as a micro-setting constraint on his inner choices. The bookshop below, though less detailed, adds a subtle vertical layering of worlds (public vs. secret). Setting is integral to atmosphere and theme rather than postcard dressing.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    The drifting prism terrace, corn maze world, wooden table, and logbook create a striking, coherent surreal environment filtered through the narrator’s attention. Recurring objects (prism glass, wood grain, logbook) accrue meaning and are present in the final images. The setting strongly supports tone and theme, even if it rarely constrains concrete options in a tactical way. World rules are consistently dreamlike but stable within their own logic.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    The underwater facility and drowned city are vividly and specifically rendered—“coral reefs of brass and glass,” bacteria like nebulae, pressure waves of dawn—and consistently filtered through Iyana’s astrologer sensibility. Environment and tools (flooded corridors, depth, failing life support, the plaza open to the abyss) materially shape what she can do and frame the stakes. The burnt feather functions as a micro-setting object that literally casts the city’s maps and charges the final image. It stops just short of 9+ only because the physical constraints of the setting don’t complicate her tactics as much as they could.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    The coastal world and the iridescent geode cave are vividly and economically rendered: “the earth’s glittering throat,” walls as “an iridescent tapestry woven from quartz and time,” sea foam that holds memories. Setting is not just backdrop; the geode literally contains the shards, the cave’s crystal matrix directs the sprouts, and the tide pool and surf become active partners in the ending. The recurring water-glass-crystal imagery charges the final image of foam and footprints, giving the environment thematic weight as well as beauty. A bit more sense of physical constraint (danger, difficulty) in the descent would push this closer to truly extraordinary.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tidal arcade is vivid, specific, and tonally integrated—Neptune’s Arcade, the salt-worn railing, bioluminescent plankton, and creaking boardwalk all feel lived-in rather than touristic. Environment actively shapes choices: the tide isolates the boardwalk, the railing becomes his perch, the western corner becomes a tactical vantage point, and the stars/tide are incorporated into his timing algorithm. The micro-setting of individual machines and booths is clear enough to make the causal choreography legible. This is strong, publishable-level atmosphere whose only ceiling is that it enriches more than it constrains in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    The twilight garden, moonstone dust, and obsidian sky are sensually vivid and thematically integrated, giving the piece a strong atmospheric identity. The garden does shape one major choice—the anchoring and elective exile—but thereafter functions more as lyrical backdrop than as an ongoing physical constraint. World rules (nostalgia ban, memory-laden space) feel consistent, if abstract. The final shimmering garden image charges the ending, though the setting could more forcefully affect specific tactics or limits to reach the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.0)
    Pearl Bay at dawn, the lighthouse’s prism atrium, and the hidden pond create a vivid, coherent maritime atmosphere that feels lived-in and thematically apt. Light, water, and glass are described with selective, sensorial attention that clearly reflects the glazier’s professional eye. The reprise of the prism atrium in the final image usefully charges the ending. The environment doesn’t meaningfully constrain choices, but it does strongly color perception and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    The moonlit ridge, granite spires, and celestial bodies are vivid and tightly integrated with Elara’s inner state; the cracked porcelain box functions as a charged micro-setting. The environment doesn’t much constrain physical options, but it fundamentally shapes the ritual and the final image (box left on ridge, moonlight in fractures) that reweights the story’s meaning. Details are selective and character-filtered—fire behavior, burn scars, forest warnings—rather than generic scenery. This strong object-as-setting integration justifies a high score even without overt physical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto and its “tide-polished” debris are richly and consistently rendered, with setting details (limestone, anemones, tide, sea glass) doing double duty as both lab apparatus and symbolic calculus. The environment constrains and enables: it’s the serenity-source for transfused hope, and the tide’s rearrangement of decorations at the end literally rewrites equations, charging the final image. World rules around quantum balloons and the gauge stay consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition dumps. Description remains purposeful rather than touristic, tightly braided with the story’s conceptual work.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.5)
    The abandoned university and ivy-veiled passage are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Mira’s sonic perception, giving the setting a lived, eerie specificity (walls “dream,” corridors “breathe easier”). Environmental elements—stone absorbing intention, frost-vine hybrids, the cracked ceiling admitting milky sun—are not mere backdrop but deeply entwined with the premise and final image. The corridor itself becomes a character whose “dream” shifts, directly charging the ending. This tight integration of place, mood, and thematic function is a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.0)
    The echoing terrace, prism parapet, rain, and bells are vividly rendered and consistently threaded, giving the piece a strong sense of place and atmosphere. Environmental features do participate in the mechanics—echoing amplifies the lullaby; rain and prisms enable the light-play; bells impose a hard time limit—but more as soft enablers than hard constraints on choice. Sensory focus leans visual and auditory in a way that suits the concept and tone. Setting is a genuine strength, though it stops just short of fully constraining tactics or choices at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.3)
    The terrace, solstice light, and “slow dance of celestial bodies” are vividly rendered and recur to charge the ritual and the final image. The environment isn’t a mere backdrop: the carved ceremonial circle, absorbing solstice light, and planetary alignment all become part of the peace mechanism. The ebony clipboard glowing under the solstice and in sync with the planets effectively fuses object and setting into the closure. A slight limitation is that weather/terrain don’t constrain choices tactically; their role is symbolic and atmospheric rather than practical.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    The salt flat, cracks, thunder, and coming storm are rendered with strong sensory specificity and function as active constraints (acoustics, silence between thunderclaps, the map that will be erased by rain). Setting and recurring objects (salt, cracks, hollow) directly charge the final images: washed-away map vs preserved echo. The environment feels integral to both action and theme rather than decorative. This is one of the story’s strongest dimensions.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    The silver courtyard, snow, starlight, and crystalline sanctuary are vividly rendered and tonally unified, with recurring images (snowflakes as “forgotten syllables,” starlight fracturing) that support theme and mood. Setting acts as more than a postcard: the snow conceals and then frames the sanctuary, the starlight is necessary for its revelation, and the courtyard becomes a charged revolutionary space at the end. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics in a concrete way; her choices during the unlocking are not meaningfully shaped by physical obstacles or spatial demands. This keeps the piece slightly below the very top tier for setting-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    The decommissioned radar dome repurposed as “The Dish” is vivid, specific, and woven throughout: rusted Cold War tech, parabolic ceiling, single CRT, parachute curtain, Nevada dawn. Setting isn’t just wallpaper; the dish “concentrating the quiet like a prayer” and the meteor sky explicitly charge the final image and amplify the conceptual stakes of signal vs. noise, truth vs. static. Details are tightly filtered through tone and theme rather than touristic listing. The environment doesn’t force tactical choices, but it meaningfully shapes atmosphere and the closure image enough to push into a very strong band.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grotto above the clouds is vividly drawn—clouds pooling “like shy visitors,” moss, orchids, quartz, and reed towers create a tactile, visual, and atmospheric environment. Setting is not decorative: altitude explains why the moth “should not have flown so high,” the grotto’s isolation enables her signals, and specific angles of light (47 degrees) and wind patterns charge key choices. Environmental detail evolves with time-of-day and weather, mirroring ecological rupture and her ritual work without feeling like mere symbolism. The final image of the grotto in darkness, structures destined to rot, powerfully charges the thematic aftertaste.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    The icebound sanctum and aurora are vivid, sensorial, and deeply integrated into action: the ice preserves the card, the aurora lights her work, and the cold exile embodies her perfectionist prison. The rope, workbench, glacier, and melting snow all evolve with the narrative, mirroring her thaw and directly charging the final images of glowing braids and a “foundry” of sound. Environmental constraints (ice, isolation, aurora as light source) shape what she can do and how. A slight overabundance of aurora metaphors edges toward decorativeness but doesn’t undermine clarity or function.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is rich and integral: vines threading concrete, a rewilded forest above, and the storm all mirror and pressure Mara’s state. Environmental specifics—climbing the vine-draped walls, mortar dust, the loam swallowing the fox stamp—directly stage the climax and final image. World rules (bunker, Archive, dream method, rewilded surface) are consistent and learned through tactile interaction rather than exposition dumps. The piece could perhaps lean a touch more on non-visual senses earlier, but the atmosphere and spatial logic are strong and thematically charged.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Kael’s observational bias: brass instruments sold for bread, lapis-inlaid floors, loose bricks hiding a cuneiform tile. The “ancient Babylonian palace reimagined” as empty observatory/monastery is not just decorative; its abandonment and in-between state mirror the story’s thematic concern with what persists between regimes. Environmental details (moonlight striking the tile, chalk circles in the courtyard, banners unfurling) actively charge the final images. The world rules—quasi-mystical but rational “magic”—remain coherent and are learned by watching Kael work rather than through exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    The soundless sanctuary and its reality shifts are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Mira’s experience; details like breath as silver motes and walls morphing material anchor atmosphere. The environment subtly shapes the logic of time and possibility, making the sanctuary a live participant rather than backdrop. The music box pin also functions as a charged micro-setting object, especially in the final exchange. The setting could exert a bit more concrete constraint on choice, but it still strongly supports tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ruined orchard, frost, fog, workshop, and sextant are rendered with vivid, selective detail that feels unified by Kael’s glass- and star-obsessed perception. Setting is not mere backdrop: the orchard’s transformation into “glass mountains” and the charged sextant clearly shape the final image and thematic stakes. The environment doesn’t much constrain tactical options, but it strongly charges mood and closure. Overall, atmosphere and specificity are a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cathedral-orchard hybrid is textured and specific (apple boughs in rafters, moss, squirrels, beams, roof hole), and these elements consistently interact with action rather than sitting as décor. The environment shapes behavior—rotting ladder, precarious height, squirrels taking resin, the roof admitting the crucial sunbeam—and the final images (stars in quartz eyes, rustling leaves) are charged by what we’ve seen. World rules (orchard flourishing on vows, quartz eyes) stay coherent within the piece’s magic-tinged logic. This is rich, purposeful setting work, shy only of the absolute top tier because the physical constraints never significantly corner the characters’ options.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    The astral orchard is vividly rendered—silver branches knitting starlight, fruit humming with ancient frequencies—and the cramped bathroom offers a grounded micro-setting that shapes how and where insight is possible. The environment consistently filters through Evers’s role and perception, especially in the oldest tree’s living-constellation bark and the impossible “wind” in vacuum. Setting rules and constraints (surveillance coverage, privacy protocols, orchard rules) quietly guide his tactics and charge the final revelation that each tree is a tombstone. A touch more non-ornamental interaction with physical constraints (e.g., zero-g or station logistics) could push this into unquestioned 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mountain-bookstore setting is vivid, specific, and thematically integrated—stone chambers, catacombs, glass mosaic ceiling, and the memory-feeding warden all reinforce the idea of knowledge as a physical, dangerous terrain. Sensory detail leans heavily visual and conceptual but remains selective and purposeful, with occasional tactile and olfactory touches (“perfume of forgotten herbs”) that deepen atmosphere. The environment constrains tactics (pact with a stone guardian, hidden stair, labyrinth) and charges the final image of dawn on the mountain. A bit more lived-in, moment-to-moment interaction with space under pressure would push this into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.3)
    The abandoned carnival ship and foggy bay are vividly realized with purposeful, POV-colored detail (calliope pipes, faded big-top canvas, smell of popcorn and mildew). The environment isn’t just backdrop; it literally hides the passage, houses the garden, and becomes “a vessel of trapped freedom,” charging the final image. Sensory specificity is strong and consistent without feeling like a catalog. The world rules of the garden and ship are mysterious but internally coherent at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the clock tower mechanism room, brass gears, the clandestine passage, and the pristine rope chamber all shape what is possible and signal the story’s logic about time and memory. The environment responds to her act (“clock gears above her spun backward, forward…”) so the world isn’t just backdrop but an active participant in closure. Objects (the rope, the seal, the gears) act as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Detail selection feels purposeful and filtered through an archivist’s eye rather than touristic cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    The harmonic caves, frozen pool, and crack-pattern ice are vivid and specific, with sensory and conceptual integration (“each crack mirrored the tremors of the storm”). The environment meaningfully shapes tactics—she must read and harmonize the ice, use resonance, and set the stone on a pedestal within this specific cave ecology. World rules around sound, vibration, and light feel internally consistent and are learned through her actions. The final image of the caves humming softly as a lullaby effectively charges the setting with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glass humming pavilion, the ruined world, and the beacon-tower are vivid and specific, with sensory integration (light, vibration, wind, sound/silence) that feels purposeful rather than ornamental. Setting actively constrains choice: the pavilion’s geometry and acoustics are what allow silence to become light, and the star-tracking architecture governs her method. The post-collapse wasteland is sketched economically but effectively raises the stakes of navigation. The environment clearly charges the final image of answering beacons, though a bit more tactile interaction with the physical hardship of the world could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, original, and tightly integrated: stormlight, solid fog, lost-decade stone, and the crystal forecourt all feel specific and rule-consistent. Environment shapes what’s possible—the frozen fog enables the forecourt visit, the stormlight enables shadow-measuring, and dawn’s “melting” of fog charges the final understanding that memory shouldn’t stay solid. Details are filtered through her professional lens (shadow lengths, threads of memory, crystal panels), avoiding tourist listing. This is rich, but never so baroque that coherence or spatial tracking suffers.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the “blooming fortress,” the floral garlands over ancient stone, and the starless void all mirror and pressure the emotional stakes. Environmental details are filtered through Cinder’s sensibility as a fire-worker, so walls become canvases and the sky a negation her light must answer. The fortress and sky materially charge the final image—the glowing stronghold against a black, empty firmament. This object-as-setting and environment-as-constraint relationship is tight enough that removing it would gut the piece’s atmosphere and closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    The grotto, tidal pool, rising tide, and star-mapped walls are vividly rendered and filtered through Mara’s sensibility as a tidal-pool chronicler, giving the setting both atmosphere and thematic weight. Details like “chalk marks mapping constellations long since faded from memory” and creatures lifted by the tide elegantly mirror the transition theme without feeling like mere decoration. The jade cicada functions as a micro-setting object, a tactile node tying time, body, and memory together. While the environment doesn’t hard-constrain choices, it strongly charges the final image and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bunker and its “gilded hush,” the xenial trellis above the clouds, and the one-hour inversion of gravity create a striking, coherent world with consistent rules. Setting is filtered through the girl’s anxieties and obsessions—the pressing walls, the metallic quiet of the ventilation shaft, the thin air at the summit—all in service to her relationship with silence. The environment directly constrains choices: the sealed bunker, the narrow gravity window, and the climbable trellis frame what she can and cannot do. The porcelain doll as micro-setting (a container for silences) also charges the final image, integrating object and environment effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    The drifting prism terrace, noise meters, and atmospheric strata are vivid and integrated, not just decorative—light and sound as physical media directly shape Kael’s tactics. The storm glass vial functions as a micro-setting object, charged by touch, temperature, and crystalline shifts that mirror emotional states and culminate in the ending gift. Environmental details like the terrace’s rotation and the endless drop beyond the edge subtly constrain choices and heighten the stakes of stillness. The world feels specific and lived-in, with rules implied through use rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is vivid, specific, and integrated: acid rain, nano-tube transitway, kaleidoscopic waterfall, and Memory’s Garden are all filtered through her archivist priorities and used as tools or thresholds. The murals and decorative skins are not postcard scenery; they are the functional mechanism for locating and unlocking the stairway. Recurring objects (chronoshawl, ruby flake, orchard, waterfall) charge the final images and constrain choices, justifying the high score.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight, with its shadows as memories and fading threshold, is vivid, coherent, and omnipresent. Setting is not mere backdrop: it encodes her isolation, defines what can happen (others must cross this tenuous boundary), and directly charges the final image of the ring and fading threshold. Details like the altar, starlight through charcoal walls, and ash as both residue and medium of life deepen atmosphere. The environment could constrain tactical choices a bit more concretely, but as a lyric micro-world it’s highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm and submarine-console-turned-irrigation system are vivid, specific, and tightly integrated into action rather than serving as backdrop. The porthole bolt and pressure gauge function as micro-setting objects that directly constrain tactics and shape the climax. Sensory detail (soft blue glow, oxygen-rich cavern, crystalline crackle) is selective and thematically aligned with “shadowseam wonder.” The environment also charges the final image, with the glowing mushrooms and glinting bolt concretizing the abstract “quantum promise.”

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sepia reading room, golden shadows, gramophone, and dust-moted lamplight are richly rendered and recur in a coherent atmospheric pattern. The environment shapes the mood and medium of revelation—the hidden crank in the journal, the gramophone as conduit—but doesn’t strongly constrain physical options. Still, the final return to the room’s “peaceful, eloquent silence” and lingering golden shadows charges the closure image. The sensory palette leans heavily visual but is precise and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse and endless night are richly specific and consistent, with details like silver vines, luminescent fruit, and glass-cathedral walls deeply integrated into action and magic. Setting is not mere backdrop: the greenhouse’s isolation and the orchard’s properties define the stakes and the final image of Aldric as guardian within this bounded cosmos. The environment charges the closure but stops short of constraining concrete tactics in a way that would push this into the 9+ tier.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    The foster care file room and the dust are vivid, selective, and deeply integrated with Marianne’s perception, making the environment feel tactile and meaningful rather than generic. Dust operates as micro-setting and tool, literally shaping her method and thematically charging the final image. The setting’s stale air, sagging shelves, and neglected boxes accurately mirror the emotional terrain without feeling over-explicit. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices but it absolutely charges meaning and tone, especially at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: archives of “revised histories,” enforcement drones, pothole puddles, and the auric lagoon all arise through Mara’s task-focused perception. Environment consistently constrains or enables action: puddles become a map, the lagoon water reveals the relay and later destroys the drives, and drones shape her movements. The auric lagoon and key recur to charge the final image, where reflections literally and thematically become maps to further resistance. A bit more sensory variety at the Archives stage could heighten contrast, but what’s here already integrates world and stakes strongly.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto, fog, dewdrops, and prism atrium are vividly rendered and recur with evolving roles (code-carrier, silence-refractor, then dimmed shell). Setting is strongly integrated into the mechanics of the prophecy and the method of hushing, not just a backdrop. Weather, light, and surfaces all affect how the ritual works (“dewdrops forming,” prism refracting silence). The environment does not strongly constrain tactical options, but it convincingly charges the final emptied image.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.5)
    The ashen skyborne arbor, moonstone dust, silken roots, and mossy leaves create a vivid, coherent atmosphere, with strong recurring imagery. The environment matters conceptually—the arbor’s fate is the stake and its branches/roots shape the map and journey—but rarely constrains tactical choices in scene. Description leans visual and textural, with little evolution of setting under pressure beyond “ashen” to “blooming.” Still, the final image of the glowing arbor and silver leaves is strong and charges prior details.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    The settings—workshop, dead greenhouse, subterranean waterfall—are vivid, sensorially specific, and filtered through Elara’s mechanical bias. Environment and tools constrain and enable choices: the cracked firebox exposes the compass, the greenhouse drafts and mosaic floor guide her, and the waterfall’s spray plus crystalline gears literally shape the solution. The heart-clock and greenhouse both charge the final images conceptually, tying world and theme. Description is dense but purposeful, avoiding touristy cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    The rain-washed foundry is vividly and economically rendered, with brick ribs, copper smell, and furnace embers all filtered through Elara’s professional eye. The environment materially shapes action: the furnace enables the coin’s transformation, the rainwater is a specific quenching medium, and the final golden-shadow image charges the closure. Details evolve with the ritual (embers, anvil, gutters, dawn), avoiding static description. The setting is inseparable from the story’s mood and mechanics, and it meaningfully constrains and powers the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.1)
    Echo Gorge, the hidden sunrise, the misaligned harp, and the crocodile tooth all function as charged setting-elements rather than mere backdrop, with the gorge’s acoustics and “throat” metaphor literally and thematically shaping events. The sunrise’s forty-seven seconds and evolving colors modulate perception and pressure, culminating in the “throat preparing to sing” closing image. Details are vivid, specific, and filtered through Kael’s workmanlike familiarity with the place. Environment and tools clearly constrain tactics and charge the final image, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ultraviolet forest is strongly realized and filtered through her altered body: moss compressing underfoot, ozone in the air, leaves glowing like echoes of the interrogation chamber. The environment mirrors and contrasts the torture room in purposeful ways, and the UV lamps and forest both charge the final image of “ultraviolet penance” as measurement rather than punishment. While the setting doesn’t strongly restrict her physical options, it does meaningfully constrain the ritual she enacts and the thematic frame. A bit of descriptive repetition keeps it just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    The alchemist’s market above the rooftops, the rope bridges, vials of memory, and storm-tossed canvas all create a vivid, tactile, and tonally unified environment filtered through the narrator’s sensibility. Setting is not mere backdrop: the fragment, canvas, and market lanterns explicitly charge the final image and reflect the story’s concern with suspended, liminal spaces. World rules feel consistent and are shown through use (hidden latches in paintings, alchemical objects) rather than explained. The only reason this doesn’t climb higher is that the environment rarely constrains concrete choices; it shapes mood more than tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is vivid and functional, from buzzing fluorescents and dust spirals to false ceilings and cracked façades; we always know where we are and why it matters. Environment and micro-setting constrain action: only by climbing onto the counter and into the ceiling space can Marlon uncover the truth, and the circus context makes the engraved names and wage-theft resonance possible. The final image of the cracked façade breathing secrets grants the setting a thematic afterlife. This is top-tier work for length, just shy of 9-band only because the spatial and physical risks in the environment remain low.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glass orchard library and its sea of clouds are vivid, specific, and integral to how events unfold: the weightless equilibrium, old porous glass, and frost-bearing wall all directly constrain what Elara can do. Environmental changes—the apples falling upward, books bleeding into each other, the mirrored inverted library—are not just decorative but dramatize the rupture of the system. The final image of “frost of infinite panes” clearly grows from and recharges the setting logic. This is rich, economical world-building that serves plot and theme rather than functioning as a postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is vivid, original, and tightly integrated: the baroque asteroid, visible time, and temporal storms all shape how characters act (covering mirrors, using the shard as lens). Details like “gilded skull,” “visible sunset that had happened centuries ago,” and archives heavy with interpretations create a strong, coherent atmosphere. World rules about time, mirrors, and storms are taught through ritual and then leveraged in the climax. The final image of the turning asteroid and preserved poem feels charged by environment rather than pasted over it.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    The resonance chamber, clock tower, quartz pedestal, and silver-veined floor are vivid and integrated with function: sound-shaping and vibration amplification directly enable the repair. World rules around sound, rust, and alchemy stay consistent and are learned through his goal-directed work rather than static exposition. The environment constrains choices (this must be done here, via resonance, before the clock strikes) and charges the final image as music and light literally reshape space. A slight sense of “lushness for its own sake” in a few lines is the only thing keeping this from the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is rich, tactile, and thematically fused: shuttered factory, blackberry-choked quarry, solution tubes, and the lagoon whose stillness becomes a literal “hole in the world.” Environmental details (“mineral breath of the earth,” off-tempo stalactite drips) are filtered through Mira’s odd, sensory-focused mind. Crucially, the lagoon and cave architecture function as the moral/ontological constraint—an actual threshold she refuses to cross and then ritually marks. This integration is excellent, though a hair more interaction between physical hazard and choice could have made the constraint sharper still.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is vivid and integral: the turbines, rocky shore, ozone/iodine air, and barnacled archway are all filtered through Mara’s artistic eye. The environment shapes her path (GPS failure forcing “old paths”) and charges key acts (the slide’s projection on stone, the perfect niche for the token). The recurring turbine-hum and storm clouds modulate mood and infuse the final image with a lived, specific atmosphere. While the setting doesn’t physically constrain a dire choice, it meaningfully colors and supports the story’s central reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    The amber pavilion, autumn light, frosted fields, and cathedral windows are vividly drawn with purposeful sensory detail that supports the contemplative tone. Setting is consistently filtered through Sable’s artistic eye (etched glass, tinted postcards, moonlit gardens), which strengthens specificity. While the environment rarely constrains her choices in a hard way, it very effectively charges the final images of the pavilion and mural. The world’s rules (hidden images at dawn, layered glass) are internally consistent and learned through her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the floating library, obsidian lagoon, dunes, and watchtower-lit beach sculptures are specific and tonally cohesive. Environmental details are filtered through Elara’s archivist lens, turning objects (driftwood, shells, holographic dunes) into charged evidentiary artifacts. The zeppelin and lagoon both return at the end to charge the final images of broadcast truth and buried secrets. Setting could exert slightly more direct constraint on tactical options, but at this length the symbolic and atmospheric work is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.3)
    The paper-lantern cove, starless sky, charred ribbons, and amber reflections create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that is consistently filtered through Kael’s sensibility. The environment and key object (bottle) charge the final image: the sealed bottle on a pedestal, lanterns glowing from maps, and the water’s reflections crystallize the theme of transformed, not reopened, past. Setting functions as more than wallpaper—lanterns as wishes/memory, maps as future blueprints—but it stops short of fully constraining tactical choices. The sensory focus is predominantly visual but effectively leveraged for tone and motif.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rooftop orchard, ancient trees gripping concrete, phonograph on a weather-beaten bench, reflecting pool, and storm are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action. Environment and recurring objects (roots, wax, water, vault beneath the medlar) actively shape what Elias can do and charge the final images, especially the leaf whose veins echo the recorded hum. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric rather than touristic; the space feels lived-in and thematically apt. This is high-level scene embodiment for short work.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    The icebound atrium under starlight, frozen panes, dormant garden, and seed-strewn soil are vivid and consistently evoked. Setting and recurring objects (starlight as resource, ice as threat, soil as receptive matrix) genuinely matter to what can happen: she must use starlight, seeds, and the frozen earth to enact the ritual. Environmental evolution (frost retreating, atrium thawing) tracks cleanly with the magic. The only limitation is that the space tends to serve mood and ritual more than concrete constraint or tactical problem-solving under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mountain sanctuary, wind, frost, and bell chamber are vividly rendered and constantly threaded through action (the stiff rope, opening shutters, observation deck above the valley). Environment constrains and enables choice: altitude allows observation; the half-mended rope limits options; weather pressure is literally read as data. The final image of the windblown sanctuary breathing in solstice hush is charged by all that has come before. This is strong, economical setting work that shapes both mood and tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    The station and its tools are richly, consistently evoked: “silken shroud” hush, fractured windows, rusted telescope gears, and luminescent moss all build an integrated atmosphere. The yellow glass functions as a micro-setting object that shapes perception and charges the final image, and details like cooling metal and ancient metal sighs keep the environment tactile. World rules of this quasi-mystical space remain stable, and the setting mirrors Sola’s inner shift without over-explaining. A slight bias toward the visual and abstract over other senses keeps it just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.0)
    The abandoned beekeeping oasis in a scorched wasteland is vivid, specific, and thematically aligned with loss and silence. Details like rusted hives, hollow honeycombs, and the stained glass box integrate setting with world logic (drought, dying bees) and with the story’s metaphysics (bees carrying souls). The environment meaningfully shapes stakes: the drought has broken the covenant and created the present crisis. Still, the setting could influence Elara’s on-page tactics more directly, rather than serving mainly as backdrop and metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Emerald Silo and the oxidized copper “corroded jewel” image create an immediate, specific locus that shapes everything—her job, the capsules, and the final reframing of the Silo as a “prism.” World details like numbers changing meaning and garage-sale descriptions persisting backward in time are vivid, integrated, and filtered through Elara’s concerns rather than feeling like a tour. The setting does constrain choices (she must work within damaged capsules; the meeting is bound to the Silo’s interior at Recalibration), and the final image clearly depends on this environment.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lagoon, dunes, storm-wrecked shoreline, and weather are rendered with consistent, specific imagery and filtered clearly through the poet’s sensibility. Recurring elements—the cobalt water, driftwood shrine, kite in the sky—build a cohesive atmosphere and charge the final images. The environment shapes what he notices and writes but rarely constrains choices or imposes external pressure. Still, as a lyrical setting it’s rich and integral to tone and theme, not a generic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    The temple orchard—with living stone pillars, coral/bacteria growth, copper filigree, and oaks as nerves—is vividly imagined and inseparable from the plot. Environmental rules (haste as violence, consent, translation between kingdoms) consistently shape Elias’s tactics, including his choice to weave through vines rather than cut them. Sensory detail (stone warmth, phosphorescent moss, humming wires, parrots nesting in completed branches) is selective and purposeful. The final image—an orchard humming with brazen calm—relies entirely on this setting to carry the story’s emotional and conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is vivid and consistent—the “bronze quiet,” rainwashed tower, moss-swallowed sculptures, and gravel under boots create a strong sensory and tonal field. Details are filtered through her scientific and skeptical lens, tying environment to concept (footprints as chemical traces, sculptures as artificial pilgrimage). The recurring object-as-setting of the amber and the tower chamber both charge the final image and her epiphany. The only ceiling is that environment mostly supports mood and concept rather than constraining concrete choices.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is richly particular and integrated: dead reef, retreated sea, barren plain, blooming jetty, and cracked battlefield all shape what the coachman can attempt (searching for warm soil, hidden springs, clinging flowers). Environmental details are filtered through his vocation and obsession with life returning, which keeps them purposeful rather than touristic. The jetty and reef directly charge the final image, where sea, sky, and recovering land unify under the “narrow vastness.” This environmental web constrains and enables choices, elevating the atmosphere well beyond ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    The scrapyard settlement and cracked wasteland are rendered with strong, economical imagery (“rusted spine,” “the particular silence of a world that had screamed itself raw”) and filtered believably through a scent-driven bloodhound. The preserved leaf and cylinders function as charged objects that both anchor the world’s lost ecology and literally constrain choice (the leaf as key to the hatch, the vault as a place he can elect to remain). Environmental detail is selective and purposeful rather than touristic, and the wild hush of the outside world meaningfully contrasts with the sound-filled vault. The setting feels integral to tone and theme, not just backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and specific: the time-dilation observation deck, the “ring of glass and steel,” the echoing silence, and the starfield are all strongly evoked through the narrator’s priorities. Environmental details (rotation stretching time, the hatch opening, the station’s silhouette) are woven into action and theme rather than feeling like static description. The gilded compass rose functions as a micro-setting object, charging the final image and constraining orientation. Some metaphors run similar (“silence,” “echo,” “void”), but they maintain a coherent atmospheric fabric.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    The icebound spire, ice mirrors, frozen gears, and spiraling shaft of frozen starlight create a vivid, coherent environment that feels particular to this story. Setting is integrated into action—the labyrinth, chessboard dais, and crystalline heart are all spatially and functionally clear. The spire and sky visually and conceptually bracket the piece, and the final image of the spire as beacon recharges earlier description. It could go further in constraining his tactics moment-to-moment, but as atmosphere and world-building it’s strong and publication-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    The whispering gallery, the stone plinth, and the luminous city during an interregnum are vividly rendered and tightly tied to the story’s mood. The chessboard on its plinth and the echoing, letter-spelling acoustics function as recurring, purposeful details rather than decor. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain physical choice—Kael is never spatially or materially challenged—but it does shape how unbinding is possible (through echoes and hidden mechanisms) and how memory will be archived. Overall, atmosphere and specificity significantly elevate the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mountain bookstore is vivid and memorable—“a maze of paper and ink… stone shelves that spiraled up into fog”—with consistent atmospheric details (dust, ink, breathing stone) that feel lived-in rather than touristic. Environment is not merely decorative: the rearranging corridors, substituted nights, and the mountain’s “heart” directly govern discovery of the alcove and charge the final image of shelves aligning into the “shape of home.” The lost language stone and feather operate as charged micro-settings, constraining physical and symbolic choices. A touch less descriptive redundancy and a bit more tactile interaction under pressure would push this toward absolute top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    The time-frozen village, halted clocks, and thunder-laden sky create a rich, coherent atmosphere that supports the story’s suspended-guilt motif. The tapestry/platinum labyrinth functions as both setting object and mechanism, constraining his actions and charging the final image when it dissolves into glow. Environmental cues (the hush, misting breaths, storm fading) evolve with the plot, marking the transition from stasis to release. Description occasionally edges toward ornamental, but it generally remains purposeful and POV-aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    The canyon of bone towers, endless echoes, and the pale spire is vividly realized and tightly interwoven with theme—light, bone, and mist recur as vehicles for refracted truth and fossilized tradition. Environmental features do more than decorate: the echoes, shadows, and spire surface become literal screens for Kael’s subversion and the community’s re-seeing. The world’s physical rules remain consistent and atmospheric without info-dumping. While setting shapes perception and symbol rather than hard physical constraints on action, it strongly charges the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop on an acid sea is not decorative; the waves, hiss of corrosion, exchanger, and fragile hull all constrain options and shape tactics. Sensory detail is rich and purposeful—the green foam, mercury spill, and “fragile copper bell” hull all reinforce both physical danger and thematic corrosion/repair. The recurring objects (statue, scarab, exchanger, sea) are spatially coherent and evolve with the action. The final image of the steadied workshop on the acid sea, statue warm with gold, feels fully charged by everything established.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    The coastal cave network and hidden oasis are rendered with specific, sensory detail—the brine, cool air, turquoise pool, shaft of light—that feel lived rather than touristic. Environment matters: the pool’s water is used for painting, the shaft of light charges the seashell’s “new-born glow,” and the oasis becomes the necessary place to fulfill the vow. The sea/cave setting also mirrors the internal themes of hidden promises and submerged memory without being mechanically allegorical. A bit more tactile interaction with the space under stress could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cobalt lighthouse is richly realized and not merely scenic: its glass literally “purifies intentions,” and dawn’s first light is the required condition for Elara’s attempt, so setting directly shapes tactic and outcome. Weather and time—heat wave breaking at 3 a.m., cool salt air at dawn—mirror the emotional transition from oppressive shouting to cooled, clarified intent without feeling like blunt symbolism. The night garden and jasmine scent operate as a micro-setting that travels through objects and into the final image. This integration of place, atmosphere, and magic-logic is unusually tight for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    The signal station and its failed hydraulics, the salvage-lined walls, and the starlit sky are vivid and consistently filtered through Kael’s task-driven focus. The censer foot functions as an object-as-setting, physically steering him and heavily charging the final image in his palm. Environmental details (frozen dish, scrap electronics, windows full of stars) are specific and thematically aligned with broken communication and distant light, not generic scenery. The setting genuinely constrains options and shapes tactics rather than feeling like a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    The hanging orchard, ravine, and storms are vivid and recur as functional elements—the sap becomes a binding agent, the storms mirror and pressure the internal turmoil, and the ropes anchoring the trees echo the community’s new balance. Details feel filtered through the narrator’s practical sensibility, avoiding generic scenery. Environmental constraints (cliff, storms, precarious orchard) plausibly shape tactics. A touch more spatial specificity in the climactic gathering could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse, opal dock, and mist are vivid, recurring, and tightly tied to mood and theme. The dock and mist shape the sense of liminal isolation, and the lighthouse beam in the final image is strongly charged by everything before. Details like barnacled hull, alpine air, and the glass jar on his desk feel selective and purposeful rather than touristic. Environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, but it decisively charges the emotional and thematic field, especially at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is a standout: the antique shop, the swollen creek, the limestone bluff, and especially the bioluminescent cavern are rendered with vivid, selective detail that feels both tactile and uncanny. Environmental elements actively shape choices—the creek’s height gates access to the doorway, the keyhole fissure constrains movement, the pool around the arch forces him into the water. The midsummer timing and subterranean “blooming” deepen the sense of a rare, rule-bound phenomenon rather than a generic magical space. Details remain firmly filtered through Merrick’s sensibility as a map dealer and pattern-seer.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is vivid and integral: frost, thorns, thin air, and “cobalt grotto above clouds” all shape atmosphere and the queen’s options. Environmental features meaningfully charge the final image—the ridge, ember grotto, frost, and bleeding starlight all participate in the closure and in her transformation into a keeper. Details feel selective and purposeful rather than touristic, and world rules (dream invitations, star embers) are consistent. It stops just shy of truly transcendent because the landscape rarely constrains concrete tactics beyond mood and symbolic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    The “ember nexus at twilight,” pocket-sun, and miniature star imagery create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that’s strongly filtered through the alchemist’s perspective. The setting functions as more than backdrop—it hums, approves, becomes “a crucible where secrets turned into stars”—and clearly charges the final image. However, the environment rarely constrains or redirects choices; it affirms rather than pressures. The sensory palette is mostly visual and conceptual, leaving some experiential depth untapped.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    The mountain ranger cabin, graveyard, and surrounding peaks are vividly rendered and tonally aligned (“jaw of earth,” “mountain’s pulse”), giving a strong atmospheric container for the surreal interiority. Setting recurs meaningfully—cabin vs graveyard vs sky—as locations for stages of the internal shift, though environment seldom constrains concrete choices beyond mood and vantage point. Objects as micro-setting, especially the scroll and headstone, carry much of the charge and are integrated with action. This is rich, selective description that supports theme, even if it doesn’t fully cross into using environment as a hard tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    The water clock shop, fog-dimmed morning, and tactile details (condensation, oil, brass, float valves) are vivid and tightly selected through an anosmic POV. Environment and objects (clock, screw, fogged windows) actively charge the thematic field and the final image rather than functioning as décor. The world rules are consistent and the shop’s tools literally and metaphorically shape the options she sees. This is near top-tier micro-setting work for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    The floating rock, storm-cloud sea, and tea ceremony platform form a vivid, specific locus that’s tonally aligned with the meditative ritual. Details like stormcloud-berry ink and crystals catching dim light feel integrated rather than touristic, and the environment echoes her inner state (storm outside vs. hush within). However, the setting mostly amplifies mood rather than constraining choices; she rarely has to adapt tactics because of the rock, platform, or physical peril. This holds it just below the very top tier for elite venues.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sheet-music archive, the orchard, and the physicality of tools (piano, chainsaw, perfume bottle) are vivid and tightly woven to mood and meaning. The environment constrains choices—this must happen “beneath the cider house” and before the trees fall—and charges the final image as the perfume’s ghost lingers over stumps. Sensory detail is rich across multiple senses (scent, sound, texture) and filtered through the characters’ histories. A marginal reason this doesn’t cross into 9+ is that the archive itself affects mood and imagery more than it concretely limits options.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ancient temple library is vivid, specific, and continuously active: dust in sunless light, nautilus shelves, gravity writing poetry, scrolls of impossible futures. Crucially, the setting isn’t postcard decoration; it responds to her (“its halls lengthening into paradox”), physically enacts the spiral, and finally dissolves into her body, charging the final image. The softcover dictionary and her body function as micro-setting extensions, becoming the literal architecture of the new cosmos. World rules are consistently strange but internally coherent, and the environment shapes how the story resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    The horizon measurement station, cliff, and fjord stillness are vividly evoked and interwoven with the hydraulic clock and drops of water. Setting and object-as-setting (the clock, reservoir, key) recur and clearly charge the final images of silence and heartbeats. The environment shapes tone more than choice, but the “fjord quiet” and horizon vantage point are thematically apt and specific. This is strong, economical atmospheric work that could reach higher if the physical environment constrained his options more directly.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm, permeable membranes, and spore-laden air are specific, atmospheric, and consistently filtered through Kael’s technical and spatial mindset. The environment isn’t postcard; membranes, sectors, and hyphal networks are integral to the notion of intrusion and memory transmission. The setting also charges the final images (dimmed bioluminescence, ventilation shafts, fruiting cycles) with thematic weight. It could constrain tactical options a bit more concretely, but as a micro-ecosystem of grief and surveillance it’s highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rainwashed midsummer library, the subway’s “tired palette,” and the dust-breathing hidden alcove are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Lila’s sensibility. The lantern and its mica pane function as a micro-setting object that constrains action, organizes the decoding process, and charges the final image when she carries it “like a heart that had learned to beat in two worlds.” Environmental details (rain, skylight, old paper) are purposeful mood engines rather than generic wallpaper. The world rules stay grounded even as the atmosphere edges towards the numinous.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.0)
    The subway utility tunnel, iron, and the glass-walled booth create a distinct, claustrophobic atmosphere that fits the emotional isolation and the haunting. The recurring glass harmonica disc functions as a setting-object that shapes the final act and charges the closing images of shattered notes and lingering echoes. Environmental detail is selective and purposeful rather than touristic, though it leans more on mood than on concrete spatial constraint. The aboveground city and streetlamps bookend the piece effectively, giving a felt before/after to her emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.0)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: cedar shelves, brittle scrolls, the dark ribbon of the jetty, and night-blooming jasmine all create strong atmosphere and recur meaningfully. The jetty and jasmine in particular charge the final images, framing the place as both memory-site and threshold. Environmental detail is consistently filtered through the archivist’s sensibility as a preserver of delicate things (ink, paper, blossoms). The world does not strongly constrain choices, but it does effectively mirror and deepen the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ivy-clad, disused station with its frozen clock tower is a strong, coherent atmosphere that recurs and deepens—from cracked platforms to ivy-playgrounds to the haunted ritual space. The setting charges the final image: the moon rock embedded in the cornerstone and the caretaker tending ivy while listening for the rusted clock’s chime. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain tactical choices, it meaningfully inflects tone and theme (abandonment turned into communal hearth). Details feel selective and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ultrasonic forest is vivid, specific, and deeply filtered through Elara’s tactile perception, creating a distinctive atmosphere. Environmental rules (ultrasonic song, stillpoint, lichen-notes) stay consistent and matter to how she moves and understands. The compass ring and the forest function as micro-setting that charge the final image and constrain her options. A slightly greater sense of physical hazard or texture in the undergrowth could heighten lived-in realism, but what’s here is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The gravitational anomaly and station are richly evoked—“light bent into whispered spirals,” groaning corridors, ozone, moss—and the pen and shimmering threads integrate setting with premise. The anomaly isn’t mere backdrop; it enables the visible threads of causality and its curves “unbend” as history is edited, then remain as a gentler, embracing constraint at the end. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, though at times it leans on lyrical abstraction more than tactile interaction. Still, the environment strongly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    The luminous harbor, moon, and water are vividly and economically rendered, with strong sensory atmosphere (“night smelled of salt and forgotten things”) and consistent tone. The harbor and moonlight aren’t just backdrop; the moon’s path of light and its reflection become the focus of the redirected camera and the charged final witness. The vintage camera functions as a micro-setting object that constrains his gestures and charges the final image as metronome. The environment shapes mood more than concrete tactical choices, but it clearly charges the story’s meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    The volcanic foothills and subterranean limestone archive are vividly rendered through smell (sulfur, old paper), temperature, and texture, and are consistently filtered through Kael’s archivist/arsonist sensibility. Environmental constraints matter: the rockslide exposes the doors, minerals provide pigments, fungi supply light, and the precise geometry of skylights and chambers governs the final reveal. The setting evolves with the narrative, from ruin to living memory-space, and culminates in the final image of the weeping portrait within this carved history. The only minor limit is that immediate physical danger from the volcano stays largely atmospheric rather than a live tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and original—the sound wave garden, crystalline flora, auric lagoon, and cosmic-radiation “hush” all feel sensorial and conceptually integrated. Environment is not mere backdrop: Kael’s drumming interacts with quartz trees, copper vines, and the frozen waterfall in ways that materially shape his attempt to reconstruct Mira and access the lagoon. The black stone and the lagoon’s mirror surface charge the final image, constraining his choice to a single, irreversible act. A touch of density verging on ornament appears in places, but it rarely stalls momentum or blurs spatial logic.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    The port’s container labyrinth and geomagnetic storm are vividly and efficiently evoked, and they genuinely constrain tactics—the metal walls become both obstacle and instrument. Marek’s professional eye (“maintenance routes,” “structural weaknesses”) gives the environment a strong POV filter instead of tourist description. The amphitheater junction, zodiac houses, and resonating skins all shape how sound can move, directly affecting the plot. The final image of the humming wall and folded maps carries atmospheric and conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and sensorially rich: “cobalt dock,” rain pools mirroring a “bruised sky,” the smell of iron and rope all create a strong atmosphere that feels lived-in rather than decorative. The environment meaningfully interacts with the premise—the wet wood and pooled water enable the reflections and star illusions that drive the teaching. Still, the dock and weather do not significantly constrain choices; they charge the imagery more than they shape tactics. Beautifully rendered, but just shy of the 9-band requirement that setting actively alter options or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt library, mist, and magnetic grotto are vivid, recurring anchors that establish a strong, consistent atmosphere. Setting is filtered through Hartwin’s perspective in a thematically coherent way (cobalt, mist, hushed energy) rather than as neutral description. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, it clearly charges the final images (misty library, amplified quiet) with thematic weight. The story could lean further into how the city’s geography or rules physically pressure choices, but what’s here is textured and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    The docks, sublittoral fringe, and vanishing island are textured and specific (“tide painted silver ribbons over jagged rocks”), and the nonviolent world-rule is consistently reflected in the guardian’s non-sword threat. Environment and recurring objects (dock, skiff, scrimshaw) shape possibilities—she must unmoor, navigate the tide, and ride the island’s retreat—and the liminal edge between sea and land meaningfully mirrors her liminal identity. A few descriptions verge on atmospheric gloss rather than constraint, but the setting remains integral.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.5)
    The farmhouse and wind turbines are vividly rendered—the hum, “remade hush,” and blade shadows give the piece a strong, specific atmosphere that mirrors the emotional regime. Setting details are well-integrated into perception (turbines as scissors cutting the sky, breathing structures, etc.) rather than feeling like a backdrop list. However, the environment rarely constrains concrete choices; it shapes mood and concept more than action. The turbines and bouquet do help charge the final image, but not to the point of full indispensability.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and humming quartz colonnade are vividly realized and filter strongly through the poet’s sensibility; the space feels specific rather than generic. Environment shapes the experience: the frozen surface lets her walk out, the atrium’s dimming lights and quartz glow focus her path, and the lake/colonnade form the literal and metaphorical thresholds. The rules of this quasi-mystical place stay internally consistent, and recurring details (ice, hum, cobalt glow) charge the final images. A bit of the description is ornamental, but most of it supports atmosphere and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.3)
    The courtyard, furnaces, glass shards, and dense plant life create a vivid, coherent micro-world that is strongly tied to the story’s actions (the trade, the hum, the arrangement). Setting details are filtered through artistic perception—molten glass as warmth she “feels,” plants as a language—and the molten droplet and rainbow concretely charge the final image. The glassblower’s tools and environment plausibly shape what can happen here (barter of fire, glass music, living score). A slight excess of atmospheric abstraction in places is the only thing holding it just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is exceptionally vivid and purposeful: the panels of preserved sounds, the reconstructed sacred spaces, and the lab’s equipment all serve the thematic question of what’s lost in translation. The miner’s lens and the golden shadows function as micro-setting, constraining tactics (she must use flawed physical artifacts) and charging the final image. World rules around the holographic grid, neural interfaces, and post-collapse infrastructure are consistent and sketched with economical specificity. The environment is inseparable from the story’s meaning and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    The observatory, curtains of intention, withering star field, and airlocks are vivid and distinctive, and they feel lived-in through Elara’s work and rituals. Environmental rules (starlight revealing coordinates, dissolving vellum into stardust, timelessness allowing Mnemosyne’s “after-death” blooming) are consistent and integral to action, not postcard-like. The setting directly charges the final image: the observatory deck, the last crane, the timeless dome waiting for the “next soul.” A touch more tactile, bodily grounding amid the cosmic imagery would push this to the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    The loft under the rain-beaten skylight, the emptied city, and the flood below are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Mara’s professional gaze (rain as “tiny crystal of a broken economy”). Tools-as-setting—the measuring tape, obsidian cards, onyx ink—are tactile, recurrent, and integral to how she navigates the world. The skylight and loft’s elevation subtly shape the stakes (they are “above the flood, above the chaos”), and the final image of rain as pixels in a decoded pattern elegantly charges the environment with thematic weight. The setting feels fully fused with character and concept rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.0)
    The archive, crystalline shelves, obsidian pillars, and bronze prism pagoda are vividly realized and sensorially rich, especially in light and color. Details like sigils humming with latent energy and the kaleidoscope of twilight feel specific and tonally aligned. The environment mostly frames and mirrors her inner state rather than constraining her options, so it’s more atmospheric than tactical. Still, the pagoda as an environmental object charges the final image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “blooming library” above amber clouds is vivid, specific, and returns meaningfully in the final image, now faintly glowing under the luminous veil. Setting and object-as-setting (river stone) both charge the ending: the transformed shadow draping over the library and her now-empty pocket visually embody the cost. World rules (floating structure, clouds risen, earth as memory) stay consistent and are conveyed through image rather than exposition. This atmosphere feels integral rather than postcard-like.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    The workshop, mist, stars, cedar, and jasmine are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, creating a lived-in, almost tactile atmosphere. Setting isn’t just wallpaper: the wood stove enables the burning of false brochures, the enclosures and injured animals constrain her options, and the night-into-dawn shift mirrors her internal clarification. The recurring image of the chameleon’s enclosure and the workshop as “sanctuary, now tainted” subtly charges her choices and the final image. While environment mostly pressures her internally rather than through hard physical constraints, the micro-setting does meaningfully shape tone, options, and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.5)
    The tower, tunnel, mossy air, pool, and hourglass are vividly rendered and maintain a cohesive, quiet-dawn atmosphere. Recurring objects—the frosted hourglass, coffee rings, glowing pebble—anchor the imagery and are meaningfully reprised at the end. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, it does thematically mirror her inward descent and re-emergence. The consistency of tone and tactile specificity (stone walls, damp air, lapping water) is a notable strength.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.0)
    The projection booth and palace are rendered with vivid, selective specificity (“hot metal and celluloid ghosts,” “gap between seat G12 and G13”) that is always POV-filtered and thematically active. The setting is not postcard; its architecture and micro-spaces literally store the unused love and constrain what Mira can perceive and do, and the final image of her leaving the now-empty palace is charged by that knowledge. The recurring objects-as-setting (booth, staircase curves, seats, sidewalk cracks) clearly shape the story’s conceptual stakes and the closure image. Environment, tools, and architecture are indispensable to both action and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting and atmosphere are the piece’s strongest assets: the aurora-lit archway, frozen landscape, and brass sextant are vividly rendered and tightly woven through the narrative. Environment influences action in a soft but real way—she must travel north, lie on the ice, and work under the aurora for the ritual to occur. The recurring sextant and aurora charge the final images (rainbow on ice; dawn on the archway) effectively. Sensory detail skews visual but is rich and purposeful rather than touristy.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and particular—“glowing dune in bloom,” ash-waste, last forest, null-zones—and always filtered through the guard’s task as shepherd of memory. Crucially, environment constrains choice: the ash-saturated world forces the search for an “unlit corner” beneath the dune as the only viable rooting ground. The chess clock and dune function as micro-settings/objects that charge the final image of midnight as a visitable garden carried away on walking sand. A touch more tactile, non-visual sensory grounding could push this higher, but as-is it’s strong and thematically integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mechanical rainforest is vividly and economically rendered—copper leaves, brass bark, piston-trees, oak-turbines, willow-pipes—and remains consistent, teaching its rules through action rather than exposition. Setting is tightly fused to consciousness and theme, and the small gear as object-as-setting charges the final image. The environment constrains meaning more than physical tactics, but the sense of a thinking forest that “calculates” is clear and memorable. A bit more sensory range beyond the visual and auditory could deepen atmosphere further.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    The coastal setting—fog, ridgeway, cove, lantern, fireflies, and stars—is vivid and sensorially grounded, and the recurring shoreline imagery gives the piece a strong atmospheric coherence. Environment mirrors the interior journey (veiled ridgeway as uncertainty, twilight deepening as emotional liminality) without becoming outright symbolic exposition. Still, the setting rarely constrains specific choices beyond general slipperiness and mist; it decorates more than it pressures tactics. The recurring ticket and shoreline do charge the final images, raising this above pure postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cobalt fortress, snow, and staircase are vivid and tonally integrated, with details like “snow pressing against the windows like a mourner’s hands” doing strong atmospheric work. The environment functions more as emotional and thematic pressure than as a hard physical constraint, but the recurring stair and the fortress’s sacred mundanity clearly shape her routines and perception. The bolt as a handled object effectively doubles as micro-setting, charging the final choice. A slightly stronger sense of spatial consequence (how failure in this place tangibly threatens others now) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ancient temple library and cosmic time dilation are vividly realized and consistently filtered through the story’s mythic register. The setting is not mere backdrop: the library’s books enable Sylvar’s cryptic messages, and the graceful physical collapse charges the ending image. Details like “vines of silvered starlight” and “shelves stood like silent sentinels” are specific and tonal, though sometimes verge on decorative excess. Environment could constrain character choices more concretely, but it already does significant thematic and structural work.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sea-level monitoring station, floating yet moored, is a strong, specific environment that permeates action, perception, and theme. Details like the tide gauges, rusted archive cabinets, mildewed charts, and the drifting platform are selective but vivid and consistently filtered through Lina’s professional eye. The setting subtly constrains what she can do—she is a watcher surrounded by instruments, not an agent of change—and that feeds the earned-stasis closure. The recurring objects (gauge needle, torn page, railing) charge the final images without feeling over-symbolized.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.5)
    The abandoned spaceport and its specific features—the repair bay, observation deck, launch pad seven, and buried stone circle—are vivid, coherent, and tightly integrated with action. Environment isn’t just backdrop: the hum through the stones, the beacon’s solar power, and the decrepit systems shape what Kai can do and how her song spreads. The motif of twin suns and “margin of daylight” supports the piece’s liminal, anticipatory tone and charges the final image of her resting on the humming earth. The world feels both particular and thematically aligned without drifting into inert cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.3)
    The volcano flank, scaffolding, flags, springs, and moss-lines are richly and efficiently rendered, and the plant perceptions give the setting a distinctive, lived-in texture. The hot vent physically constrains the unsealing and the fire-resistant trees tie environment directly to future stakes, so setting is not mere backdrop. World rules about ash, mist, and plant-telepathy stay consistent and are learned through action. A small missed opportunity is that the reconstruction infrastructure and community space could bear a bit more tactile pressure during the key act to push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    The arboretum, cliff, lighthouse, and specific trees are vivid and sensorially grounded, with salt air, bark texture, and orchids integrated into action rather than catalogued. Setting directly shapes his tactics—he presses his palm to trunks, matches photograph to bark, reads somatic markers in roots—and the lighthouse/arboretum contrast charges the final metaphor of him as “keeper.” The environment’s weather and geography (seaside cliff, seabirds, foghorn silence) mirror and pressure his internal state without feeling forced. A few lines flirt with overt symbolism, but overall the setting is purposeful and indispensable to the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse library is vividly realized—salt, silverfish, breathing stone walls—and the environment meaningfully pressures her (walls closing, floor tilting, pivot-point architecture) and channels the magic system. The lighthouse beam and the library-as-pivot both directly charge the final image and her thematic realization about light/dark. Detail remains purposeful rather than touristic, closely filtered through Elara’s sensibility. A few metaphors are familiar (“velvet fingers”), but they don’t undercut the strong integration of setting with choice and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    The wind-carved encampment, arches, and dunes are vividly rendered and consistently refracted through Kael’s perception (e.g., the wind “holding its breath,” arches humming). The setting strongly supports atmosphere and theme—erosion, ephemerality, and carved time—but rarely constrains choices or tactics. Weather and light (post-eclipse glare affecting his albino eyes) are nicely used but remain more tonal than decisively functional. Overall, it’s an evocative, specific backdrop that could be pushed one step further into shaping action.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Alexandrium is vividly and economically realized—the subzero corridor, nitrogen-cooled servers, pneumatic tubes, and three kilometers of snow create a tactile, specific environment. Setting meaningfully constrains action: her intimate knowledge of the “dead switches and rusted junction box” makes her particular tactic possible, and the buried library under snow charges the final image when the “old silence” is literally reburied by new snow. Details are filtered through her professional gaze, avoiding tourist catalog syndrome. World rules (cryogenics, broadcast relays, Silence Laws) feel internally consistent and learned through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glass-domed rose farm on the desert’s edge is vivid, tactile, and thematically loaded, with weather and sand actively pressuring maintenance choices. Details like clogged filters, rattling glass in the storm, and the roses’ colors and scent are integrated into action rather than postcard description. The dome and desert meaningfully frame her isolation and pacifism against a “fractured mosaic” world. The final glow of the dome and the altar of small objects powerfully charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sound wave garden, the humming soil, and the rail spike together create a distinctive, rule-consistent environment that shapes every choice Avery makes. Setting details (waves blooming into unnamed colors, rooted starlight, soil that “breathes frequencies”) are not decorative; they’re the medium of action and the logic of the magic. The final images—rail spike glowing on the windowsill, garden breathing and waiting for patterns to break—are charged directly by this environment. A bit less reiteration of “transliterated” in favor of one or two new, equally concrete sensory anchors could refine the texture further.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.3)
    The observatory above the clouds, the fog “like old headlines,” the grandfather clock, and the telescope all create a strong, coherent atmospheric container. Setting is tightly braided with theme: light/darkness, orbits, black holes, and telescopes are not just decorative but charge the moral calculus. The micro-setting of the desk and the nib as a “small dark star” at the end gives the final image weight. It still leans more toward symbolic echo than concrete constraint on her options, which keeps it just below the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.0)
    The laboratory, meteor hush, phonograph cabinet, and amber are all concrete, specific, and deeply integrated into action and choice. The lab’s existence only during time-folds and the furniture’s timed compartments directly constrain when and how Elara can act. The final image—holding the amber to her ear and hearing only silence—beautifully charges the environment and recurring object with thematic weight. World rules (time folds, haunted firmware, sound archives) are consistent and learned through use rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    The whispering grotto, mist, chalk, tile, and sand mandala are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action and magic rules. The environment is not backdrop; it actively shapes options (the grotto “collects what speech leaves behind,” is “ravenous” during the unlearning, and physically responds to the altered mandala with wind and crystallized hush). Recurring purples and lilacs bind atmosphere to theme without feeling like a mere color gimmick. The final image—the grotto retaining “chalk fossils of ancient stories” as the village forgets—charges the setting with lasting narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ruined plaza, ash-scented air, shattered sky, and mosaics are vivid, sensorial, and consistent, with the tessera and stepping stone nicely carrying through to the ending. The environment strongly supports tone and theme, and the “shattered sky” in particular reweights the final images of rebuilding and incomplete minaret. However, the setting rarely constrains choice or tactics; it’s more backdrop and metaphor than an active pressure. This keeps the piece from reaching the very highest band here.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is richly imagined and specific—the empty theater, secret hedge maze, and chiming-petaled orchard all feel tactile and coherently magical. Synesthetic description (“applause that painted the darkness in hues of gold and violet”) grounds atmosphere through the ghost’s perception rather than generic lyricism. The orchard and maze meaningfully charge the final image (folding back, waiting as a hidden promise) and the coin’s last clink sits in that world with weight. A bit of detail borders on ornamental, but overall the environment is integral and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.3)
    The light painting studio is vivid and functionally woven in: the dimmer, acetone smell, metal table, and software all participate in the process, culminating in the fractal tree canvas. The geode operates as both object and micro-setting, its lattice literally shaping the method and the final image. Environmental details consistently filter through Lina’s artistic-technical mind, lending specificity rather than generic “lab” atmosphere. The setting does constrain and enable her choices, but external pressures from environment (e.g., time, institutional constraint) remain minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    The coastal cave network is vivid and integral: “walls wet with salt and memory,” the hum of the sea, and the narrowing tunnels all shape mood and motion. The environment directly structures the narrative—Lira moves deeper following emotional currents, presses her palm to the wall, and finally emerges back onto the coast. The elm leaf fossil and the cave system together charge the final image, with the caves “sleep[ing] behind her” and their secrets woven into her song. Setting is not just backdrop but the primary medium of the story’s emotional and thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    The amber warehouse, sandstone cliffs, and petrified sap are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through the story’s metaphors of time, memory, and entrapment, giving the piece a dense, coherent atmosphere. The setting does more than decorate: the echo bound into amber walls at the end and the cliffs “no longer empty” charge the final image and embody the shift from hoarded to shared time. Environmental details (hourglasses ticking overhead, resin pooling, trapped fireflies) are purposeful and thematically aligned rather than touristic. While the physical layout rarely constrains her tactics in a practical sense, it deeply structures the thematic stakes and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: Zephyr Bluff, the mist, and accumulated snow are not mere backdrop but the storage medium for the codes and a physicalization of buried time and guilt. Environmental details (cold air, predawn light, frozen capsule) are filtered through Kael’s operative mindset and shape his tactics (he must dig, layer by layer). The recurring atmospheric “silver” and thaw imagery subtly track the internal shift without becoming overbearing. The final descent from the bluff into a thawing world is a charged environmental echo of his internal re-entry.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fog-bound river landing, ticking gutters, and uneasy sleeping town are evoked with rich, selective detail that clearly arises from Silas’s occupational gaze. The gutters and fog are not mere décor: they structure time, condition his “ambient awareness,” and charge the final silence, making environment central to meaning. The yarn needle functions as a kind of micro-setting/tool that anchors his body and the last image. There is mild risk of atmospheric over-saturation, but it rarely muddies spatial or temporal clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    The oasis and wasteland are vivid, specific, and filter clearly through Kai’s craft-focused perception: hive boxes, silvered wood, rosemary, kiln, and clay all feel tactile and lived in. Setting is not mere backdrop; the oasis’s impossible greenery, hidden spring, and temporal memory actively explain its survival and charge the thematic core. The final images—the oasis as a pulsing heart and the wasteland listening “patient as clay”—are strongly environment-charged. The only thing holding this back from the very top band is that the environment guides meaning more than it constrains concrete choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.0)
    The urban setting is vivid and purposeful: fire escape, harbor, and abandoned cannery lot each mirror her internal state and guide action. Sensory details (salt air, warm concrete, machine oil and tobacco on the metal) are specific and character-filtered, not touristic. The bitting gauge and the lot function as micro-setting constraints, literally shaping how and where she can act. The environment culminates in the moonlit harbor and lot blessing the seeds, charging the final image with place-based meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.3)
    The tidal library above the clouds, shifting shelves, and humming stone circle are vivid, particular, and consistently inflected through Mara’s experience; they never feel like generic fantasy dressing. The sundial and stone circle function as micro-settings that actively shape what she can do (channel ghosts, translate hums), and the library’s tides of time metaphorically and literally align with her heartbeat by the end, charging the final image. Sensory detail leans visual and sonic but is purposeful rather than touristic. This is very strong environmental work, just shy of the kind of constraint-driven, choice-forcing setting that would push into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.3)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, rain, and courtyard mosaic are vividly rendered and recur throughout, giving the piece a lush, coherent atmosphere. Setting details are strongly filtered through Lira’s sensibility (lotus leaves as “stained glass,” prismatic quiet, the installation reflecting on water). The environment meaningfully charges the final image—her letter sealed with rain and placed in the spiral at the pond’s heart, with temple bells rippling across the water. It still functions more as charged backdrop than as a constraint on choice, keeping it just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.3)
    The radio station and campus are vividly evoked—peeling paint, burnt coffee, old vinyl—and these details are filtered through Mara’s professional and emotional lenses. The station’s aging equipment and the transmission tower are not just backdrop; they materially shape tactics and danger around the subsonic interference. The broader campus unrest (quad protests, faculty senate, student senate debate) coheres with the celestial manipulation and modulates the atmosphere. While the environment doesn’t fully choke her options, it does meaningfully constrain how and where she can fight back.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    The church, catacombs, and star-lit chamber are vividly rendered and tonally coherent, with the organ and compass functioning as charged tools within the space. Claustrophobic pressure from “walls…breathing with a malevolent will” gives the setting real agency over Elara’s body and choices. The transition from shadowed nexus to blueprint library evolves logically and supports the conceptual reweighting at the end. A touch of description feels ornamental, but overall the specificity is purposeful and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    The quarry is vividly realized—the “furrowed hush of stone,” mist like “breath on a mirror,” and the fissure where the ribbon snags all feel concrete and tonally unified. Setting meaningfully constrains action: the quarry’s shadows explain the missed ribbon and the height-dependent edge detail that cracks the case. The return to the quarry at midnight recharges the opening imagery and charges the final image with quiet earned resonance. A touch more sensory variety beyond the visual/atmospheric would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    The weather station, howling wind, thawing permafrost, and emerging valley camp are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through the librarian’s attention. Environmental details (alarms, consoles, observation deck, storm vs. pocket of calm) shape what she can do and how quickly, and the jet stream’s chaos versus the valley’s stillness charge the final image. The copper nail and preserved instruments work as micro-setting objects that anchor both history and present stakes. A bit more tactile interaction with the station environment under peak pressure could push this higher, but what’s here is strong and economical.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is vivid and sensorial—pine-thick night air, moonlight, plastic wrap rippling, mossy cairn—filtered through his artistic, observant gaze. The environment meaningfully shapes action: the mountain pullout allows the encounter; the construction site’s scaffold wrap literally maps his path; the grove and cairn locate the buried past. The recurring objects (fiddle, glass flake, photograph) are well integrated into the physical world and final image. While atmosphere edges toward uniformly ethereal, it coheres with the story’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    The abandoned circus train is vividly rendered (rusted rails, popcorn grease, sawdust, peeling posters) and firmly integrated into action—posters become the canvas for territorial symbols, the caboose their former launchpad. The environment mirrors and deepens the thematic concern with worn-out spectacle and cyclical failure. It also charges the final image: the train as “silent sentinel” exhaling rust and memory concretely frames the son’s inner shift. The setting could influence physical choices a bit more, but as atmosphere and symbolic pressure it is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory, telescope, mountain wind, and night sky are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the story’s mechanics and mood; this does far more than provide backdrop. Tools like the brass telescope and photometer are used in action and return in the final promise whispered into the eyepiece, charging the last image. The variable star field and the “temple of silence” atmosphere reflect and deepen Elara’s inner work without collapsing into generic symbolism. Setting doesn’t strongly constrain her options, but it meaningfully frames and inflects every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cursed lake with its “orchard vortex” is vivid, specific, and atmospherically rich, and the shifting from maelstrom to quiet grove tangibly mirrors the plot’s resolution. Environmental details (hissing water, cloak tugged by the vortex, malevolent ice) are well integrated into action rather than ornamental. The setting does exert some pressure on choices (he works from the edge, must contend with the vortex’s pull) and charges the final image of a smoothed surface and somber grove. It’s strong, though it stops just short of being truly indispensable as a constraint on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cobalt glade, mirrored maze, and eclipse are vividly rendered and tonally cohesive, and the organic imagery (roots, sap, scars) coheres with the covenant/gardening theme. Setting details are strongly filtered through Elara’s visionary sensibility, avoiding a tourist catalog. The maze and roots do more than decorate—they are the actual mechanism and metaphor of her transformation, and the final plan to plant a new maze charges the closing image. A bit more concrete interaction with the physical environment (beyond vision and touch) could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.0)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid and specific—roots, bones, half-lit corridors—and integrated into action, not just backdrop. The environment constrains the ritual: the card must be placed on a root; memories literally become the orchard’s growth. The final image of roots having taken her memories and the city oblivious above is charged by the same setting logic introduced early. Sensory and conceptual coherence across the piece makes the world feel distinct and lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    The quarry office trailer and valley are vividly and economically rendered—the rust, old paper, blasted rock, and echo motif all support tone and theme. Setting is consistently filtered through Mara’s sensibility, especially in how the valley’s “echo” mirrors her internal state. The trailer doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but the environment does charge the final image, with the valley’s silence reweighted as “possibility.” A slightly greater sense of the working quarry’s practical constraints could deepen its functional role beyond atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    The magnetic arbor, floating groves, cloud-sea, and star-iron are vivid and integrated into action (she climbs, carves, the city sags/steadies) rather than being mere backdrop. The environment materially constrains the solution—the spirit is distributed through the arbor’s structure, so her work must be inscribed into magnetic pathways. The recurring vertical axis (throne-room above, clouds below) charges the final act of letting the fruit fall. A slightly broader sensory palette or more tactile hazard in the environment could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tidal atrium, geothermal crucible, and pressure-glass cathedral are vivid, specific, and constantly interacted with, never mere backdrop. The environment materially shapes choices: tides constrain timing, geothermal vents allow the “gradient of heat” solution, lunar pull literally migrates her identity. Recurring objects-as-setting (creel, crucible, pressure glass) charge the final image and embody the theme of preserved impermanence. World rules (tides, moons, tomorrow’s disappearance) feel internally consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: Bunker 7 and the crystal caves are rendered with strong sensory specificity (“resonant hush,” quartz dust, humming crystal) and feel inseparable from the story’s stakes and final image. The fracture and the caves actively shape options, and the central pillar plus pearl function as a charged environmental device, not mere backdrop. Detail is economical yet lush, though occasionally edges toward overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    The disused ivy-choked station, cracked platform, rusty bench, and graffiti bathroom are vivid, coherent, and tightly filtered through Mira’s sensibility. Recurring setting elements (ivy whispering, the waiting room, the bathroom, the tracks) mirror her internal state and explicitly charge the final “threshold” image. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactical options, but it meaningfully frames and intensifies every beat of her interior journey. The accordion and map, as embedded objects in the setting, become charged tools for reconfiguring her relationship to the past.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.3)
    The mist, forest, and glowing library are vivid and consistent, and the environment shapes both mood and action (the fog-bound path, the pulsing glow, the spiral descent). The library’s architecture—spiraling shelves, breathing leather, ticking depths—mirrors the cipher and maze of meaning in a purposeful way. The setting directly charges the final image of the glowing library in mist waiting for the next letter. A slight limitation is that the environment constrains atmosphere more than concrete tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    The velvet observatory, jasmine, ice-crystal violin, telescope, and central garden are vivid and sensorially rich, with strong POV-filtered specificity. Setting meaningfully shapes choices: planting “in the heart of the observatory, where the earth remembers songs” is only possible because of this peculiar space, and the observatory becomes the final-image sanctuary that reweights the stakes. Objects-as-setting (coffee dish, telescope, violin) recur to charge the ending. Description occasionally leans lush, but it remains purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    The skyborne grotto, aurora, void, and emerald archive are vivid and specific, with the aurora’s “band of green” and the crystal floor’s edge to the void directly shaping how Elara works. Setting is not postcard; it’s functional—she must align chip to auroral frequency at the grotto’s threshold, and the final image of ten thousand chips flickering in their niches charges the theme of distilled last moments. World rules feel internally consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition dumps. The atmosphere of cosmic, suspended stillness permeates the piece and tangibly underwrites the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is rich and integrated: the Umbral Grotto, cloud-sea, ancient yew, and vineyard all feel tactile and specific, with consistent magical rules (memory-grapes, moonlit sigil). Details are filtered through Elara’s working familiarity—clouds like “spilled milk,” vines as “dark serpents,” scalloped shears as technique, not ornament. Environment and objects (tree, hairpin, vines, grotto mouth) shape what she can do, especially the need to climb and to prune in particular ways, and the final jam in the stone cottage recharges those places. It stops just short of 9+ because the environment constrains gently rather than decisively under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lighthouse, wind, dawn light, and chimes provide a coherent, sensorially specific atmosphere that’s tightly tied to the protagonist’s perceptions. Setting objects—the lantern, cloak, shard, and chimes—recur and are reweighted, especially the shard refracting dawn and the wind animating the “language” of chimes. The environment constrains some choices (waiting on the chimes, unhooking the lantern) but mostly supports mood rather than hard tactical limits. Still, the final image of departing the breezy lighthouse at dawn with shard and cloak charged by prior beats gives the setting real closing weight.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is richly imagined—magnetic grotto, floating granite slab, sycamore canopy, starlit pond—and these elements recur in ways that charge the final images. The environment isn’t mere backdrop; the grotto’s field creates backward aging and memory loss, and the pond’s rings become the core interpretive method and closure device. Sensory detail and atmosphere are consistent and purposeful, though occasionally on the edge of over-lush. The world rules (magnetic pulse, reverse aging) feel internally stable within this poetic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.0)
    The bone towers and canyon of echoes are vivid, sensorially grounded, and integrated into action: they turn wind into voices, vibrate with skimming tones, and function as the literal infrastructure of time-maps. The environment is not backdrop but constraint—movement risks sacrilege and temporal disturbance—so her stillness and reliance on sound are meaningfully shaped by place. At the end, the towers become “markers on a temporal map” and their echoes “roads between ages,” directly charging the final image. The specificity and consistency of this setting would be hard to replace without breaking the story’s logic and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    The world is vivid and specific: the Refactory, the icebound spire, mist-walking, and the repository of dying artifacts all feel textured and coherent. Setting details are well filtered through Vorrin’s priorities (automation vs organic magic), and the spire environment—cold preservation, “cathedral of dying light”—directly charges the final image of him staying and dissolving there. The keystone as an object-as-setting is strongly integrated at the end. A slightly broader sensory range (beyond the heavy visual and temperature emphasis) could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting work is rich and specific—the pier, meteor hush, sunken library, and sky lanterns create a coherent, immersive atmosphere. Environmental elements (lamps, water, ship’s library, lanterns) are not mere backdrop; they channel his search and charge the final images. Sensory detail across sight, sound, and even taste/smell (“tasted of silver and smelled of rain”) deepens the world without confusion. The sunken library and pier-light line explicitly frame the guiding-vow theme at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ambered observatory, resin walls, compressed nebulae, and brass telescope are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elara’s attention. Setting is not mere backdrop: the coins on the deck, the amber she presses her forehead against, and the observatory as her final “vessel” all charge the ending image. World rules around static, coins, and contracted universe feel internally consistent and learned through use rather than exposition. A slight gap is that the environment rarely constrains physical options; it’s more symbolic and atmospheric than tactical, though it still strongly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ancient observatory at twilight is vivid and functionally integrated: its lens, prism, and meridian circle enable the magic of “scattering light” to crystallize fears, and dusk’s last sun provides a temporal and atmospheric constraint. Details like “patterns of broken gold” and the later “sharp silver of stars” evolve with the scene rather than sitting as postcard backdrops. The setting also subtly mirrors her role—an elevated, lonely vantage point, built for seeing what others cannot. It stops just short of 9-band because the environment shapes method and mood more than it forces hard tactical trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sapphire viaduct, dawn light, dripping water, and silent sea are vividly rendered and tightly integrated into action: the drips determine timing, the crystals amplify sound, and the meeting of shadow and sun frames the ritual’s fulcrum. The bell and viaduct function as charged objects/structures that literally constrain tactics and symbolically charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with light, water, stone, and sound all doing work without feeling touristic or static. This is strong, economical worldbuilding fully in service of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the receding reservoir, ghost outlines of the drowned town, rusted water tower, damp earth, old wood, and the dark levee station all feel tactile and coherent. Environmental details are nicely filtered through Nora’s professional and personal lens, and recurring images (reservoir as mirror, wind chime, sapphire label) help charge the final calm. However, the landscape mostly shapes mood rather than constraining or forcing choices; it enriches the piece but doesn’t fully function as an active pressure on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, original, and consistently filtered through the character’s sensibility: silver apples, kaleidoscopic waterfall, and singing crystal all feel of the same world. Environmental elements are not mere backdrop; apples brighten at the crystal’s song, the orchard’s roots metaphorically “drink” reason and intuition, and the canopy absorbs star-shards at the end. The final image of her sleeping beneath the oldest tree, beneath new-made stars, is charged by all the earlier world-building. The one restraint is that the environment rarely constrains concrete options; it primarily mirrors and amplifies interior change.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.1)
    The “nocturnal arbor above the clouds,” data-vines, and city below are vivid and distinctive, with the arbor’s swaying under fluctuating tether tension nicely tying environment to stakes. The recurring vertical imagery—above/below, tether, clouds—creates a clear spatial and tonal field that supports the watchful, precarious mood. Still, the setting mostly frames rather than constrains choices; beyond one vibration and some swaying, the environment doesn’t force or alter tactics. More tactile interaction with the physical space under pressure could make it feel indispensable rather than atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    The floating rock dojo, vast sky, and temporal storm are vivid and tonally apt, mirroring his inner void and later reconstruction. Environmental shifts (dojo flickering between “ancient and newborn,” then crumbling) effectively echo and charge the closure. However, the setting rarely constrains concrete choices; the same arc could mostly occur in a non-floating dojo. Strong atmosphere and symbolic integration, slightly less strong as a functional constraint on action.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.0)
    The nocturnal brook setting and storm-quiet atmosphere are vividly rendered—moonlight, damp soil, “storm born silence,” and the brook’s “song” create a strong sensory frame. These details are well filtered through Mara’s creative preoccupations, especially the river/flow metaphors. However, the environment rarely constrains her choices; the brook could be swapped for another tranquil setting without materially altering the arc. The clearest functional use is the root reaching toward the water and the brook’s thematic echo in the final lines, which gives the setting some closing charge.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    The echo chamber tunnel, house above, and autumn wind are sensually and functionally integrated: the tunnel amplifies sound, carries lullabies, and later captures the siblings’ voices, while the cord is a concrete interface between realms. Details are selective and purposeful (“concrete walls slick with memory and groundwater,” “wind…like a choir of broken kazoos”), and the micro-setting constrains the haunting method rather than being decorative. The final image of the tunnel keeping her music recharges the opening and charges the environment with ongoing meaning. A touch more physical choreography of the house/tunnel relationship might heighten it to the very top tier, but as is it’s highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    The frozen garden, mist, and stone tablets are vivid and consistently filtered through the guardian’s sensibility as a being of libraries and thresholds. Setting actively constrains options (trapped in a single, snow-locked courtyard) and then charges the ending: “the garden remained frozen, the mist remained thick, but the guardian moved through both like a word through silence.” The pendant functions as an object-as-setting, a micro-environment whose geometry and “boundary of light” reconfigure what the guardian can perceive and do. The only small limit is that environmental constraint stays conceptual rather than forcing tactile problem-solving or embodied risk.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the ember nexus, ruined Cathedral, ash spirals, and eventual glass tree are not postcard backdrops but the core machinery and imagery of the story. Environmental elements (embers, ash, crozier, twilight) evolve with the action and charge the final image of a land in beautiful undeath where time moves differently. The ember nexus and frozen blooms concretely embody the theme of suspended transformation and incomplete life. This tight integration of atmosphere, object, and closure easily clears a high bar.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned radio tower city over a black gorge is vivid and specific, with details like mossed steel, swaying platforms, and humming “ghost frequencies” giving a strong lived-in feel. The environment constrains and shapes action (she climbs, strips gear, rewires copper on the tower itself) rather than sitting as backdrop. Cosmic elements—the gorge, moon, and perigee—are integrated into atmosphere and theme, not just spectacle. The final image of the hundred dark towers “waiting” is strongly charged by everything we’ve learned about this setting.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.5)
    The ferry, sideways clocks, spectral grotto, and starlight threads are vivid and specific, giving the piece a strong atmosphere. The hourglass and grotto meaningfully charge the magic and final image, so setting is not merely decorative. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics beyond “this is where the merge happens,” and the physicality of the boat and sea could be more tactically engaged. Sensory range is somewhat narrow (dominated by visual and sound) but still effective at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Optical Illusion Gallery is vividly imagined and integral, not backdrop: breathing walls, moving stairs, and reactive paintings all participate in the crisis. Environmental rules stay internally consistent (illusions becoming real, time tied to memory) and directly affect events, especially when the sea painting literally bursts. The gallery also charges the final image—the pristine yet changed space “breathing on” underpins the quiet, uncanny closure. Detail is lush but purposeful, maintaining clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    The benthic city, pressure layers, thermocline, bioluminescent tattoos, and Tethians’ refracted bodies all feel specific and sensorially grounded, constantly filtering through Mara’s professional lens. The recurring anchor link functions as a micro-setting object that constrains meaning and decisively charges the final image. Environmental conditions (depth, darkness, pressure, absent sky) are not just decorative; they define what navigation can be and why starlight becomes an inner construct. A small deduction comes from occasional abstract description where one more concrete sensory cue could heighten the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mist-clad atrium, stone pillars, marble floor, and dew-slicked surfaces create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that meshes with the liminal dead-calling hour. Details are selective and purposeful, repeatedly tying setting to mood and function (echoing pulses, fog, glass shattering). The photograph and the hearing aid operate as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, but it does heavily charge tone and thematic space.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    The undersea facility, the converging cables like “neural pathways,” and the moon pool/phase-transition machinery are vivid and integrated into action rather than static description. Environmental features (pressure, flooding corridors, tidal window) directly shape what Marek can do and charge the final image of the facility “returning to the deep’s silent custody.” The codex and the cables function as micro-settings that constrain how memory can be accessed. A slight tempering of abstract phrasing in a few lines could make the physicality of the space feel even more tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    The opal observatory, snow, old-circuit air, ink, and porcelain shard create a vivid, coherent atmosphere, and the recurring objects (ink, shard, terminal) meaningfully charge the final image. The environment functions mostly as mood and metaphor rather than as a hard physical constraint, but the observatory and “machine” heartbeat parallel the protagonist’s ghosted status in a way that feels integral. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, rarely lapsing into cataloguing. The shard and ink in particular operate as effective micro-settings that frame action and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is vivid, strange, and fully integrated: bone towers, canyon of echoes, tunnel of polished calcium, and spinebirds all constrain what is possible and how translation can occur. Environmental features directly shape tactics (using the tunnel to amplify, embedding the diamond in bone) and charge the final image. Sensory detail (“air tasted of fossilized thunder,” copper resonances) is precise and POV-filtered rather than touristic. The final bone-tower/canyon images reappear as witnesses, giving the world a subtle, charged presence in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    The subterranean herb garden under a “frostbitten crust” is vivid and specific, with glowing moonwort, dried sage, and responsive vines that visually manifest the gravitational play. The environment actively participates in the climax—the garden laughs, plants defy gravity—so setting is more than backdrop. The old phone and the arrowhead feel naturally embedded in this space rather than pasted in. While the mountain and frost motif don’t literally constrain choices, they charge the emotional palette and final thaw imagery effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “iron orchard,” sky-bridge, statues, and clocktower form a vivid, original environment that constantly interacts with the action (roots answering her rhythm, tower sending a counter-pulse). Setting details are selective and charged rather than encyclopedic, and the orchard’s transformation at the end strongly charges the final image. The world’s magic/technology rules stay internally consistent and are mostly learned through events, not exposition. Minor room remains to show more tactical navigation of physical space under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt arcade, neon, ozone, and drones create a vivid, specific world that feels tactile and distinct. Setting is not postcard-only: the disputed zone, lone mail-drop window, and liminal commerce all constrain tactics and make his cross-border work plausible. The thunderstorm bottle and arcade rooftop function as charged micro-settings that shape how he can deliver the message. The final image of neon, drizzle, and brittle hush recharges earlier environmental details to carry emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned circus train and hidden garden car are vividly rendered with strong sensory specificity—“peeling paint, shattered mirrors, ghost-light,” “moss and a single silver spring.” Setting and objects (halo, center pole, wind bells, mist) are integrated into action and final imagery rather than tacked-on description. While the environment doesn’t strictly constrain tactics, it deeply charges the closure image as the train “exhales” and becomes a sanctuary. The atmosphere is cohesive and supports the lyric, haunted tone throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    The scientific poetry library is richly and consistently realized, from “hyperbolic geometry aisle—where shelves curved away from each other like the surface of a saddle” to books as black holes with event-horizon dog-ears and memories woven into spacetime pages. Setting is not just decorative: non-Euclidean architecture and the physicalized nature of texts are the very means by which the portal is opened and the zeroth volume accessed, and they charge the final image of constellated stains on the ceiling. The world’s rules (stories as gravitational entities, equations that rhyme) remain internally consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition. At this length, the density of setting detail is well-judged and tightly integrated with the story’s core moves.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and tightly integrated: the whispering archipelago, floating library, volcanic island, and dawn sky all actively shape options (moving islands, the risk of daylight, the summit vantage for photography). Tools and micro-setting—the camera and watercolor palette—function as extensions of environment and directly constrain tactics. The world’s rules (dreams as shelved objects, light as paintable, islands that whisper) stay consistent and are learned through action, not exposition. At elite level, this is strong work; a slight sense of decorative flourish in some later island/whisper mentions keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “shadowed nexus” and starlit alley are vividly rendered and thematically apt as a liminal hinge between worlds. Environmental specifics (pawnshop roof, keyhole-shaped shadow, the door with no sign) feel purposeful, not decorative, and the first star’s angle literally governs the magic. The setting supports the tone of cosmic hush and reinforces Merrin’s role as interpreter of a locked universe. It stops just short of using environment to actively constrain difficult choices, which keeps it out of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse, shipwreck ring, and bioluminescent lagoon are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with plot (the wrecks as Pleiades, the greenhouse architecture echoing the fairy ring). Environmental specifics constrain choices—in particular, the geometry of wrecks/glass and the seasonal mushroom ecology—and the final image of the glowing mushroom and shipwreck constellations feels earned and charged. Details consistently filter through Elias’s folklorist lens, avoiding tourist-catalog listing. This is very close to exemplary scene-setting at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    The forgotten library, mossed stone, marble floors, and the empty swing outside create a textured, unified atmosphere that’s both visual and conceptual. The swing and hush recur and are explicitly reweighted at the end, charging the final image of a “library no longer forgotten.” Objects-as-setting (shard, teapot, mug) are integrated into action rather than listed. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, it consistently mirrors and shapes the thematic register of exile and resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.8)
    The border-orchard, parapet, and waterfall are vividly imagined and tightly integrated into the logic of the magic—the waterfall’s “betweenness” directly enables her weaving and the parapet physically and symbolically marks the edge of worlds. Sensory detail is selective but strong (mist, stone, moss spelling unseen languages), and the environment evolves with events (reversing waterfall, door-bearing trees, permanent hush). The final image is charged by this setting: the waterfall’s song and rustling orchard embody the reconfigured order. It stops just short of 9+ because the physical constraints of the environment never significantly limit her tactics or create friction beyond the ritual itself.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prism sanctuary, refracted starlight, net, and masks create a vivid, specific environment that is inseparable from the story’s mechanics and mood. The setting isn’t backdrop: the sanctuary is “built for this,” and the starlight/prism motif literally and thematically refracts silence into shareable story, charging the final images (net across the doorway, starlight as forgiveness). The tapestry needle and pearl operate as micro-setting objects that control action and closure. Rich description flirts with density but remains purposeful and filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: studio smells of “old parchment and wood glue,” the “rain-scoured fresco vaults,” and the henge stones all feel tactile and lived-in. Environmental details matter causally—the storms justify the repainted fresco concealing the door and the weathered stone invites her touch that opens the passage. The final image of the restored map with a silver thread bridges studio and landscape, charging the environment with thematic weight. This is a strong, economical use of setting that supports both action and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sunken library is vivid, specific, and thematically charged—“colonized by anemones and sorrow” is both image and thesis. Environment and recurring object fuse: the brass chest, the drowned books, and the pressing water concretize the idea of preserved-yet-decaying memory and constrain the action to delicate, slow work. The setting meaningfully charges the final image of leaving the library to sediment while carrying the globe to the surface. Details are economical yet immersive, and they always serve character and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “misty courtyard above the clouds” and the city’s “forgotten alleys, where walls wept with old paint” are vividly rendered and tonally unified, giving the piece a strong, specific atmosphere. Setting images recur and evolve (mist thickening, courtyard trembling and then dissolving, mist returning when the scribe sings), so place participates in the emotional cadence. However, the environment rarely constrains choices; it frames and amplifies rather than forcing different tactics. Still, the courtyard dissolving at the climax charges the final image in a satisfying way.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    The icebound spire, glass elevator, and prismatic light are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the story’s mechanics; the environment isn’t postcard décor but the necessary medium for the optical encryption. Details like “ancient ice that scattered sunlight into a thousand fractured colors” both build atmosphere and explain the diary’s conditions of legibility. The altitude/ice interplay directly constrains choice and charges the final image of Kai in the captain’s quarters. It’s beautifully handled, though the atmosphere, while rich, stops short of the absolute uncanny singularity that would push this into the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    The gondola, broken cable, clouds, and instruments create a vivid, integrated setting that is inseparable from the premise. Details like the gondola’s tilt, hissing cable, and “dusty starlight” are filtered through Mara’s meteorological and emotional lens, reinforcing both profession and theme. The environment constrains and colors her actions (derelict station, dead instruments leave her with only telescope and tapes) and the final image of the gondola as a “cradle of memory” is strongly charged. A slightly broader sensory range beyond the visual and auditory would deepen immediacy further.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tree-trunk library and “hollowed heart” motif are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Kael’s artistic perception, giving the piece a strong, tactile atmosphere. Environmental details (bark cracking, demolition siren, dust) meaningfully charge the stakes of preservation vs. erasure. The setting doesn’t just decorate; the living-wood library and its impending destruction directly shape what he can attempt (a last mural) and what it costs. This is rich, though just shy of transcendent because the environment constrains mood and premise more than concrete tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    The antique airship, starling murmurations, ozone-scented chart room, and Whispering Crag are vividly rendered and tonally integrated. Details are filtered through Elara’s cartographic lens (coordinates, bearings, altitude) which grounds the lyricism. The stranded luminance and carved rocks charge the final image and anchor the world’s sense of wonder. Setting rarely constrains choice or tactics, though; it decorates more than it pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.0)
    The frozen library, clouds, frost, and mirrors are vividly rendered and recur in ways that support tone and action. The environment meaningfully participates: frost and ice give way as time is mended, and the hall of mirrors is both physical obstacle and conceptual arena. Details such as the “frost-rimmed doorway,” “dust danced like memories,” and the thaw at the end integrate setting with theme rather than feeling like static décor. World rules remain consistent within a fabulist frame, and spatial orientation is always clear.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    The orchard planet, floating rock arches, and nebula of respite are vivid and specific, and the environment meaningfully shapes action (the hidden reservoir in the arches, the water mist spiraling upward). The butterfly garden and watering bell are tactile micro-settings that anchor key beats and recur at the ending. World rules are consistent and learned through image and action, not infodumps. At times, description leans slightly toward decorative lyricism rather than constraint, keeping it just below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and heavily integrated: the hidden lighthouse, spiral stairs, pane of hush, and frozen ocean all mirror and constrain the story’s temporal and emotional logic. The pane of hush and the lighthouse lens are not just backdrop but functional tools, translating motion into memory and defining how a lullaby can exist without sound. Environmental details evolve with events (ocean learning to breathe, lighthouse becoming monument) and clearly charge the final images. The world’s rules around silence and time feel consistent and learned through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    The orchard, cliff, labyrinth, frost, and clockwork birds are vividly rendered and consistently rule-bound, with environmental constraints (frost, height, patrol paths) directly shaping tactics. Details are POV-filtered—roots like desperate fingers, frost as crystalline fingers—enriching atmosphere without museum-touring. The nut’s shadow and the mechanical birds function as micro-setting elements that literally structure the route and the ending image. This is elite-level scene-grounding and atmosphere with both beauty and menace tightly integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    The braided ravine, the twin channels, the foam patterns, and later the lab and city lights are specific and strongly filtered through Elena’s scientific and musical sensibility. The environment isn’t just backdrop; the river’s split and later merging, plus the physical act of dropping the chrysalis, actively charge the emotional and thematic turns. However, the setting functions more as lyrical mirror than as a concrete constraint on options or tactics, which keeps it just shy of the very top tier. The occupational world of polymer chemistry is sketched enough to feel plausible without bogging the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glass orchard library above a cloud sea is striking, consistent, and thematically charged, with books as leaves, narratives as fruit, and discarded stories composted into new ones. The setting isn’t mere backdrop; its elevation and lantern-like drift frame the vendor’s threshold existence and the distance between her and the writing woman. Recurring environmental images (orchard rustling, clouds, stars as puncture wounds) meaningfully charge the final image. While the setting could constrain choices more overtly, it already shapes the story’s conceptual stakes and mood at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is strikingly specific and integrated: desert fortress, post-rain dunes, coral icebound pavilion, and tidal pools all feel tactile and are filtered through the chef’s professional/emotional lens. Environment directly shapes action (rain reveals the pavilion; pools = remorse fossils; coral droplet as memory ingestion) and charges the final image (pavilion waiting beneath dunes, fortress as “sturdy” yet brittle). Sensory detail is rich but purposeful, extending beyond the visual into taste and texture. The world’s surreal rules remain consistent and legible without expository drag.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is distinctive and memorable: multilingual grain elevators and an astronomical clock tower form a coherent symbolic and physical landscape. Details like the brass weight engraved with wheat sheaves effectively fuse environment, tool, and theme. The world’s rules are clear and consistent, and setting imagery evolves toward the festival and illuminated clock face. While the environment influences meaning more than it constrains tactical options, it decisively charges the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.3)
    The moonlit canyon is richly and consistently rendered, with the geology-as-neurology conceit (“phosphorescent minerals that stored memories like a neurological substrate”) doing real work. Setting is not just backdrop; it’s the medium of entangled memories and the site of “geological synaptic plasticity,” clearly charging the final image of dawn and new deposits. Sensory detail is mostly visual but purposeful and strongly atmospheric. The one gap is that the physical environment rarely constrains her choices in a concrete way—it shapes meaning more than tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    The serpentine grotto, mist, inverted gravity, and forest are vividly rendered and integrated into action (alcoves only visible under reversed gravity, slick walls, floating drift). The prism and manuscript serve as concrete anchors that recur and charge the final image. World rules—gravity inversion window, threshold shimmer—are consistent and easy to track. Setting does influence options, though it could press more tightly on her choices to reach the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    The siskin alder grove, porcelain sculpture, and small animals create a vivid, continuous environment that shapes mood and meaning throughout. The grove functions as a resonant chamber both literally and metaphorically, directly charging the central images of music-in-silence. Details like moss, alder cones, and the lantern evolve with the day’s passage and inflect the ending’s hush. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactical options, but it deeply charges the final image and is inseparable from the piece’s effect.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    The magnetic nexus, lodestone gravel, and twilight sky are richly and consistently evoked, with the environment’s odd physics (spinning compasses, humming ground) filtering through Kael’s expert perception. Setting is not just backdrop: the nexus’s pulses are his medium for translating silence and the place where the covenant is “sealed,” and the stone left there in the final image is charged by the world’s rules. The twilight/eclipse axis deepens the mood and thematic sense of liminality without feeling like generic atmosphere. World rules stay stable and legible despite the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    The workshop under stars and the fireworks create a strong, coherent atmosphere that mirrors the inner journey from enclosed shadow to shared starlight. Objects-as-setting (radio, clasp, diary) are vividly rendered and recur meaningfully. The environment mostly frames emotion rather than constraining choice, so it’s evocative but not fully weaponized against the character. Still, the final image of the quiet workshop under the indifferent stars is well-charged by prior details.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.5)
    The treetop village, perpetual mist, canopy bridges, and sensory-rich flora create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere, especially through smell and organic materials (acorn vial, moss cork, petrified wood). Details are filtered through Elias’s herbalist sensibility, which grounds the lyricism. The setting mostly functions as mood and texture rather than as a hard constraint on choices, so it doesn’t fully charge the final image in a structural way. Still, the world feels particular and lived in, not generic.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and original: floating rock arches, inversion hour, silver rivers, and the sky-chamber are all sharply rendered and filtered through Kael’s practical focus. World rules (gravity inversion, geosynchronous warning, water as navigation aid) are consistent and mostly learned through action rather than dump. The environment materially shapes tactics—she times her launch, rides inverted water currents, and accesses a phenomenon that exists only in the arch during inversion. A slight overreliance on expository explanation of the glyphs/colonists, rather than dramatized interaction with those details, keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    The port’s “towering labyrinth” of containers and the wind-funneling corridors are vivid, specific, and tightly integrated with plot and method. Setting isn’t a backdrop: it dictates where she walks, what she measures, and how the accident is understood, and the final image of the labyrinth fading in the mirror reinforces the thematic web of forces. Sensory detail leans visual and atmospheric but is consistently filtered through her professional eye. This is one of the story’s strongest aspects and approaches high-end literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ice cavern, aurora, and bells are vividly rendered, with strong sensory interplay of color, sound, and cold that feels integral rather than decorative. The environment constrains the action (she needs the aurora there; the hush is literally carved into the ice) and charges the final image of a “cathedral of oscillating repose.” Details are consistently filtered through Lyra’s synesthetic perception, which sharpens atmosphere. A slight tendency toward repeated abstract phrases keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Thunder-echo range is vividly rendered—purple bruised sky, stone pillars, canyon hush, thunder echoes—and consistently filtered through the keeper’s sensibility. Environment shapes movement and meaning: he seeks the pass “where the thunder echoed longest,” the dry riverbed and driftwood enable his self-made navigation system, and the hush/silence directly charge the thematic stakes. The recurring interplay of thunder versus hush and stars/dust versus stone materially charges the final image of him walking home under “unspoken thunder.” A slight surplus of atmospheric description edges toward luxuriance but mostly serves tone and theme rather than stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    The topaz workshop, iron press, and vanishing stars create a distinctive, coherent atmosphere that is tightly interwoven with the emotional and conceptual stakes. Details like “topaz walls” reflecting starlight and the halo fragment’s light bleeding into lead type are vivid and POV-filtered through Cassian’s analytic yet mystical gaze. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain his choices, but it does meaningfully charge the final image when the stars vanish and only the workshop’s residual glow remains. World rules (halo fragment, transposition) are consistent and learned through on-page action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway, observatory, and silver-leafed tree are vividly realized and consistently threaded through the story, with the environment clearly charging the final image of the living ridge and legendary tree. The aurora’s rhythm echoing the pendant’s hum and the ridge as a liminal place between earth and sky feel purposeful rather than decorative. Setting is filtered well through the courier’s role and longing for wonder. The only limitation is that weather/terrain never significantly constrain action beyond mood, keeping it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    The quartz arbor, mist, frost, and rusting Volvo are vivid and particular, and the setting is deeply entwined with the premise of memory-recording. Environment functions as more than backdrop: quartz as medium, mist as preserving agent, and frost as display surface all constrain how and where the experiment can happen. The final dawn image—arbor “less solid” after absorbing something—beautifully charges the setting with the story’s thematic stakes. A few descriptive flourishes verge on luxuriant, but they remain coherent with Seraphine’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    The orchard and bamboo forest are vividly realized and tonally congruent, with details like the “forgotten orchard,” “deepening hush,” and the single falling plum sharpening the final image. Setting feels integrated with theme—the isolation and overgrown quiet mirror Mei’s grief and the world’s fraying silence—rather than postcard description. The loom and shuttle function as micro-setting tools that channel and constrain the magic. However, the physical environment rarely forces concrete tactical choices; it’s more atmospheric than structurally constraining, keeping this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.5)
    The orchard planet and floating blue arches are vivid and specific, with the azure dust, abandoned shafts, and heart-chamber creating a cohesive, tactile environment. Setting is not decorative: the arches’ decay incites the plot, the mine shafts dictate method, and the reborn orchards charge the final image. World rules (arch-stone, silk, sleeping vs dying arches) hold together and are revealed through Ren’s actions rather than heavy exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.0)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay is clearly evoked—rusted hull plates, cracked concrete, dust—and the shard-as-object has good physical presence. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or tactics; she could perform the same weave in almost any empty sci-fi space. Atmosphere supports tone, but the setting doesn’t evolve or bear much causal weight as the scene escalates. This keeps it from feeling indispensable rather than illustrative.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse, lantern room, cairn of stones, and sea are vividly and economically rendered, with details (rust, salt crust, mossy rocks, churning dark) filtered through Caleb’s professional eye. Setting is not just backdrop: the lantern room’s haunting, the steps, and the cliffside cairn directly shape his tactics and options. Recurring objects (lamp, sea glass, bottle, stones) charge the final image and embody the thematic stakes. Atmosphere (“luminescent ache”) is consistent and organically anchored in physical environment.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.6)
    The emerald lighthouse, glass wick, roiling sea, and “digital fog” are vivid, specific, and consistently returned to, giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine. The mechanics of the crystal wick and beam do affect tactics (she adjusts angle, uses it to reach the ship), so the environment is not just backdrop. Sensory range is mostly visual and conceptual, but it feels intentional and tonally controlled rather than thin. This is a strong, publishable setting treatment, even if it stops short of a fully constraining, embodied environment.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating rock tea house, valley mist, and pigment workshop are vivid, coherent, and deeply integrated; sensory detail around light, dust, and altitude is consistently filtered through the master’s craft-obsessed gaze. The environment meaningfully charges the final images: sun trails across pigment and fabric, the tea house rising to cloud-level, and valley mist all reinforce liminality and the master’s function as threshold. The blue morpho dust and sun path function as micro-setting tools that constrain the master’s method—tracking light becomes an in-world technique, not just an image. This is rich, purposeful atmosphere that rarely lapses into generic description, though it flirts with decorative density in places.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    The labyrinth, stormlit tower, moonbeam, and memory-glowing trees are vivid, cohesive, and strongly filtered through Elara’s task and sensibility. Environment and tools meaningfully constrain choice—the need for moonlight, the climb up the spiral stairs, the storm-parted clouds enabling the sextant’s healing. The final garden of trees completes the spatial journey in a way that recharges the entire setting logic. Description is rich without becoming disorienting or overloaded.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse and mirror world are vividly realized through specific, sensuous detail (fermenting apples, copper, silver leaves, mica window). Setting elements meaningfully interact with the stakes: endless night and leached trees embody the realm’s dying state, and the greenhouse converting sorrow into fruit meshes with the thematic work of transmuting loss into hope. World rules remain internally consistent and are conveyed through image rather than exposition dumps. The only restraint on a higher score is that the environment mostly serves as rich backdrop rather than constraining his concrete choices in moment-to-moment action.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bookstore and hidden door create an evocative, atmospheric setting, with nice touches like the “water-stained ceilings,” “shelf marked ‘Philosophy—Obscure,’” and the corridor of light. The environment supports tone and theme (hidden in plain sight, nested paradoxes) and the midnight clock gives a temporal frame. Still, description is mostly abstract and symbolic; the space rarely constrains her physically or tactically in specific ways. The secret-society library twist is strong but more conceptual than sensorially grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: rusted palace gates, abandoned bakery, overgrown courtyard, and the tucked-away tea house all feel tactile and lived-in. Environmental details consistently echo theme without feeling purely decorative (ivy consuming the wall versus Mara’s cultivated herbs; wet earth and possibility in winter). The courtyard/tea house micro-setting genuinely shapes the story—its seclusion enables her rebellion and later becomes the public garden. This is just shy of top-tier only because the environment constrains mood and secrecy more than concrete tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    The frozen library above the clouds, quartz hush, and frosted shelves are vivid and coherent, with the environment participating in the climax as shelves “creak with renewed strength.” Detail is selective and focused on light, ice, and altitude, which suits the tone. However, the sensory palette leans heavily on repeated images (quartz, hush, luminous, frost) without much evolution, limiting depth. The setting supports the thematic stakes but stops short of constraining specific tactical choices beyond being cold and fragile.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.3)
    The rotting pier and hidden pirate market are vividly evoked through texture—salt, old fish, lantern light—and consistently filtered through the narrator’s lived familiarity. Setting constrains action in meaningful ways: the space beneath the pier allows stealth, the ancient beam hides the compartment, and the dawn light brackets the clandestine world. The watch fob functions as a micro-setting tool, literally unlocking the environment and charging the final image. Weather and tide don’t strongly shape tactics, but the atmosphere of damp, precarious decay amplifies the theme of fragile truces.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is a major strength: lavender bluff, aurora, forest elections, and fungal root-networks underwrite both mood and mechanism, and the taste-based reading of place is consistently embodied. Environment and object-as-setting (the ring, the bluff, the aurora) clearly charge the final images and define what is possible—this experience could only happen here, in this ecology. World rules (root-voting, weather-carriers as atmospheric compromise) are taught through observation rather than infodump, and they remain internally coherent. A minor ceiling point is that the bluff does not materially constrain physical options so much as frame perception, keeping the pressure mostly atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vivid and integrated: humming crystals, mineral-streaked painting, and tomb→womb imagery all echo Elena’s inner state. The environment isn’t just backdrop; it provides seclusion, amplifies silence, hosts the hidden chamber, and its charged transformation at the end meaningfully reweights the story. Details are selective yet specific, avoiding generic fantasy-cave texture. The setting strongly charges the final image of rebirth through art.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    The greenhouse city under a toxic sky, the vents, the water-reclamation plant, and the brittle tape archive all feel vivid and integrated. Environmental conditions (toxicity outside, controlled air and plants inside) support the thematic contrast between poisoned lies and sheltered, oxygen-like truth. Setting details like the vines seeking light, the sour air, and the “oasis of memory” at the end charge the final image. The world’s mechanics remain suggestive rather than deeply systematized, but they are coherent at this length and never feel like postcards.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the whispering bluff, thin air, and impossible iceberg fragments are not just scenery but the physical conditions that make her art and the ice’s half-thawed state possible. Altitude’s “strange magic” and the treacherous climb for villagers concretely tether environment to choice and cost. The final images—the iceberg glistening, blue shadows on the clouds, color flooding back—are powered by this specific location. World rules stay consistent within the fable-like mode and clearly charge the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glass-domed desert rose farm is vividly rendered and functionally crucial: the dome’s geometry, fire-suppression protocols, and failing systems directly constrain what the caretaker can do. Environmental details (golden sap, fossilized footprints, LEDs flickering, magnetic north drifting) are specific and thematically charged without reading like a catalogue. The world’s rules—magnetic interference affecting circuits, controlled burns for roses—are consistent and learned through action, not exposition. Setting actively shapes the climax (fire contained by dome + glitch) and charges the final quiet with a sense of fragile equilibrium.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    The courtyard, adobe walls, jasmine, and ancient mailbox are vivid and recur meaningfully, especially the mailbox and jasmine as functional anchors for mystery and solution. Dawn as a temporal and atmospheric motif supports the gentle, hopeful tone and the idea of stories “rising” with coffee steam. Setting is filtered through community use (offerings, gossip, benches), giving it social texture rather than postcard flatness. It could press more directly on choices under peak pressure, but it clearly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.3)
    The sunken laboratory, black water, rust, and flickering diodes establish an evocative, oppressive atmosphere that’s consistent throughout. The spider’s web and the hangman’s dice work as micro-setting objects that shape mood and subtly guide Lyra’s tactics (patience, encoded chance). The eventual flooding is grounded in the environment and refigures the water from menace to baptism, charging the final image. A slight drawback is that the lab’s physical layout and constraints stay somewhat abstract, limiting how tactically the setting can shape specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The harbor, docks, gravity pockets, and salt crystal chamber are vividly rendered with multi-sensory specificity; setting is inseparable from the premise. Environmental rules (grief-induced gravity anomalies) remain consistent and constrain his movement and experience (dragging steps, warped breath, bent flame). The chamber in particular is not a postcard but a functional micro-setting that provides both resource and pressure. A slight trim in descriptive density at one or two points might sharpen momentum further, but the world-building is already at a very high level.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    The nocturnal brookside haven is vivid and specific—willows, smooth stones, moss-covered log—and the brook’s physical behavior (whispering, quickening, gurgling) is inseparable from the magic. Setting is not postcard backdrop; the water’s course, the stones, and the log all dictate where cranes can go and how the hush propagates upstream. The environment also mirrors and amplifies the thematic tension between quiet and warning. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that the broader world beyond the grove stays somewhat abstract, so the spatial canvas remains narrow by design.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Murray Building, 7B’s bergamot-scented kitchen, the rooftop garden, and the sealed basement wall are all sharply rendered and folded into action and theme. The basement wall and fresh plaster directly shape the climax, and the meteor shower on the rooftop charges the ritual that follows. Details like “tomatoes grew in salvaged chimney pots” and “nurses’ desperate graffiti” feel particular and lived-in rather than decorative. The setting powerfully mirrors and channels the story’s concerns, though it rarely imposes hard physical constraints on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    The velvet garden is vividly realized and omnipresent—phosphorescent moss, velvet petals, and twilight light all filter through Elara’s scientific yet haunted gaze. The setting isn’t a mere backdrop; it is the membrane between worlds, the locus of the sister’s transformation, and the stage for the final reconfiguration at dawn. Environmental details (petals brushing “reproachful,” star on the horizon) mirror and pressure Elara’s internal shift. The world’s rules (garden as cocoon, resonance through soil) remain consistent, though one more tactile interaction affecting a concrete choice could push this into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, stalactites, and altar mechanism are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action (the aurora-revealed ink, the hidden compartment, the physical use of the thorn). Setting detail is economical and voice-filtered, maintaining a consistent sacred/lyric tone. Environment and specific tools (altar aperture, golden disc) meaningfully constrain choices and are required for the unlinking to occur. Recurring images—the aurora, pearl twilight, dripping stalactites—also charge the final atmosphere without losing spatial clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    The canyon as “serpentine nexus under starlight” is vivid, sensorial, and consistent, and the echoing environment functionally shapes what’s possible—her entire method and vocation rely on how sound behaves in that space. Recurring images (starlight as threads, the canyon breathing, rock crevices holding truth) are well-woven and thematically aligned with memory and echo. The seashell as micro-setting/object is integrated into how she hears, stores, and ultimately silences the voices. The only limit keeping this below elite level is that the environment rarely constrains choice in a concrete, tactical sense; it’s a powerful resonant backdrop more than an active obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.3)
    The glacier shrine, ice-etched glyphs, and half-buried wreck are vividly rendered and strongly tonal, with good integration of light, cold, and sound. The snow globes function as charged micro-settings, anchoring both the ritual and the closing image. While the environment doesn’t sharply constrain tactics beyond atmosphere, it does meaningfully color every action and reinforces the liminal, sacred quality of her work. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, avoiding generic white-room or postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.5)
    The parapet after rain, moon paths, and firefly-lit air are vividly rendered and recur in charged ways, giving the piece a strong, coherent atmosphere. Details like the “whispering parapet” and “moon’s silver track” feel particular to this world and integrated into action. The environment mirrors theme and mood but rarely constrains choices or alters tactics; the same narrative could largely unfold on a pier or hillside. Strong sensory and tonal work lifts the score despite the low pressure function of setting.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and fully integrated: mulberry roots laced with paper, radioactive dust storms, geothermal vents, mutated bees, and the orchard’s impossible greenness all feel lived-in and purposeful. World rules around radiation, the diamond’s refraction pattern, and the orchard’s microclimate are consistent and drive plot logic. Environment actively constrains and charges choices (storms diverting, rad-count anomalies, warmer soil, the orchard’s geometry pointing to the bunker). The final approach to the council under a looming dust wall ties the atmosphere directly into the closing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.3)
    The observatory above the sleeping world, the cobalt glass portico, the storm, vacuum tubes, and rusted antennas are richly specific and strongly filtered through Atlas’s work-obsessed perception. Environment meaningfully affects action (storm scattering notes, lightning revealing etchings) and charges the final image (abandoned observatory, portico as “threshold between eras”). Details feel purposeful rather than touristic, though the piece leans heavily on visual and metaphorical texture over other senses. World rules stay consistent and the setting is inseparable from the story’s logic and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is richly imagined and integrated: the “feral loft beneath the dunes,” breathing sand and memory, shapes both her isolation and her role as a subterranean library under the town. The dunes, sand, boardwalk cafés, and tourist beaches all feed the logic of how she gathers jars and why wind and sound matter. Environment charges the final image—the loft as a place where “the dead could sing” and memories seep up through the dunes to the waking town. A tiny step below top tier only because the physical constraints of the space rarely alter her tactics in specific scenes; they inflect mood more than choice.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    The drift-ice marina and lighthouse world are vividly and economically realized through concrete sensory detail—bronze taste, frozen kelp, snapping coat, rose-gold mirror ice. Environment genuinely constrains choice (boats locked in ice, forced to confront the shadow here and now) and then participates in the solution (the ice singing, forming a bridge). World rules around sound, frequency, and spiritual physics are internally consistent and revealed through action rather than infodump. The final tableau of still, rose-gold ice and emerging stars solidly charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly rendered and deeply integrated into Elara’s methods and constraints—she can cross the ice, exploit post-rain polarity shifts, and use under-ice resonance as her transmission medium. World rules (rain altering polarity, moon paths predicting thaw, ice “singing”) are consistent and learned through her actions rather than dump. The environment meaningfully shapes what she can do and when she can do it, directly charging the final act of disabling the network. Sensory detail (glass-dark ice, skin of light on rails, hum in her teeth) is precise and purposeful without devolving into cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tunnel, water seepage, rust, and darkness are vividly drawn and consistently filtered through Mara’s professional eye and family history. The setting does more than decorate: rust depth, loosened bolts, and scuff marks are all plot-relevant details discovered through her navigation of the space. The lantern functions as a micro-setting object that constrains how she moves and literally/figuratively lights her choices, charging the final image. A slightly broader sensory palette (sound and touch are good; smell and temperature are thinner) is the only thing keeping this from the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.8)
    The workshop is vividly realized—dust motes, silent boxes, tools, and light—and consistently filtered through the chaplain’s sensibility. The music box as object-as-setting is deeply integrated, and the shaft of light through storm clouds in the final image recharges earlier atmospheric cues. The environment genuinely matters (only someone in this exact space can perform this repair), not just as backdrop but as moral and emotional frame. A bit less overt symbolism language around that light motif would make the atmosphere feel even more effortless.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop floating on an acid sea is vivid, idiosyncratic, and consistently integrated into action: her job, the buoyancy engines, the corrosive pressure of the sea, and the climb toward lightning all grow out of it. World rules—self-evolving machinery, ghost logic, dead satellites—are strange but internally coherent and learned through what Zephyr does. The setting meaningfully charges the ending image: the acid sea reflecting the workshop’s new light underlines the shift from mere survival platform to yearning resonator. It stops just shy of perfection because environment rarely constrains a tough on-page choice; it frames rather than forces the key decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.0)
    The archive—with humming servers, corrupted blocks, backup tapes, and a sealed vault—is vivid and meaningfully tied to her work and to the theme of digital ghosts. The mission patch functions as a small, recurring object that charges the atmosphere and final image. Environmental details (archive vs. humming city vs. private apartment) are selective and tonally aligned rather than touristic. The setting could constrain choices more concretely under pressure, but at this length it serves character, tone, and theme well.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse orchard, glowing fruit, and shifting ice floes create a vivid, idiosyncratic world that feels lived-in rather than decorative. Environment meaningfully shapes stakes: without floe prediction the community is endangered, and the orchard and mirrors are tools rather than scenery. Recurring objects (crystal, mirrors, fruit, lighthouse beam) charge the final images and reinforce the sense of a unique, coherent place. A bit more direct physical constraint from weather/terrain on on-page choices could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    The drift-ice marina and Arctic weather are vividly realized and tonally integrated, with sound (cracks, groans, hums) doing heavy thematic work. The setting goes beyond postcard description: the ice she steps onto, the ruined boathouse, and the cold all shape what she can do and how she feels. The parasol tip works as a micro-setting object, charging the final image and tying a summer garden world to the frozen docks. This environment doesn’t force hard logistical choices, but it meaningfully governs mood, perception, and the story’s governing metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.0)
    The vineyard and amber pavilion are vividly realized with sensory specificity—fermenting grapes, woodsmoke, honey-glowing beams, rustling leaves—and consistently filtered through the sentinel’s meditative gaze. The environment isn’t just postcard: the mismatched vines become a thematic engine, and the burial beneath the oldest vine charges the closing image. Still, setting rarely constrains his options or forces choices; it’s a rich mirror more than an active pressure. For elite publication, a slightly sharper interplay between physical environment and decision-making would be needed.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.1)
    The desert, dunes, and murmuring pavilion are specific and atmospherically strong, with recurring images like the kinetic parapet and glowing clearings lending texture. World rules (sand receding, moving stone) are internally consistent and learned via action. However, the environment mostly decorates rather than constrains choice—nothing in the setting meaningfully forces a different tactic or risk. The final image of the pavilion and parapet does charge the world a bit, justifying a solid but not elite score.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lavender field and rusted factory ruins are vividly evoked and central to atmosphere; details like “vines climbed the corroded steel” and “the final light of day painted the ruins gold” feel specific, not generic. Setting is tightly fused with theme, turning physical decay into a site of transformation without heavy exposition. The environment also charges the final image: ruins softened by lavender and memory, and the ever-growing photograph circling the field. While setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it consistently shapes perception, stakes, and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    The shadowed, decaying library is vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility (“dying spines,” “suspended hush”), with the chandelier and crystal functioning as charged micro-setting elements. Environmental constraints—the storm-damaged ceiling, the un-repaired chandelier, and finally the chained doors—shape his options and compress time. Dawn light and dust motes recur to charge the opening and closing images, giving the space emotional as well as physical presence. At this length, the world feels fully inhabited without slipping into tour-guide description.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    The junkyard fog garden is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through his sensibility—“rusted VCRs stacked like forgotten tombs,” driftwood markers, Betamax shells, and magnetic fields all feel organically of a piece. Fog and scrap not only color mood but subtly constrain movement and perception, justifying his marking tactics. Recurring objects (chalk spiral, tapes, driftwood) directly charge the final image and thematic frame. The setting feels indispensable to the story’s meaning, though it shapes atmosphere more than hard tactical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.0)
    The lunar observatory, clouds, and black sky of dying suns create a clear, atmospheric setting that aligns well with the themes of isolation, precision, and cosmic fragility. Objects-as-setting (clock, leaf, cameras, crystal lattice) are well-used to texture the environment and final images. However, beyond the shaking foundations there’s limited sense of physical constraint or lived-in detail; the observatory could almost be an abstract stage rather than a specific, pressuring place.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.0)
    The hospice “above the clouds” and the solarium are vividly rendered, with medical machinery and light working as part of the sonic and emotional palette. Details like the shard catching sun, the antiseptic air, and the mix of vinyl perfume and morning rain create a tactile, specific atmosphere. While the environment doesn’t significantly constrain choices in a practical sense, it strongly shapes tone and charges the final image of the hospice as a “radiant haven” for goodbyes. The setting is more poetic than functional, but it’s consistently and effectively integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fractured sky, floating isle, nocturnal observatory, and brass automaton create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels specific rather than generic. Setting details are filtered through Elara’s scholarly focus (runes, moonlight angles, the clockwork’s hum), which strengthens immersion. The environment supports tone more than it constrains choice; Elara’s tactics would barely change in a different lab-like space. Still, the observatory and automaton meaningfully charge the final image of a sealed, humming heart full of shadows.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    The hedge maze and secret garden are vividly rendered (yew walls, rusted trellises, cracked sundial) and clearly anchored in space, with Elena physically moving through them. Setting is thematically integrated—the maze and hidden garden mirror the buried truth and the difficulty of reaching it, and the telescope framing morning glories powerfully charges the final image. However, the environment influences mood and metaphor more than concrete options; the scene’s choices would mostly function in a less distinctive place. The details feel curated rather than touristic, but they don’t quite constrain tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.5)
    The serpentine grotto, mist, cliff, and village square are vividly rendered with strong sensory integration (stone coolness, salt, wet sand, amber and violet sky). Setting is consistently filtered through Mira’s star- and tide-conscious gaze, and the recurring grotto closes the loop as a place of “quiet alchemy.” The environment does supply resources (sea glass) and tone, but it rarely constrains choice or creates pressure—Mira’s path feels unhindered by place. Even so, the final image of the world turning with “sea glass pearls” shows the setting doing real thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned data center turned moss cathedral is vividly and economically realized—server racks as trellises, bees in rack-mount slots, sunlight through shattered glass creating “constellations” on concrete. Setting and object details (cooling system water, keyboards overgrown, honey from cable-hives) are filtered through Elara’s sensibility and mirror her project of repurposing harm into refuge. The environment isn’t just backdrop; it’s the literal site of the algorithmic betrayal and the material she uses to reconfigure that wound, directly charging the final sanctuary vision. The amber pendant, moss spiral, and “honeyed hush” recur as charged micro-settings that constrain what this place can be and mean at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “feral nexus” and mist are vivid, recurring anchors that saturate the atmosphere and clearly locate the piece in a liminal, almost-organic space. The seashell as a recurring object is tightly interwoven with setting, especially when it’s pressed into the earth and later remains as a monument. While the environment doesn’t impose concrete obstacles, it does shape the mood and metaphysics of what’s possible, charging the final images. Detail is selective and purposeful rather than touristic, maintaining a coherent, otherworldly tone.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.0)
    The verdant arbor, dawn light, and later lantern-lit gathering create a strong, consistent sense of place that supports the story’s hush and sacredness. Environmental details like the cool bark, withered coil, and dew on the tendril are well chosen and recur meaningfully. The setting does some light constraint work through the alignment of dawn, the arbor, and the vine, and it clearly charges the final image. It stops short of shaping tactical choices in a concrete way, but as lyric backdrop it’s quite effective.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    The withered subarctic orchard, crater, and Great Silence are vividly realized and deeply integrated with tone and theme. Setting details (skeletal trees, brittle leaves, crater’s wall, hidden grove, snow-dusted sky) evolve as she moves, mirroring her inner shift from desolation to tentative warmth. The environment constrains options (she must follow the mapped path through orchard/grove/ravine) and charges the final image of the warm cabin beyond the crater. Description is rich without losing spatial coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    The marble cavern, wounded season, and acoustic properties of stone are vividly rendered and deeply integrated into the mechanics of the plot (veins channeling vibrations, angles selecting eras). The environment constrains and enables his methods and explicitly charges the final image of light and reflections. World rules around chronomantic echoes are consistent and revealed through his work rather than dumped. A slight excess of atmospheric description edging toward lyric exposition in places keeps it just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bronze grotto, copper-veined walls, snowmelt patterns, and visible constellation are vivid and specific, and they actively shape the ritual (alignment to stars through the open ceiling, changing fractal walls responding to weights). The kerosene burner functions as a charged micro-setting/object, its geometry and absent fuel directly constraining her method. Atmosphere is exquisitely sustained; the environment mirrors and modulates the inner process without feeling like pasted-on symbolism. The only slight check is that a few gorgeous details (“shingled hush”) are more atmospheric than tactical, though they still contribute to the final silence image.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft, rust-colored light, kettle, ash wood, and quartz are vividly rendered and recur with purposeful variation. Setting is tightly filtered through Mara’s grief—rain as “tiny lenses of the past,” steam as time, rust-hued light as peace—so atmosphere and interiority reinforce one another. The environment also charges the final image (lion by the window, prism casting a rainbow, continuing rain) and subtly embodies the “here and gone” motif. While the space doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, it functions as a charged micro-setting that shapes tone and thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is highly vivid and original—the carousel in the sky, “kinetic lagoon,” and silver reeds create a strong, unified atmosphere and are consistently filtered through the scavenger’s routines. Details like the lagoon reflecting stories and the stalled carousel as a void in the sky do thematic work as mirrors for memory and lost motion. While the environment mainly charges mood rather than concretely constraining choices, the camera wheel and lagoon together strongly frame the final image. The world’s rules stay consistent, and the surrealism feels purposeful rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vividly realized: “bruised orange sky,” lingering popcorn, rusted pipes, old festival flyers, and the architecture of the terminal all feel specific and tactile. The environment isn’t just backdrop—it provides constraints and tools (water lines, canal, solar panels, announcement system) that directly enable Mira’s tactics. The spaceport’s history of star-bound dreams nicely parallels the new, more grounded launchpad for imagination. A slight overuse of atmospheric abstraction near the end keeps it just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.0)
    The soundless sanctuary and crystal forecourt are vividly rendered through multiple senses (light, texture, petrichor) and always filtered through Elara’s vocation and grief. Setting is not postcard; the environment actively participates—its crevices receive the gears, its whispering shifts to song, and its glacial hush charges the final images. The sanctuary’s silence and crystal surfaces directly shape the ritual and the stakes of being witnessed by time. The final impression of a “new chronology” is inseparable from this specific place and its rules.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    The canal, twilight light, and phosphorescent chamber are vividly realized and tightly filtered through Elara’s consciousness (“liquid ribbon of amber and violet,” “mosaic of false histories”). Setting directly shapes action: ripples in the water cue the hidden channel, and the physical canal wall/arch enable the discovery. The recurring use of the barge and canal as a liminal space reinforces the thematic threshold between lie and truth. A bit more environmental friction (danger, difficulty of access) could make the setting feel less purely aesthetic and more pressuring.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is richly realized and integrated: snow, fog, frost, and lantern light all interact with the rope and fulgurite to shape what’s possible (working by touch, reliance on lantern, the hush enabling attention). The harbor environment and weather don’t force big tactical changes but deeply inflect mood and perception, especially in details like hearing snowflakes click on pilings. The recurring objects—the golden dock, rope, and fulgurite—charge the final image conceptually as a world written in materials. Because the environment and tools constrain how she reads and what she can notice, they function as more than postcard backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and textured—shadowed garden, mossed statues, autumn light, palace hall, and the sea all accrue into a consistent atmosphere. Details are filtered through her vocation and solitude, and the recurring thread object is tightly tied to place (garden bench, fountain, final glint). While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, it absolutely charges the final images and theme (autumn, last ship, grey and gold world). This is high-level atmospheric craft for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is richly imagined: a palace suspended from stalactites above an industrial cavern city, with strong, specific images like “stalactite chains” and “a symphony of grinding gears and hissing steam.” Environmental details are consistently filtered through Lysander’s sensibility, and the fusion of magic and machinery in the hatchery is particularly effective. Crucially, the physical environment charges the ending—the palace swaying, stalactites shifting, city workers looking up—so place is not mere backdrop but part of the story’s final pressure. There’s some density of description, but it generally supports atmosphere and theme instead of stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    The obsidian lagoon, black sand, kelp scent, and migrating clouds are vividly rendered and recur in ways that mirror Maya’s inner state. The sand and coin, in particular, shift from description to ritual tools, charging the final images with memory and transformation. The environment doesn’t significantly constrain action—nothing about the lagoon changes her options—but it powerfully inflects tone and theme. The specificity and consistency of the setting are publication-level, even if not fully weaponized against the character.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “city of forgotten fountains,” moss-choked basins, ivy-choked alleys, and groaning bridges create a vivid, integrated setting that’s strongly filtered through the story’s tone. Environment and recurring objects (fountains, the central plaza fountain, the stained glass box) are not just backdrop; they define the problem and frame the final image of restored water and light. The world’s rules around the geese and the thinning boundary between past and present are consistent and legible. Setting also symbolically mirrors the city’s neglected memory without becoming incoherent or touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    The nebula garden is vividly rendered through selective, motif-rich detail (chromatic mist, phosphorescent pollen, quantum loam) and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The setting does genuine work as a Turing machine made of petals, meaning the environment is not mere backdrop but integral to the story’s logic and climax. The recurring petals/gear/garden machinery are tightly woven into the final beats, charging the closure image. A small limitation is that the physical constraints of being a sentinel in this place remain abstract; we feel atmosphere more than tangible constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ancient greenhouse at dusk, filled with orchids, corpse flower, fading glass, and monarchs, is vivid and tonally integral. Environmental details repeatedly echo and deepen the thematic work (beauty and rot sharing soil; butterflies bending light like prayer; stone dust on orchid leaves). The setting charges the final images—the emptied greenhouse and the river stone—though it doesn’t strongly constrain physical options so much as emotional ones. Overall, specificity and integration are high, with only a slight bias toward atmosphere over concrete constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tidal obsidian ridge and clock tower are vividly drawn and functionally important: the retreating and returning sea define her decision window, and the volcanic glass underpins the world’s “shifted foundation” premise. Sensory detail is precise and purposeful (“black glass that sang,” “burning mirrors”), always filtered through Elara’s time-obsessed perspective. The pendulum, ridge, and tide all charge the final images with more than postcard atmosphere—they embody the story’s moral physics. There’s no white-room feel anywhere, and spatial/temporal anchors remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cemetery and cobalt silo are vividly evoked—“metal skin painted deep blue,” “velveteen gloom,” “thick with dust and the scent of old wood”—creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting details are well integrated with action (boots on gravel, shelves lining curving walls) and mirror the interior work of decoding the past. The final image of the cobalt silo as “keeper of secrets” under the stars effectively charges the ending. However, the environment rarely constrains choice; it’s more evocative backdrop than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    The obsidian spire, frozen lake, ice bridge, and geothermal vents are sharply realized and consistently shape the story’s logic and options. The environment is not decorative: isolation, the fragility of the ice bridge, and the spire’s foundation directly constrain tactics and define the possible innovation path. The final image of the spire as a beacon and the intact frozen bridge charges the setting with thematic meaning. A touch more sensory variety beyond the visual and thermal (sound, smell) at peak moments could push this to an even higher echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ember alcove, mist, dust, and cobalt dial glow create a rich, consistent atmosphere that feels integral rather than ornamental. Details are tightly filtered through Mira’s purposes—secrecy, cold, the glow revealing luminous ink—and recur in evolved ways (dust from passive motes to “scholars” and “storytellers”). The environment constrains action (hidden radio, heavy cloak, isolation) and directly charges the final image of dust carrying myth beyond the mist. World rules (story famine, pirate radio, luminous ink) are fantastical but internally consistent and cleanly embedded.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.0)
    The Vanishing Point Gallery, rocking chair, porcelain mask, and rainy city are rendered with vivid, selective detail that strongly shapes mood. The vanishing point and dissolving facade nicely echo the thematic concern with disappearance and incompletion, and the rocking chair’s lullaby motif ties interior stakes to place. Environment doesn’t significantly constrain choices, but it does meaningfully charge the final images. The sensory palette (cedar, drizzle, ash, dim light) is coherent and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sewer, sediment layers, drowned basilica, and sunken city are richly textured and consistently filtered through Malach’s evidentiary mindset (stratigraphy, thermal fractures, compression rates). Environment constrains and enables choices: the sewer as last library, patrols above, sediment as both archive and future preservative for the cog. The cog and clock-tower function as micro-setting objects that directly charge the final image. A slight pullback from maximal vividness at the very end keeps this just below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “velvet library in autumn,” the mahogany lectern, dust motes, and the leaf veined like the rosette create a rich, coherent atmosphere that perfectly matches the story’s preoccupation with negative space and quiet. Setting details are filtered through Mrs. Kaelin’s musical sensibility and explicitly charge the final image (the leaf pressed between scores, the second “velvet library” where Marco begins again). The environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, but it absolutely charges meaning and tone. As object-as-setting, the rosette and the leaf anchor the world and closure with satisfying specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.3)
    The rusted greenhouse, its “metal ribs bleeding orange,” and the silver celestial light are vivid, recurring anchors that evolve meaningfully as vines convert decay into “verdant vigor.” The environment is not just backdrop; it shapes the ritual (alignment light as key, frame for tendrils, composted memories) and charges the final image of rust becoming crucible. Sensory detail is rich but mostly purposeful, filtered through Mara’s plant- and food-centric perception. A slight tendency toward lush repetition keeps it just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is rich and integrated: lightning collection tower, ceramic spires, bio-electric flowers, and city-wide blackout all interact with the premise rather than feeling decorative. The environment meaningfully constrains choice—Mara’s booth, the dead grid, the climb up the spiral stairs, the empty receptors—and the recurring objects (tower, honeycomb, lacquer box) charge the final images. Sensory texture like “honeyed dusk,” “nectar dusk light,” and “threads of honey” is strong without fully tipping into indulgence. World rules around energy, bees, and flowers are consistent enough to feel lived-in and conceptually satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    The quiet bay, streetlights, and sighing houses create a consistent, gently uncanny atmosphere, and the setting is well integrated into the lyrical mood. Specific images like “streetlights daydream” and “windows blinking amber” are memorable and recur to frame the opening and closing. Still, the environment rarely constrains his choices or creates friction; it’s a beautifully lit stage rather than an active pressure. The final bay-wide exhale charges the ending image but doesn’t fundamentally alter options.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    The drowned garden, cracked dome, foxgloves, and coral-encrusted founders are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Petra’s perception, producing a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting meaningfully shapes choice—she can only act through “the smallest crack in the dome’s eastern quadrant,” and the environment’s transformation (foxglove forest, roots cracking the dome) embodies the thematic shift. The recurring objects (ampoule, foxgloves, dome) all charge the final images with layered meaning. It falls just shy of the very top band because environmental constraint, while present, is more symbolic than materially contested.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    The infinite staircase and the dice are precise, recurring environmental anchors that both constrain options and charge the final image; the steps’ cold perfection mirrors his emotional stasis. Spatial and physical logic are clear, and the impossible architecture’s rule-set is taught early and honored. The micro-setting—the steps, bannister, and landing statues—feels lived-in and shapes tactics (never resting, always counting). A touch more non-visual sensory texture could push atmosphere even higher, but the current economy is very effective.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rooftop greenhouse in a smog-choked city, under the waxing moon, is vividly and economically rendered, with recurring images like “saffron quiet” and the amber haze. Setting is tightly tied to function: the greenhouse is a sanctuary above the smog; the moonlight physically enables the brush; the industrial quarter and derelict factory frame the mural’s impact. Environmental contrasts (choking metropolis vs. breathing pocket of green) mirror the thematic arc of quiet renewal. The setting also charges the final image of continued vigil under the waxing moon, giving the world texture and consequence beyond ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto city, waterfall, rosewater mist, UV-reactive murals, and cavern kitchen are sensuously rendered and consistently filtered through Liora’s curatorial eye. Environment and objects (lens, murals, ice river, harp, ovens) constrain tactics: she must use a specific shaft of light, bake in that shared kitchen, arrange loaves in a circle, and navigate the damp corridors. These details evolve with the action rather than sitting as static décor, and the final image of mist, scent, harp, and city-in-stone feels deeply place-bound. Setting is a genuine engine of mood and meaning, not a postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lighthouse, rocky island, and “slow exhale of low tide” create a vivid, coherent environment that both constrains and enables action (she must act when the tide turns and the reef is exposed). Recurring images—the grey lighthouse, kelp-bearded keeper, barnacled stone spine—build a strong atmosphere aligned with the story’s mood. The hunger stone and lantern room function as micro-settings tied directly to the central choice. Some phrasing (“slow exhale of low tide,” “latent radiance”) is repeated to the edge of overuse but still supports tone rather than derailing it.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned carnival funhouse is vivid and purpose-driven: “skeletal against a bruised twilight,” plywood grin, filthy mirror maze, corrupted-gold luminance and glowing footprints all shape mood and movement. The setting constrains tactics (the way mirrors function, the central convergence, the whole act of turning the photograph toward a mirror) and charges the final image of cracking glass and emptied photo. Environmental detail stays tightly tied to Mira’s altered perception rather than drifting into cataloguing. The opera clasp and photograph also function as charged micro-settings/devices that shape choices and the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is richly realized and tightly integrated: the driftwood ring doubles as instrument, the “breathing sea” and “blue hour” infuse every beat, and apples, branches, and wave-geometry all participate in the music. Environmental details evolve with the action—the water catching indigo, ripples turning to “foam geometry,” rain joining as coda—so atmosphere and mechanics are inseparable. The final image of the orchard floating on “a circle of driftwood and song” is directly charged by these earlier specifics. A small tempering factor is that the physical danger of the sea/storm could be more concretely felt as constraint, but what’s present is already publication-caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    The turtle-shell city, calcium spirals, monsoons, and sunwashed horizon produce a vivid, coherent environment filtered through a cartographer’s eye. Setting is not just postcard texture: the turtles’ breathing frequency is the key to communication, and the rusted gate plus Old Merra’s back literally and symbolically structure Kael’s choices and the final carving. The recurring shells/spirals meaningfully charge the last image rather than feeling decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    The overgrown station, ivy, rusted rails, fireflies, and rosebush are vivid and recur in purposeful ways, especially the station-as-ruin becoming a community garden that mirrors the narrative’s reclamation. Details feel coherently filtered through Emlyn’s historian sensibility, with infrastructure as archive. While the environment does not strongly constrain her physical choices, it heavily charges the final images (ivy climbing “out of the pit and into the light,” new roses as honest history). The specificity and atmospheric integration are strong enough for high-band even without hard logistical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    The submerged pavilion and its decaying architecture are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Elias’s professional eye and emotional response—barnacles on dance floors, coral prying mosaics, hydraulic lime and crushed shells. The environment constrains his actions (diving, bolting rungs, wrestling stones underwater) and directly shapes his method of embedding capsules in foundations. Recurring objects (inkwell, cornerstone, drawbridge) charge the atmosphere and final image. World rules for this semi-flooded coastal authority feel coherent without distracting exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.3)
    The sunken, semi-submerged library is vividly rendered through specific tactile and visual detail (three fathoms of murky water, water-stained stone, silted vaults, sputtering lantern vs. fluorescent tubes). Setting consistently supports tone and theme of fragile order against encroaching chaos. Environmental constraints (darkness, water damage, blackout) lightly shape how Mira works but don’t fully corner her into difficult choices. Still, the place feels singular and lived-in, and the recurring objects (lantern, water, stamp) charge the atmosphere effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is vividly particular—glass basilica, floating island, tea garden with silver leaves and jasmine that once held shadows—and consistently filters through her work and grief. Environmental rules (floating isle, dream-harvesting, paradoxical stair) are stable and learned through use rather than exposition. Crucially, setting charges the closure: the basilica becoming a lantern, the tea garden’s leaves turning to glass, and the island drifting on a sea of recorded dreams all crystallize the story’s stakes and cost. This integration of environment as both tool and prison justifies a very high score.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating observatory, dead zone, cooling breakers, and cathedral ruins are all sharply evoked and consistently filtered through Kael’s sensibility, merging war-scape and lab-scape into one atmosphere of suspended fallout. The geode functions as a micro-setting, charging both the process beats and the final image where starlight refracts “crystallized ghosts” onto her skin. Environmental constraints (altitude, tremor-dampeners, the breakers’ cycle) subtly shape what is possible in-scene rather than serving as mere décor. A touch less abstract phrasing around “dead zone” and “energy pools” would strengthen the physicality even further, but the atmosphere is already very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory at dusk is richly realized—the “ancient stones” that “drank light,” the brass orrery, and the copper-tasting air all build a coherent, texturally dense environment. Setting is not mere backdrop: the orrery’s mechanics directly shape Elara’s tactics (the star-linked pinions), and dusk/brilliant dimness recurs thematically in how truth must be mediated. Spatial and atmospheric anchors stay clear, and the observatory’s “sleep” at the end charges the final image. A slight increase in how environment physically constrains her—time, access, danger—would push this toward the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cobalt terrace, forgotten shore, and driftwood carvings form a vivid, coherent atmosphere, with strong textural specificity and recurring objects (watch hand, carvings) that echo the memory theme. Setting is filtered through his emotional state, giving images like “tide-polished driftwood...like broken sentences” real resonance. However, these environments mostly mirror internal states rather than constraining choices; he could conduct this reckoning in many locations with minimal plot change. Even so, the sense of place feels lived-in and thematically charged.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    The parapet, mist, tide, and moon are vivid and recurrent, with strong sensory specificity (“storm-worn parapet,” “hidden causeway”) and a consistent tonal palette. Crucially, environment and world-rule (the moon-governed tide) constrain timing and procedure for the exchange, not just mood. The parapet’s age and exposure to battles meaningfully echo the story’s preoccupation with history and fragile truces, and the brief clearing of mist to show the valley neatly mirrors the fleeting clarity in the political situation. Setting is integrated into action and theme rather than remaining a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    The coastal environment, fog, and utility poles are vivid and purposeful, shaping both tactics (navigating by poles, fog erasing them) and symbolism. The whalebone compass operates as a micro-setting/tool that literally and thematically charges the final image when left on the rock. Weather and tide subtly but believably influence options without over-explaining. Detail stays selective and filtered through a navigator’s eye, avoiding tourist cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The underground bioluminescent lake is vivid, sensorial, and integrated: it supplies light, defines paths, and its echoes and glow shape his decisions in the labyrinth. Details like “phosphorescent algae” and “ancient stone” feel purposeful rather than touristic, and the lake reappears at the end as a charged, thematic image. World rules are consistent enough for this length, and spatial movement (room → bridge → tunnels → cavern → elevator → surface) remains clear. The environment meaningfully colors both mood and choice without bogging the pace.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    The orchard under permanent moonlight, phoenix ash–fed soil, and specific magical flora (moon-cinnamon, ghost-pepper) create a vivid, integrated environment. Setting is not mere backdrop: it supplies the necessary tools, defines the magic’s logic, and shapes her final role as a “creature of the orchard” and guardian. The recurring moon and phoenix imagery also charge the final images of violet blossoms and the phoenix’s acknowledgment. A slight tendency toward descriptive luxuriance keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is striking and integral: the midnight glade above cloud-floor, the mist as tablecloth, and the cracked saucer all operate as a lived environment rather than backdrop. The micro-setting of the body-as-tablecloth and the saucer-as-body decisively charges the final image, where the “cracked saucer’s light” is pressed into linen and carried in her pocket. World rules—ancestral mist, onyx ink, silver-weeping crack—are consistent and always filtered through her maternal focus. The environment does not just decorate but defines how the ritual can occur and how the meaning of time is reframed.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    The recycled spaceship and jury-rigged alien gravity tech are vivid and integral, not just backdrop; the environment literally bonds with Maya’s psyche and constrains her options. Objects like the quantum core, photographs, and warp-core filament function as micro-settings that channel action. The final image of *Compassion’s Tear* sailing on “gravitationally light with purpose, heavy with love” is charged by everything established earlier. A touch more sensory texture beyond the visual and conceptual would push it even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    The black sand beach, volcanic breath, steam, and sulfur-salt scent are vivid, textured, and consistently filtered through Kael’s attention. Crucially, the volcano and its “whispering hush” are not mere backdrop: they ground the prophecy, shape the bugs’ synchronizing pulses, and literally “rumble approval” in the last line, charging the final image. Environmental details evolve with action (detour, treeline, tidal pools, fog), avoiding postcard stasis. The setting meaningfully fuses with theme and closure rather than sitting as decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is vivid and functionally integrated: limestone walls, phosphor emergency light, sundial, pneumatic tubes, and the fort’s architecture all shape Seren’s tactics. The half-painted sundial and bronze quill holder both act as environment-as-tool, directly constraining and enabling the plot. The blackout’s green shadows and “luminous fort” atmosphere reinforce the covert, liminal feel. World rules around locks, powder, and wiring remain consistent and legible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tidal bluff, frictionless sea, and aurora-slashed sky are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through Elara’s ritual mindset and tools (eels, painted rocks, star dust). The world-rule of vanished friction meaningfully charges the stakes of her possible intervention, and the environment (bluff edge, sliding sea, auroral light) is not just backdrop but an active medium in which the pattern manifests. The recurrence of aurora and “borrowed dawn” into the final image gives the setting thematic weight beyond atmosphere. What keeps this just shy of the very top band is that the physical environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical options in the moment-to-moment of the scene; its pressure is mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    The stormlit observatory above the clouds, the brass instruments, the ghostly bus timetable, and the enveloping weather are vivid and consistently filtered through the poet’s sensibility. Setting does more than decorate: the altitude and clouds signify distance from the censors, the storm’s lightning and rarefied air are bound to the moment of possibility, and the observatory’s “vigil” posture charges the final image. Objects-as-setting (timer, envelope, timetable) are well integrated into the spatial and atmospheric fabric and evolve across the piece. The environment doesn’t strictly constrain physical tactics, but it deeply shapes mood, stakes, and the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.0)
    The glass atrium, quiet brook, and half-painted sundial are vivid, recurring anchors that create a coherent, slightly otherworldly atmosphere. The brook’s “silent applause” and the sundial’s evolving shadow nicely mirror Rhen’s internal orientation toward time and choice. However, the environment rarely constrains or enables actions; it decorates rather more than it pressures tactics. The setting does help charge the final image, but mostly at the level of mood rather than decision.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prison library as a “rusted metal shack” with a storm-torn roof exposing stars is sharply rendered and recurs in evolving ways, from ruin to “rusted cathedral under stars.” Setting and objects (rust, moonlight, shelves, scavenged nails) consistently mirror and frame the thematic movement from decay to fragile beauty. Crucially, the environment constrains and enables action: it is both punishment workplace and sanctuary, the only plausible node for their resistance. The final images—“luminous fracture across the library” and the “secret garden of words”—are deeply charged by the built-up physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    The world is vividly and economically rendered: the glass-and-steel station above clouds, erratic compasses, airship, and the tidal arbor’s “silver branches and floating leaves” create a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting is filtered through his sensibility—storm as threat, arbor as sanctuary—and recurs meaningfully in the ending (storm below, stillness above, compasses aligned). Environment does not tightly constrain tactical options, but it clearly shapes mood, stakes (refuge vs. turmoil), and the final charged image. The recurring objects-as-setting (piano, clock, compasses) are well integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ridge, blooming flowers that “whisper equations” then “story-gold” petals, and the impending monsoon are vivid, specific, and tightly tied to the stakes. Environment consistently shapes meaning and options: the ridge as memory-keeper, the fissure “where limestone remembered the sea,” and the monsoon as a drowning/erasure threat that the awakening must precede. The final image—monsoon washing a now-awakened ridge—recharges earlier details without over-explaining them. Sensory detail skews visual and conceptual but remains selective and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    The islet, dock, courtyard, and conservatory are vividly rendered through selective, sensory detail (mist “like unspun silk,” light through lace, lapis in rainwater), and these spaces evolve meaningfully across the piece. Objects-as-setting—the compass, bonsai, lace, and rainwater pigment—are tightly integrated and charge the final image of the conservatory and oldest tree. The environment constrains tactics in a micro way: Hideo’s garden and tools make the ritual possible; seasons on the islet structure Mara’s transformation. A slight bias toward visual imagery over other senses keeps this just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the strongest element; the storm-damaged greenhouse is rendered with tactile specificity that mirrors the protagonist's internal state. Details like "watery sunlight" and the "squelched" ground actively constrain the character and drive the realization, functioning as an essential narrative crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is rendered through clichés ("blanket of stars," "dew-kissed grass") and generic adjectives rather than sensory particularity. The environment feels like a stage set where convenient props (a warm furnace, a safe) materialize as needed, lacking spatial coherence or gritty reality. The "patterns in morning frost" function as a magical plot device rather than a grounded environmental detail.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.0)
    The winterglass conservatory is well-integrated, providing the specific physical medium (resonant glass) required for the solution. However, the use of technical terms like "heat signatures" and "heat-mapping" creates a jarring register clash with the story's fable-like atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with the "impossible architecture" of the drowned library grounding the surreal elements effectively. The physical integration of the environment (shelves groaning, waterlogged histories) consistently pressures the tone and supports the "eternal occupation" theme.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "terra-cotta arbor" and silver bell are established with clear, if slightly purple, imagery ("patina a map of memories"). However, the "sanctions" remain abstract background wallpaper, failing to exert visceral, sensory pressure on the characters' immediate physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.6)
    The atmospheric setting is established ("twilight viaduct," "fog"), but quickly dissolves into abstract "corridors of light" that fail to constrain the character. Sensory details rely heavily on vague lighting metaphors rather than concrete, grounding particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the hyperbolic, living garden is not just a backdrop but the active mechanism that enables the plot and resolution. The specific integration of geometry and biology grounds the abstract temporal concepts in a tangible, visualized space.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting uses standard carnival tropes ("bruised sky," "stale popcorn," "rusted horses") without specific, sensory details that constrain the character's choices. The "seed vault under a prize center" concept is visually established but feels spatially arbitrary.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "sunken orchard" and "salt-scabbed panels" create a vivid, claustrophobic atmosphere that actively constrains the character. The environment is perfectly integrated with the protagonist's sensory condition.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is established through repetitive visual adjectives ("emerald," "golden") rather than tactile interaction or constraint. The station functions as a decorative backdrop rather than a physical space that pressures the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting acts as a second protagonist; the "groaning" reservoir and the "sweating" concrete walls actively pressure Marek’s choices. The integration of the glassblowing equipment into the industrial decay creates a unique, tactile atmosphere where the physical leak mirrors the internal release. Specific details like the "bird's-nest wiring" and the gauge frozen at "forty-two" anchor the metaphor in concrete reality.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "rusted library" imagery is visually distinct but functions largely as a static backdrop that does not constrain the action. The physics of the setting are secondary to the aesthetic, and spatial geography remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=3.6)
    Setting details are obscured by the relentless repetition of specific phrases ("ambered hush," "storm-tossed") which act as placeholders for genuine sensory scanning. While the location is established, the atmosphere is rendered artificial by the recycling of descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the frozen courtyard and the "transparent violin carved from a single ice crystal" create a vivid, atmospheric grounding. The sensory details of the "bruised purple" sky and the frost-wrapped statues effectively mirror the protagonist's cold, sterile existence before the anomaly. However, the setting ceases to constrain choice once the metaphysical looping begins, becoming a backdrop rather than an active force.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.1)
    Setting details are abstract and repetitive ("crystal whispers," "resonant hush") rather than concrete and grounding. The "whispering crystals" feel like ornamental fantasy elements that clash with the mundane context of ticket sales and audits.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.4)
    The garden setting is functional but relies on generic descriptions ("sprawling," "pale sun") rather than specific, sensory grounding. The "luck gauge" is an intriguing prop, but it remains an abstract concept for most of the story rather than a physical constraint in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sensory details are vivid and specific, blending the mechanical ("frosted copper valves") with the cosmic ("fractured amber and violet") to ground the high-concept premise. The setting actively constrains the plot via the atmospheric seals and the precise orbital alignment required for the experiment. The atmosphere of cold precision contrasts well with the "warm" bio-mysticism of the leviathans.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    The flooded opera house is atmospheric, grounded by vivid details like "shin-deep" water and the "cold" cello neck that anchor the scene. However, the repetitive use of the phrase "in between spaces" (six times) flattens the specific geography into an abstract label.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=4.9)
    The setting consists largely of atmospheric lists ("barometers and anemometers") and "aurora" descriptors without constraining the character's choices. The environment feels like a passive backdrop for the character's internal monologue rather than a source of pressure or resources. The "snowfall scale" is used, but primarily as a prop for a metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is vivid and tactile ("damp concrete breath," "spectral cotton dust"), effectively grounding the supernatural elements. The tunnel and the wheel serve as strong physical anchors that enhance the atmosphere, though the reliance on "phantom/ghost" adjectives is slightly repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.2)
    Atmosphere is consistent and moody, with the "obsidian refuge" providing a solid visual anchor. However, descriptors often drift into generic fantasy tropes ("lost knowledge," "ancient parchment," "glowing glyphs") without specific tactile constraints that force the character to adapt. The setting functions more as a backdrop than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sensory details like cedar and lavender are present but rely on hospice clichés. While the eclipse provides a temporal window, the setting acts primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than a source of friction or constraint that shapes Mira's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the "bronze cylinder" and "metallic scent of old rain" grounding the abstract concept. The physical constraints of the silo effectively isolate the character and support the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Atmosphere is excellent, blending noir melancholy with magical realism; the lighthouse is not just a backdrop but a tool of the premise. Sensory details like "guilty stars" and "salt air" firmly anchor the reader, and the "microdot" visualization of the kitchen is a vivid, specific invention.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.1)
    The micro-setting is vivid and specific, blending the technological (loop pedal) with the mystical (indigo stillness) effectively. The "dimensional anchor" concept provides a strong atmospheric backdrop that grounds the surreal action in a tangible space.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid imagery of the "glass spire" and "mirrored horizon" grounding the fantasy. The sensory details of sound and light effectively support the central concept of the symphony.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.3)
    The viaduct and phosphorescent moss provide a vivid visual anchor, effectively establishing a surreal atmosphere. However, "walls made of her adult regrets" is a metaphor displacing necessary concrete detail, and the specific tech term "procedural generation" clashes with the established ancient/mythic aesthetic without sufficient bridging.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is functional but relies heavily on "mystic shop" clichés (cobwebs, dust, amber eyes, stone air). While atmospheric, the details feel generic and fail to constrain the character's choices or ground the magic in a distinct physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.1)
    The concept of barometric anomalies acting as a quarantine tell is distinct and grounded, but the immediate setting (the courtyard) feels generic ("forgotten pocket," "stone benches"). The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint or tactical opportunity.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.5)
    The greenhouse setting is vivid and atmospheric, integrating well with the sensory focus on scent. However, descriptions occasionally veer into purple prose ("ghosts of forgotten fragrances," "chasing literal darkness"), which distances the reader slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.0)
    The "terra-cotta grotto" and "starlight" provide a visual backdrop, but the setting operates mostly as a metaphorical screen for the protagonist's thoughts. The environment does not constrain action or force tactile trade-offs beyond serving as a surface for the rope.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.1)
    Atmospheric descriptors ("sunken orchard," "shipwrecks") are vivid but largely static, serving as a backdrop rather than constraining tactics or choice. The setting details are listed rather than utilized, failing to create tactile pressure on the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    The amber grotto and static electricity provide a cohesive, sensory-rich atmosphere that grounds the magical elements effectively. Details like the "moth's wing" blotter create strong visual anchors. While atmospheric, the setting functions primarily as a backdrop rather than a constraint that forces specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is established with functional descriptors ("glass-and-iron," "salty night air") but remains a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker. Sensory details are standard ("scent of old paper," "echo of violins") and do not constrain the character’s choices or sharpen the crisis. The environment provides atmosphere but fails to influence the plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is imaginative and visually distinct, with strong elemental contrasts (glass vs. reed). However, descriptions often tilt into abstraction ("clung... like a remembering," "frequencies beyond the murmur"), creating a dreamlike distance rather than a grounded physical space that constrains the character's movement.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is inventive and integral to the plot; details like moss growing only during exhalations and canals reversing flow under time-pressure act as genuine constraints rather than just backdrop. The environment actively shapes the pacing and obstacles, grounding the high-concept premise in tactile, specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.3)
    The setting is lush and atmospheric, with specific details like "obsidian and pearl" establishing a strong mood. While vivid, the environment functions mostly as a cooperative backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure on the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmosphere is the story’s strongest asset, with vivid, specific details like the "lung filling with dusk" and the "rusted elbow joint" grounding the library’s underbelly. The physical space of the pipe chase is rendered well, though the transition to the "sapphire hush" leans slightly into romanticization over the grittier reality of crawl spaces. The setting actively supports the mood, even if it doesn't strictly constrain the protagonist's movement.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.4)
    The setting is established with standard descriptors ("damp earth," "mossy trellis") but functions primarily as a metaphorical mirror for the protagonist's state. While the trellis is central, the environment lacks tactile resistance; the plants and weather cooperate too readily with the theme rather than presenting concrete physical obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "tidal island" and "water wars" provide a consistent atmospheric backdrop, but the details remain generic ("rusted debris," "bruised purple"). The setting serves as mood lighting rather than a physical constraint that pressures the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.0)
    The crystal cave is described with vivid, albeit standard, fantasy imagery ("choir of frozen stars," "silver and violet hues"). While the setting is visually clear, the sensory details are repetitive, and the environment functions more as a backdrop than a source of constraint or tactical resources for Lira.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with tactile details like "green with sea-sickness" and "salt-stained repositories" grounding the fable. However, the setting relies occasionally on clichés like "bottled starlight" that detract from the otherwise gritty texture of the brine and rust.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=5.5)
    Atmosphere is present but relies heavily on clichés ("fog rolled thick as cotton," "clock struck twelve," "gas lamps"). The "fortress of unspoken truths" is described through abstract metaphors ("bricks mortared with shame") rather than concrete, grounded sensory details that would make the surrealism palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is functional but relies on abstract descriptions (&quot;restless echo chamber&quot;) rather than concrete, constraining details. The tower and tile serve as passive backdrops for the magic rather than environments that force the character to adapt or sacrifice resources.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    The "prismatic escondite" and "frozen equator" provide a vivid, albeit highly abstract, backdrop that constrains the protagonist. While the sensory details are imaginative ("liquid rainbows," "obsidian surface"), the setting sometimes feels more like a metaphysical canvas than a physical place with tactile reality. The integration of the setting into the plot mechanisms (the crystals amplifying the storm) is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with details like the "glass webbed with cracks" and "surgical scissors" grounding the abstract themes. The funeral home prep room is effectively utilized as a pressure cooker for the protagonist's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory details are vivid and atmospheric ("flickered like a dying star," "thin as breath"), establishing a strong aesthetic mood. However, the setting remains an inert backdrop that cooperates with the protagonist rather than exerting pressure or constraining her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with the "Grid" and the tidal rhythms actively constraining the protagonist’s movement and defining the ritual of the ending. The sensory details ("salt-stained concrete," "rusted tackle box") effectively ground the abstract themes in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.9)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with the "broken skull" dome and "wind eating stone" establishing a strong mood. The environment actively participates in the acoustic focus of the plot (the cello's hum). However, the description remains somewhat static, serving as a backdrop for internal monologue rather than presenting physical obstacles that force varied tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting contains some vivid, if slightly purple, imagery ("blackwater like fireflies," "mosaic of rotting wood"). However, because the piece lacks a specific scene, the environment functions as a static backdrop rather than a constraint that pressures immediate action or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.3)
    The lunar setting is visualized with decent sensory detail ("regolith," "blue-white gem"), though some descriptions lean toward standard sci-fi tropes ("suspended in the void"). The specific mechanism of the chemical flare and the hourglass adds a nice tactile layer to the environment, grounding the otherwise ethereal scene.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.1)
    The depot atmosphere is vivid ("taste of salt," "dim gaslight"), but the workbench setting breaks verisimilitude by relying on visual tools (prism, mercury reflection) for a blind artisan. The environment decorates the scene effectively but fails to provide a grounded, tactile physics for the character’s method.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.8)
    The frozen outpost provides a suitable atmospheric baseline, and the condensation patterns offer a specific, functional micro-setting element. However, the "comma" and "sentence" meta-descriptions of the landscape distance the reader, treating the setting as a literary device rather than a lived-in physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    Atmospheric details are strong, particularly the auditory focus ("vibration they felt in their teeth"), which grounds the fantasy elements. However, reliance on abstract descriptors ("graveyard of abandoned hopes") and stock types (widow, cobbler) prevents the setting from feeling fully lived-in or specific to this moment's crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    The underwater temple is rendered with vivid, specific imagery ("knotted puzzle," "pulsating wall") that enhances the atmosphere. The sensory details regarding the "gathered hush" effectively ground an abstract concept in physical sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "lighthouse prison" concept is evocative, but the setting is rendered through repetitive adjectival tags ("copperlight repose") rather than specific, constraining sensory details. The spatial geography remains vague, failing to pressure the character's movements.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is atmospheric ("glass panes frosted," "twisted vines") and established early, providing a coherent backdrop. However, the environment serves largely as set dressing rather than a source of constraint or pressure; the "endless night" is a condition to be cured rather than a tactile obstacle Elara must navigate.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is established with generic atmospheric descriptors ("old giants," "shimmering landscape") rather than specific, tactile constraints. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the tapestry metaphor rather than exerting pressure on the protagonist's choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.0)
    The "catacomb orchard" with roots snaking through ribcages is a vivid, high-concept setting that grounds the piece. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric and ornamental; it does not actively constrain Lina's choices or force a tactical adaptation beyond the initial description.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.3)
    The "golden arcade" and "holographic shopfronts" create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that serves the "futuristic nostalgia" tone well. However, the description occasionally drifts into "museum-tour" territory (e.g., "fossil of commerce"), prioritizing aesthetic signaling over interaction that constrains the protagonist's immediate choices.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.5)
    The cobalt observatory provides a clear visual anchor, though the logistics of "autumn leaves" on an indoor stone floor are slightly ambiguous (open roof or metaphor?). The setting is largely static; while atmospheric ("blue-white heart"), the environment does not pressure Mira’s choices or offer tools beyond the primary magical objects.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is atmospheric and consistent, with specific details like the condensation on the window and the gnarled roots grounding the scene. However, the reliance on "Abstract + Concrete" genitive pairings ("scent of salt and sorrow," "chimes of broken glass and memory") dilutes the sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    The superimposition of the Solomon Islands atrium over the hospital setting is the story's strongest atmospheric feat, executed with visceral sensory details like "glass walls weep condensation." The setting actively participates in the character's internal shift, anchoring the abstract memory in concrete space.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting contains atmospheric descriptors ("skeletal hands," "mercury"), but fails to constrain the protagonist's choices. The orchard is a passive backdrop that yields its secrets instantly; the "ruin" and "fog" offer aesthetic texture but no physical or navigational resistance to the character's goal.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "sound wave garden" is a distinct and imaginative setting that actively enables the plot's mechanics. The interaction between the sculptures, the wind, and the mural is vivid and specific. However, the sensory description occasionally drifts into generic abstraction ("towering steel," "melodic echoes") rather than concrete, grounded detail.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    The greenhouse is a strong, distinct crucible that grounds the "botanical code" concept in sensory reality. Specific details like "jewel-toned beetles" and the "humid heart" effectively contrast the organic rebellion against the sterile surveillance state, creating a solid atmospheric anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.8)
    Imagery is vivid and consistent ("fossilized moon," "coral spears"), establishing a clear fantasy aesthetic. However, the setting primarily serves as a backdrop; aside from the shell acting as an amplifier, the environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices or force tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting relies on high-abstraction adjectives ("translucent," "resplendent," "extinct") and metaphors rather than concrete sensory details that ground the reader. The "opal library" feels like a floating concept space; the lack of tactile interaction with the environment (beyond the orchids) leaves the world feeling ethereal and vague.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    The physical grounding of the archive—pneumatic tubes, glass ink wells, sealing wax—is vivid and effective. These elements successfully anchor the abstract magical concepts in a tangible reality.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting of the volcanic amphitheater is atmospheric and inventive ("sulfurous sigh," "basalt blocks"), grounding the story well. However, the mechanics of the "living museum" and floodgates remain vague, serving as backdrop rather than a source of concrete constraints on the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.2)
    The attic setting is atmospheric, but the details (dust, beams) serve primarily as props for metaphors rather than constraints on action. The "bookshop hummed" below is a nice touch, but the setting doesn't exert pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=4.1)
    The "drifting prism terrace" is an evocative image, but the sudden appearance of "wooden furniture" to satisfy the prompt clashes logically with the established glass aesthetic. Atmospheric descriptors are repetitive ("fractured hush") and the setting lacks concrete sensory grounding beyond visual abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is atmospheric and strictly constrains the protagonist's options (oxygen, pressure, waterlock). Details like "rust-flowers" and "coral reefs of brass" effectively merge the industrial with the organic, supporting the central theme of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is rendered with generic fantasy adjectives ("iridescent," "glittering") rather than tactile details that constrain the protagonist's movement or choices. The cave functions as a passive container for the objective rather than a source of atmospheric pressure or physical obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "tidal arcade" with its "black water" and "8-bit thunder" is vivid and atmospherically grounded. The environment actively participates in the plot (mirror glint, bioluminescence), anchoring the magic in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting consists of generic high-fantasy signifiers ("silvered leaves," "dew-laden petal," "obsidian sky") rather than specific, tactile grounding. The garden serves as a passive backdrop for the theme rather than an environment that pressures the character's choices or offers resistance. The sensory details are purely visual and abstract, lacking the gritty specificity required for immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.1)
    Sensory details are plentiful but generic and ornamental ("iridescent sheet," "golden light") rather than constraining action or choice. The setting serves as a passive backdrop for contemplation; the "prism atrium" is observed but never interacted with in a way that forces a tactic change. Specificity is low; the glazier's trade is reduced to metaphor rather than concrete procedure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is established effectively with specific sensory details like the "cracked porcelain box" and "fire-scarred hands." However, atmospheric descriptions occasionally veer into generic poeticism ("velvet sky," "ancient choreography") that distances the reader from the gritty reality of the ridge. The box functions well as a micro-setting element that anchors the memory.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    The grotto is a standout element, vividly realized and causally integrated into the plot logic. The tide’s active erasure of the work functions as a meaningful constraint that charges the closure with the cost of entropy.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "sonic fossil" concept creates a distinct atmosphere, and the ivy-choked university is visualized with some clarity. However, the setting details often feel like static dressing rather than obstacles that constrain action, and the specific phrase "ivy-veiled passage" is repeated mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.5)
    Setting details are atmospheric but static, relying on the repeated insertion of the fixed phrase "prism parapet after rain" rather than evolving constraints or sensory specificity that shapes the action.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is established but relies on generic fantasy tropes ("ancient terrace," "old stones," "ceremonial circle") and cliché sensory details ("warmed by the midsummer sun"). While the location anchors the ritual, it lacks specific, tactile grounding that would distinguish it from a stock backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=4.7)
    The setting is established, but relies heavily on "purple" clichés ("bruised sky," "fractured mirror") rather than specific, tactile constraints. The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than forcing adaptation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is atmospheric but generic, suffering from "white room" syndrome where the courtyard feels like a stage set rather than a lived-in space. The "lullaby" is an interesting concept but remains an abstract force rather than a concrete environmental pressure affecting the scene's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    The "Dish" is an excellent, specific setting that actively constraints the atmosphere and thematically amplifies the "silence" and "glare." The physical details—rusted girders, the cracked parabolic ceiling—effectively ground the abstract nature of the performance in a tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vividly realized, with the "verdant grotto" and "wind-harp" serving as active constraints that shape the protagonist's method. The verticality of the location effectively pressures the plot. A higher score is prevented by the repetitive anthropomorphism of the sky ("blushing stillness"), which draws attention to the writing rather than the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    Atmospheric details like "shifting greens" and "frozen soot" are vivid and establish the setting well. However, the blending of "street organ punched card" with an ancient "icebound sanctum" creates a disjointed world logic that isn't fully grounded or explained.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is atmospheric and specific, with the "cracked concrete" and "laughing fox stamp" grounding the surreal elements effectively. The "rewilded forest" and the bunker's decay are vivid and mirror the protagonist's internal state. The physical environment successfully pressures the protagonist, though the "storm" is largely ignored by her, reducing its immediate impact as a setting element.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively using specific details like "lapis-inlaid floor" and "Pabilsag" to ground the scene. The physical environment successfully mirrors the intellectual transition between regimes.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    The "soundless sanctuary" with its shifting architecture is atmospherically distinct and effectively mirrors the theme of mutability. The sensory details ("silver motes," "pulsed with faint light") create a cohesive surreal tone. However, the setting remains largely a backdrop for the interaction rather than a source of pressure or resources that Mira must actively navigate.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory details like the "cider press" walls holding the scent of apples and stardust. However, the reliance on crystalline/shimmering imagery risks monotony, and the physical logic (grinding frost into glass) operates on unestablished dream rules rather than grounded constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    The concept of an orchard within cathedral rafters is vivid and anchors the story effectively. Sensory details like the "quartz eyes," "resin," and "moss" create a distinct atmosphere, though the logistics of the soil contract remain slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    The contrast between the cosmic, abstract orchard and the cramped, mundane bathroom grounds the story effectively. While the orchard descriptions lean toward standard sci-fi imagery ("ancient frequencies," "luminous fruit"), the bathroom's sensory details ("humming pipes," "recycled air") provide necessary tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting relies on abstract, "purple" descriptors (e.g., "forgotten organ," "muted brass") rather than concrete, tactile constraints. While the atmosphere is consistent, the environment serves as a backdrop rather than a pressure cooker for choice.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.5)
    The carnival ship is a vivid, grounded setting that provides strong visual anchors. However, description often stacks adjectives ("blissfully aberrant," "faded big-top") rather than interacting with the character's movement or constraining tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    The clock tower setting is atmospherically grounded with specific details like the "1643" folio and "brass gears." However, the description of the rope ("shimmered like captured starlight") leans into generic fantasy abstraction that weakens the otherwise submarine/industrial aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is established with clear sensory details ("frozen pool," "fractured lines"), but the "energy beings" remain an abstract, low-definition antagonist. The magical elements, like the stone and the mandala patterns, rely on familiar fantasy tropes without specific, grounded texture that would make the harmonic caves feel distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.5)
    Atmospheric details like the "silver paint" and "humming pavilion" create a distinct, mythic tone. However, the setting feels somewhat like a stage set designed solely to facilitate the protagonist's success, lacking environmental resistance or grit that would ground the fantasy elements.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific; the mechanics of solid fog and shadow-measuring provide excellent atmospheric grounding. The environment meaningfully constrains the protagonist's window of action.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is vividly described with sensory details (wisteria, bougainvillea, scent of mortar), but functions primarily as a decorative backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint. The "blooming fortress" and "starless void" set a mood but do not force specific tactical choices or impede the protagonist's progress.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.6)
    Setting details are vivid but frequently dip into cliché ("stars whispered," "liquid silver," "scattered salt"). While the environment is coherent, it functions more as a static backdrop for reflection than a source of constraints or resources that shape the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.7)
    The "xenial trellis" and "gravity inversion" offer vivid, surreal imagery that establishes a distinct atmosphere. However, the sensory details often rely on synesthesia ("flavor like mint and distant thunder") that becomes repetitive, and the bunker itself remains somewhat generic ("reinforced concrete").

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "drifting prism terrace" and "crystalline craft" provide a vivid, specific backdrop that integrates well with the plot's mechanics of sound and light. The setting actively shapes the narrative method (monitoring resonance), though the "prism field" occasionally drifts into soft magic rather than a hard constraint that forces difficult tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.0)
    Atmospheric details like the "chronoshawl" and "compressed starlight" establish a serviceable science-fantasy aesthetic. However, the "kaleidoscopic waterfall" feels ornamental, and the setting largely serves as a backdrop rather than forcing adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=2.9)
    The setting is an abstract metaphorical space ("ashen charcoal," "starlight") lacking concrete sensory grounding. The repeated use of the abstract phrase "loaded emptiness" (three times) substitutes for genuine atmospheric detail, leaving the environment feeling like a generic "white room" painted gray.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.1)
    The bioluminescent atmosphere is established with vivid sensory details ("sapphire glow," "exhaling oxygen"). However, the submarine porthole bolt feels like an inserted prop rather than an organic, constraining element of the farm's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=3.8)
    Atmosphere is heavy but generic, relying on repetitive descriptors ("sepia," "golden shadows") rather than specific, choice-constraining details. The setting acts as a passive backdrop rather than an active pressure on the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is atmospheric and visually consistent ("glass cathedral," "silver vines") but functions largely as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraints. The environment reacts to the character but does not impede him or force specific tactical choices beyond the initial discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.5)
    The conceit of "reading dust" provides a specific, grounding sensory detail that elevates the otherwise standard archive setting. However, the physical logic is tenuous (dust inside a sealed envelope inside a closed box), which slightly strains credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.0)
    Sensory details slip into abstraction, such as a bin smelling of "revised histories," which flattens the physical reality. The "auric lagoon" is a vivid image, but the setting logic fluctuates between gritty dystopian and magical realism.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the "radiant grotto" is visually established, the description is static and relies heavily on repeating specific phrases rather than deepening the sensory detail. The setting functions as a backdrop for the magic system but does not constrain the protagonist's choices or offer resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on abstract, ethereal adjectives ("ashen," "silken," "luminescence") rather than tactile constraints that force specific tactical choices. The mechanics of the world (forging a needle from dust) are physically confusing and lack grounding solidity.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory details like the "cathedral of dead leaves" and the "crystalline gears" beneath the waterfall. The environment creates a distinct atmosphere that anchors the magical realism effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is excellent, with the foundry's physical details ("brick ribs," "copper-smell," "broken gutters") actively participating in the alchemical ritual. The environment constrains and enables the protagonist's choices, acting as a necessary crucible for the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Echo Gorge is a vivid, active setting that constrains the action (swallowing sound). The specific details of the harp and crocodile tooth ground the mythic tone in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.5)
    The ultraviolet forest is established with vivid sensory details ("violet haze," "glowing leaves"), creating a strong atmosphere. However, the "enhanced proprioception" is mostly told through abstract descriptions ("map of tension," "read like skin") rather than shown constraining physical movement or tactics in the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is evocative but generic ("vials of memory," "distilled moonlight"), leaning on whimsical fantasy tropes rather than specific, grounded constraints that affect the character's choices. While visual description is frequent, it rarely pressures the protagonist or limits their options.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Atmosphere is excellent, grounding the supernatural in specific sensory details like "burnt caramel" and the physics of dust spirals. The setting exerts tangible pressure on the protagonist, with the ceiling functioning effectively as both a physical barrier and a thematic vault. The environment is not just a backdrop but an active participant in the discovery process.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is integral to the plot, not just a backdrop; the porosity of the glass and the "inverted library" physically enable the climax. Sensory details like the "punctures in the paper" and "glass apples" are vivid and specific. The environment constrains and guides the protagonist's choices effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.7)
    The "baroque asteroid" and "visible time" provide a vivid, distinct backdrop that anchors the surreal tone. The setting actively constrains the climax (the mirror ritual), which is a strength. However, the "visible time" mechanics remain largely atmospheric and decorative until they are used as a deus ex machina at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with details like "sound itself could be shaped like glass" and "quartz grown in dark" effectively grounding the magical tone. The imagery successfully establishes the "resonance chamber" as a distinct, pressure-filled environment that influences the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with specific, tactile details like "solution tubes," "calcite-slick ledges," and "rusted rebar." The environment feels lived-in and ancient, effectively grounding the more abstract mystical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.0)
    Sensory details like "ozone and iodine" and "barnacled rocks" effectively ground the coastal setting, though descriptions occasionally drift into vague abstraction ("impossible light"). The juxtaposition of modern turbines with ancient ruins is functional but remains largely static, serving as a backdrop rather than an active constraint on choices.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.2)
    Imagery is lush but relies heavily on "poetic" clichés ("honeyed light," "silver skies," "ancient beast") that distance the reader. While the cathedral glass mechanism is a specific detail, the rapid summary of locations prevents the setting from exerting pressure or constraint on the character's choices. The atmosphere is consistent but borders on ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting concepts (obsidian lagoon, zeppelin library) are imaginative but presented as list items rather than experienced reality. The description lacks sensory immediacy, telling the reader what to see ("silver line of the coast") instead of immersing them in the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.7)
    The "paper-lantern cove" and "charred silk ribbons" provide a cohesive aesthetic, but the setting functions largely as a static stage set. The environment does not exert pressure on the protagonist or constrain his actions, remaining atmospheric but inert.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vividly realized, with details like "roots piercing the steel grating" and specific tree varieties grounding the fantastical premise in a tangible, decaying reality.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is functional and visually established ("frozen panes," "silver ribbons"), providing a clear backdrop for the ritual. However, the description often slips into abstract similes ("texture... like silk sliding over steel") rather than concrete, sensory grounding. The environment reacts to the protagonist's magic but does not constrain her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.1)
    The "windblown sanctuary" is rendered with vivid, tactile details like "frost-kissed stone" and "stiffened hemp." The setting effectively pressures the protagonist's choices and enhances the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the "cosmic" aesthetic is consistent, the setting relies on generic descriptors ("silken shroud," "fragments of meteoric iron") rather than specific, grounded sensory details that constrain the character. The environment is treated as a static backdrop for the theme rather than a physical space that forces tactile interaction or difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=2.8)
    The setting is established through generic adjectives ("scorched," "rusted," "fractured") rather than specific, sensory interaction. The environment does not constrain the protagonist's choices or offer resources that shape the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "Recalibration" and "Emerald Silo" are vivid, imaginative anchors that ground the surrealism effectively. Sensory details like "oxidized to an impossible emerald green" and "sandpapered silk" build a distinct, memorable atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=4.1)
    Sensory detail is present but highly repetitive ("cobalt lagoon" appears three times); the setting serves as a passive backdrop for abstract philosophizing rather than a source of pressure or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the living stone pillars and copper network vividly realized. The environment actively constrains the protagonist (ticking clock vs. scale of work), though the "dreaming" orchard responds a bit too easily to his efforts.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the &quot;rainwashed tower&quot; and &quot;shards of amber&quot; provide some visual texture, the setting does not constrain the protagonist's choices or impede her progress. The repeated insertion of the phrase &quot;bronze quiet&quot; feels like a forced keyword rather than an organic atmospheric element. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the discovery rather than an active pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.5)
    Atmospheric details like the "blooming jetty" and "cracked earth" establish a mood, but the setting feels static. The oxymoronic phrase "narrow vastness" is repeated until it loses meaning, distancing the reader from the physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is rendered with evocative sensory detail ("rusted spine," "stench of metal"), establishing a strong mood. The specific objects (cylinder, leaf) are well-integrated into the world, though the "wild hush" becomes a repetitive tag for the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.5)
    Time dilation is treated as an atmospheric buzzword rather than a physical constraint that pressures the beat. The setting is generic ("glass and steel," "void") and fails to enforce basic environmental rules, allowing the character to survive and sketch in a vacuum without explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting offers some striking visual anchors ("bruised plums," "obsidian chessboard"), but the environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of pressure. The spire yields its secrets too easily to the protagonist's touch, lacking the tactile resistance or spatial constraint required to drive tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.3)
    The whispering gallery is established with atmospheric, poetic detail ("marble that remembered every footfall"). However, the sensory experience is limited to visual and auditory abstractions; the setting feels more like a stage set for the theme than a tangible physical space constraining the character.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.6)
    The atmospheric details ("mercury-glass," "basalt," "wet ink") effectively establish a mythic tone. The concept of the "substituted night" rearranging the corridor is a strong visual constraint. However, the setting remains largely supportive background rather than an active source of friction that forces specific tactical adaptations beyond the initial discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory details like the "mist" and "cobblestones" establish a cohesive atmosphere, but the "time-frozen village" relies on standard fantasy tropes without specific, grounding constraints. The setting functions largely as a static backdrop until the magic key activates, rather than an environment the character must navigate with tactical difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting of bone towers and the "sky that forgot how to be blue" creates a distinct, atmospheric container for the story. Sensory details like "smooth as a tooth" are specific and vivid, effectively grounding the fable-like tone.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is vivid and active, providing both atmospheric texture ("fragile copper bell," "liquid sunrise") and lethal pressure (acid sea, failing air). The environment is not just a backdrop but the antagonist and ultimately the source of transformation, charging the final image where Elara breathes the corrosive atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is rendered with generic, adjective-heavy descriptions ("jagged boulders," "turquoise water," "ancient stone") that fail to constrain the character's actions. The environment feels like a passive backdrop rather than an active force; the "hidden oasis" is a standard trope without specific, sensory grounding that would force a tactile interaction beyond the painting itself.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the cobalt lens is not just scenery but the active mechanism of resolution. The sensory details of the lighthouse—cool air, singing crystal, copper waves—effectively ground the fable-like tone.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is atmospheric but static, functioning as a backdrop rather than a pressure cooker that forces tactical changes. While the "salvage" aspect is relevant, the environment is described through heavy filtering ("night swallowed," "silent scream") rather than concrete interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting functions largely as a pathetic fallacy ("echoing my own inner turmoil") rather than a concrete place. While the "sap of the storm-scarred trees" integrates into the resolution, the environment generally lacks sensory specificity beyond generic storm tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.7)
    The atmospheric setting of the opal dock and lighthouse is vivid and establishes a strong mood. However, the recurring phrase "softly persistent" (used five times) becomes a distractor that pulls the reader out of the immersion. The imagery borders on purple ("ghostly finger," "jagged stitch") but generally serves the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sensory specificity is excellent, particularly the "ant trail cartography" and the "negative space" doorway, which ground the fantastical elements in tactile reality. The setting actively constrains the protagonist's choices, with the rising creek and the hidden bluff serving as essential physical pressures on the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mountain environment is vivid and atmospherically consistent, effectively using the "lacy menace" of frost to ground the magical elements in danger. However, the descriptive reliance on repetitive phrases—particularly the "bleeding starlight" motif—diminishes the immersion by drawing attention to the prose construction.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.5)
    The "ember nexus" is visually evocative but operates as a painted backdrop rather than a constraining environment. While the imagery is consistent ("ash and amber," "dying stars"), the setting offers no physical resistance or resources that necessitate a specific tactical choice. It functions as a stage for the dialogue rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmosphere is strong and specific ("moss-slicked granite," "resin and old snow"), effectively grounding the surrealism. However, the description occasionally drifts into purple prose ("bored oracle") that distances the reader from the immediate setting.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.3)
    The atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the tactile details of the "morning fog," "brass polish," and "captured rain" ground the metaphor in physical reality. The shop feels lived-in and specific, effectively mirroring the protagonist's sense of occlusion and muted sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is visually distinct ("floating rock," "clouds swirled like forgotten thoughts") but static, serving as a passive backdrop rather than a source of pressure. While the imagery is consistent, it occasionally veers into abstraction that distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene. The environment facilitates the ritual but does not constrain the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archive setting is rendered with specific sensory details ("musty," "yellowed keys") that ground the scene effectively. However, the introduction of the electrical device feels tonally dissonant with the otherwise antique and organic atmosphere of the orchard and archive.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is atmospheric and consistent with the cosmic tone, using light and dust to establish a sense of suspended time. However, descriptions often rely on abstract metaphors ("gravity wrote poetry") rather than concrete sensory details that constrain the character's physical actions. The "softcover" dictionary is a specific detail that grounds the otherwise ethereal environment.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting concept is evocative, but the description is limited by repetitive phrasing ("still as glass," "razor edges"). While the "horizon measurement station" anchors the scene, the environment fails to constrain the protagonist's choices or offer resistance beyond a static atmospheric backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the bioluminescent farm and permeable membranes are integral to the plot and theme. The environment actively constrains the initial detection and provides the physical language for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.5)
    Atmospheric keywords are present ("rainwashed," "mica pane") but the setting often feels generic ("tired palette of blues and greys"). The specific spatial geography of the library and the secret room is vague, functioning as a backdrop rather than a constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.8)
    The glass harmonica is a distinct, grounding object that anchors the fantasy elements well. However, the setting suffers from pathetic fallacy ("city above whispered thanks") which softens the atmosphere into sentimentality rather than vivid reality.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=3.9)
    Setting details like "cedar shelf" and "night-blooming jasmine" are generic clichés that do not constrain the character. The environment is decorative rather than a source of pressure or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting is established through generic atmospheric tropes ("blanket of ivy," "cracked and silent") rather than specific, lived-in details that constrain choice. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the fable rather than an active pressure on the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    The translation of the visual world into tactile and ultrasonic detail ("vibrating bark," "language of shivers") is the story's strongest feature. The environment feels specific and lived-in through the protagonist's unique sensory lens. This tactile specificity effectively grounds the abstract conceit of the forest.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.4)
    The station and anomaly are vivid, though descriptions sometimes veer into abstraction ("tasted of ozone and old regret"). The specific detail of the moss in the hydroponic bay provides a welcome, grounding counterpoint to the cosmic vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    The atmosphere is consistent and lyrical, fitting the magical realism tone. However, the setting leans into generic "white room" ethereality ("nowhere and everywhere at once") rather than tactile, specific grounding that constrains the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is atmospheric ("shifting tectonic anger," "blackened walls") and grounds the action, though some descriptions lean into pathetic fallacy. The "skylights" and "dawn's specific angle" provide a concrete, if slightly tropy, mechanism for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is exemplary, functioning not just as a backdrop but as the primary tool for resolution and the final state of the protagonist. Specific details like "quartz trees," "copper vines," and the "frozen waterfall of static" ground the high-concept premise in tactile, actionable reality that shapes Kael's drumming method.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is integral to the plot, acting as both instrument and obstacle; the "acoustic architecture" of the container yard is vividly rendered. The atmosphere of the storm is tactile and shapes the action, though the zodiac overlay feels slightly less integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.4)
    The opening sensory details ("iron and old rope") are strong, and the use of the dock's mechanics (shutters, water reflection) is clever. However, the atmosphere relies on clichéd descriptors ("bruised sky") and abstract lighting effects rather than concrete, grounded particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.1)
    The atmosphere is cohesive but relies on stock fantasy signifiers like "ancient prophecy," "forgotten tome," and "iron gates." While the "cobalt library" offers a vivid image, the setting acts as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraint or tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sensory details are often vivid ("salt and memory," "silver ribbons"), but the setting functions more as a backdrop for the prompt's requirements than a lived-in space. The specific location ("sublittoral fringe") feels inserted as a label rather than organically integrated into the physical geography of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.9)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on standard dystopian signifiers like "giant wind turbines" and "dim light." The description often leans into heavy-handed metaphor ("phantom limbs," "scissors cutting the sky") rather than concrete, sensory interaction that constrains the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.1)
    Imagery is vivid and consistent ("cobalt atrium," "humming quartz"), effectively establishing a dreamlike atmosphere. However, the setting remains decorative and static, providing mood but failing to exert pressure or constrain the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=4.8)
    The glassblower’s courtyard is visually established with atmospheric details like "shards and humming furnaces," but the setting remains a static backdrop that does not pressure choices. Descriptions often drift into abstraction ("frozen breath of memory") rather than grounding the reader in a concrete, lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is the story’s strongest asset, with specific, tactile details like the "carbide lamp lens" and "acoustic panels" grounding the sci-fi elements. The "golden shadows" and auditory descriptions create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that effectively supports the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.5)
    The atmospheric details ("dying stars like frozen breath") are evocative and establish a strong surreal tone. However, the setting remains largely metaphysical; the lack of concrete spatial grounding makes it difficult to track Elara's physical interaction with her environment beyond the workbench.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    The integration of the measuring tape as a tool that bridges the physical loft and the abstract card spread is excellent, grounding the "reverse engineering" concept in specific, tactile detail. The rain and skylight provide a consistent atmospheric container. The setting actively participates in the method of the reading, elevating it above mere background.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting relies on "dungeon fantasy" stock phrases ("obsidian pillars," "ancient stone," "sigils hummed"). While the lighting effects are described, the environment feels like a static backdrop; Lyra does not interact with the space in a way that constrains her tactics beyond the twilight requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "blooming library" and "petals of glass and steel" provide evocative, specific imagery that anchors the fantasy. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric and does not exert concrete pressure or constraints on the character's actions within the archives.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.3)
    The workshop setting is integral, grounding the emotional arc in cedar, jasmine, and woodstove heat. The tactile details of the chameleon’s skin ("angry red to cautious green") serve the story well. The score is capped by the opening description ("starlight bleeding through like liquid silver"), which feels ornamental and slightly clichéd compared to the sharper details that follow.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=3.9)
    While sensory details are present ("cool against her skin," "smelled of moss"), the setting functions as a generic backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure. Inconsistent physical logic—steaming coffee coexisting with a frosted, ice-veiled hourglass—undermines the reality of the scene. The environment facilitates the protagonist's journey too easily, offering a conveniently open tunnel and a healing pool without obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is rendered with tactile precision, blending the industrial grit of "hot metal" and chemical sludge with the ethereal nature of the magic. The theater is not just a backdrop but an active participant in the storage mechanism, effectively constraining the action and shaping the resolution. The atmosphere consistently supports the "hot metal and celluloid ghosts" aesthetic without drifting into generic description.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting consists of "poetic" abstractions ("unwritten calendar," "unspoken words") that lack sensory grounding or spatial logic. The "archway" and "north" feel like generic fantasy backdrops rather than lived-in environments that constrain choice or provide resources.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is evocative but relies heavily on abstract concepts ("quantum foam," "unlit corners") that can be difficult to visualize spatially. While the surreal tone is consistent, the sudden animation of the dune at the end feels like a break in the established physical parameters of the sand-waste.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.1)
    Imagery is vivid and specific ("copper leaves," "steam-mangroves," "oak-turbines"), establishing a distinct atmosphere. However, the setting yields too easily to the protagonist's mind, acting as a mirror rather than a source of resistance or constraint that forces tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting relies on generic atmospheric tropes ("fog-draped," "indigo," "star-stamped") that provide mood but do not constrain choices. The environment is a backdrop for the theme rather than a physical space the character must navigate with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt fortress and silent-choir provide a distinct, high-pressure environment that meaningfully constrains the protagonist's actions. The specific detail of the "thumbprint" rust stain anchors the conflict in the physical world. The setting is not just backdrop but the engine of the safety/silence conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.3)
    The atmospheric imagery is vivid ("vines of silvered starlight," "exhaling dust"), establishing a strong sense of place. However, the descriptions often veer into ornamental excess ("pause between heartbeats of the cosmos") that distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting of the floating station is established with some solid details ("mildewed charts," "steel railing"). The environment functionally supports the isolation theme but does not actively constrain Lina's choices or force a trade-off. The sensory details are consistent but often lean into standard climate-fiction tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with grounded sensory details like the "cool brass" and "teeth ache." The juxtaposition of the ancient stones and the corroded spaceport creates a vivid, tangible setting that anchors the abstract themes.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific, with "medicinal moss-lines" and "fragmented chemical dreams" grounding the fantasy elements. The integration of the reconstruction scaffolding with the ancient springs effectively mirrors the thematic conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.2)
    Specific details like "silver-dollar eucalyptus" and the juxtaposition of the automated lighthouse effectively ground the emotional arc in the physical space. The setting actively mirrors the protagonist's internal state, serving as a functional constraint that enables the somatic work.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with sensory details like "salt and silverfish" and "velvet fingers" grounding the surreal elements. The environment actively constrains the protagonist, with the closing walls providing necessary physical pressure. The specific location—the "hollow beneath the astronomy section"—feels tangible despite the shifting reality.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "wind carved encampment" provides a consistent atmospheric backdrop, but the setting remains largely static and does not pressure the protagonist’s choices. The environment is described in visual terms ("endless dunes," "stone walls") but lacks the tactile or interactive specificity that would make it a constraint on the action.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.3)
    The atmosphere of the "subzero corridor" and "nitrogen-cooled servers" is vivid and immersive. The sensory details ("wax that cracked like a knuckle") effectively ground the reader in the physical cold of the archives.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.2)
    The glass dome and the specific texture of the sandbag create a grounded immediate setting, though the world beyond remains a generic abstraction ("warring factions"). The "tower" serves as a standard backdrop anchor without pressuring the current action.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sound wave garden is a vividly realized setting where environment dictates action (the zigzag path, the humming soil). The sensory details are synesthetic and specific, effectively constraining the protagonist's movement and method.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory setting is vivid and atmospherically rich, integrating perfectly with the "orbits" motif and the protagonist's "observant" nature. Specific details like the "rosewood pen nib" and "mahogany table" ground the scene. The setting acts as a thematic mirror, though it functions more as atmosphere than a physical constraint on the immediate action of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is immersive and essential, with the "meteor hush" providing a strict temporal boundary that pressurizes the scene. Sensory details like the "golden weight" of the amber and the "moth wing" papers ground the surreal concepts in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is atmospheric and consistent, effectively establishing a mood of mystical quiet. However, the description leans heavily into synesthesia ("lilac unease," "purple dark," "violet mist") to the point of becoming monochromatic and repetitive. The environment functions as a container for the action but feels more like a stage set for the prompt's required objects than a lived-in space with physical resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting consists of generic post-apocalyptic tropes ("charred pillars," "ash") and relies heavily on the repeated phrase "shattered sky." The environment provides atmosphere but does not constrain the protagonist's choices or offer specific, tactile resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is lushly described ("petals that chimed like glass bells") but spatially confusing; the existence of a "hedge maze beyond the theater's walls" containing a "mystic orchard" feels like a disconnected dreamscape rather than a grounded locale. The environment provides magical solutions rather than constraints that force character ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is functionally established with basic sensory details (acetone, fluorescent buzz), but description is dominated by abstract, repetitive phrases. The studio environment facilitates the plot but does not constrain the protagonist's choices or exert pressure on the action.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established with some vivid sensory details ("walls wet with salt," "pool of still water"), but the environment remains a static backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure. The caves function as a museum for the protagonist to walk through; they do not force tactical shifts, physically impede progress, or create urgency through environmental hazards.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with the "amber warehouse" and "petrified sap" effectively grounding the surreal premise. The specific taxonomy of the buttons adds welcome textural density, though the imagery occasionally becomes ornamental rather than constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is well-integrated, particularly the concept of stratifying intelligence like the accumulated snow drifts, which binds the environment to the plot mechanics. While atmospheric descriptions ("silver hush," "shroud") occasionally border on purple, the physical constraints of the cold and the digging ground the scene effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is atmospheric, establishing the "gloom-hill" and "fog-bound river" effectively, though descriptions often veer into purple prose ("mist curled... like forgotten dreams") that distances the reader. The specific sensory detail of the ticking gutters provides a strong rhythmic anchor, but the "ambient awareness" is told rather than shown through sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "portable potter's wheel" strains credibility in a survival context given the weight and mechanics of such tools, creating a convenient rather than grounded interaction with the setting. The "chimney smoke" imagery blurs the line between memory and reality in a way that creates confusion rather than productive ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.3)
    Atmospheric details are vivid but frequently veer into "purple" territory ("bricks drinking darkness," "shards of silver," "cathedral of fragrance") that prioritizes poetic sounding-ness over grounding specificity. The locksmithing details (bitting gauge, machine oil) provide a welcome concrete anchor, but the surrounding sensory environment feels curated for sentimentality rather than lived-in reality.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the "tidal library" is a strong image, the specific details drift into incoherence ("atomically reflective," "frequencies of extinct heartbeats"). The setting serves as a backdrop for reflection rather than a constraint that forces choices. The lack of tactile grounding makes the environment feel dreamlike and weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is described through clichéd, "watercolor" abstractions ("rain kissed petals," "fragments of stained glass") rather than grounded, sensory particulars. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the mood rather than a source of pressure or resources. Spatial geography is vague; the sudden appearance of a potter and poet implies a dream-logic population rather than a real place.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is established with strong sensory details—&quot;burnt coffee, ozone, and old vinyl&quot;—that ground the cosmic stakes in a tactile, lived-in reality. The physical constraints of the &quot;cramped broadcast booth&quot; effectively mirror the pressure of the situation.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=4.6)
    Setting details are often oxymoronic or confusing, such as a subterranean chamber "bathed in starlight" without establishing a light source; the "spatial mutiny" is abstract description rather than a physical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmosphere of the quarry is established with specific sensory details ("mist coiled," "limestone walls"). However, some descriptions lean into purple prose ("furrowed hush of stone and memory") that distracts from the stark reality of the crime scene.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is atmospheric, with specific details like the "copper nail green with age" and the "fractured jet stream" grounding the sci-fi elements. However, the atmosphere is marred by the repetitive use of the phrase "spongey dread," which dulls the sensory immersion by reducing the mood to a recurring label.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.5)
    While atmospheric elements like pine and mist are present, the specific setting detail ("scaffold wrap") feels inserted into a mountain pullout solely to serve the prompt. The environment functions as a magical vending machine for clues rather than a resisting reality that constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is vivid but suffers from "white room" syndrome, serving primarily as a container for heavy-handed metaphors (e.g., "sigh of rust") rather than a tactile environment that constrains choice. The specific details (popcorn, sawdust) feel generic rather than perceptually grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    The observatory setting is atmospheric and grounded with specific sensory details ("brass telescope," "wooden ribs"). The environment actively supports the mood, and the integration of the telegram’s flowers with the stellar observation creates a cohesive, tangible world.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.3)
    The "orchard vortex" is a vivid, surreal concept that anchors the scene's physical logic well. However, sensory details often slip into generic descriptors ("hissing," "swirling," "malevolent light") rather than tactile, specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is vivid but relies on high-fantasy "adjective soup" ("cobalt," "bruised purple," "ribbons of gold and ash") that feels decorative rather than tactile. While the maze topiary is a nice anchor, the glade and dreamscape often feel like generic backdrops for the magical transaction.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    The "catacomb orchard" where roots intertwine with bones is a vivid, atmospheric concept that effectively grounds the scene. Sensory details like the "waxen smear" and "rustling leaves" establish a strong, distinct sense of place.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.7)
    The setting is established with functional clarity (dust, metal walls), but the descriptions lean on atmospheric clichés ("faint echo," "smelled of rust," "ghostly echo"). While the environment provides the speaker cloth, the setting itself does not constrain the protagonist's choices or generate unique obstacles beyond a general mood of desolation.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting of the magnetic arbor and the concept of cuneiform engineering are vivid and imaginative, effectively blending sci-fi and fantasy elements. The imagery of "trembling bark" and "cavity of absence" grounds the abstract physics in sensory detail. However, the mechanism of the "physics of transition" remains somewhat vague, operating more as poetic license than a constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    Exceptional integration of setting; the "warming stones" and "geothermal vents" are not merely backdrop but the specific tools that enable the protagonist's resolution. The tidal rhythm and pressure glass actively constrain the atmosphere and pacing, satisfying the highest standard for setting utility.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bunker’s atmosphere is palpable, with strong sensory details like the "quartz-dusted walls" and the "mold-ridden mattress." The transition to the crystal caves is vivid, though the "cathedral arches" imagery leans slightly into standard tropes. The setting effectively grounds the surreal elements.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is established with standard "abandoned ruin" tropes (ivy, rust, decay) that feel generic rather than specific to the character's unique perception. While the station is anchored, the sensory details often slide into pathetic fallacy ("ivy... like forgiving hands") rather than concrete, grounding observation.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is atmospheric but constructed from generic fantasy tropes (fog as secrets, breathing leather) that lack specific, grounding texture. While the "propagation delay" machinery offers a visual hook, the environment functions mostly as a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker for choices.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.0)
    The atmosphere of the "velvet observatory" and the "ice crystal violin" is evocative and establishes a distinct mood. However, the setting description is marred by repetitive adjectival choices (specifically "velvet" appearing four times), which dulls the specificity of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory details like the "green mouth drinking starlight" and the static appearing as light. The atmosphere of the skyborne grotto is immersive and distinct, grounding the abstract concept of soul-catching in concrete, albeit high-fantasy, imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integral to the logic of the story; the cloud-sea and vineyard interact directly with the plot mechanics (cloud-wanderers, starlight blossoms). The environment constrains the protagonist's actions and informs the magical realism elements naturally.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is functional but relies on "bruised horizon" and "pale eye" tropes that distance the reader. While the wind and chimes are present, the environment serves as a passive backdrop for the allegory rather than a source of constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is evocative but relies heavily on static, "mystical" imagery ("shimmering ore," "silver threads," "dark eye") that feels decorative rather than constraining. While the platform and pond are visualized, the "magnetic grotto" operates largely as a magical deus ex machina rather than a physical space the character must navigate. The atmosphere is consistent but lacks the specificity of a lived-in world.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with "towers of bone" and "endless echoes" creating a visceral, specific atmosphere. The environment effectively constrains the character and grounds the mystical elements in tangible imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    The "spire above the clouds" is vivid and thematically active, constraining the method of approach (mist walking). The "brilliant dimness" effectively establishes the atmosphere of dying magic.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the imagery is vivid ("sea of ink"), the spatial and physical logic is incoherent. The story cannot decide if the library is an air pocket or submerged, describing "water lapping at his boots" then later having him "swim upward." This confusion prevents immersion in the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.0)
    The "ambered observatory" and "fossilized reality" provide a vivid, specific texture that grounds the abstract stakes. The coins function effectively as a micro-setting and tool, constraining Elara's options and anchoring the cosmic scale in tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory is rendered with excellent specificity; the brass instruments, meridian circle, and scattered light ground the magical realism. The environment actively constrains the method of the protagonist's work.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "sapphire viaduct" provides vivid visual imagery, but the setting largely functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint. While the acoustics of the arches are used for the resolution, the environment does not force Kael to alter his tactics or impede his progress. The descriptions lean toward generic high-fantasy markers ("dripping with dew," "faded twilight").

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the atmospheric descriptions ("mirrored hush," "sapphire-hued") establish a mood, they often drift into generic territory without grounding the scene in tactile reality. The setting details undermine the story's logic; the preservation of paper artifacts in a flooded, muddy environment is treated as a convenient plot device rather than a physical reality. The "midnight ridgeway at twilight" phrasing creates immediate temporal confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting is vivid but leans heavily on ornamental descriptions ("kaleidoscopic waterfall," "silver apples") that act as a painted backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure. The environment feels static and disconnected from the urgent stakes of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.3)
    The "nocturnal arbor" offers a strong initial image, but the setting dissolves into vague "data streams" and "vines" without tactile specificity. The environment provides the conflict but does not meaningfully constrain the protagonist's tactics beyond the initial setup.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is functional but relies on generic martial arts fantasy tropes ("floating rock dojo"). While the "jar labeled DUPLICATE" is a specific and grounding object, descriptions like "sun of causality" and "canyon of justification" veer into abstraction, weakening the physical immediacy of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is sketched with vague, interchangeable nouns ("haven," "brook," "canopy") that lack sensory specificity or distinct atmosphere. The environment does not constrain the character's choices or generate friction; it serves merely as a passive backdrop for the character's internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "echo chamber tunnel" is an atmospheric and original setting, blending the industrial ("concrete," "groundwater") with the surreal ("choir of broken kazoos"). The sensory details are vivid. The spatial relationship between the tunnel and the house is established, though the metaphysical nature of the space remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.3)
    The frozen garden is atmospheric and functionally constrains the character, effectively merging the library theme with the physical setting ("hedges crystallized into unreadable glyphs"). The sensory details are vivid, though interaction remains largely limited to observation.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    The "ember nexus" is realized with vivid, specific imagery ("frozen stars," "green flames"). The setting actively constrains the magic—ash and embers are the only available materials—and the transition to the "frozen glass" landscape creates a strong, lasting visual imprint.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is visceral and active; the "gorge's maw" and "lunar perigee" exert palpable pressure, acting as constraints that force the timing of the climax. The sensory details ("familiar grooves," "harmonic so low it lived in the teeth") ground the high-concept premise in a vivid physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting offers some evocative imagery ("clocks run sideways," "spectral grotto"), anchoring the surreal premise. However, sensory details often veer into abstraction ("silver threads," "void") rather than the concrete, tactile grounding needed to make the ferry's transition feel physically perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Optical Illusion Gallery acts as an active constraint that escalates the conflict, rather than serving merely as a backdrop. The sensory details of the breathing walls and the specific scent of the erupting water effectively ground the surrealism in tactile experience.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    The benthic environment is vividly realized, particularly through the micro-setting of the corroded anchor link which anchors the abstract concepts. Sensory details like the refraction of worklights and the tactile quality of the pitted steel effectively ground the high-concept premise.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting relies heavily on atmospheric clichés ("ghostly sentinels," "shroud," "mist-clad") rather than specific, tactile details. The environment serves as a generic backdrop for the mood rather than a pressure cooker that forces choices. The "atrium" feels indistinct, lacking a specific geography that influences the rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Atmosphere is excellent; the "crashing hush" and "bloated" leather codex create a distinct, pressurized sensory environment that feels physically dangerous. The setting actively constraints the protagonist, grounding the sci-fi elements in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.4)
    The atmosphere is cohesive and vivid ("opal observatory," "tasted of old circuits and winter"), establishing a strong mood. However, the setting acts primarily as a static backdrop for reflection rather than a dynamic environment that forces specific tactical choices or imposes physical constraints on the character.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    Atmosphere is the story’s strongest asset, with evocative, textural details like "fossilized thunder" and "polished calcium" that ground the surreal setting. The physical environment actively shapes the narrative logic, though the specific "canyon of endless echoes" concept does the heavy lifting for the plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting contains vivid descriptors ("root of glowing moonwort," "dried sage") but functions as a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker. The gravitational anomalies are described as "playful" visual effects but do not constrain Lyn's physical actions or force tactical trade-offs. The environment feels like a collection of required nouns rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    The "iron orchard" and "living statues" are vivid, integral setting details that constrain the action and define the conflict. The contrast between ash/gears and the organic locust shell grounds the fantastical elements in concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.5)
    The arcade setting is vivid, with "neon veins" and "ozone" establishing a strong noir atmosphere that anchors the scene. However, the description occasionally dips into purple prose, such as "eyes the colour of cobalt neon," which strains physical credibility and distracts from the gritty reality.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the atmosphere is consistent, the setting relies heavily on generic "abandoned carnival" tropes (peeling paint, ghost-lights) without specific, constraining geography. The "hidden oasis" serves as a set piece rather than an environment that forces tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with inventive concepts like "hyperbolic geometry aisles" and "palindromic proteins" grounding the surrealism. The atmosphere is distinct, though some details lean towards abstract lists rather than lived-in sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting suffers from abstract projection, where physical details are replaced by emotional labels ("mist, thick as unspoken regret," "rock slick with meaning"). While atmospheric, the lack of concrete, grounded sensory detail creates a "white room" effect masked by poetic language, failing to constrain the character's choices physically.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting blends concrete urban details ("pawnshop roof," "denim") with atmospheric abstraction effectively. However, vague descriptors like "cosmic possibility" dilute the specificity of the "nexus" concept.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.1)
    The "sunken orchard greenhouse" surrounded by shipwreck constellations is a striking, original concept that provides strong visual grounding. However, the summary mode renders the setting somewhat static, serving as a postcard backdrop rather than an interactive environment that forces tactile choices in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on "purple" descriptions ("dust motes seem to hold their breath") that feel cliché. While the "shard-mirror" concept is interesting, sensory details often serve the prose style rather than constraining character choice or creating tangible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.8)
    While atmospheric, the description relies on abstract synesthesia ("violet of a child's first laugh") rather than concrete grounding; the setting serves as a passive backdrop for the ritual rather than a source of tangible constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sanctuary is a vivid, atmospheric setting that actively participates in the story ("drank starlight," "refracting"). The net functions superbly as a micro-setting, constraining Elara's focus and actions. The sensory details are evocative, though occasionally they lean into abstraction ("spectral geometry") rather than grounded texture.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=2.6)
    Setting description is repetitive and generic, relying on verbatim loops ("rain-scoured fresco vaults" appears three times) that deaden the reading experience. The environment feels like a list of fantasy tags rather than a lived-in space that constrains the character. Spatial orientation is vague, jumping from studio to hillside without grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.5)
    The atmospheric details of the sunken library are vivid and effectively set the "sophisticated melancholy" tone ("colonized by anemones and sorrow"). While the physics of conversation at 300 feet are hand-waved for surreal effect, the sensory environment strongly anchors the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=3.1)
    The setting is sketched with generic high-fantasy abstractions ("misty courtyard," "suspended garden") rather than concrete, tactical geography that constrains the characters. The environment serves as a passive backdrop for the magic system rather than a source of pressure or sensory grounding. The "city's forgotten alleys" lack distinct texture, functioning only as a vague container for the scribe.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the story’s standout feature, with the mechanics of the ice spire and refracted light integrated intimately into the plot's encryption concept. The sensory details ("thousand fractured colors," "delicate filigree," "ancient air bubbles") are vivid and specific, grounding the fantastical premise in tangible atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    The gondola is vividly rendered, with the 23-degree tilt and "hissing" cable providing excellent physical grounding. The setting effectively pressures the protagonist, though the external environment sometimes dissolves too quickly into metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=4.3)
    A severe continuity error breaks the setting's reality: the library is described as a "thousand-year oak" in the first sentence and an "ancient yew" in the eleventh. This contradiction undermines the physical anchor of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.5)
    The atmospheric description of the airship and starlings is vivid but decorative, lacking tactile interaction that constrains choice. The inclusion of the hopscotch board breaks verisimilitude within the established setting of a working vessel.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting relies on decorative, poetic abstraction ("crystal shard," "frozen tomes") rather than tactile constraints that shape action. While the "hall of mirrors" is central, the environment functions as a passive backdrop that yields instantly to the protagonist's presence.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.0)
    Setting details like "floating rock arches" and "blossoming fruit trees" are ornamental and do not constrain tactics or physical movement. The environment serves as a generic backdrop rather than an active force shaping the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.2)
    Atmosphere is vivid and consistent ("spirals folding into smaller spirals"), effectively creating a surreal twilight mood. However, the recurring phrase "pane of hush" (used five times) shifts from an evocative concept to a repetitive scaffold that loses impact. The setting supports the tone but remains static.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is integral to the plot, not just a backdrop; the specific constraints of sunlight, shadow, and frost dictate every move Elara makes. The contrast between the organic, withered orchard and the clockwork, frost-threatened labyrinth creates a unique, high-pressure atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting is filtered so heavily through the central metaphor (everything is a braid or a symphony) that it loses sensory reality. The ravine functions more as a symbolic backdrop than a physical place with constraints and hazards.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.1)
    Atmosphere is vivid and consistent ("swirling sea of clouds," "crystalline counter"), creating a distinct dreamlike mood. However, the setting functions largely as a static backdrop; the specific geography of the library or the clouds rarely constrains the vendor's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is not merely atmospheric but functional; the coral pavilion and tidal pools provide the necessary mechanism for analyzing the memory's architecture. The environment constrains the protagonist's method and directly enables the climax, fulfilling the high-band criteria.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.5)
    While the imagery is consistent, the setting functions as a metaphorical backdrop rather than a physical space that constrains choice. The geography between the tower, the "Spanish elevator," and the meeting spot is vague, and the elevators' "speaking" blurs the line between literal magic and metaphor without establishing clear world rules.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.1)
    The geological-neurological setting is vivid and imaginative, effectively blurring the line between mind and matter. However, the atmosphere is undermined by the heavy repetition of specific descriptors ("quaking," "spiraling") which turn vivid details into mechanical tags.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.2)
    The gravity inversion concept offers potential for spatial constraints, but the execution remains largely visual ("floating drift") rather than tactile or tactical. The setting details are consistent but often generic ("mist," "serpentine") and do not force difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.4)
    The specific imagery of the fused porcelain insulators and the moss-covered grove creates a vivid, if somewhat static, atmosphere. While the "cathedral" metaphor is cliché, the tactile details of the "cold memory of electricity" ground the setting effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific details like "lodestone gravel" and "spinning compasses" grounding the metaphysical concept. However, phrasing like "twilight purpled the sky" leans into overwrought poeticism that distracts from the gritty texture of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is functional but relies on literary clichés ("shadows pooled like ink," "canopy of stars") rather than specific, lived-in sensory details. While the workshop contains specific tools, the environment serves more as a static backdrop for the metaphor than a pressure cooker that constrains Mira's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting contains sensory details ("acrid hint of sulfur"), but they function as a static backdrop rather than pressuring choices. The "treetop village" concept is standard fantasy fare, and the spatial geography is never utilized for choreography or constraint. The atmosphere relies on repeated label phrases ("wildflower hush") rather than organic immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.7)
    The inverted gravity setting is visualized well, particularly the "silver ribbons" of water which constrain the timeframe and movement. However, elements like "twin suns" and "ancient bones" lean toward sci-fi cliché, and the "spiral glyphs" serve as convenient exposition rather than lived environment.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting mechanics (wind tunnels between containers) differ from standard backdrops and drive the investigation's logic. However, descriptors like "towering labyrinth" and "steel skyscrapers" remain somewhat generic, and the atmosphere relies on stated "silence" rather than sensory pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.8)
    The "ice cavern" and "sculpted hush" establish a cohesive, if generic, high-fantasy atmosphere. However, the setting feels static—a backdrop for the light show rather than a pressure cooker that forces choices. Sensory details rely heavily on sight and sound abstracts ("crystalline air," "luminous tide") rather than tactile grit.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "Thunder-echo range" provides a solid atmospheric backdrop, and sensory details like the "bruised purple" sky are vivid, if occasionally overwrought. However, the specific phrasing "fell into an avalanchingly quiet" is grammatically awkward and breaks immersion, reading as a forced insertion rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is visually distinct with "topaz walls" and "copper shadows" providing good anchors. The specific lighting effects of the halo fragment ground the magical elements, though the environment remains somewhat static outside the printing action.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is established via the repeated static label "aurora-lit ridgeway," which appears five times without deepening or varying the description. While the atmospheric details of the aurora and frozen earth are present, they function as a passive backdrop rather than an environment that constrains the courier's choices or creates obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the quartz arbor and the greenhouse lab are rendered with vivid, specific sensory details that create a cohesive atmosphere. The environment actively participates in the magic system (quartz recording, mist preserving), satisfying the interaction between setting and plot. The imagery is consistent and evocative, grounding the esoteric premise.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    The physicalization of abstract concepts ("silence grew thicker," "stripping threads from the air") creates a distinct, immersive atmosphere that serves the story's logic. The setting effectively constrains the character, though the juxtaposition of the mythic orchard and the mundane village sale jars slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmosphere is vivid, with specific imagery like the "blue snow" and "floating rock arches" anchoring the fantasy setting effectively. The mine description is functional, though slightly less distinct than the orchard imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.2)
    The spaceport setting provides a functional atmospheric backdrop with details like "rusted hull plates" and "cracked concrete," anchoring the scene reasonably well. However, the environment operates mostly as static set dressing rather than providing tools or obstacles that constrain Lira's choices or influence the tactical outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting is established with competent but standard imagery (rust, salt, brass). While functional, the atmosphere relies on generic lighthouse tropes rather than specific, pressure-driven details that constrain the character.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting features vivid stock imagery ("emerald lighthouse," "roiling sea"), but fails to utilize the environment as a constraint on the character's choices. The concept of "digital fog" is an abstract straw man rather than a tangible atmospheric pressure. The lighthouse feels like a static stage set rather than a lived-in space that shapes the action.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is established but operates as generic fantasy wallpaper; the "floating rock" contrasts jarringly with the modern medical reality of a transplant without reconciling the world-building logic. Sensory details are vivid but abstract ("liquid silver") and do not constrain the characters' tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is atmospheric and evocative ("salt and stardust," "silver-blue light") but operates as a generic fantasy backdrop rather than a source of constraint. The labyrinth and tower do not resist the protagonist's movement or force tactical trade-offs. The sensory details are pleasant but often lean into abstraction ("smelled of... stardust") rather than grounding the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.1)
    Specific sensory details like "fermenting apples and copper" establish a distinct atmosphere, though the description leans heavily on standard fantasy tropes (obsidian, silver). The setting is vivid but static due to the repetitive exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting contains competent sensory details ("water-stained ceilings," "ache in spines") but relies on standard "magical bookstore" tropes. The environment serves as a backdrop for the theme rather than offering constraints or unique textures that shape the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with specific details like "wax paper that crinkled like dried leaves" and "frost-nipped streets" grounding the abstract themes. The setting of the overgrown courtyard effectively mirrors the central conflict of memory versus decay.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=3.0)
    Atmosphere relies on the incessant repetition of generic adjectives ("frozen," "luminous," "crystalline") rather than distinct, grounded sensory details. The setting feels like a vague backdrop, and the repetition of "quartz hush" dilutes the sense of place rather than building it.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.0)
    The atmospheric descriptions of the rotting pier and black water are vivid and establish a strong mood. However, the introduction of a "recording device" and the ability to rewire it clashes with the established "antique/lantern/pirate" aesthetic without sufficient context, creating a jarring anachronism.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.2)
    The sensory constraint (tasting the magnetic/political shifts) is brilliantly executed and serves as the primary mode of investigation. The setting is not just a backdrop but the engine of the plot; the specific combination of the bluff, the aurora, and the root-network elections creates a unique, constrained environment that forces the character's realization.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=3.7)
    Setting details are generic ("crystals hummed") and physically implausible (a canvas surviving in a damp cave). The environment functions as a static, metaphorical backdrop rather than a concrete space that pressures choices.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.5)
    The "glass forest" and "bruised, toxic sky" create a strong, specific atmosphere that anchors the fable-like tone. The setting details are vivid and tactile ("smelled of old ink," "vines crawled up the panes"), effectively establishing the world's decay, though the "archive" concept operates on dream logic rather than concrete world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid, atmospheric, and integral to the plot; the specific mechanics of the whispering bluff and the altitude constraints shape the tuner's methods. The sensory details ("blue breath of glaciers," "whispering bluff") effectively ground the magical realism elements.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with the "weeping golden sap" and "magnetic north" providing strong sensory anchors that mirror the internal state. The physical environment (dome, filters, rusted box) effectively grounds the abstract nature of the android's glitch.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is picturesque but decorative ("apricot and rose"), lacking tactile grit or constraint. Specific details like the jasmine blooming white function only as riddle-game logic rather than organic environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.1)
    Atmospheric details like the "flickering diodes" and "jawbone of a whale" are vivid, but the setting largely functions as a backdrop rather than a constraint. The "sunken lab" trope is handled competently but does not force specific tactical trade-offs beyond the general threat of water.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting concepts—gravity pockets and salt mines for memories—are imaginative and anchored by specific details like "brine pumps" and the "fifth piling." However, atmospheric descriptions occasionally veer into abstraction ("cotton wool soaked in starlight") rather than constraining immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the brook functions as both the physical workspace and the antagonist. Sensory details like the "smooth stones," "willows," and "moss-covered log" ground the "terrestrially cosmic" magic in a tangible reality that constrains Elias's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with specific sensory details ("bergamot and old paper," "tomatoes in salvaged chimney pots") grounding the setting. The physical reality of the Murray Building is vivid, though occasionally obscured by the density of the linguistic metaphor overlaid upon it.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting is atmospheric, establishing the "velvet" texture and "phosphorescent" mood well. However, the description leans heavily on visual adjectives and abstract concepts ("impossible geometry") rather than distinct, grounding sensory details that constrain the character's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the setting is established with vivid imagery ("stalactites," "aurora"), it functions as a static backdrop rather than a constraint that pressures the protagonist. The repetition of "pearl twilight" (four times in a short text) diminishes its atmospheric impact, turning a specific detail into a rote label.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the atmospheric description is consistent, it relies heavily on repetitive epithets ("serpentine nexus") rather than specific, tactile interaction. The setting functions more as a passive backdrop for the character's monologue than a source of constraint, failing to ground the abstract concepts in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting relies on visual clichés ("endless dark," "silver mist") rather than tactile, constraining details. The transition from the glacier shrine to the wreck is spatially vague, and the environment exerts no physical pressure on the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.1)
    Atmospheric descriptions are vivid but lean heavily on generic "ancient" tropes. The spatial and physical logic crumbles when the philosopher stirs the air with a whisk and immediately produces a physical cup of tea without established tools or ingredients.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.5)
    The contrast between the "impossible greenness" of the orchard and the radioactive wasteland is vivid and grounds the story well. Specific details like the "mulberry roots" and "blue flicker of a salvaged LED" add necessary texture.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the "cobalt glass portico" and "rusted crown" serving as effective grounding elements. The environment actively pressures the protagonist (storm, height, isolation). It misses the 9-band only because the "cobalt glass" serves more as a lens for the character's internal realization than a strict physical constraint on the final tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.1)
    The "feral loft beneath the dunes" is realized with vivid, specific sensory details that effectively ground the magical realism (e.g., walls breathing sand, varnish like sunburn). The setting actively supports the mood, though at times the description borders on ornamental. The atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, establishing a distinct, dream-like texture.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, effectively blending the "drift-ice" reality with the "fleshly ethereal" tone. Sensory details like "tasting bronze" and "frozen kelp" ground the mystical elements, though the density of description occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    The atmospheric details of the frozen lake and the "skin of light" on the viaduct are strong and ground the scene effectively. While some descriptions drift into abstraction ("sky's hunger"), the physical environment is vivid and logically integrated with the magnetic mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.5)
    Atmospheric details like "damp gloom" and "rusted rails" provide a basic sensory grounding, but the setting is undermined by the illogical prop choice. The "slow breath" metaphor for the water feels overwrought and distances the reader from the gritty reality of the tunnel.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.6)
    The "vibrant hush" establishes atmosphere, but the description relies on shopworn imagery ("dust motes... tiny galaxy," "silence louder than any scream"). The setting provides mood but does not uniquely constrain the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vivid sensory details like "phosphor-coated grease" and the "acid sea" effectively ground the fable-like logic. The setting is integral to the plot, providing both the resources (machinery) and the threat (corrosion) that define the workshop's existence.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting is a generic cyberpunk archive without distinct sensory grounding, relying on standard tropes ("digital ghosts," "humming"). The inclusion of the exact sequence 4-8-15-16-23-42 (from *Lost*) shatters world-building credibility, reading as a pop-culture intrusion rather than a logic-driven detail of this specific world.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.1)
    The juxtaposition of "lighthouse orchard" and "abandoned vintage store" creates a jarring aesthetic clash that lacks connective tissue or spatial logic. While individual images are vivid ("amber pools," "molten glass"), the setting feels like a collage of unrelated prompt words rather than a cohesive, lived-in world.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is atmospheric, with vivid details like "pale gold" ice and "ruined boathouse," establishing a strong mood. However, the environment functions primarily as a backdrop for reflection rather than a source of concrete obstacles that constrain the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.7)
    While the sensory details are abundant ("honey," "woodsmoke," "fermenting grapes"), they lean heavily on generic atmospheric tropes without constraining the character's choices. The setting functions as a static backdrop for reflection rather than an active force that exerts pressure on the narrative arc. Specificity is replaced by adjectival density.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.4)
    Setting is abstract and reliant on repeated nomenclature ("whisperfield calm") rather than sensory specificity. The environment offers no constraints, functioning as a passive backdrop that yields instantly to the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with vivid if static imagery of the lavender and ruins ("frozen in silver nitrate," "shuttering"). However, the description often remains atmospheric background rather than a source of constraint or pressure that forces specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    The atmosphere of the "suspended hush" and the sensory details of the crystal ("heavier than glass should be," "sonically reflective") are vivid and immersive. The setting actively pressures the protagonist, embodying the decay he studies.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "fog sculpture garden" of electronics is evocative and grounds the mood well. However, the "low hum of rusted VCRs" presents a specificity issue (unpowered, rusted electronics don't hum), which breaks the literal grounding of the scene despite the poetic intent.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.2)
    While atmospheric phrases like "metallic hiss" and "frozen starlight" provide texture, the setting lacks constraints that force difficult choices; the "escape velocity" functions as abstract flavor rather than a physical pressure. The observatory feels generic, acting as a static container for the prompt elements rather than a distinct, lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the "solarium" establishes a location, the setting dissolves into abstract metaphors ("clouds drift below like a vast, soft sea," "radiant haven") that unmoor the physical reality. Sensory details are filtered through heavy interpretation ("scent of hope") rather than direct observation, making the hospice feel like a stage set for a poem rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy tropes ("floating isle," "impossible colors") that do not constrain the protagonist's choices or tactics. While the "nocturnal observatory" is established, the environment feels like a painted backdrop rather than a physical space with resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    The secret garden and hedge maze serve as excellent constraints and symbols, charging the final image. Specific details like the "rusted trellises" and "final wall of yew" ground the metaphor in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is described with ornamental adjectives ("cool embrace," "sleeping dragon") but lacks the concrete specificity to constrain choice or grounding. The grotto and village feel like generic fable backdrops; the sensory details are pleasant but interchangeable, failing to create a distinct atmosphere that pressures the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    The physical environment—moss on server racks, bees in cables—is vivid and effectively grounds the story's concept. The imagery is the strongest element, though occasionally marred by abstract descriptors ("green memories").

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting suffers from "white room syndrome," defined almost exclusively by abstract "mist" and the "feral nexus" label. Concrete sensory details are sparse, and the environment does not constrain the character's choices or movement in a tangible way.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting is established with functional but generic fantasy descriptors ("verdant," "golden," "silken"). While the arbor provides the necessary props, the environment never constrains the protagonist's choices or forces an adaptation. It serves as a passive backdrop rather than an active element of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.4)
    The subarctic crater and withered orchard are established with vivid sensory details ("crunch of brittle leaves," "liquid mercury"). However, the sudden appearance of a warm, lit cabin at the end contradicts the established "withered" and "dead" atmosphere without sufficient grounding, feeling like a set-piece dropped in for a happy ending.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the cavern's acoustics and the "wounded season" actively constrain and guide the mechanics of the solution. The sensory details of the tuning forks interacting with the marble veins are vivid and functional, grounding the magical elements in concrete physics.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting acts as the primary antagonist and tool, integral to the plot's resolution rather than serving as mere backdrop. The "copper-veined walls" and starlight alignment actively constrain the protagonist's tactics, meeting the high-band standard for environmental interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.7)
    The sensory environment is vivid (ash, rain, steam), but the recurrence of the specific phrase "rust-hued peace" as a descriptive label breaks immersion. The setting successfully anchors the mood but feels slightly checklist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.8)
    The surreal imagery is vivid ("kinetic lagoon," "silver reeds") but suffers from "white room" syndrome, lacking tactile grounding or spatial coherence. The environment is described with high-concept adjectives but does not constrain the character's physical movement or choices until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.2)
    Atmospheric descriptors ("bruised orange sky") are vivid, but the physical setting lacks grounding; the environment yields instantly to the protagonist's will. Complex tasks like rerouting canals are treated as trivial, instantaneous actions, preventing the setting from acting as a meaningful constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is atmospheric and plays a functional role in the resolution, particularly the interaction between the crystal crevices and the gears. However, the reliance on repetitive descriptors ("glacial hush" appears five times) flattens the specificity of the environment over time.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the setting description is frequent, it relies on heavy-handed "purple" phrasing ("liquid ribbon of amber") rather than distinct, grounding details. The integration of "morning radio" into a barge/sundial fantasy aesthetic creates a jarring anachronism that is never harmonized by the world logic.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "golden dock," "oceanic hush," and "salt-stiffened coils" create a vivid, tactile reality. The rope functions effectively as a micro-setting, with its texture and knots grounding the abstract intellectual work. The sensory details are specific and enhance the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting consists of generic fantasy markers ("shadowed garden," "moss-covered statues," "golden leaves") that provide atmosphere but fail to constrain the character's choices. Sensory details are abundant but decorative, focusing on visual adjectives rather than specific, tactile interactions that would ground the scene in a concrete reality. The environment feels like a passive backdrop rather than an active force in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the Hanging Palace and Cogspire providing a vivid, contrasting backdrop that grounds the conflict. Specific details like "stalactite chains" and "crystallized resin" effectively evoke the atmosphere. The "gear-quake" adds a nice environmental texture, though it functions more as atmosphere than an obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.5)
    Visual details like the "obsidian lagoon" and "black sand" establish a basic atmosphere, but the setting largely functions as a static stage for symbols. Sensory details often drift into abstraction ("scent of kelp-drift peace") rather than grounding the scene in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.0)
    While the "forgotten city" atmosphere is established through vivid adjectives, the setting functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint. The environment yields to Kael's progress without resistance, failing to dramatize the "silence" or "moss" as tangible obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.1)
    The imagery is vivid and cohesive ("chromatic mist," "phosphorescent pollen"), establishing a strong lyric atmosphere. However, the setting lacks physical resistance; the "quantum loam" and "infinite recursion" are so malleable that they serve as a passive backdrop rather than a constraint that forces specific tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sensory details like the "stench of decay" and "orange wings" are vivid but often float in a generalized timeline rather than grounding a specific scene. The greenhouse is well-conceived, but the lack of a continuous present-moment scene prevents the setting from exerting immediate pressure on the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is not merely atmospheric but causal; the specific properties of the "obsidian ridge" (fracture, tidal timing) drive the plot and the revelation. The "black glass that sang" and "volcanic grooves" provide a vivid, tactile grounding that enhances the stakes of the geological twist.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=3.2)
    Atmosphere is suffocated by the repetitive recycling of specific prompt phrases ("velveteen gloom," "cobalt silo") which deadens specificity. The setting functions only as a static backdrop, offering no constraints or resources that shape the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "obsidian spire," "cracked black tooth," and "ice bridge" are vivid and directly constrain the plot's logic. The physical limitations of the environment (the risk of cracking the ice) successfully drive the protagonist's problem-solving process. Sensory details like the "ink made from iron and snowmelt" add distinct texture.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.2)
    Sensory details like the "cobalt pulse" and "frayed blanket" are vivid, though the setting exerts little physical constraint on the action. The verbatim repetition of phrases ("ember alcove," "thistled calm") within a short space reduces the atmospheric immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sensory details like the smell of "burnt paper" and "cedar" are effective and establish a melancholic atmosphere. However, the setting relies heavily on abstract metaphors ("vanishing point pulling at the edges") that make the space feel floaty and dreamlike rather than a grounded environment pressuring the character.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    Atmosphere is the story's standout feature, with visceral details like "corpse-bloat" and "phosphorescent fungus." The stratification of the city is woven beautifully into the physical action, though the patrol's visual presence is slightly less vivid than the sewer itself.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "velvet library" provides a consistent atmospheric backdrop, but the sensory details ("dust motes," "autumn leaves") are generic and decorative rather than constraining. The setting does not pressure the characters or shape their tactics; it functions merely as a container for the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is described with vivid, albeit heavy-handed, imagery ("bleeding orange," "ghost of chlorophyll") that establishes a clear atmosphere. However, the environment remains static and yields instantly to the protagonist's efforts, failing to act as a constraint or source of friction for the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, offering vivid, immersive details like "ceramic spires," "bio-electric flowers," and "rust" that ground the fable-like premise. The atmosphere effectively blends the industrial with the organic, though the mechanics of the towers remain slightly opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.8)
    Setting details rely on the verbatim repetition of "quiet bay in spring" and "streetlights daydream" (appearing four times) rather than specific, evolving sensory work. The atmosphere is generic and fable-like, lacking the concrete grounding or spatial specificity required to make the environment feel lived-in or crucial to the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with strong sensory details like "green twilight," "limestone bones," and "foxglove-stained ampoule." The environment actively informs the theme (stone vs. water, rigid vs. fluid).

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tactile details of the "perfect stone" and the "chipped die" ground the surreal premise effectively. The atmosphere of "boundless confinement" is palpable, though the explicit insertion of the "Timeframe: None—" line reads as a meta-textual artifact that briefly breaks the immersive world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.2)
    Sensory details are vivid ("amber haze," "crushed starlight") but often lean into "cozy fantasy" tropes that provide atmosphere without constraining action. The setting serves as a backdrop rather than a pressure cooker; the smog and city do not actively oppose the protagonist's efforts.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is established through generic, elevated descriptors ("monumental," "ancient") rather than sensory interaction that constrains action. The "rosewater dread" motif is atmospheric but becomes repetitive rather than deepening the sense of place.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is vivid but relies on ornamental adjectives ("grey finger," "black spine") that verge on purple prose. While the lighthouse is central, the environment functions as an atmospheric backdrop rather than a source of frictional constraints that force difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.3)
    Atmospheric details like "corrupted gold" and "oil residue" effectively ground the supernatural elements and establish a distinct visual texture. However, the "abandoned carnival" setting relies heavily on standard genre tropes without subverting them.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, blending specific sensory details ("braided kelp," "gnarled apple trees") with the high-concept floating orchard. The "blue hour" atmosphere is tangibly rendered, effectively grounding the surreal magic in a physical reality that shapes the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is integral to the plot’s resolution; the calcium geometries and shell swirls are not just backdrop but the very tools of the protagonist’s success. The atmosphere of "sunwashed dread" is palpable and specific, grounding the fantasy elements in sensory reality.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.7)
    The setting is vividly described but relies on standard ruin tropes (ivy, rust, dust) without constraining the protagonist's choices. The environment functions more as a static backdrop for internal monologue than an active pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sensory details are vivid and atmospheric ("green-filtered light," "coral fingers"), effectively establishing the drowned district. The setting actively constrains the character, though the specific era and rules of the world (steampunk vs. historical) remain slightly ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=2.5)
    World-building is incoherent, mixing incompatible technologies and environmental rules without explanation. The atmosphere is generic ("murky," "musty") and relies on told descriptions rather than sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.8)
    The visual atmosphere is vivid, with strong sensory details like the "sharp smell of cut glass." However, the "descending while ascending" paradox remains a stated concept rather than a spatially realized constraint that pressures movement or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.5)
    The atmospheric details (floating observatory, dead zone) are evocative and set a consistent mood. However, the sensory environment is often filtered through heavy metaphor ("atomic rage," "blood in shadows") rather than concrete physical grounding. The specific mechanics of the observatory remain vague, serving primarily as a backdrop for the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is rendered with distinct sensory details ("air tasted of copper," "gears lay frozen"), establishing a solid atmosphere. However, the environment functions primarily as a static backdrop for the puzzle rather than a dynamic force that pressures the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting operates on "dream logic" where convenient props (driftwood carvings with specific stories, a plaque) appear exactly when needed. While descriptions like "cobalt terrace" are vivid, they feel decorative and disconnected from the gritty reality implied by "black-market genealogist." The environment does not constrain the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest suit, with vivid sensory details like the "silvery scythe" moon and "slick" stones establishing a consistent mood. The use of the "causeway" revealed by the tide anchors the setting in a specific physical reality, though the "antique drawer pull" feels somewhat arbitrary as a diplomatic token.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the utility poles acting as "rusted sentinels" and the specific decay of the cannery provide excellent tactile constraints that shape the journey. The environment actively constrains the navigation method, satisfying the high-band requirement for setting integration. The fog and salt spray are palpable and directly affect the protagonist's movement.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=3.4)
    The setting blends generic sci-fi tropes ("bioluminescent lake") with confusing sensory details ("smelled of... forgotten water"). Descriptions are ornamental rather than grounding, often prioritizing sound over sense. The "sterile room carved from ancient stone" creates a contradictory, undefined space that fails to anchor the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=4.3)
    The setting relies on generic high-fantasy signifiers ("silver leaves," "captured starlight") that create a static backdrop rather than a pressure-filled environment. While the orchard is visually established, the details are ornamental and do not constrain the protagonist's choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.1)
    The "midnight glade" and "invisible tablecloth of mist" create a cohesive, ethereal atmosphere that suits the fable mode. The use of the dolls' tea set as a grounding artifact amidst the abstract magic is excellent, anchoring the surreal setting in tangible memory.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is visceral and tightly integrated with the character's psyche; the ship breathing through "lungs of salvaged alien tech" and the gravity bonding with her emotions creates a unified experience. The micro-setting of the photographs serves as the physical terrain for the climax, effectively constraining the action.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively using the "whispering hush" and volcanic imagery to ground the fable-like tone. The description of the bugs' light and the black sand creates a strong visual texture, though the connection between the setting and the mechanical plot resolution (the filter) feels tenuous.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.1)
    The atmospheric details—phosphor lights, limestone, and the darkening fort—create a vivid and tangible setting. The sensory environment is well-rendered and supports the tone of "winking hush." However, the spatial logic of the secret room's location relative to the sundial and armory feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.0)
    Atmospheric detail is vivid, with strong imagery like the "blackened spine" and "green ribbons." However, the setting fails the credibility test regarding the central premise; the "frictionless" environment is treated selectively as an aesthetic backdrop for the sea while ignoring its physical impossibility for the protagonist standing on a cliff.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on generic, purplish descriptors ("silver halo," "ghost map") rather than specific, tactile grounding. While the observatory and storm are functional, the "rarefied air" operates as a convenient magical metaphor rather than a physical reality, weakening the sense of place.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting details—glass atrium, brook, sundial—are present but function as a static backdrop rather than an interactive environment. The "kaleidoscope of color" and "whispering brook" are generic sensory clichés that do not sharpen the POV or constrain the action.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the "rusted cathedral" offers a coherent visual, the setting relies heavily on generic "poetic" abstractions ("stars exposed," "silver ribbons") rather than gritty, specific textures. The imagery feels decorative rather than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=5.0)
    While the "skeletal frame" and "glass and steel" offer a visual start, the setting dissolves into vague descriptors like "cloud stuff," which breaks immersion. The world-building feels decorative rather than physical, with elements like the film-reel map functioning as magic rather than grounded reality.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and conceptually tight, merging scientific instrumentation with high fantasy elements ("whispered equations," "storm-cloud leather"). The environment actively pressures the protagonist, with the fading luminescence serving as a tangible countdown. The integration of the "blooming" with the mathematical motif creates a unique, cohesive atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sensory details like the "rainwater and ground lapis" and "miniature juniper" are vivid and specific, grounding the ethereal tone. However, the "misty island" setting feels somewhat generic, serving as a backdrop for the lesson rather than a constraining force that shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    Greenhouse details like watermarks and mold constrain observation and mirror internal shift; butterfly dust as recurring object charges final image under researcher's pattern-seeing bias.

    Glass spire, frozen lake, and nautilus segment are tactile, temperature-rich anchors; the mirrored horizon physically doubles sky and ice, constraining her final gesture. Micro-setting succeeds: the shell’s spiral literally guides hand-movements and resonance. One line drifts toward postcard prettiness—“sky and ice merging into a single silver band”—but the next sentence re-anchors it to breath and sound, salvaging specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.1)
    Glowing viaduct stones function as micro-setting/tool hybrid: phosphorescence guides/narrows footfalls, crimson fade signals cost. Rain, moss, clay dust are tactile, POV-filtered, never catalogued. Spatial choreography clean: she steps, floats, presses; objects track. Weather and surface explicitly alter footing and visibility, forcing slower moves. Final dimming charges closure image under RR.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cavern’s cold stone air and “echo of forgotten rhythms” act as micro-setting that literally receives the carved filament; the drum skin and needle function as environment-in-hand, constraining the final gesture. Sensory hierarchy favors touch over sound, matching POV. Seasonal rustle returns in the last line, recharging the stake. Meets 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Rooftop tiles slick with evening dew, brass tube grooves, fig-leaf murmur—each detail is filtered through Elias’s metrological gaze and constrains footing/tool/hand. Spatial choreography is immaculate: gap between buildings, drop into forgotten courtyard, pigeon released upward—every move is tethered to tangible environment. Weather is not backdrop but data source and moral barometer, integrating atmosphere with theme. Micro-setting (tube, courtyard stones) functions as extension of Elias’s body, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.2)
    The greenhouse is not backdrop but active pressure cooker: ventilation system, UV lamp, petal-locking mechanics all constrain the moment she uncorks. The crystal vial doubles as micro-setting; its facets cast literal shadows on her cheeks, marrying object to body. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—lantern broker notices light spectra before botany. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from overhead lights-off to UV halo to exit at dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    Terra-cotta grotto breathes through tactile verbs—“walls seemed to breathe,” “sediment band a page”—and the starlight slit actively tugs the rope ends, charging the final image. Spatial anchors hold; no white-room gaps. Micro-setting (rope body, knot pattern) functions as extension of environment and constrains the poet’s manual dance. Would need one more causal interaction—e.g., a strand actually snagging—to breach 9.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Greenhouse-shipwreck micro-setting is vivid, tactile, and specific; driftwood selection and bowl placement anchor the scene. Sensory hierarchy skews visual—little smell/temperature—but the rusted hull hum is an inspired acoustic layer. Environment is handled in lived-in ways: wood is gathered, bowl repositioned, fire fed. Final image of pulsing stars through shattered glass charges the closure with spatial poise.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Amber grotto functions as micro-setting: its honeyed light guides dilution choices and its dusk pulse times the dose. The blotter petal is handled, re-handled, and finally re-cased—its journey tracks the emotional transaction. Stone bench, resinous air, and distant drip are filtered through the dealer’s sensory hierarchy, never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography stays clean across two bodies and one exit. The setting quietly constrains: no quick escape from resin-thick air, no daylight to expose the counterfeit.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.1)
    Cliffside glass-and-iron library, salt-laden gusts through tall windows, and the locket’s silver weight are selectively re-used to constrain choices (open-air meeting neutral ground, lantern-lit terrace); micro-setting beats entwine with emotional pressure, charging the final starlit image without tourist sprawl.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    The crystalline orchard is no backdrop; its refracted shadows and humming frequencies constrain Kael’s every move and finally swallow his loneliness in borrowed starlight. Micro-setting—the spiral tag etched where glass meets earth—literally roots the closure. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: the marsh-reed sculptor notices texture, vibration, and silence rather than tourist vistas. One notch below 8.8 only because crater physics (light exhalation, borrowed stars) edges toward poetic license without full world-rule anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rooftop canal, phosphorescent algae, and crystal bell in a cage of frozen reverberation are tactile, specific, and filtered through Elara’s illustrator gaze. Environment actively constrains: moss slip forces attention, canals reverse under borrowed time, the bell’s vine-echo cage must be physically struck. Micro-setting (the pendant against her sternum) doubles as temporal gear and body-anchor. Sensory economy is exact—no tourist catalog, only the details she needs to sketch or survive.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Environment functions as micro-setting: the mosaic stepping-stone literally constrains Vesper’s kneeling body and dictates the only possible ritual. Stalactite drip cadence times the beats, cavern darkness supplies the only light source for glass-eye reflection. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (“silver droplets into silent music”). Final image—doorway etched in light—charges the setting itself with conceptual cost. World rules remain consistent; no spatial drift.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    The library’s crawl spaces, steam pipes, and loose baseboards are not backdrop but tools that constrain how Mara can act; the seventh-shelf baseboard must be pried to deliver the tape. Sapphire dusk and coal-smoke taste recur, recharging the final image when the boy’s voice replaces the 1957 woman’s. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track her vertical climb, the pocketing of the reel, the cross-legged boy on the pre-placed blanket. Environment, body, and object jointly charge the closing beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mossy trellis functions as micro-setting: its wet wood refuses nails, forcing the release tactic; final arch is shaped by the vines’ own tensile logic. Rain is not backdrop but immediate constraint—boot suction, dripping eaves, soaked skin—integrated into every beat. Spatial choreography is clean: leaf pluck, lattice crouch, backward step track without drift. Selective sensory triage (cool damp leaf, trickle down forearm) mirrors Elena’s narrowed attention under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    The granite’s “salt-scarred” surface, the watchtower ruin, and the brooch half-buried in wet sand are tactile anchors that constrain where she can walk and what she can find. Rain trails literally carve her path, integrating setting into plot mechanics. Sensory hierarchy obeys her painter eye—color of bruised sky, texture of rusted debris—so description never feels catalogue. Final image of rain tapping the window fuses inside/outside, charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cave’s chime-scale and bright darkness are returned to twice with altered timbre after each shadow ingress; final image reweights the same crystals as now “steady, unpredictable.” Body-as-setting is handled via Lira’s palm-and-pearl micro-positioning that decides the climax. Sensory hierarchy favors echo and luminosity over visual catalog, matchingPOV bias. No spatial drift; distance from pilgrim to back-wall silhouette tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ivory stones after rain serve as micro-setting that literally alter light and metaphorically become blank pages awaiting inscription—this constrains the archivist’s next act of writing. Salt-crusted velvet case, brine-scented hands, and mist-writing droplets are tactile, lived-in details that evolve with action. Spatial choreography clean: valve handed over, carried to archive, placed in case. Sensory hierarchy obeys her professional filter—smell of brine first, sight of stones last.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment becomes micro-setting: the phantom punch is handled in three distinct beats (pocket warmth, brass flare, validation bite) and directly gate-keeps the final image; the starlit mist vault is not backdrop but a pressure chamber that erases her maps and forces new navigation. Sensory specificity is selective—ozone and old iron on the breath, cracks that pulse rather than merely glow—each detail tied to her cartographer’s bias for topography of smell and texture. Spatial choreography is pristine: door behind condemned station → rusted hinges → dissolving threshold → cathedral of frozen breath, all trackable in a single continuous move. The setting charges the ending: the liquid-mercury starlight pools onto her unspoken truths, making the architecture of silence an unavoidable physical workspace she must now chart with voice instead of ink.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    The open tower is rendered through tactile night cold, salt wind, and telescope gears; whale song vibrates stone, turning architecture into instrument. Micro-setting—the tile under the floorboard—literally constrains action: Lira must pry, handle, translate. Spatial choreography is clean: charts spread across flagstones, mural climbing walls, fisherman dwarfed by star-painted ceiling. Environment and body mutually charge the ending image: the tower’s acoustic shell now forever murmurs, a physicalization of the conceptual reprice.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prismatic escondite functions as micro-setting: its fracturing geometry literally supplies the tactical means for scattering consciousness. Sensory hierarchy skews visual, but light/memory synesthesia is POV-justified for a dimensionally aware immortal. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the implosion sequence; no floating bodies or teleporting props. The environment constrains the final choice—only within this crystalline trap can the mutiny be consummated—meeting 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    The embalming machine’s wheeze and chemical stench permeate every beat, constraining Sam’s breathing and timing; the ink pot’s cracked glass becomes a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-specific—Sam notices surgical steel, fluid gurgle, not floral wallpaper. Spatial choreography is flawless: eighteen-pace map, three-minute blind spot, the exact angle between cabinet and door. Environment directly enables the breach and pays off in the closing dirge-currency metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    The fluorescent lamp becomes a micro-setting that actively constrains every beat: its dying-star flicker dictates the spectrum she can refract and therefore which “history” is harvested. Bonsai labyrinth geography stays coherent—branches lean, dew lenses refract, roots absorb spectral ink—each detail tethered to her immediate tactile goal. Sensory hierarchy matches her craft priorities: hum frequency before color before leaf texture. The final gilded shimmer on leaves is environment charging the image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.1)
    The Grid’s salt-stained concrete, vent holes, and twenty-high stacks aren’t backdrop; they shape how he scavenges and where the bottle lodges. The tide rhythm supplies a living clock that times every micro-beat. The rusted tackle box functions as micro-setting, its changing weight constraining whether he can carry or must abandon it. Final image—water licking the anchored box—charges the entire atmosphere with irrevocable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    Observatory, cello body, and shell function as micro-settings that constrain every move: wind dictates resonance, shell’s spiral literally maps the inward turn. Sensory hierarchy favors sound and touch—perfect for a story about listening. The rusted dome and sea-air erosion are more than wallpaper; they decide how the cello can hum. Final image—shell as lens on the telescope—crystallizes the setting-to-theme transfer.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is filtered through Mira’s body and tools—turpentine sting, rain-softened planks—so the raft-carnival constrains every paint stroke. The stone chip functions as micro-setting that charges the final image; without it the closing beat loses its grit and memory-claim.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lunar regolith, visor reflections, chemical vial, and camera exposure are filtered through professional attention, constraining tactics (anchor tripod, shield eyes). The moonlit summit and Earth-glow are not scenery but tools that set the bloom’s location and the flare’s necessity. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible props. One notch below 9 because the crater rim could have been used to hide or reveal the bloom under new light, tightening stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    Micro-setting triumph: the mercury pool and suspended glass sphere literally let a blind woman “see” circuitry, so setting constrains every decision. Depot mist, salt-air taste, and gaslight refraction are filtered through Miren’s bias toward vibration and temperature, never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean: drone, tools, lantern, apprentice tracked without drift. Could edge higher if the depot’s social texture (other workers, ticket counter) pressed back, but the isolated bay suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    Corrugated metal, rusted rivets, and the frozen lake’s forgotten shape give tactile, POV-filtered specificity. The phrasebook dog-ear and condensation on glass function as micro-settings that literally steer the plot. Weather is not backdrop but oracle: the ice’s whisper in seven languages forces the final stance. Only the outpost’s interior layout remains vague, preventing full 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    Thornhaven is sketched with corpse-sharp specificity—“moss grew in its cracks like old blood,” “streets were a graveyard of abandoned hopes.” The archway functions as both setting and tuning chamber, its geometry literally shaping the final chord. Micro-setting (the tuning fork carved from fallen bell-tower heartwood) constrains the method and reappears at closure. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and subsonic hearing, matching Kael’s profession.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Underwater temple as micro-setting constrains every move: oxygen gauge, crushing walls, knotted architecture that literally re-knots when the hush dissolves. The crystal vial recurs as tactile object, cool in the captain’s quarters, charging the final image. Sensory selection narrows to pressure, pulse, salt—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is flawless; the corridor re-alignment is the spatial payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lighthouse-prison, reef, and copperlit stone are tactile, selective, and filtered through the POV’s obsession with silence; the lattice’s grain and the scuffed door constrain the only possible path. Spatial choreography is clean; the spiral descent and final sealed chamber track without drift. The copper glow charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.9)
    Greenhouse, winter fields, and ancient tree are vividly sketched with cold-light imagery; the bead as micro-setting charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; frost, glass, and root are tactile. The “alchemical” rule-set is never tested or constrained, so environment is backdrop rather than choice-forcer.</question>
    <question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—orchard survival—is declared late and abstractly; pressure is atmospheric, not tactical. No resource is lost or path foreclosed; Elara’s single action is unopposed. Escalation is a smooth crescendo of luminescence rather than a narrowing of options; cost is ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    Red canyon walls, tide-pool dusk, loom-creak, dust-footprints—selective sensory triangulation keeps attention tight; the copper plate acts as micro-setting that constrains the final walk. Place names stay spare (“the wharf,” “the labyrinth”) yet accumulate texture through synesthetic loom-sound and moon-rust color. Spatial choreography clean: Elara’s footprints → tapestry → canyon grooves track without drift. The orchid alcove is the charged environmental rebate that reweights precedent—setting literally “carved into reverence.”

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.0)
    The catacomb orchard is not backdrop but tactical: roots guide her feet to fragments, bones become bookmarks, dappled light patterns the moment of discovery. Spatial choreography is clean (roots between femurs, stone clicks into groove). The sundial as micro-setting constrains the final choice and charges the ending image, meeting the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy reflects Lina’s priorities—touch of moss, smell of memory—never cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    The arcade at dawn is sensory, specific, and filters through Kael’s artisanal gaze—“frayed awnings,” “fossil of commerce,” “sepia tones”—while the ebony clipboard constrains every encoding motion. Micro-setting (clipboard surface, chalk stubs) doubles as tool and terrain, guiding finger placement and camera angle for Mira. Weather is not just backdrop: the threat of rain supplies the temporal fuse that forces Kael’s last spiral galaxy glyph.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Cobalt walls “absorb light” and the eternal candle’s blue-white heart are not backdrop but tactical constraints—only that flame can reveal the hidden star, hence the tapestry must be folded under its glow before flight. Autumn leaves scraping stone fuse auditory texture with thematic hush, charging the final image of Mira vanishing into the same echoed silence. Spatial choreography holds: frame, stand, corridor, cloak pocket—no drifting landmarks. Micro-settings (flame, cloth, pocket) literally guide her choices; setting therefore passes the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mangrove labyrinth is not backdrop but navigation constraint: every paddle stroke narrows exit routes, forcing the apology outward. Shard-as-micro-setting constrains the ritual beat and reappears in pocket at closure, charging final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis—salt scent, wet bark, broken-glass timbre—filtered through guilt-bleached perception. Spatial choreography clean: paddle, root, boat, tide line track without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting: its weeping glass and aerial-root silhouette externalize Kael’s unasked questions and constrain his decryption work. Brain coral and plaster cast act as portable settings whose tactile grooves guide finger-choice and memory-access. Sensory hierarchy (salt-taste of cordite, coral’s calcium bite) filters through translator’s trained attention. Environment does not merely mirror but physically hosts the decryption act that reweights stakes.

    The garden’s steel sculptures and shifting sound refractions are tactile and specific; the hobo nickel functions as micro-setting that constrains Elena’s hand and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is effortless—light, echo, and pigment track cleanly—earning the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse is not backdrop but tactical weapon: humidity scrambles scanners, pollen clouds carry cipher. Mango-roots conceal the dead-drop; orchid shadows obscure hand-movements. Sensory hierarchy—tactile seed, insect wing-beat, auditor’s grey sleeve—mirrors the surveillance vs. nature dialectic. Micro-setting (seed between thumb/forefinger) literally constrains the final activation phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    The shell-cathedral is handled with tactile specificity: conch walls, spiral chambers, coral spears laid on the rim—objects repeatedly handled, constraining ritual space. Sensory triangulation is biased to the poet’s exhausted ear: “half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind” lets sound carry setting rather than static vistas. Spatial choreography stays coherent as merfolk circle the rim and tails paint light; no impossible geography. The reef itself evolves from scar to blossom, meeting the 9+ gate by charging the final image, though broader oceanic rules (currents, pressure, bioluminescence timing) remain lyrically vague, capping at 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    Environment, body, and tool trifecta: the cracked bamboo tube functions as micro-setting that both enables and wounds the song; Lyra’s fractured heart is the body-in-setting; the opal shelves supply vertical scale that pressures her solitary climb. Sensory hierarchy stays filtered through her caretaker bias—she notices shimmer, silence, petal fracture, not tourist vistas. Spatial choreography is clean: she “moves gently systematic,” breath-to-pitch-to-light sequence tracks without drift. One hairline slip—“across the museum of extinct feelings” drifts toward abstract landmark—but the object continually constrains her tactics, satisfying 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.1)
    The glass ink well functions as micro-setting: its depletion constrains the mid-scene choice to stop writing and launch the tube, then charges the final image when empty beside Kess’s fresh wells. Sensory selection—“quicksilver ink that shimmered with trapped starlight”—filters through Elara’s professional awe. Spatial choreography is clean: desk → pneumatic tube → central chamber. Archive stays off tourist-catalog detail; pressure is linguistic, not architectural.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.3)
    The surveyor’s chain and basalt blocks act as micro-setting, constraining the decryption choice and returning in the ceremonial guide; volcanic breath and sulfurous sigh integrate environment into the final charged image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Skylight beam and dust function as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice: balance, mapping, release.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    The drifting prism terrace functions as both macro-setting and psychic mirror; its fractured light literally refracts the narrator’s memory, charging the final image. The wooden table’s grain is micro-setting that constrains choice: every line dictates a precise step-count before the threshold will open. Weather-code symbols and corn-silk scent are anchored in maze-architect lore, giving the world internal consistency without exposition dump. Spatial choreography is ghostly but coherent—no impossible positions—so the surreal frame stays navigable.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.0)
    Flooded corridors, coral-crusted instruments, and pressure-wave dawn are selective, sensorily balanced, and always filtered through Iyana’s astrologer gaze. The plaza-as-open-courtyard and the feather’s projected ghost-maps constrain her final choice; environment literally shows her the pattern she must join. No static cataloging—each detail either escalates pressure (oxygen countdown) or charges the final image (firefly bacteria as nebulae).

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.0)
    Environment is protagonist: the iridescent geode walls constrain movement and literally embed the missing pieces. Sensory hierarchy skews visual—shimmer, glow, hue—but the quartz tapestry is tactile and lived-in, not tourist postcard. Weather is internalized as “amber and rose” sunset echo, mirroring the reweighted glass. Micro-setting (tide pool) becomes the stage for the final reconfiguration, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal arcade is rendered through Ezra’s tactical gaze: salt-worn railing, coin-return slot, mirror-timed star-glint all become playable squares. Sensory hierarchy obeys his performer's priorities—sound of 8-bit thunder, plankton glow timed to guard patrol. The bishop operates as micro-setting that constrains the final choice; environment directly enables each manipulation. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across four engineered encounters plus perch returns.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    The garden is rendered through motion, dew, starlight and the dancer’s proprioception; “moonstone dust on petal” is a crisp micro-setting that later constrains her tattoo pigment, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial logic clean; no environmental choice alters tactics beyond the initial anchor, so just shy of top band.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory selection is disciplined and POV-tinted: dawn color, glass reflections, salt-air hush. The lighthouse prism atrium and pearl bay are named but never repositioned or allowed to obstruct action, so they decorate rather than constrain. The hidden pond functions as micro-setting; its rings become the interpretive tool that focuses closure, giving it an integral final charge. Spatial clarity is perfect; environment never complicates tactics, hence not quite indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    The moonlit ridge is not backdrop but tool: silver pools dictate where Elara steps, granite spires frame her stone-circle shrine, and planetary arcs meter the thirteen-year vigil. Micro-setting succeeds too—the cracked porcelain’s glaze becomes a lens scattering constellations across granite, literally projecting stellar patterns that charge the closure image. Weather is used tactically: wind disperses ash at the exact beat grief is released. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible positions or floating props.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ivy-veiled passage functions as micro-setting: frost-vine hybrids clutch damp stones that guide Mira’s fingertips and later constrain her departure. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—calloused fingers detect ink under blisters, milky sun pierces cracked ceiling—rather than tourist catalog. The chalkboard equation reappears as a recharged image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    The parapet’s prism droplets and the echoing terrace are returned to throughout, each re-description tightening the painter’s canvas; the final fading prism is the charged image. Micro-setting—stone veins, moss-softened floor—constrains her barefoot grace and channels the lullaby’s vibration. Weather remains causal: rain → droplets → prism → code medium. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating bodies. For 9-band, needed one tactile tool-prop whose loss or alteration stung the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    Terrace, solstice light, and planetary alignment are woven through action; the stones warm under bodies, the light kisses clipboard edges—environment constrains the ritual timing and supplies the hum that seals the pact. Micro-setting (clipboard surface as ritual altar) charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate. Some cosmic language edges toward ornament, but never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    The salt flat’s crystalline crust, resonant hollow, and mirror-fissure map are not backdrop but instruments: they guide Vesper’s steps, amplify the single note, and ultimately record the ghost-echo. Micro-setting (egg glass, condensed breath) constrains the final gesture; weather evolves from lull to deluge, erasing the map yet fixing the sound—an 8.9 for environment-as-apparatus.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    Frozen air as prism, silver courtyard, snowflakes as “forgotten syllables” supply tactile micro-setting that constrains her silent dance and later catches fractured starlight in the closure image. Spatial choreography stays clean; only the courtyard’s exact social geography (where windows are, who sleeps) stays vague, a forgivable ellipsis at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cracked parabolic dish above the bar functions as a charged micro-setting: it concentrates the meteor hush and literally amplifies the silence that becomes the story’s final currency. Selective sensory detail—rusted girders, static-blue CRT glare, reclaimed parachute silk—fuels the seed-bar seediness and mirrors the stripping of moral varnish. Every noticed object is filtered through Adrian’s urbane eye, giving the world tactile specificity without tourist clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.4)
    The grotto itself acts as tool: altitude denies permanence, clouds supply building material, the 47° sunrise angle is a mechanical constraint that dictates tower placement. Body-as-setting is equally precise: silver hair becomes thread, lungs feel “respiration” of moss exhaling spores whose vectors are already gone. Spatial choreography is flawless—reader always knows where wing, tower, and monarch are relative to Esme’s body. Final shadow-as-flyway-map is micro-setting charged with closure, impossible to relocate without breaking logic.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Frozen dome, shifting aurora hues, and rope-as-filament are tactile, selective, and bias-filtered through a caster’s eye for negative space. The sanctum’s acoustic properties literally shape the climax—sound is the tool—so micro-setting constrains the final choice. Ice, brass scent, and cardboard soot are balanced across senses without checklist溢出. Spatial choreography stays clean; only the aurora’s “drip like melting snow” risks mixed metaphor but pays off thematically.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve vanishing names—signals early; pressure tightens when card grid matches rope, forcing a single irrevocable act: reconfigure braids or let voices die. Escalation is textural/accumulative: each newly-lit fiber adds sonic density, narrowing her stance from exile to keeper. Cost is visible aurora energy and emotional thaw; no coincidence resolves. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens;agency resides in the deliberate threading.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rewilded forest is sketched through selective, lived detail—fermented-moss tea, mortar dust, vine-textured concrete—never catalog. Body-as-setting counts: brittle thumbnail, dusted hair, rain-washed scalp constrain her last move. The laughing fox stamp (micro-object) physically changes hands, charges the bunker-memory, and is relinquished to loam at the crucial beat, meeting the Q3 9+ gate. Spatial logic holds: footprints swallowed, walls scaled, storm-break overhead all track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lapis-inlaid floor, chalk circles, windblown dust—selective tactile detail anchors the observatory as monastery. The tile’s warmth/cold cycle and moonlight angles constrain ritual timing, charging the final activation. Palace empties in real time, providing spatial choreography that tracks Kael’s isolation. Environment mirrors internal arc: stripped rooms → stripped self, yet the pattern persists, charging the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sanctuary’s material flux (marble → sandstone → pulsing tissue) directly constrains Mira’s tactic—she rides the shifts instead of fighting them. The soundless void forces the color-as-music payoff, making the setting a co-protagonist. Spatial choreography remains clean across dissolves. Micro-setting (the pin) also charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.0)
    The half-buried sextant, frost-silvered trunks, and cider-press workshop function as micro-settings that constrain tools and tactile motion. Environment dictates choice: only frost-infused glass can become the new mirrors; only the collapsed observatory yields the frame. Final image of glass-mountain orchard is inseparable from transformed stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    Raftered orchard is tactile: rotting ladder groans, resin scent, quartz glint, sun-shaft through roof hole. Cathedral spine split by roots functions as environmental antagonist; ribbon’s color against gray bark becomes the charged final image. Spatial choreography is spotless—bag, squirrel, locket, beam nest all tracked. One minor overgloss: “thousand new leaves” edges toward poetic excess, not enough to dull the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    The astral orchard is never backdrop: branches “knit starlight,” bark rearranges constellations, fruit tastes of “shattered symmetries”—each descriptor constrains Evers’s perception and final choice. Micro-setting inside the bathroom compresses thought into clarity, literally enabling the philosophical breakthrough. Spatial choreography is clean: shell pressed to forehead → sigil → trunk → bite. One minor over-adjective (“luminous fruit that hummed…”) but it pays off in the closing reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mountain-bookstore-as-organ metaphor is sustained through “stone chambers humming,” “unheard symphony,” and the glass-pane ceiling that “recharges” the final image, so environment constrains and rewards. Spatial choreography is clean: doors → shelves → catacombs → glass mosaic; bodies and distances track. Sensory hierarchy favors sound and tactility, matching the linguist POV. A hairline slip: “golden chords” at dawn is a touch painterly, but the prior sonic architecture keeps the final image charged.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.1)
    The carnival-ship is rendered through selective sensory triage—rust flakes, mildewed popcorn, calliope pipes—each detail tethered to Mira’s search. The emerald swatch card micro-setting acts as both key and mirror, constraining her literal path and charging the final glow. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Environment directly shapes tactics and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clock-tower mechanism room functions as micro-setting: brass gears and cold exhalation constrain her path choices; the rope itself becomes hybrid tool/setting whose braid-tension records timelines. Spatial choreography is immaculate—panel reveal, narrow passage, suspended rope—tracked without drift. Final image (new chime beat) recharges the opening “fable of absence.” Missing 9.0 only because broader campus geography is implied, not tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Harmonic caves function as active instrument: ice lattice, pedal-note hum, and stone pedestal directly constrain tactics and shape the final image. Selective sensory economy—breath-frost, glow-pulse—mirrors Lira’s narrowed perception under acoustic siege; no exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)

Sensory hierarchy follows the saxophonist’s ear-eye sequence; spatial choreography stays clean as he steps, blows, lowers horn. Setting constrains tactics—sound can be weaponized because the grotto is a resonant chamber—charging the final dimming.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.8)
    “Ashen skyborne arbor” is never catalogued; instead we taste dust, feel root-hollow silk, see moonlight smear on bark. The arbor’s spiral root geometry is re-used as seed-stack blueprint, so setting literally shapes the final gesture. Micro-setting triumph: moonstone needle and petrified-leaf cairns constrain every tactile move. Environment passes the 9+ quick test by charging the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment (greenhouse rust, mineral-frozen gears) constrains every move; the crystalline gear face literally redirects her final tactic. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s clock-maker bias: sound of grinding quartz, smell of wet stone, sight of light on mineral tears. Spatial choreography is tight—lantern angle, ladder rungs, spray trajectory all track. Micro-setting (compass rose face) charges the closure image when its angled planes redirect water. One hairline slip: “burnt wire” smell is announced but never re-anchored in a later beat.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Foundry steams, bricks breathe copper-smell, furnace exhales workers’ names—environment actively participates in Elara’s ritual. Rainwater collected from broken gutters is micro-setting that constrains the quench beat; temperature of gutter water vs. furnace heat sets up the scream that shifts zodiac figures. Spatial choreography clean: coin moves pocket → anvil → grate; body moves lantern-spot → furnace → doorway. Final golden shadow reprises earlier “gold-filled cracks,” charging last image.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.0)
    Echo Gorge is not backdrop but resonant instrument: its sound-swallowing physics forces Kael’s distorted harp tactic and dictates the confessional returns.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    Brass-polish scent claim, dew-bead rosemary oil, and the clepsydra’s “captured rain” act as micro-setting that constrains Elena’s non-olfactory senses; the midwife screw’s topography and the fog’s watercolor wash charge the final image when she wears the screw as talisman.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Floating rock, tea-stone, stormberry ink, and crow feather are not postcard décor: each constrains action—ink chemistry halts progress, platform’s polish resists mark until tear softens surface. Sensory hierarchy (hush so thick it “hums,” ink catching dim light) mirrors internal saturation. Spatial choreography clean: quill, vial, pouch tracked without drift. Object states evolve (liquid → crystal → glow), charging final image. Meets 9+ gate: the crystalline rune on tea-stone is the charged final object.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    The archive is more than backdrop—dusty scores and the scarred piano bench physically constrain where Mira can place the case and how Linden must turn. The morning light fracturing through the bottle doubles as emotional prism and clock; the rising scent narrows perception to remembered soil, guiding the apology’s timing. Spatial choreography is flawless: no floating bodies, every object handled changes state (bottle opened, mist dispersed, page turned). The orchard outside evolves from silence to crash, anchoring the final cost.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    The temple-library is rendered through selective sensory strokes—gravity poems on ceilings, nautilus shelves—each detail bending choice by limiting or enabling movement. The dictionary mutates from paper prop to skeletal extension, satisfying the 9+ gate that an object must charge the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean as corridors lengthen or compress in step with her inward descent. A hairline slip: “light that had never known a sun” edges toward abstraction, though it fits the unreal cosmos.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    The horizon station, brass key, and water-clock reservoir are handled in tactile detail—key teeth “slice a whisper,” reservoir level drops perceptibly—and these objects constrain the ritual steps. Fjord silence acts as acoustic setting that amplifies each click; the still water mirrors the glass-pool metaphor, tying external state to internal shift. Micro-setting (key, lock chamber) dominates, but it repeatedly alters Elias’s tactical choices. Light, sound, and water are filtered through his engineer’s bias, never touristy.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mycelium membranes function as both setting and plot gate—literally parted “like curtains of living silk” during Kael’s crossing—so environment constrains the decisive choice. Bioluminescent rhythms provide the only light source for the climax, forcing the laser pointer to dim and symbolically cede authority. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Kael notices spore-laced air, substrate give, cyan pulses—never tourist catalog. Micro-setting (the button in pocket) charges the final image when it stays silent, now a tool for mapping love, not threat.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.1)

    The hairpin, yew bark, and mist-pooled cloud-sea function as micro-setting, each constraining the next cut. Scalloped blade and sigil-inscribed earth are tactile, lived-in tools. Perpetual-twilight vineyard rules stay consistent—grapes hold souls, overripe grief taints—learned through pruning action, not exposition. The easternmost terrace’s shadow depth mirrors Elara’s interior, charging the final pale-grape image.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse, wind chimes, and salt air are used as tactile tools, not postcard backdrop: the chimes’ discord literally blocks entry until the lantern is unhooked, and the breezy dawn carries the keeper’s spoken key. Shard-as-micro-setting constrains perception; its empty centre is handled twice, charging the final spectrum. Spatial choreography holds across the spiral ascent. Sensory hierarchy narrows to wind, light, and smoke, matching the reflective tempo. Environment directly shapes the tactic of loosening the cloak, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.0)
    The magnetic grotto’s iron-pull is not backdrop but an active constraint that reverses cellular time; same with the floating granite slab—both body and tool that enables the final step into water. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mira’s altered biology: she feels the field before she sees it. Spatial choreography is immaculate: platform, pond, ridge, cave mouth track cleanly across the night. Final image recharges both settings as the grotto’s pulse syncs with the star-woven pond, making environment and body indistinguishable.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Bone towers, rose-quartz disc, and dust strata are handled, struck, and made to resonate; their acoustic properties directly enable the final map, satisfying the 9+ gate. Canyon acoustics and avian choreography are filtered through a mystic surveyor’s priorities, giving the world intimate, functional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Micro-setting success: the keystone itself functions as environment—its “single ivy leaf” and pulsing light constrain every choice once Vorrin reaches the pedestal. Icebound spire is sketched with chilling sensory economy (“air that accommodated impossibilities by keeping them perfectly preserved”). Spatial choreography clean; no geography drift. The final image of man-stone-mist fusion charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.0)
    Pier boards, rusted ladder, whale-rib shelves, phosphorescent ink—each detail is tactile and stakes-shaping.

Micro-setting (key-tag as heartbeat) charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Amber deck, resin walls, frozen galaxies, and the brass telescope create a tactile micro-setting that constraints motion (creaking deck, press of forehead) and charges the final image (walls glow with pre-birth light). Selective sensory hierarchy favors touch and resonance over visual catalog. Spatial choreography clean across three coin-casts. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.1)
    The observatory’s brass instruments, prism light, and wax cylinders are tactile tools that constrain her method; the atlas page itself functions as micro-setting whose blank corner forces the final mirror. Spatial choreography is clean—light angles, lens tilts, shard drops—and the environment mirrors her narrowing interior focus. Dusk-to-starlight progression is economical and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sapphire viaduct, dew, cracked bronze, and salt crust are tactile and selective, never touristic. The central arch’s shadow–sun intersection literally positions the bell and determines the strike angle, so environment constrains the climax. Micro-setting of the bell’s internal resonance is tracked through warming metal and starlight cracks, charging the final image. One hairline slip: “cosmic imbalance” remains atmospheric, not sensory.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    The wind-chime hush, mud-sucked glass, and lantern’s blue bloom are tactile anchors; the reservoir itself functions as a mutable mirror that constrains visibility and metaphor. Spatial choreography is flawless—flashlight beam, knelt retrieval, ridgeway tread, station door ajar—all tracked. Sensory hierarchy obeys warden priorities: sound of water level, scent of old wood, coyote as living alert. Final image (star-lit water) recharges the same mirrored surface introduced on page 1—setting charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orchard, waterfall, and silver apples are lived-in: bark “holds ancient equations,” apples chime advice—setting feeds both atmosphere and choice. Crystal and flame act as micro-setting, constraining the final fusion beat. Spatial choreography stays coherent in a single continuous scene. Descriptive density risks purple drift (“color between heartbeats”), but here it is pattern-taught and paid off, so penalty waived.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    “Nocturnal arbor above the clouds” is sketched with synesthetic shorthand—starlight on metal, sway of branches, low hum—economy over breadth. Micro-setting (buckle, control interface, breath-mist) constrains the revision act and reappears in final image, meeting 9+ gate. Selective sensory triage reflects crisis: cold, vibration, click—visual dominance justified by night watch. No geography drift; spatial choreography stays tight in one perch.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    The jar, rock dojo, and dissolving stones are micro-settings that constrain choice: the jar must be shattered before integration can occur, the crumbling dojo forces the step-off moment. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV bias—formaldehyde swirl, silver-blue veins—selective and urgent. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: clones collapse into him, stones melt, he remains centered. Final image reuses the floating rock as pure force of will, charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.1)
    Brook-side micro-setting is filtered through Mara's puzzle-designer eye—water sound as “auditory trigger,” moonlight as mirror-prop—so environment constrains her inventing and charges the sprout image at close.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.1)
    The echo-chamber tunnel functions as micro-setting that literally multiplies sound, enabling every tactic; concrete damp, recoil vibration, off-kecho kazoo timbre are filtered through Eleanor’s conductor ear. Sensory choice stays urgent—what the tunnel turns into music dictates next yank intensity—so environment constrains choices and charges the final image (silence that now breathes). Spatial choreography is tight; no geography drift. World rule (dead can tug sound from cord) established early and stays consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.1)
    Frozen garden is not backdrop but prosthetic extension: ice glyphs force the guardian to read by tongue, mist curtails vision so navigation must be mnemonic. Pendant’s impossible geometry is re-handled three times, each state altering what can be perceived. Micro-setting (the pendant lens) literally bends light and choice. Falls short of 8.5 because no environmental detail directly forecloses a live alternate path—garden never offers thaw vs eternal cold fork.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    The crozier’s evolving state—intact, cracked, ground to shards—functions as micro-setting that constrains each tactical shift. Ash-and-blood mortar, frozen glass tree, and twilight nexus are specific, sensory, and filtered through Elara’s alchemical gaze. Spatial choreography is clean: wind spirals, penny sweats green flames, branches knit. The final image recharges the opening “ember nexus” with transformed rules.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rusted ladder grooves, moss-reclaimed steel, and “harmonic so low it lived in the teeth” are tactile and specific; the gorge’s hunger mirrors Mira’s internal void without overt symbolism. Tower Nineteen’s copper veins and ghost frequencies constrain her every move—she rewires what’s already in her hands. Micro-setting succeeds: the single copper wire becomes the new world’s artery.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    Observatory-as-body: glass dome mirrors her cranial dome; server-room air “tastes of old circuits” fuses mind/machine. Snow-quiet outside, ink-nerve inside—micro-setting objects (shard, terminal, vial) constrain every move. Tool-use tactile: stylus traces ink, shard completes circuit. Spatial choreography clean—no impossible reaches. Environment evolves: snow keeps falling, dome keeps glowing, final image reweights “opal” from jewel to skull. No occupational dumps; only details that affect defrag tactics appear.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    The canyon, bone towers, and tunnel of echoes are not backdrop but instruments: the tunnel’s polished calcium literally amplifies the diamond’s new voice, constraining the climactic act. Micro-setting objects—the copper veins and flawed diamond—are handled in every beat, their changing states (veins oxidizing, fracture resonating) altering later choices. Spatial choreography is flawless: the climb, the press, the leaving of the stone track cleanly. Sensory economy favors texture over vista, matching the urgency of a last speaker racing extinction.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.1)
    The underground garden is not mere backdrop; its moonwort, sagging phone, and vine choreography supply the literal playground for playful gravity and constrain the metamorphosis beat.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sky-bridge cables, ash-fall, granite tear-track, and locust-ridge under thumbnail all double as micro-setting that physically constrain tactics: cable transmits orchard pulse, ash times heartbeat visibility, shell’s weight & warmth enable sync. Sensory hierarchy matches musician POV: sound>tactile>visual. One object—locust shell—charges final image (dust in palm) and literally enables closure, satisfying 9+ gate. Iron orchard’s rule-set stays consistent (fruit→gears→fruit again) and discovered through action, zero exposition dump.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cracked pavement, ozone air, and neon-flicker of the cobalt arcade are tactile and filtered through the courier’s practiced eye. Space stays coherent: rooftop launch, rusted fire-escape landing, alley exit. The bottle’s glint and static crackle at the end reweight the setting into a charged.micro-object that mirrors the emotional discharge.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    Train geography is tracked by touch—splintered seat, rust-eaten corridor—so body-scale navigation stays coherent. Cracked-glass garden car and silver spring are micro-settings that constrain discovery: only this warped door yields the fragment. Sensory hierarchy favors hush and glint, matching POV’s carpenter bias for texture over color. Final carousel spin recharges the initial “peeling paint” image with glowing light, satisfying 9+ micro-setting test.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    The library is not backdrop but topological actor: shelves inhale, spacetime is woven into paper, dog-eared corners mark event horizons. The scarf functions as micro-setting—its knots and stains constrain navigation and finally re-map themselves onto the ceiling as a new constellation. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: the librarian notices static of lullabies, taste of unspoken words, rather than visual décor. One precision misfire: “frozen sound waves” as pedestal material is metaphorically rich yet physically vague, but the image is brief and does not distort spatial choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    The archipelago is not postcard scenery but an active grammar: islands “arrange themselves like question marks,” mist is “thick as unspoken regret,” setting literally rewrites the navigation path. Micro-setting of the palette’s wells—each a different hour—constrains the painter’s tactics and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is pristine: dream drinks “reflections of stars that fled,” camera click “split darkness,” all tracked without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rain-scoured fresco vault is not backdrop but tool: its cracked plaster guides her finger to the seam, then reappears as the ceiling she touches inside the chapel, recharging the same texture with new devotional weight. Micro-setting (the torn map on her worktable) literally constrains her next move—she must travel. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elena’s parchment-and-glue vocation: scent of old parchment arrives first, sound of rain last. No static catalog; every stone is noticed because it might be a door.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sunken library is not backdrop but tactile constraint—anemones colonize decks, coral fuses with logs, water pressure bends brass—every detail pressures the handling of the globe. Micro-setting rule met: the snow globe itself becomes environment-in-hand, its “minute gravity” guiding the final reclassification. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Cassian notices refractive index before emotional color, a scientist’s panic. Spatial choreography is pristine; bodies, distance, and object states track across the ascent without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is the story’s chief glory: the cloud-borne courtyard, glyphs blooming in stone, and the singing rivets create an airy, tactile dreamscape that constantly steers attention. Sensory selection stays biased to the balladeer’s wind-listening ear, integrating detail into motion (“each swirl a verse, each bolt plate a chorus”). Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drifts.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ice-spire is not backdrop but decryption device: its prismatic filigree is literally read by the goggles, so environment dictates the only possible method of revelation. Micro-setting of the diary surface—parchment that “shifted when viewed from different angles”—becomes the contested terrain where intimacy is won. Spatial choreography is flawless: elevator floor numbers track Kai’s rising emotional exposure, bodies stay confined in a cabin no larger than the story’s word count. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV bias: Kai notices steam spirits and brass hums because those are the captain’s noticed beauties now re-seen through servant eyes. Weather (sun shaft) is plot trigger, not ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    The brass telescope is micro-setting: it anchors her body against twenty-three-degree tilt, constrains her last possible action (looking, not radioing), and is left as monument—its lens literally charged with final starlight. Cloud names and cable hiss create sonic immediacy; the listing frame and frost on eyepiece give tactile limits. Spatial choreography is flawless: the canister’s weight against the chute, the recorder’s click like insect wings—every object’s state tracks. Gate met: tool charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.0)
    Airship hull, brass lantern, ozone scent, starling murmurations—details are selective, POV-filtered, and return to charge the final image (“starlings trailing like a farewell”). Whispering Crag and luminance are sketched rather than deep-mapped, but at this length the micro-setting (phrasebook, hopscotch board) constrains choice and thus satisfies the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. Tone matches twilight wonder without tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    The frozen library above clouds is not postcard scenery—it actively withholds warmth, forcing the protagonist to seek internal combustion via gears. Micro-setting triumphs: the crescent-moon keyhole and uncapped gear's hollow core are tactile objects that constrain and enable the decisive turn. Sensory hierarchy is POV-tuned: frost-rimmed doorways, silver mist, and amber ripples track the locksmith's professional attention to metallic breath and eclipse cycles. Environment, tool, and body converge in the final image, charging the mirror's amber glow with irreplaceable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Floating arches, chalk glyphs, bronze bell etched with wings—details are sensory and specific.

Micro-setting (bell handle cool against shared palms) is the sole tactile anchor that briefly merges body and tool.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.0)
    The pane of hush functions as both atmospheric veil and physical constraint: it absorbs footsteps, translates motion into memory, and finally lets the ocean relearn breath. The nested spirals act as micro-setting—each fold is a tactile surface the adjuster’s fingers must negotiate. Body-tool-object triad is perfect: the puppet head’s cracked ceramic literally refracts light paths that reorder time. Setting detail is selective—no lighthouse mechanics beyond the lens—keeping economy poetic yet functional.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cliffside labyrinth is not backdrop—it actively patrols, freezes, and kills. The mechanical birds’ gear-frost transition is taught early and charges the final frost seal. The sundial stone and poisoned orchard constrain Elara’s motions and moral space. Spatial choreography is flawless: torchlight depth, nut-shadow angles, frost fingers climbing the wall all track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ravine’s two channels and transient foam constrain both insight and metaphor; the empty chrysalis functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when released. Selective sensory hierarchy—sound of water, visual foam geometry, tactile grip on chrysalis—filters through polymer-chemist perception. Spatial choreography is clean: rim → current → downstream merge tracks without drift. Weather and topology affect choice (rapids → insight → release). Meets 9+ gate but capped at 8.3 because the urban lab coda is only sketched; environment there does not actively constrain tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.1)
    Glass orchard library and bottled moonlight are vivid, selective, and return to charge the final image (“bottled another fraction of moonlight”). Spatial choreography is clean: customer enters, light pools, books rustle, vendor remains behind counter. Environment constrains the vendor’s final choice—she cannot drink her own product without dissolving her role—meeting 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Desert-after-rain micro-climate steers every move: dune-skin split reveals icebound coral, pools become memory-fossils, pink stalactites drip sorrow. Spatial choreography is exact—“descended through a crack… knelt beside the first pool”—so body, object, and terrain feel mutually porous. The fortress kitchen, though off-page, persists as the place where future bread will ghost-tingle, giving the final image environmental bite. Specificity is sensory, never catalogue: salt-crystalline edges, metallic grief, coral groan.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.1)
    Setting is distilled to the grain elevators as multilingual “voice boxes”—a sharp, memorable compression that externalizes the conflict. The astronomical clock tower functions as micro-setting: its brass weight warms the palm, constellations glow, gears exhale, so the object actively times the climax. Spatial choreography stays clean across the spiral stairs, belfry, and festival stage. Weather and season are omitted, but at this length the selective sensory focus (starlight, metal, chorus) productively narrows perception.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    The canyon is not backdrop but active neural substrate—phosphorescent minerals "store memories like a neurological substrate," forcing her footfalls to alter the data bank beneath her.

Spatial choreography is immaculate; moonlight, rock faces, and mirror planes track cleanly across beats. Weather (quaking moon, ozone breath) directly affects the memory-excavation physics, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is vivid and selective: candle flicker, slick serpentine walls, mist that clings to skin; sensory hierarchy obeys POV urgency. The prism itself steps in as micro-setting/tool that constrains action—without it the doodle stays invisible and the quest fails, so it charges the final rainbow image. No white-room syndrome; distance and drift under reversed gravity are tactile. World rule (inversion window) is learned through action, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.1)
    Alder trunks, porcelain shards, and breath-cold air are sensuously selected and return to constrain technique (bow against insulators, lantern against dark).

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.1)
    Workshop, radio dial, and clasp function as micro-setting: the radio’s hum and the clasp’s spring physically constrain her tuning choices and deliver the final click. Starlight and ink-shadows mirror internal hush without overwriting. Spatial anchors stay consistent; no object teleporting. Environment could exert sharper pressure (cold, risk of discovery) to reach top band.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    Perpetual mist, petrified-wood mortar, acorn vial: each object is tactile and stakes the ritual. Spatial tracking stays clean—treetop bridges, hammocks, harp beside journal. The village never becomes a postcard because scent-wind and sap-direction keep it lived-in. Final image of “wildflower hush” reuses the opening hush, recharging atmosphere without new detail, just missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Floating arches, twin suns, and reverse-flow irrigation ribbons are filtered through pilot priorities; every detail either guides navigation or mirrors internal stakes. The 20-degree temperature drop at the arch threshold is a micro-setting beat that constrains the final choice to drift. Spatial choreography tracks glider, water, and seed cyclone cleanly. Environment literally re-weights the meaning of “up” and “down,” charging the final image; thus meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ice cavern is not backdrop but active antagonist: its “weight of frozen sound” presses ears, dictates ritual timing, and glows only when bells are tuned to aurora hues. Spatial choreography is exact—circle of bells, reflected colors on ice, sculptor’s distant stroke—all tracked without drift. The aurora itself becomes a living instrument; its shades are mapped to bell frequencies, turning sky into playable terrain. Micro-setting (amber sheet) warms against cold, constraining when Lyra must act before it cools—detail that charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Thunder-echo range is rendered through sensory triangulation: bruised sky, gravel that sings, canyon hush pressing ears—each detail double-duties as mood and navigational tool. The flute’s glowing sliver and the driftwood “lit by an inner fire” act as micro-settings that literally steer his choice at the exit. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: riverbed → pass → boulder → stone-pillar forest; no impossible moves. Setting constrains the final image—he must walk downward through the same pillars that witnessed his fracture, cementing environment as silent witness.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    The topaz walls and halo fragment function as micro-setting: their pulsing light and copper shadows constrain Cassian’s choices—he times each print to the fragment’s heartbeat and stops when it dims. Star extinction is not mere atmosphere; it mirrors the fragment’s decay and charges the final darkness with conceptual cost. Spatial choreography stays clean: press, bench, vellum, notebook track across beats without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway is not backdrop; its shifting green waves echo pendant rhythm and dictate the courier’s slowed pace, directly shaping agency. Micro-setting—the frozen earth beneath the pendant—yields the germination beat, coupling body, tool, and environment. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: visual ribbon sky, haptic vibration, auditory hum. Details evolve; sprout→silver tree mirrors theme of myth accretion. No spatial drift; weather is causal, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Quartz arbor, frost-constellations, and Volvo glass form a single constrained arena; the prism-as-tool and frost-as-lens dictate the only possible tactics. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—she notes electromagnetic spikes, not touristic mist. The final image of the arbor “somehow less solid” is earned because the setting has been established as a recording medium that can lose density after transfer.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    The loom and amber bead function as micro-setting: they constrain every tactical choice and charge the final image. Bamboo forest is sketched with selective sensory economy—“silence grew thicker than morning mist”—filtered through Mei’s auditory obsession. Spatial choreography is clean: box against ribs, candle-shadow on warp threads. Weather and season stay peripheral, avoiding tourist-catalog cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.7)
    Floating rock arches are not postcard scenery—they dictate the entire plot: their dust colors snow, their cracks force council action, their stone must be mined. Micro-setting works: the lantern-lit shaft walls “glittering with the same blue mineral” constrain movement and sight. Environment mirrors internal state: moss over warning signs = Ren’s buried defiance; azure dust shifts from decay to vitality as Ren’s stance crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.7)
    Repair-bay as micro-setting succeeds: rusted hull plates, cracked concrete, distant-radio static all filter through sensory mapper POV. Spatial choreography stays clean—shadowed corner, half-buried shard, exit door—bodies and objects track. Environment does not constrain tactics (no locked door, no tool shortage) so gate for 9+ missed, but atmosphere is integral. Green glass shard functions as mobile setting fragment that charges final image when it vanishes.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    Salt-crusted glass, brass housing, spiral steps, and the cairn’s moss-covered rocks are filtered through Caleb’s caretaker gaze; the lantern room’s cold and the ghost’s warmth create an immediate sensory tension that guides his decision to bottle the glass, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.

    Emerald lighthouse, glass-crystal wick, and star-pricked dark supply micro-setting that constrains every beat of light-steering. Visceral sensory triad—wind taste, crystal chill, green ray—anchors POV without sliding into catalog. Spatial choreography holds across the single scene: beam-thread from tower to hull is trackable. Final image of gold dawn reweights the emerald palette and satisfies 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Floating tea-house above liquid-silver mist is visually memorable and repeatedly filters perception; height metaphor mirrors the master’s remove from ordinary life. Blue morpho scales as micro-setting succeed: grinding pressure, iridescence, and sun-angle mechanics are concrete, not ornamental. Spatial choreography is soft—no sensory cue confirms the house’s drift “level with clouds”; it’s asserted in closing summary rather than lived. Weather/mist is over-relied on for atmosphere; each mention adds lyric echo but minimal fresh sensory data, so texture plateaus mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    The tower corridor, body, and sextant together function as micro-setting; the sill’s moonbeam literally constrains the repair and subsequently the map’s projection. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—salt and stardust noticed because she tends stone. Spatial choreography holds from flagstones to spiral stairs to garden gate. Final image of moon-washed oaks glowing charges the closure under the inferred lens.

Spatial choreography is clean: mica pressed against obsidian glass, fracture pattern tracked. Micro-setting (mica sheet) charges the final image; without it the dawn-sliver fails, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bookstore’s water-stained ceilings, philosophy shelf, and moonlit dust motes are selective, POV-filtered details that guide Mira’s hand to the invitation and later mirror. The corridor of light is sketched with restraint, keeping spatial footing clear. Micro-setting success: the crumpled invitation itself becomes a portable shard of the hidden world. Just shy of 9+ because the exterior street beyond the window remains a blank canvas, untapped for contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    The palace courtyard functions as both macro-setting and micro-tool: cracked flagstones receive seeds, mossy fountains supply water, the yew shelters the tea table. These details constrain tactics—officials never penetrate the overgrowth, giving Mara tactical freedom. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Mara notices rust, yeast ghosts, frost-nipped air because they signal erasure. The breadcrumb-soil mixture charges the final image, making environment and ritual inseparable.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Frozen library is not postcard backdrop; ice creaks under literal weight of forgetting, constraining the chief’s micro-moves.

Environment guides every micro-adjustment of weight and tension.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dome’s glass geometry, fossilized footprints, and roses weeping amber sap are tactile constraints that shape the burn decision. The box, irrigation panel, and corroded servos act as micro-setting objects that charge the final image—when the caretaker’s finger sparks, the reader already knows every surface it can touch. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: ceramic joints creak before color is named, and static hum drowns vision. One-to-one specificity; nothing could be swapped without breaking the tactical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.1)
    The courtyard is never a postcard: jasmine vines “strangle” the post, survey flags “intrude,” colors shift from apricot to rose—details that mirror rising stakes. The mailbox itself becomes micro-setting, its brass face and rusted lock constraining every attempt to open it until the key turns. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions during dawn gatherings. Meets 9+ gate: the mailbox charges the final image and constrains the choice to display the letters publicly.

    The orchard-in-rafters setting constrains choice: rotting ladder limits access, split roots demand grafting, moss obscures quartz eyes. Final image charges the ribbon against gray bark under sunlit quartz—a visual payoff where environment enables thematic resonance. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (resin’s stickiness, apple’s dryness) without tourist cataloging. Spatial choreography stays coherent across vertical climbs and nest encounters.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.4)
    The astral orchard functions as both macro-setting and micro-setting: its silver branches, crystalline paths, and vacuum-defying wind directly constrain Evers’s choices (e.g., retreating to the drone-free bathroom) and charge the final image (trees tilting like sentient mourners). Sensory detail is purposefully selective—humming fruit, liquid memories, recycled air—filtered through Evers’s fractured perception. The pistachio shell, as recurring object-as-setting, evolves from blank potential to sigil-carved key, physically enabling the climax. Every environmental element reflects thematic stakes: starlight-knitted fruit embodies remembrance; constellations in bark signal cosmic scale of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mountain bookstore functions as both setting and character—its stone chambers, catacombs, and glass-mosaic library directly constrain choices (e.g., hidden stairway unlocked by reassembled phrases). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: “perfume of forgotten herbs,” “lantern casting flickering notes,” “stone warden’s eyes glowing like muted brass.” The environment charges the final image—the cavern’s visual symphony makes the unheard audible. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite descent into labyrinthine depths.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.3)
    The abandoned carnival ship functions as micro-setting and active constraint: its decaying layout guides Mira’s path, the fog limits visibility, and the garden’s iridescent names alter perception. Sensory details (popcorn, mildew, flapping canvas) are selective, POV-filtered, and evolve with discovery. Crucially, the setting charges the final image—the ship exhales as the garden blooms, linking environment to internal resolution. Emerald card and rusted trellises tie object and place to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.1)
    The clock tower mechanism room functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its temporal ambiguity enables the door’s appearance, and the brass gears’ behavior reflects narrative tension. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—“cold air,” “subsonic resonance,” “warm as living skin”—filtered through Elara’s archivist POV. The Chancellor’s Chain charges the final image, its unoxidized state defying time yet demanding tactile interaction. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent even in the impossible passage.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.3)
    The harmonic caves function as a living micro-setting—ice cracks, frozen pool, and resonance directly constrain Lira’s tactics and charge the final image. The echo chamber stone’s glow and the “hammered repose” are tactile, recurring details that evolve with the narrative. Sensory hierarchy shifts appropriately: early focus on vibration and sound gives way to visual mandalas and thermal breath-frosting. The environment doesn’t just reflect mood—it actively participates in the conflict’s resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.1)
    The glass humming pavilion functions as micro-setting: its panes constrain choice (alignment must match silver-painted constellations) and charge the climax (humming intensifies with starlight). Sensory detail is selective—sound (thrum), touch (cold steps), sight (faded silver)—filtered through the custodian’s urgency. The tower’s ruin and wasteland below contextualize stakes without exposition. Final image (“thistle of hope rooted in ruin”) ties environment to theme with irreplaceable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.6)
    Setting functions as active constraint: the solid fog plateau isolates the observatory, the stormlight enables shadow-reading, and the hexagonal crystals force embodied engagement (kneeling, feeling cold). Every detail serves pressure—the obsidian stairs fragment her reflection just before confronting undifferentiated memory below. The moss-bound journal’s scent (“thunderstorms and old ink”) ties past to present. Final image of morning light on the dome charges closure by contrasting stormlit uncertainty with earned quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    The blooming fortress is vividly rendered with wisteria, bougainvillea, and broken flagstones, but it functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active constraint. However, the kerosene rag knot—a micro-setting object—directly enables the climax and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (floral perfume masking mortar), though the starless void borders on thematic shorthand. The setting supports tone but doesn’t force tactical choices beyond providing tiles for the mosaic.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ancient grotto functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and charges the narrative: its tidal pool dictates biological rhythms, its star-pierced ceiling refracts light into liquid silver, and its chalk-marked walls echo ancestral navigation—pressuring present choices about leaving and staying. Sensory detail is selective (cool jade, soft water give) and filtered through Mara’s chronicler POV. The setting culminates in the final image where stone anchors shifting water, directly shaping the closure’s resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting operates as micro-setting: the porcelain doll and sealed glass case constrain choices (limiting exposure), while the xenial trellis enables high-altitude silence harvesting. Concrete sensory detail (“metallic quiet of the ventilation shaft,” “mint and distant thunder”) filters through the child’s obsession. The bunker’s walls “press” yet “hold a secret garden”—environment directly charges the final image. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography (climbing, falling, slipping inside) tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.6)
    The drifting prism terrace isn’t backdrop—it’s an active constraint shaping buoyancy calculations, wind shear navigation, and harmonic balance. The storm glass vial functions as micro-setting, its chemical reactions dictating Kael’s tactics. Prismatic light and atmospheric tides aren’t decorative; they physically manifest sound and emotion, culminating in tears that “focus the quiet.” Final image charges the vial’s transfer: environment, tool, and body coalesce into portable peace.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting functions as active constraint: the peelable murals guide navigation, the waterfall’s static charge interacts with the chronoshawl, and the orchard’s stasis fields preserve memory-fruit essential to closure. The observatory’s layered skins directly enable the discovery of the throne chamber. Final image—fruit falling like memories—is charged by environment. Only minor deduction: “nano-tube transitway” feels under-integrated compared to other setting elements.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ashen sanctuary functions as micro-setting: its charcoal walls filter starlight that cues hope, its loaded emptiness pressures emotional exposure, and its breathing walls respond to the characters’ rhythm. The doorknocker ring—a tool—constrains choice (she withholds then offers it) and charges the final image (glinting with latent spark). Sensory detail is selective (tactile ash, visual starlight, auditory silence) and filtered through the keeper’s trauma, avoiding white-room syndrome or generic description.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.3)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting: fungi exhale oxygen/secrets, thrive under pressure, and their bloom triggers diamond crystallization. The submarine porthole bolt constrains Kael’s agency (only it releases compressed air) and charges the final image (“glinted, a reminder…”). Sensory detail is selective (soft blue glow, hiss of air, crystalline crackle) and filtered through Kael’s trauma-turned-purpose. Every environmental element ties to theme or tactic, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sepia reading room functions as a potent micro-setting: its amber light, dust motes, and mahogany gramophone directly shape perception and action. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—golden shadows deepen with sound waves, dust becomes truth. The environment charges the final image (“golden shadows whispered farewell”) and constrains the protagonist’s only tool: the crank handle. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.3)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: its endless night, silver vines, and transmuted leaves directly shape Aldric’s actions and the story’s metaphysics. The glass cathedral evolves causally—from static refuge to singing, trembling vessel of creation—and charges the final image where “each fruit a universe.” Sensory detail is vivid yet purposeful, filtered through Aldric’s withdrawn sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.1)
    The foster care file room functions as a charged micro-setting: dust isn’t backdrop but a tool that constrains Marianne’s method and reveals narrative sequence. Sensory detail (stale air, sagging shelves, brass patina) is filtered through her professional bias and grief. The button’s physicality evolves from artifact to vessel of legacy, directly charging the closure. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: puddles, lagoon, mossy slab all constrain or enable choices. The auric lagoon’s bioluminescence isn’t backdrop—it triggers the door, floods circuitry, and becomes a burial shroud. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (ripples at dusk, compost bin stench), and the phone booth key’s materiality ties past to present. Environment charges the final image: reflections dance like maps of freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    The radiant grotto, dewdrops, and prism atrium form a cohesive micro-setting that charges every image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through the saxophonist’s ritualistic focus. The environment constrains no physical choice but deeply shapes the final image—light refracted into silence, then faded stone. This qualifies as micro-setting-as-tool under lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting: its branches constrain movement, its ash shapes planting, and its roots mirror Lira’s spiral monuments. The moonstone needle and petrified leaves are tactile, recurring objects that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective, poetic, and filtered through Lira’s ritualistic focus without tourist detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.2)
    Setting functions as active constraint: the greenhouse’s decayed state forces physical navigation that mirrors Elara’s internal shift, and the subterranean waterfall’s mineral-choked gears demand improvisation. Sensory details (oil, burnt wire, wet stone, spray) are filtered through her tinkerer’s attention and evolve with plot—e.g., leaves swirl *before* the compass spins. The compass rose and drain grate anchor spatial choreography cleanly. Final image (greenhouse doors wide open) charges closure by contrasting earlier “cathedral of dead leaves.”

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.1)
    The rain-washed foundry functions as both setting and micro-setting: its embers enable the ritual, its gutters supply quenching water, its brickwork absorbs memory. Sensory specificity (“copper-smell,” “slick brick ribs”) filters through Elara’s alchemical perception. Crucially, the environment charges the final image—the golden shadow stretching at dawn literalizes the kintsugi ethos applied to absence. One missed opportunity: the marsh beyond slag heaps is evoked but never interacted with, slightly weakening spatial pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.4)
    Echo Gorge functions as both setting and active constraint—it swallows sound, regurgitates memory, hides laughter between notes—and its transformation (“less like a grave and more like a throat preparing to sing”) charges the ending. The crocodile’s tooth, harp, and silver vial are micro-settings that shape tactics: the tooth’s scrape produces the sob-like note that finally draws out the fractured laugh. Sensory hierarchy reflects Kael’s urgency: focus narrows to strings, cliffs, light shifts. The gorge’s physical logic remains consistent and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.1)
    The ultraviolet forest functions as both setting and micro-setting: UV light constrains action (triggering memories, demanding exposure), moss offers tactile feedback via proprioception, and the pewter strap anchors Elena physically and thematically. Sensory detail is selective (ozone, pine, violet fire) and filtered through trauma—vision dominates under duress, touch grounds recovery. The environment charges the final image: light as shroud, forest as home-that-was-never-left. Every element ties to the dominant stake, avoiding white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.0)
    The alchemist’s market functions as micro-setting that supplies both resource (fragment) and method (hidden paintings), directly enabling the plot. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—sulfur, rope bridges, lantern flicker—and filtered through the translator’s professional bias. The lighthouse fragment constrains choice (must be held to canvas) and charges the final image (resting against the heart). Spatial choreography remains coherent across descent and ascent, with weather and height reinforcing thematic fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.1)
    The abandoned circus ticket office functions as micro-setting: its collapsed counter, false ceiling, and water-stained posters directly constrain Marlon’s actions (climbing, tile removal) and charge the final image (“cracks seemed to breathe secrets”). Sensory detail is purposeful—buzzing fluorescents, burnt caramel, motes of dust—filtered through his technician’s attention. The mainspring barrel, found amid decay yet “impossibly pristine,” gains significance because environment contrasts its condition. Setting doesn’t stall momentum; every description advances discovery or atmosphere under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.6)
    The glass orchard library isn’t backdrop—it constrains every choice: frost forms only on oldest glass, apples fall upward when equilibrium breaks, and light through perforated pages projects meaning onto spines and air. The setting charges the final image: two libraries shatter into “a single, crystalline instant,” with glass as both vessel and boundary. Sensory detail is purposeful (“swirling sea of clouds,” “soft scrape of a million pages”) and filtered through Elara’s profession. Environment directly enables the climax and embodies the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.3)
    The baroque asteroid isn’t backdrop but active constraint: its spires, temporal storms, and mirrors shape tactics and charge the final image. The shard functions as micro-setting, its fracture line echoing historical fault lines. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“ghostlight of bygone eras,” “sound of shattering glass that had not yet fallen”). The environment directly enables the climax—without the mirror-covering ritual, the truth couldn’t surface.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.0)
    The resonance chamber functions as micro-setting: its silver veins amplify sound, quartz pedestal stores memory, and breathing walls respond to harmonics—directly enabling the climax. The body (rusted joints) and tools (meteoric tweezers, spider-silk filament) constrain tactics. Every sensory detail serves pressure or closure, especially the final image of golden threads stitching darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.4)
    Setting functions as active crucible: the quarry’s blackberry-choked entrance, calcite-slick ledges, and subterranean lagoon directly constrain Mira’s descent and final choice. The compass and petrichor vials act as micro-settings—their properties (frozen needle, remembered rain) charge the climax. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira’s priorities (mineral breath over visual cues), and the lagoon’s stillness pressures her renunciation. Environment irreplaceably shapes the ending’s hinge.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.1)
    The storm-tossed archway functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges the climax: its niche receives Mara’s carving as if preordained, making environment an active participant. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—ozone, iodine, barnacled rocks—filtered through Mara’s sculptor’s attention. The turbine-hum evolves from backdrop to chorus, binding human, machine, and ancestor. Final image of the glowing archway with figures in mist reweights all prior description, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    The amber pavilion, postcards, and cathedral window function as micro-settings that charge the closure—the pavilion frames both beginning and end, while the glass constrains Sable’s revelation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: “honeyed light,” “cold surface,” “umbral tenderness” all filter through Sable’s perception. The recurring postcards evolve from static artifacts to active guides, directly shaping her brushwork. Only minor deduction for slight overreliance on visual description during the cathedral scene.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.0)
    The zeppelin library and obsidian lagoon aren’t backdrop—they constrain tactics (floating archive enables secrecy) and charge closure (broadcast from air over silent dunes). Sensory detail is selective: creaking leather, saltwater taste, coastal winds—all filtered through Elara’s archivist POV. The recurring beach debris functions as micro-setting that directly enables the climax. Final image of drifting south ties environment to earned peace.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    The paper-lantern cove functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and charges the narrative: its emptiness pressures Kael’s solitude, its boardwalk channels his pacing, and its water reflects the amber glow that becomes the town’s resurrected spirit. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—charred silk, rain-slicked morning, tide-worn shells—all filtered through Kael’s grief and resolve. The setting culminates in the final image where lanterns on water reconfigure loss into legacy. Only minor deduction: the cove’s geography lacks tactile specificity beyond shoreline tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.4)
    The rooftop orchard is not backdrop but active micro-setting: its roots pierce steel, its trees supply the vault’s location, and its leaves echo the prophecy’s pattern. The phonograph and wax shaving function as tool and object-setting, constraining Elias’s only viable response (immersion in the reflecting pool). Weather (approaching storm) and time (post-foghorn silence) shape urgency and ritual logic. Every sensory detail—tarnished bell, flaking wax, rippling water—serves causality or closure without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.3)
    The icebound atrium functions as both setting and micro-setting: its frozen soil constrains seed planting, its glass dome filters transformative starlight, and its thawing directly signals success.

The final image of dawn-thaw charges the closure with earned hope. Every environmental element pressures or enables Elara’s ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.4)
    The windblown sanctuary isn’t backdrop—it’s an active constraint: altitude isolates Elara, winds test the bell rope’s glue, clouds obscure then reveal the valley, shaping her choice. The bell rope (micro-setting) evolves from frayed hazard to symbol of withheld action. Sensory detail is selective (frost-kissed stone, plastic cold, tea’s faint ping) and filtered through her meteorological attention. Final image—gold-purple clouds in solstice hush—charges the closure by contrasting expected storm chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting functions as micro-setting: the station’s decaying corridors, fractured windows, and rusted telescope directly shape Sola’s actions and perception. The yellow lantern glass—discovered in the telescope’s gears—becomes an extension of environment, charging the final image when set in the window. Luminescent moss grows where the glass’s glow touches, making the setting dynamically responsive. Every sensory detail (cooling metal sighs, silken hush, amber light) filters through Sola’s spiritually curious POV, avoiding tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.1)

    The cobalt lagoon, rain-damp air, and shoreline debris are rendered with vivid, selective sensory detail that filters through the poet’s attentive POV. The setting actively charges the closure: the lagoon becomes a “mirror of endless woven dawns,” and the driftwood shrine anchors the final offering. Crucially, the environment constrains no physical choice but functions as a micro-setting that shapes perception and ritual—sufficient for lyric mode. Weather (post-rain stillness) and light (shifting hues) evolve causally with the poet’s reflections, avoiding static description.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.3)
    The temple orchard functions as micro-setting: living stone pillars, copper-wrapped oaks, and strangler vines directly constrain choices (e.g., weaving wire through vines instead of cutting). Final image—glowing pillars, humming wires—charges closure with irreplaceable specificity. Sensory detail (phosphorescence, copper’s high note) is filtered through Elias’s botanical-caretaker POV, avoiding tourist cataloging. Environment actively shapes tactics and legacy definition.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    The rainwashed tower, overgrown sculpture path, and bronze quiet atmosphere function as active micro-settings that constrain and charge the narrative. Sensory detail (wet earth, metal, crunching gravel, amber warmth) is filtered through the protagonist’s scientific yet poetic perception. The recurring amber and moss-swallowed sculptures evolve in meaning and directly shape the final image. Environment and object jointly constrain choice (she follows footprints, not roads) and culminate in a charged poise at the summit.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is integral: the dead reef, barren battlefield, and blooming jetty aren’t backdrop but active constraints. The jetty’s rotting wood hosts stubborn flowers that glow at twilight—a micro-setting that supplies both emotional anchor and literal soil for renewal. Spatial choreography is precise: coachman moves from road to jetty to battlefield to garden, each shift altering tactics. The environment charges the final image: “narrow vastness filled with colour” ties scale to hope.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.1)
    The scrapyard isn’t backdrop—it constrains every choice: water from a radiator, food from rations, navigation by scent-memory across cracked terrain. The “wild hush” and corroded machinery filter perception, shaping what Wick notices (Maya’s scent on fabric) and how he moves. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: the vault’s sterile preservation contrasts the wasteland’s decay, making the leaf and cylinders feel sacred. The body itself functions as micro-setting—his ears, nose, and paws are tools that interact tactilely with oilcloth, wax, and grooves.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.0)
    The whispering gallery functions as micro-setting: its curved walls transform footsteps into sighs, directly enabling the unbinding ritual. Chessboard on plinth constrains final image—missing pawns literalize thematic loss. “Luminous absence” permeates sensory detail (pale light, marble echoes), filtered through Kael’s trauma. Weather/time absent but unnecessary; spatial choreography (northern arch → western alcove → stairwell) tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.3)
    The mountain bookstore is not backdrop but active crucible: its shifting corridors constrain Mira’s search, its ink-dust air flavors memory, and its very architecture becomes the revealed map of home. The feather, stone, and basalt pedestal function as micro-settings that directly enable and charge the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—wet ink, silvery glyphs, rustling pages—and evolves causally with the plot (shelves tremble, then align). The setting culminates in the final image: dawn etching “a new shape of home” against the peak, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    The frozen village functions as micro-setting: its temporal stasis directly constrains the tutor’s options (no help from townsfolk) and charges the climax (time resumes only after he acts). The platinum tapestry—a recurring object—constrains choice by demanding interpretation through chess logic. Sensory detail is selective (cobblestones, misting breaths, humming crystal) and filtered through the tutor’s professional perception. However, the setting doesn’t evolve causally beyond the initial freeze/thaw binary, missing a chance for deeper interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    The bone towers, pale spire, and mist are not backdrop but active constraints: the spire’s smooth surface enables painted verse; its height isolates Kael for rebellion; the canyon’s acoustics amplify echoes that become thematic counterpoint. Sensory detail (ivory/ash light, violet/silver shimmer) is filtered through Kael’s artist POV and tightens under pressure. The setting charges the final image—the marked spire becomes monument to refracted truth—and evolves causally after the pigment strike.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.3)
    The acid sea, copper-bell workshop, and fungal statue aren’t backdrop—they actively constrain choices (limited breaths, corrosive atmosphere) and charge the ending (warm gold tracing against corroded stone). Sensory detail is selective and urgent: hissing foam, verdigris-stained hands, gaslight on scarab wings. The setting’s logic (floating workshop on acid sea) remains consistent and tactile, with spatial choreography clear through porthole, workbench, and beam collapse. Final image of “infinite canvas of corrosion and possibility” ties environment to theme.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coastal cave functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image: its turquoise pool, shaft of light, and echoing walls directly enable the painting act and thematic resonance. Sensory detail is selective (brine, wet stone, silk wrapping) and filtered through Elias’s painterly perception. However, while vivid, the setting doesn’t *constrain* choice—it facilitates without imposing meaningful limits or altering tactics, missing the 9+ gate for environmental pressure on agency.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.3)
    The cobalt lighthouse isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting: its warm stone, singing glass, and lantern-room height constrain and enable Elara’s ritual. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: salt air, thunderclap, then jasmine’s ghost—all filtered through professional keeper priorities. The vial cork and fresnel lens are handled with lived-in specificity, not catalogued. Final image charges setting: copper waves and cobalt glass reweight silence as navigable terrain.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.3)
    The starlit signal station functions as a charged micro-setting: its broken hydraulics, salvage walls, and window-mosaic directly enable and constrain Kael’s resonator build. The censer foot—a tool-as-setting—guides circuitry and culminates in the final image, its bronze gleam flooding the room. Sensory detail is selective (scrape of metal, hiss of phone line) and filtered through Kael’s urgency, avoiding white-room syndrome. Environment and object jointly charge the ending, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.3)
    The hanging orchard functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and charges the narrative: its roots hide the eye, its groaning mirrors turmoil, and its fruit transforms from “rain-blackened” to ripening as truth integrates. Storms aren’t backdrop but tactical pressure—limiting movement, amplifying sound, forcing decisions. The cliffside ravine spatially anchors every action, and the antique eye’s physicality (cloudy iris, cracks) evolves into a map of communal repair. Final image ties environment directly to thematic closure: scent shifts from decay to healing because of human choices made within this specific place.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.4)
    The opal dock, mist, and lighthouse aren’t backdrop but active agents: the mist obscures and reveals, the dock rises like a “ghostly finger,” the beam becomes a “silent promise.” Crucially, the edelweiss functions as micro-setting—its fragile veins constrain Cornelius’s investigation and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (amber lantern glow vs. alpine scent in memory), and all details filter through the keeper’s weathered perception. The environment directly shapes the thematic closure: visibility equals remembrance.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting is micro-setting elevated: the matrix chip, creek, ants, and limestone bluff all constrain choice. The blooming cavern isn’t backdrop—it exhales “petrichor and time,” its nectar-dripping stalactites and bioluminescent fungi charge the final image with impossible vitality that contrasts Merrick’s decayed shop life. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: humid night → ankle-deep water → cool fissure air → turquoise fungal light. The kudzu-obscured keyhole fissure and moss-thick bluff feel tactilely inhabited, not catalogued.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting functions as active crucible: the mountain’s “lacy menace,” upward-growing thorns, and bleeding starlight constrain movement and perception while charging the climax. The cobalt grotto isn’t backdrop but catalyst—its heat melts ice into “dangerous lace,” its walls channel starlight that “pooled around her feet” as both baptism and erasure. Every environmental detail reflects or pressures the queen’s interior state without overt symbolism, fulfilling the 9+ gate by shaping the final image’s emotional and conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.1)
    The ember nexus functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: its liminal twilight state enables the alchemical act, while dying stars and ash-amber intersection charge every gesture. Sensory detail (liquid-light coat threads, shell’s spiral catching ember glow) is filtered through the alchemist’s cosmic longing, avoiding tourist cataloging. Crucially, the setting culminates in the closure—the nexus pulses approval, making environment a participant, not backdrop. This integration of place, object, and ritual elevates specificity into thematic engine.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.1)
    The mountain ranger cabin functions as a potent micro-setting: its “cedar-shake” walls and “chinks” where wind howls shape the chronicler’s isolation and sensory reality. Crucially, the birch bark scroll—a recurring object—constrains choice (he must write) and charges the final image (tucked beneath his pillow, “bleeding sap like ink”). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“pine resin and old snow”), never generic. The stars’ rearrangement into dreamed constellations directly enables the climax, proving environment actively shapes possibility.

Spatial choreography is clear (window → bedside → door), and sensory detail serves pressure, not decoration. Only minor deduction: “radiant haven” risks abstraction but is grounded by tactile handling of the shard.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle functions as micro-setting: its balcony, desk, and floorboard directly enable key actions (hiding the key, observing noon shadows). The clockwork automaton and brass key are tactile, recurring objects that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective—“brass teeth glinting like frozen starlight,” “low hum”—filtered through Elara’s scholarly focus. However, the setting doesn’t *constrain* a critical choice beyond providing location; it supports rather than pressures, just missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.1)
    The secret garden functions as micro-setting that charges the closure: morning glories on rusted trellises, the cracked sundial, and the telescope aimed not at stars but blossoms—all constrain choice (Moira chooses this space for truth-telling) and reframe meaning. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: Elena notices what aligns with her forensic mindset (sundial numerals, enamel DNA), while Moira engages tactilely (rolling the tooth, tracing stone). The hedge maze’s persistence mirrors the entanglement of myth and truth. Final image ties environment to theme—truth grows only in hidden, tended spaces.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.3)
    The serpentine grotto, mist, wet sand, and zephyr bloom aren’t backdrop—they’re active micro-settings that constrain and charge choices. The sea glass is discovered *because* of the grotto’s tidal dampness; the mist clings as she ascends, marking transition; the village roofs are “dark against the sky,” making the pearl’s glow necessary. Crucially, the recurring object (sea glass) evolves into the final image—a constellation of pearls—that reconfigures the entire premise. Every sensory detail serves the thematic pivot from isolation to shared stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.6)
    The abandoned data center isn’t backdrop but active collaborator: collapsed ceilings channel light for constellations, server racks become trellises, cooling-system water feeds moss. Every detail constrains or enables Elara’s method—the shattered glass, damp concrete, and bee-hived cables directly shape her ritual. The amber pendant and wild honey taste fuse environment with body, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects her calm focus: touch (soil, pendant), sound (drips, bees), taste (honey) over visual spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.1)
    The “feral nexus” functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: mist limits visibility, wet ink impedes movement, and the shell’s placement enacts finality. Sensory detail is selective and pressure-driven—cold fog, humming lullabies, calcium whorls—all filtered through the novelist’s guilt-laden perception. The recurring seashell charges the final image, transforming from vessel to seed. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent despite ephemeral figures.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    The arbor functions as micro-setting: its hush, bark, and canopy directly shape Elara’s actions (palming bark, timing song to dawn). Sensory detail is selective—copper scent, morning mist voice, shimmering leaves—and evolves with the vine’s revival. Final image (dew on tendril kissed by dawn) charges closure with irreplaceable specificity. Only minor deduction: spatial choreography of villagers arriving lacks tactile grounding, though not disruptive at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    The withered orchard functions as micro-setting that actively constrains and charges every choice: skeletal trees frame the sigil, brittle leaves crunch underfoot during placement, and ancient stones resonate with lingering presence. Sensory detail is selective (crunch, mercury-like starlight, warmth of cabin windows) and filtered through the alchemist’s urgency. The crater’s “moving stillness” evolves causally—from oppressive silence to rippling tide—culminating in snow-dusted sky that visually echoes the silver dots. Environment directly shapes the final image: without this specific orchard, the map’s logic collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.3)
    The marble cavern isn’t backdrop but active collaborator: its veins channel vibrations, its angles capture eras, and its reflective surfaces enable the locksmith’s peripheral vision to function as tool and metaphor. The limestone bench “sweating condensation,” rose quartz lenses, and mercury pendulum are micro-settings that constrain tactics—e.g., six degrees off-center unlocks last season’s echoes. Final image of “angled light dancing across his workbench” charges closure by merging environment, character, and theme. No white-room syndrome; spatial logic remains coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.3)
    The bronze grotto functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its copper-veined walls respond to calcified burdens, tightening or loosening spirals to recalibrate the trap. The kerosene lamp burner—a tool—charges the final image, glowing with “whalebone light” after holding the sphere. Sensory details (melting snow, shingled hush, brass wick-holder) are filtered through the weaver’s ritualistic attention, avoiding tourist catalog. Weather (snowmelt) and starlight directly enable the climactic orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft functions as a micro-setting that constrains and charges every choice: light shapes carving, rain mirrors transience, steam times ritual. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—Mara notices rust-hued light, chamomile, whip glints—not as catalog but as emotional anchors. The quartz prism, ash blank, and kettle are handled tactically, not decoratively. Final image of the lion “watching with eyes that held both presence and absence” is charged by the setting’s accumulated textures.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    The kinetic lagoon, halted carousel, and camera wheel form a micro-setting that actively constrains choice—the lagoon supplies narrative fragments, the broken horse anchors reflection, and the wheel becomes both talisman and tool. Sensory detail is selective yet potent (“shimmered like a liquid mirror,” “paint chipped”), filtered through the scavenger’s eroded perspective. Crucially, the camera wheel charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate by shaping the closure’s meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.3)
    The abandoned terminal isn’t backdrop but active crucible: cracked tiles echo, dry fountains become mirrors, carnival detritus yields solar panels. The setting constrains and enables—Mira uses its bones (pipes, roof, speakers) as infrastructure for renewal. The sextant, buried in festival flyers, ties past spectacle to present purpose. Final image—the glowing terminal as “lantern”—charges the closure with irreplaceable specificity; no generic ruin would suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.6)
    The crystal forecourt functions as micro-setting that constrains choice (gears placed only in rain-filled crevices) and charges the final image (sunlight igniting harmony from embedded fragments). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: petrichor triggers memory; glacial hush mirrors emotional stasis. Environment evolves causally—post-storm dampness enables the whispering—and spatial choreography remains coherent. The sanctuary isn’t backdrop but active participant, its silence redefined by Elara’s offering.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    The twilight canal functions as micro-setting: its reflective water, mossy arch, and phosphorescent chamber directly enable discovery. The sundial and radio silence are tactile anchors that shape perception. Vivid, selective detail (amber-violet water, creaking barge) serves theme without stalling momentum. Yet the setting doesn’t *constrain* choice—it facilitates it—missing the 9+ gate requiring environmental pressure that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.3)
    The golden dock, snow, fog, and fulgurite glass aren’t backdrop—they constrain and charge every beat. The micro-setting (rope across lap, lantern light on frost) forces tactile decoding; weather tightens time and muffles distraction. Final image—dock as “page written in frost”—reconfigures setting into archive, fulfilling the 9+ gate by making environment inseparable from theme and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.3)
    The shadowed garden functions as micro-setting: moss-covered statues, dark fountain, and falling leaves directly shape the scribe’s ritual actions and emotional register. The palace carpet thread—a tool—constrains her choices (binding leaves, writing obituaries) and charges the final image when released. Autumn’s decay/rebirth diction filters all perception, avoiding generic seasonal cliché. Every detail serves the theme of lonesome splendor without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.3)
    The suspended palace, stalactite chains, and Cogspire’s grinding gears aren’t backdrop—they constrain and enable. The cradle is carved from stalactite core; vibrations shift stone roots; the egg’s luminescence recalls a sun unseen underground. Every setting detail charges the climax: the creature’s wings stir air that brushes ancient formations, triggering seismic reverie. This micro-setting functions as crucible, tool, and symbol without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.3)
    The obsidian lagoon functions as both setting and micro-setting: its black sand is used ritually, its kelp-drift peace modulates tone, and its mirrored surface reflects thematic shifts. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—warm sand, scent of kelp, silver scars—filtered through Maya’s firefighter sensitivity to heat and aftermath. The environment directly constrains and enables action: sand forms a protective circle, driftwood shelters the bird, volcanic ash becomes sacred ground. This integration charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    The city of forgotten fountains functions as both macro- and micro-setting: cracked basins, ivy-choked alleys, and groaning bridges aren’t backdrop but active constraints that shape Kael’s path and emotional stakes. The stained glass box’s cobalt-amber-crimson mosaic charges the climax visually and thematically. Crucially, the setting evolves—dust becomes shimmering water—and the restored fountains’ glow merges with Kael’s light in the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate: environment directly charges closure. Sensory detail (luminescent crumbs pulsing with heartbeat, goose calls ceasing) is selective, POV-filtered, and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.1)
    The nebula garden functions as micro-setting and active constraint: its recursive geometry distorts sonar tones, petals encode failure/hope, and quantum loam hides the gear. Every sensory detail—phosphorescent pollen, upward-falling tears, humming teeth—is filtered through Elara’s sentimentality and mission. The setting charges the final image: petals refracting “light of recognition” directly enables her solution. No white-room syndrome; spatial logic coheres through tactile interaction (touching gear, drifting deeper).

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.1)
    The greenhouse isn’t backdrop—it’s a crucible. Its decaying glass, corpse flower stench, and orchid-dusted stone dust actively shape Kael’s perception and method. The setting constrains choice: only here can ghost, ribbon, and butterfly converge. At dusk, light bends through clustered wings into “something like a prayer,” directly charging the final image. The environment is tactile, evolving, and irreplaceable.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tidal obsidian ridge functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: Elara must act before the tide reclaims the evidence. Sensory detail (crunching glass, salt in volcanic grooves) is filtered through her occupational bias—she notices arc degrees, alignment, silence between swings. The pendulum bob and rake handle are recurring objects that charge the final image: silver stillness mirrors her poised decision. Obsidian’s transformation into “burning mirrors” under dawn light reweights the entire moral landscape without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the cobalt silo, starlight, and gravel path constrain perception and mood, directly charging the final image (“walls drinking the night”). Sensory detail is selective—velveteen gloom, thread-dye on fingers, crunch of gravel—and filtered through the gardener’s ritualistic attention. The sovereign case and tapestry act as environmental anchors that evolve in meaning. Though vivid, the silo never materially alters tactics (e.g., no lock, obstacle, or resource), slightly undercutting 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.3)
    The obsidian spire, frozen lake, and kingfisher quill aren’t backdrop—they actively constrain and enable. Obsidian’s flexion limits dictate drilling angles; the ice bridge’s fragility forbids vertical shafts; the quill’s sensitivity mirrors Kaelen’s precision. Sensory detail is selective (crystallizing breath, blue-green ink memory) and filtered through Kaelen’s cartographer POV. The setting culminates in the final image: spire as “pen poised above tomorrow,” charging closure with irreplaceable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ember alcove, mist, and cobalt dial glow form a micro-setting that actively constrains Mira’s actions (hiding the radio, working in cold secrecy). Sensory detail is selective—cold air fogging breath, wool cloak’s weight—and filtered through her urgency. The setting charges the final image: dust motes as scribes only resonate because the alcove’s isolation makes them the first audience. However, the environment doesn’t *foreclose* options; it enables them, slightly limiting Q3’s reach into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.3)
    The Vanishing Point Gallery functions as a charged micro-setting: its converging lines pressure perception, blur walls, and dissolve the facade into haze. The rocking chair, ash, and mask are tactile anchors that constrain choice—Elara’s ritual only makes sense within this space. Sensory detail (cedar ghosts, burnt paper, cold drizzle) is selective, POV-filtered, and integrated into action. The gallery isn’t backdrop; it’s an active participant in the story’s dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.4)
    The sunken city functions as micro-setting: sewer bricks, flood silt, and basilica foundations directly constrain Malach’s archival work and encode temporal data. Sensory detail is purposeful—phosphorescent fungus light, brick dust in the throat, scraping metal—filtered through a philosopher-archivist’s priorities. The chronometer cog and sediment layers aren’t backdrop but active tools that charge the final image: truth preserved in brass and mud. Every atmospheric element serves the central conflict of narrative erasure versus evidentiary endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.1)
    The velvet library functions as micro-setting: its absorptive drapes and dust-mote light physically enable the lesson in subtraction. Autumn isn’t backdrop but active pressure—the falling leaves mirror the students’ shedding of noise, and the season’s transience underscores the urgency of vanishing arts. The rosette’s carved voids constrain choice by modeling how absence enables sound. Final image of the leaf veined like the rosette charges closure with irreplaceable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.3)
    The rusted greenhouse functions as a charged micro-setting: its decay constrains action (brittle vines, cracked glass) and directly enables the climax (silver light through broken panes). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—Mara tastes chlorophyll ghosts, feels marrow-deep hums—and evolves causally as the plant reclaims the frame. The setting culminates in the final image: no longer a cage but a breathing heart, irreplaceable to the story’s logic. Every atmospheric detail serves theme, pressure, or closure without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.4)
    The lightning tower functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: its empty chamber demands Mara’s intervention, its receptors “drink” her offering. Sensory hierarchy reflects her tollkeeper POV—ceramic spires, static discharge, amber emergency lights—not tourist description. Weather (post-storm dusk) and tools (matchbox, lacquer box) are tactile and consequential. Final image (“amber light flow down into the city”) reweights the setting from infrastructure to vessel of collective memory.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    The quiet bay functions as micro-setting—its spring light, shoreline, and water “listening” constrain and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the noticer’s perceptual bias (e.g., scent as “whisper,” silence as “living thing”). However, the setting rarely forces tactical choices; it reflects rather than pressures. The recurring cobblestones and amber streetlights evolve tonally but not causally.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.4)
    The drowned garden isn’t backdrop but active crucible: coral-encrusted statues, eggshell-thin dome cracks, and water-stained foxgloves directly enable Petra’s actions. The ampoule’s violet light casts living shadows that reanimate founders’ faces, making doubt tactile. Every sensory detail serves pressure—the green twilight limits vision, currents carry petals like messages, stone lungs fill with “ancient light” to mirror Petra’s awakening. The setting constrains choice (only the eastern crack allows transmission) and charges closure: roots cracking certainty wide open literalize thematic rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    The staircase isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and antagonist. Its self-healing geometry, thermodynamic impossibility, and flickering rupture directly shape Elias’s tactics and final choice. The dice function as micro-setting: their weight, sound, and bias dictate navigation. Cold stone versus antiseptic hospital air crystallizes the thematic stakes in sensory contrast. Every detail serves pressure or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.0)
    The rooftop greenhouse functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: it shields Kael from smog yet connects him to celestial light essential for his brushwork. The smog-choked city below isn’t backdrop but counterpoint—its oppression makes the greenhouse’s green breath miraculous. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: the mural on a derelict factory wall becomes a beacon precisely because it emerges from urban decay. Sensory specificity (amber haze, saffron quiet, indigo ink with crushed starlight) filters through Kael’s artist-POV without tourist detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.3)
    The grotto city is not backdrop but active crucible: the waterfall’s rosewater spray permeates mood and memory, limestone corridors echo both footsteps and cultural decay, and the ice-encased harp is spatially central. Crucially, the setting constrains choice—the opera glass must focus morning light through mist, the cavernous kitchen enables communal baking—and charges the final image when harp music “echoed through the limestone halls.” Sensory specificity (yeast mingling with rosewater, flour like ash) filters through Liora’s professional perception, avoiding tourist cataloguing. The emerald lens and waterfall are micro-settings that directly enable the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting functions as active constraint and charged closure image: the lighthouse’s iron ribs transmit resonance, the lantern room houses the hunger stone, and the rocky reef necessitates the beam. The “black spine of barnacled stone” exposed by low tide enables access and symbolizes vulnerability. Crucially, the environment constrains the climax—the tide’s exhale dictates timing—and the final image (“lighthouse beam cut a golden path”) reweights prior bleakness into brilliance. Sensory detail (kelp-beard, rotted string, liquid silver radiance) is selective, tactile, and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.1)
    The funhouse functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: its corrupted gold light reveals footprints and phantom faces, forcing Mira to navigate via ghostlight rather than reflection. The opera clasp—a tactile object-as-setting—grounds her physically and charges the climax. Every atmospheric detail (peeling grin, filthy mirrors, bruised twilight) serves pressure or perception without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the driftwood ring, floating orchard, and sea actively constrain choice—the mallet must strike tuned slabs to generate resonance. Salt-silvered cheeks, indigo ripples, and luminous wave trails are tactile, selective, and pressure-driven. Final image (“circle of driftwood and song”) charges closure by fusing environment and theme. Weather directly alters tactics—clouds dictate musical notation, waves mirror fractal design.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)
    The turtle-shell city functions as both macro- and micro-setting, constraining access (six shells, rusted gate) and enabling Kael’s cartography through calcium swirls. Objects like the whistle and spiral tools are tactile extensions of environment, directly shaping tactics and the final act of carving. “Sunwashed dread” permeates sensory detail—not just visual but gustatory (“tasted of salt”) and auditory (harmonic frequency)—filtered through Kael’s professional bias. The seventh turtle’s inaccessibility charges the climax, making geography inseparable from theme.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ivy-swallowed station functions as active micro-setting: it supplies the ledger, shapes Emlyn’s movements (“peeled back the vines”), and culminates in the garden’s rebirth. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—moss-covered tracks, brittle pages, fireflies mirroring gold leaf—avoiding tourist cataloguing. Crucially, the setting constrains choice (access to truth requires physical excavation) and charges the final image: roses blooming atop honest history.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.3)
    The submerged pavilion isn’t backdrop but active crucible: seaweed-slick stairs, coral-pried tiles, and collapsing pillars directly shape Elias’s movements and choices. The antique inkwell functions as micro-setting—its weight, dents, and eventual emptiness constrain and charge his actions. Final image (“tide rising behind him”) reconfigures earlier motifs: water no longer erases but preserves. Sensory detail (green-filtered light, silt clouds, copper lantern glow) is selective, profession-tuned, and woven into action without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sunken library functions as a potent micro-setting: water-stained walls, silt, flickering lantern, and submerged vaults constrain perception and movement. The antique ink stamp and oil lantern are tactile anchors that shape Mira’s actions. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (archivist noticing watermark, paper texture). Final image charges the setting—fluorescent lights returning as water recedes—making environment integral to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.3)
    The floating island’s tea garden, glass basilica, and cloud-water aren’t backdrop—they constrain and enable. The basilica’s spiral stair “descends while ascending,” directly shaping the protagonist’s movement and memory work. The tea garden’s jasmine hedges mark where shadows once rested, grounding loss in space. Crucially, the setting charges the closure: glass leaves capture the moment forever, turning environment into archive. Sensory detail (sharp smell of cut glass, luminous torment) is filtered through the lantern maker’s craft, never touristy.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.1)
    The floating observatory functions as a charged micro-setting: it tilts in high-altitude currents, groans with tremor-dampeners, and isolates Kael in her task. The geode, scanner, and breakers are tactile tools that constrain action (e.g., reboot window limits choices). Sensory detail is selective—humming crystals, phantom diamonds felt “in teeth and bones”—filtered through Kael’s trauma. The final image of starlight refracting through the geode charges the closure with irreplaceable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.0)
    The observatory isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains choice (pinions require celestial sequence) and charges the ending (gears wait for next pilgrim). Dusk’s “brilliant dimness” recurs as both atmosphere and epistemological condition. Sensory detail (copper air, stone echoes) is filtered through Elara’s pilot-precision POV. The orrery functions as micro-setting, its frozen gears embodying suspended knowledge until Elara’s intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cobalt terrace and forgotten shore function as micro-settings that charge the narrative: the terrace frames silence and regret; the shore’s driftwood carvings directly enable the protagonist’s search and discovery. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (salt-worn grooves, tide-polished wood), avoiding tourist cataloguing. The watch hand and driftwood key constrain choice and reweight the final image. However, the setting doesn’t actively foreclose options—it supports rather than pressures, missing the 9+ gate for environmental constraint on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    The storm-worn parapet isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting: slick stone affects footing, mist obscures vision, wind threatens balance, and the causeway’s tidal exposure hinges on lunar mechanics. Sensory detail is selective (damp leather, hissing rope, clinking chains) and filtered through Kael’s professional vigilance. The moon’s silver light doesn’t just illuminate—it validates the protocol. Final image of empty parapet recharges the setting as witness, not stage.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the coastal launch, utility poles, fog, and cannery pilings constrain navigation and charge the ending. Sensory detail is selective (humming transformer, salt spray, barnacled rock) and filtered through Elias’s professional bias. The astronomical compass and poles evolve from failed tools to monuments of forgiveness. Environment directly shapes tactics—when fog erases the third pole, Elias must choose between panic and surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bioluminescent lake constrains choice (bridge crossing, algae-lit path) and charges the final image (its glow as “silent promise”). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—Kael notices turquoise skin hues, humming water, crystal shards—not tourist cataloging. The baseball-as-setting micro-function works well, though the steel-and-glass skyline feels slightly generic compared to the underground specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.3)
    The fairy-tale orchard isn’t backdrop—it actively supplies resources (moon-cinnamon, ghost-pepper) and witnesses the ritual. Spatial choreography is precise: canopy, circle of spices, gathering beasts. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (scent thickening air, fur threading skin). Crucially, the setting constrains choice: only here, under permanent moonlight after the phoenix rises, can the conjuration occur—charging the final image of violet blossoms and double heartbeat.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.3)
    The midnight glade functions as a charged micro-setting: clouds “pooled like liquid obsidian,” mist as “invisible tablecloth,” trees of “starlight”—all constrain and enable the cartomancer’s ritual. The dolls’ tea set and onyx ink are tactile extensions of this environment, culminating in the saucer’s silver-light fissure that becomes the story’s thematic crucible. Sensory detail is selective (velvet dark, porcelain gleam, cloud-floor) and filtered through maternal exhaustion and mystical focus. The setting directly charges the final image—the cracked saucer pressed into linen becomes the new custom.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    The recycled spaceship functions as micro-setting: its patched gravity generators bond with Maya’s psyche, directly constraining her ability to transcend. Tools (needle, monofilament) and recurring object (photographs) charge every action. Final image—stitching the hull—reweights the ship from vessel to embodiment of integrated compassion. Sensory detail (curled photo edges, shimmering tears) serves pressure, never stalls it.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    The black sand beach functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: sulfur-salt scent, volcanic steam fog, and tidal pools guide Kael’s detour and discovery. The crimson bug’s trail-painting light charges the final image, while the volcano’s breath shapes atmosphere and theme. Sensory hierarchy reflects Kael’s focus—visual glow dominates, but sulfur smell and subsonic hush ground the mysticism in body. Environment directly enables the prophecy’s fulfillment by funneling bugs toward clean water tanks.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.1)
    The fort’s limestone walls, phosphor lights, and bricked magazine aren’t backdrop—they constrain and enable choices. The bronze quill holder and half-painted sundial function as micro-settings that directly charge the final image. Sensory detail (oil, phantom gunpowder, green shadows) filters through Seren’s professional attention. The luminous fort evolves causally: amber promise → phosphor uncertainty → unlocked dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tidal bluff, aurora, and frictionless sea aren’t backdrop but active constraints: the bluff anchors ritual placement, the aurora pulses star dust, and absent friction defines both world-state and Elara’s method. These elements charge the final image—eel-grooves in sand emerge only because friction is partially restored through environmental interplay. Sensory detail (foam whispering, teal/coral rocks) is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding tourist cataloging. The setting earns its 9-band by shaping every key action and the closure’s fragile hope.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    The stormlit observatory isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choice: rarefied air enables revelation, lightning illuminates instruments, thunder cracks his mask. The darkroom timer and bus timetable function as micro-settings that constrain action (timing the opening, hiding the envelope). Brass instruments, cloud sea, and wax seal are filtered through the poet’s censored gaze, never touristy. Final image of dawn over clouds recharges the vigil with earned hope, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glass atrium functions as both setting and micro-setting: its reflective surfaces fracture light to mirror thematic chaos, while spatial constraints shape fencing choreography. The brook’s murmur and sundial’s shadow evolve with the duel, charging the final image. Every detail serves pressure or perception—no tourist cataloging. Only narrowly misses 9+ because the willow grove, though thematically resonant, doesn’t constrain an on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.3)
    The rusted library under stars functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: its exposure allows moonlight to “paint silver ribbons,” its ruin necessitates scavenging nails, and its fragility makes the sanctuary precarious. Recurring objects (coffee tin, Whitman copy, hollowed sonnets) are handled tactically, not decoratively. Sensory detail is selective and pressure-driven—e.g., “laugh like breaking glass” reflects both sound and emotional texture. Final image charges closure: rust shimmering with “fractured light” mirrors the poet’s fractured yet hopeful self.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.3)
    The station and tidal arbor function as charged micro-settings: glass walls rattle under storm pressure, cloud stuff thickens during ascent, and the humming bark alters tactics by enabling sanctuary. Every sensory detail—yellowed keys, rusted strings, silver grain in film—serves character or theme. The arbor isn’t postcard backdrop; it actively enables the final performance and reweights the broken clock’s silence. Environment constrains choice (seeking refuge in archives) and charges the ending image (stars winking above still compasses).

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    The ridge functions as micro-setting: its fissure, limestone, and dreaming soil directly constrain Kael’s action (planting site) and charge closure (light pours from that exact crack). Tools like the spectrograph and storm-leather journal are tactile extensions of world logic. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—Kael notices equation-flowers early, then memory-light photons during crisis. Final image (golden petal humming in journal) ties environment to theme without cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    The islet functions as micro-setting: rain-washed air, cedar table, tide pools, and lace-diffused light directly enable the ritual. Objects act as setting—the compass, lace, juniper, and lapis pigment constrain choices (e.g., wire bending follows lace instructions). Final image charges closure: dawn through lace curtains animates the color of regret in living leaves. No white-room syndrome; every detail serves the thematic ecology of remembrance.
