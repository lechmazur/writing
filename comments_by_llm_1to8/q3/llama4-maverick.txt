    The greenhouse setting anchors the opening and provides sensory detail ("thick with the scent of damp earth"), though it never constrains choices or enables specific actions. The butterfly wing dust serves more as metaphor than physical constraint. Setting remains largely ornamental rather than pressuring decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    The canyon setting provides consistent atmosphere and the frost patterns effectively link environment to the central mystery. Sensory details like "crisp night air" and "soft, ethereal light" create mood, though they remain somewhat generic. The frost's "intricate designs" meaningfully connect to both the ledger's code and the protagonist's craft, making setting functional rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.4)
    The winterglass conservatory provides vivid sensory detail with the frost/warmth contrast and automated light systems. The setting enables the music creation through its protected environment. However, the broader world remains vague—we don't understand how society functions in this "silent world" or what physical reality allows vibration-based music but not sound.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.2)
    The underwater library setting creates atmosphere through "labyrinthine structure," "tomes bound in material that shimmered like the moon," and "eerie stillness." The broken lens constrains the central action effectively. However, the journey and underwater navigation remain vague, missing tactile details that would ground the fantastical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.4)
    The terra-cotta arbor provides visual anchoring but doesn't constrain choices or create pressure. Sensory detail is limited to visual ("warm orange glow," "soft light of lanterns") with minimal tactile or auditory texture. The setting functions as backdrop rather than active element shaping decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    The twilight viaduct with glowing wisteria creates strong atmospheric grounding, and sensory details like "heavy with the scent of blooming flowers" establish place. The setting functions as more than backdrop when the blossoms "unfurl like tiny stars" during Aria's transformation, though it could constrain choices more actively.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.4)
    The living bridge garden is vividly rendered with sensory detail ("sweet scent of blooming flowers," "dappled shadows") and the environment actively participates through its transformation into "a realm of wonder." The setting evolves from tranquil to otherworldly as Elian's perception shifts. However, the environment doesn't constrain choices or create obstacles - it merely provides atmospheric support.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.5)
    Settings are named (carnival center, seed vault, city) but lack sensory specificity or constraint on action. The piano bench and seed vault function as plot devices rather than lived-in spaces that shape choices. Generic descriptions like "rubble-strewn streets" and "lush fields" provide minimal texture without POV filtering.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse setting creates vivid atmosphere with shipwrecks and aurora light, while Lyra's synesthetic perception adds sensory texture ("soft blue murmur," "rusty red groan").

The space functions adequately but never shapes the central discovery or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.4)
    The storm-tossed ridge fort and its contrast with interior calm creates effective atmosphere, and sensory details like "sandalwood," "soft glow of candles," and "ambered hush" establish mood. The setting participates in the narrative arc as the storm passes and stillness deepens. However, the environment doesn't constrain choices or provide specific resources that alter the oracle's tactics during her ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.1)
    The frozen courtyard and ice crystal violin create atmospheric coherence, with twilight effectively framing the meditative tone. However, the setting remains largely ornamental rather than constraining choices - the environment never forces Zeta to act differently or pay a price.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.1)
    The crystal forecourt after rain creates a specific atmosphere with "wet stone" scent and crystal structures that echo footsteps, though these details rarely constrain choices. The lens and concert tickets function as micro-settings that could charge meaning but remain largely ornamental. The crystal monolith reflecting the starry sky provides the story's most vivid moment but arrives too late to reshape earlier material.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    The garden maze setting is richly detailed with sensory specificity (scent of blooming flowers, withering blossoms) and creates atmosphere. However, the environment never constrains a choice or forces action—it exists as beautiful backdrop rather than active pressure on the dresser's decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.6)
    The xenobiology station and atmospheric simulator are described with selective detail ("rows of sterile workstations," "complex array of pumps and valves") that grounds the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.5)
    The shadowed autumn garden and palace carpet are rendered vividly across senses (damp earth, decaying leaves, lunar glow). The weft thread recurs and charges the final image, giving the setting object‑specific force. Environmental pressure on choices is minimal, but the atmosphere meaningfully shapes perception and cadence. Strong POV filtering keeps details purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The suspended palace, stalactites, and mechanical heartbeat create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere. Details are filtered through the prince’s focus on beauty and machinery, and the egg serves as a charged object. The environment mirrors and amplifies mood but rarely constrains choices or tactics. Strong specificity without the 9‑band constraint link.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.0)
    The obsidian lagoon, black sand, rain scent, and night water yield strong atmosphere filtered through Aria’s sensibility. However, setting rarely constrains choice; it frames and echoes, not pressures. The coin and sand recur as charged objects, enhancing tone. Vividness is steady but largely postcard-adjacent in function.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.9)
    The city of forgotten fountains is vivid and purposeful, with whispers, alleys, and hidden waterways guiding action. The stained glass box and glass shards function as object-as-setting anchors, culminating in the fountains reviving. Sensory detail is selective and in POV, though mostly visual and a touch aurally weighted. Environment influences path more than constrains it, limiting top-end impact.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.0)
    The nebula garden is vivid and consistently filtered through the protagonist’s sensibility. Sensory selection supports tone (petals/starlight metaphor, tendrils, echoes). However, the environment rarely constrains action; it’s more canvas than crucible. The recurring gear acts as micro-setting but doesn’t shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ancient greenhouse, dusk, and incoming butterflies create a vivid, sensorial atmosphere that filters through the carver’s priorities. The environment charges the final image (lunar glow, clustering butterflies among headstones). Details are purposeful without tourist cataloging. It shapes mood and insight more than choice but does so decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)

Recurring objects (pendulum, rake handle) charge the atmosphere and final image. The setting rarely constrains options; it mostly mirrors theme and mood. Still, sensory economy and specificity are strong for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Specific, sensuous setting—cobalt silo, lavender, stars, frayed tapestry—creates a distinct atmosphere that supports theme. The silo functions as a repository and stage for discovery, and recurring objects (sovereign case, tapestry) charge the final image. However, the environment seldom constrains choices; it frames mood more than tactics. Still, integration is purposeful and textured.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.9)
    The frozen lake and obsidian spire create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere, and the kingfisher nib offers tactile specificity. Details are filtered through the cartographer’s purpose and sustain tone. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics beyond metaphor; it frames, more than pressures, the choice. Strong texture, limited functional leverage.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is vivid and filtered through task: ember alcove, mist, dust motes, and the radio’s glow integrate with action and culminate in the “beacon” image. The radio dial functions as micro‑setting/object charging the final moment. Environmental effects (swirling dust, flickering lights) evolve with events rather than sitting as postcard detail. While tone-true and specific, the space rarely constrains choice beyond atmosphere, so it stays below 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.0)
    The gallery, frame, charcoal, and porcelain mask provide purposeful, cohesive atmosphere filtered through Lena’s professional eye. Specifics like the powder‑coated frame and ash dispersal integrate setting with action. The environment does not constrain tactics, but it charges the final image credibly.

Environment doesn’t distinctly constrain choices in the ending, but the recurring object charges the final image. Strong specificity without tourist listing.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    The velvet library, autumn light through stained glass, and the zither’s rosette create a rich, coherent atmosphere filtered through Emilia’s sensibility. Details recur purposefully (the rosette glinting in the fade, the leaves’ whisper) and charge the final image. The environment doesn’t constrain choices, but it meaningfully frames the meditation. Sensory selection is apt and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rusted greenhouse is vivid and sensorially integrated (vines, corroded beams, pruning tactile detail). The setting supports tone and discovery (seed found in tangles) and charges the final image. However, it seldom constrains tactics beyond atmosphere. Strong specificity without turning into a decisive pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vivid, economical atmosphere: “nectar dusk,” machinery hum, and the tower as locus of action. The setting meaningfully organizes movement (ascent to upper levels) and frames the beehive encounter. While it doesn’t heavily constrain options, the place and objects recur to charge the final hum-and-stars image. World rules are consistent and learned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmosphere is vivid—the quiet bay, perfumery, and streetlights “daydreaming” create a consistent, lyrical world. The shard functions as a charged object and carries through to the final image. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics; it mostly bathes the action in mood. Specific sensory textures could be more character-filtered under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Underwater city garden is vivid and consistent: coral/anemones, filtered light, drifting ampoule. Details are filtered through the statue’s attention and recur to charge the final image (empty ampoule at its feet). While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain choices, it sustains tone and coheres with the story’s transformation. Sensory economy is good, especially visual texture.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    The infinite staircase is vividly rendered (dim windows, thickening air) and sustains atmosphere. It functions as micro‑setting that frames and pressures the narrator’s fixation, and the dice recur as charged objects in the space. Yet the environment rarely constrains tactics beyond “keep climbing,” limiting its leverage on choice. Still, it meaningfully charges the final image of bound ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.9)
    The rooftop greenhouse, smog, and waxing moon are vivid and consistently filtered through the painter’s sensibility. The environment subtly frames a sanctuary versus city pressure and charges the final image at dawn.

    The lighthouse, sea, and low tide create a coherent, moody atmosphere with tactile detail (salt, seaweed, musty bowels). Setting integrates with action (descent, hidden compartment) and frames the mythic tone. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics or force trade‑offs. The strongest setting charge comes via objects (hunger stone/yoyo) rather than place pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is strong and specific (fog, must, cracked mirror, faded poster), integrated through action rather than static cataloging. The funhouse and mirror charge the final image, though the environment rarely constrains concrete choices beyond “go deeper/leave.” Recurring objects (poster, clasp) help texture and tone. Sensory range leans visual but remains purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vivid, integrated environment: the orchard on driftwood and open seas tangibly inflects sound (creaking circle, lapping water) and charges the final image. Sensory breadth is strong and filtered through the musician’s priorities. It still functions more as stage and instrument than constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    The city on turtle shells is vivid and filtered through Lyra’s occupational eye; the cracked shell revealing a compartment ties setting to plot. Sun, dust, and shell‑etched patterns create a coherent atmosphere that supports the “sunwashed dread.” While the macro‑setting rarely constrains tactics, the micro‑setting (shell patterns, hidden mechanism) does. Consistency of world rules is maintained without exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    The station and ivy are vivid and consistent, with damp, decay, and the “skeletal fingers” image establishing mood. The illuminated letter functions as a charged object in place, and the ivy reprises at the end. However, environment seldom constrains tactics or choices; it’s mostly atmospheric. Sensory detail is strong but not purposively engaged in the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The submerged pavilion, drawbridge, silt, and orange-to-starlit transitions create a coherent, vivid environment filtered through a professional gaze. Water and stillness shape tone and tempo, though they rarely constrain tactics beyond “quiet to work.” The inkwell functions as object-as-setting in the final image.

Micro‑setting details (binding creak, aged paper scent) are purposeful and controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is vivid and selective: floating tea garden, mist, filigreed lanterns, glass basilica; details are filtered through a maker’s eye. The environment charges the final image (crane drifting, lanterns whispering) more than it constrains action. World rules feel consistent and unobtrusive. Strong atmosphere elevates theme without turning into a postcard tour.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.2)
    The wrecked wedding space and the floating observatory are sketched with a few effective sensory notes (smoke, blood, console glow). The geode crystal functions as a micro-setting talisman, recurring in the final image. Yet the environment seldom constrains choice or strategy; the observatory remains a calm backdrop. Detail is more emblematic than lived-in or tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory and dusk atmosphere are vivid and filtered through Lena’s task; carvings function as map, enabling the hidden compartment find. Tool/body integration (drone, console) feels plausible and purposeful. While richly described, setting seldom constrains her beyond guiding discovery, limiting ceiling. Still, specificity and tone carry the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Atmosphere is vivid and purposeful: cobalt terrace, lunar glow, salt and decay, skeletal driftwood. The watch hand functions as micro‑setting/object that charges the final image. Details are filtered through her trade and guilt, aligning tone and perception. Environment rarely constrains choices, but it strongly inflects meaning and cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.5)
    Vivid, cohesive atmosphere: “storm-worn windblown parapet,” mist, and the drawer pull recur and frame the final image. The environment charges tone but rarely constrains choices or tactics. Sensory selection is consistent and purposeful, if visually biased. Setting integration is strong but not operative.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.9)
    The coastal launch and utility poles provide serviceable anchors, and sunset imagery adds mood. However, sensory specificity is sparse and mostly visual; the sea rarely constrains choices beyond being a backdrop. The compass and poles lightly charge the final image, but the environment doesn’t press tactics. Overall, functional but generic.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    The underground bioluminescent lake is vividly rendered and not merely decorative—the glow “responds,” the mist parts to reveal a path. Sensory detail is focused and consistent, with atmosphere supporting the premise. While the environment nudges her choice, it rarely constrains tactics or imposes cost. The signed baseball participates as a charged object but remains mostly symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    The orchard under permanent moonlight and spice‑scented air are vivid and integrated into action (the ritual requires spices; creatures assemble). Sensory texture is balanced and biased to Lyra’s world. Environment subtly charges the final images (silvery glow, luminescence), though constraints on choice remain gentle rather than coercive. World rules feel consistent for the fairy‑tale mode.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.9)
    The “midnight glade above the clouds” is vivid and sensorial (ozone, mist) and the object micro‑setting (cracked saucer) charges the final image. Details are filtered through her cartomancer lens and integrate with action. Environment doesn’t materially constrain choices, but it shapes tone and meaning consistently. Strong atmosphere without postcard bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)

Strong mood, medium tactical relevance.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    The black sand beach, volcano rumble, and bottled glow create a coherent, moody atmosphere that supports the lyric mode. Details are selective and consistent across senses (sound and sight dominate), and the object returns at the end to charge the image. The environment, however, rarely constrains action or tactics; it’s evocative more than functional. Strong mood work, low pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    The fort, blackout, sundial, and the cradle’s light are integrated into action rather than postcarded. The environment constrains tactics (darkness demanding code and stealth; light reconfiguring space). Some diction trends generic-lyric, but the setting participates in the climax. Specificity around the half‑painted sundial is a standout detail.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    Vivid, coherent atmosphere (salt, ozone, aurora, tidal bluff) integrated with action via the rock placements. The environment colors tone but rarely constrains tactics beyond offering a stage. Recurrent objects (painted rocks, dust) are used with some specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vivid, selective storm-and-observatory imagery filtered through her sensibility; the darkroom timer functions as micro‑setting and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rusted library, moonlight, and the coffee tin create a palpable atmosphere; sensory detail is selective and consistent. The setting charges the final image (dawn in the library) even if it seldom constrains choice. World rules and spatial anchors are stable. Some imagery leans conventional (“beacon of hope,” “phoenix”) but the place feels lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Atmosphere is lush and purposeful; the film reel, mist, ozone, and compasses are integrated and recur with charged meaning. The reel functions as a tool that changes options (literal portal), and the clock charges the final image. Sensory choices track mood without tourist listing. A slight bias toward visual repetition (“flickering,” “mist”) is offset by tactile and olfactory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ancient ridge, flowers, insects, and monsoon atmosphere are vivid and sensorially grounded, shaping tone and temporality. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, it charges the final image (verdant ridge pulsing with memory). Details are cohesive and filtered through Aria’s purpose. Some repetition of scenic elements keeps it from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    The breezy islet after rain is vividly evoked across senses (salt, seaweed, wet earth), and the compass functions as a charged recurring object. Environment supports and mirrors the internal arc and furnishes a plausible endpoint (the sea carrying the compass away). While the setting rarely constrains options, it consistently inflects tone and action. Strong specificity without overloading.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, functioning as both the catalyst for the character's entire internal journey and the subject of the final, resonant image. Sensory details like the "scent of damp earth and decaying plant life" create a potent atmosphere. The storm-damaged greenhouse is not merely a backdrop but a central force that constrains the character's attention and is fundamentally re-evaluated at the story's closure, making it integral to the narrative's purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, vividly rendered with specific sensory details that create a potent atmosphere of stillness and ethereal beauty. The canyon is more than a backdrop; the patterns of the morning frost become a crucial narrative device, constraining the character's perception and directly charging the final image. This integration of environment into the story's core mechanism is exceptionally well-handled.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    The winterglass conservatory is rendered with excellent sensory detail, establishing a potent atmosphere of fragile sanctuary against a harsh outer world. The setting is not merely backdrop; its automated light systems frame the central action, and its contrast between inner warmth and outer chill charges the final image. While it doesn't strictly constrain a choice, it functions as an essential crucible for the story's emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    The concept of the underwater city library is evocative, and the atmosphere of "eerie stillness" is well-established. Details like "tomes bound in a material that shimmered like the moon" add a strong sense of wonder. The setting serves as a compelling destination and backdrop but falls short of being an active force; obstacles like "treacherous currents" are mentioned but not shown to constrain choices or alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting of the terra-cotta arbor is established with effective sensory details, creating a warm, communal atmosphere. The key object, the antique silver bell, functions as a micro-setting and is integrated well, used to structure the scene and charge the final image as its chime echoes in Akira's mind. The setting effectively supports the tone, even if it doesn't actively constrain choices.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.0)
    This is the story's greatest strength. The setting of the twilight viaduct is rendered with vivid, purposeful sensory detail that establishes the "foggy lucidity" tone and mirrors the protagonist's internal state. The glowing wisteria becomes a key recurring image that constrains perception and is recharged in the final paragraph, directly shaping the closure and satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "living bridge garden" is established with evocative sensory details at the start, creating a serene atmosphere. While the setting transforms into a "realm of wonder," it functions primarily as a backdrop for the halo fragment's effects rather than a force that constrains choice or shapes tactics. The environment changes *around* Elian but doesn't force them to navigate it differently or use its features to overcome an obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.7)
    The opening setting of the abandoned carnival prize redemption center is evocative and well-used, with the piano bench serving as a functional micro-setting that constrains the initial action. However, subsequent locations like the "rubble-strewn streets" and the seed vault itself are generic and lack specificity. The environment provides a backdrop but rarely applies meaningful pressure or constrains choice after the initial scene.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptional, with the "ashen forge" and "aurora-lit sky" being more than just backdrop; they are active participants in Lyra's creative process. The forge is explicitly named as a "key to unlocking the sound," directly constraining her work and charging the climactic moment of creation. This elevates the environment from atmospheric to functional, satisfying the 9+ criteria.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    The atmosphere is the story's strongest element, with evocative details like the "emerald station," "fleeting golden sunset," and "soft, ethereal light" creating a palpable sense of magic. Key objects—the flower arrangement and the jar of moonbeams—are not just descriptive; they are central to the plot, directly constraining Lumina's choice and charging the final, resonant image. The setting feels both specific and purposeful, guiding the narrative's tonal shifts effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, establishing a potent atmosphere of decay contrasted with creation. The abandoned control room and the melting ice effectively mirror the internal state of the character. The glass orb serves as a strong micro-setting, a tool that constrains action and ultimately charges the final image as a "beacon of hope."

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "rusted library under the stars" provides a strong initial atmosphere, enhanced by details like "dim light casting long shadows." The key objects—the whispering seashell half and the child's cast—are central to the plot. However, the setting itself remains a passive backdrop; it contains the action but does not constrain choices or directly influence the outcome, preventing it from reaching a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is excellent, with the "storm-tossed ridge fort" acting as both a container for the scene and a direct participant in the conflict and resolution. The contrast between the violent exterior and the calm interior is well-established. Crucially, the fort's sound changing from a "groan" to a "lullaby" charges the final image, providing tangible proof of the oracle's success and fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story's greatest strength is its evocative atmosphere, successfully establishing a tone of "mundane mysticism" from the opening lines. The frozen courtyard and, most notably, the ice crystal violin are not mere backdrops. The violin functions as a central, recurring object that anchors Zeta's contemplation and becomes powerfully recharged in the final image, directly serving the story's thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is a distinct strength, creating a potent, evocative atmosphere. The "crystal whispering forecourt after rain" is rendered with effective sensory detail. More importantly, the setting directly enables the climax: the crystal monolith is not just scenery but a necessary component for the registrar's final, transformative action with the lens. This direct interaction between character, object, and environment charges the closure image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is a significant strength, with the garden maze serving as both a vivid physical space and a potent metaphor for the character's journey. The atmosphere is consistently maintained, blending the melancholic and the beautiful. The recurring object—the marbles—is skillfully integrated, its shifting meaning charging the story's emotional beats and culminating in a strong final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is a significant strength, creating a potent atmosphere through the contrast between the sterile lab and the otherworldly nexus. The atmospheric simulator is not just a backdrop but the central tool that constrains and enables the entire plot, directly facilitating the climax. The final image is effectively charged by the events that took place within this well-realized and purposeful environment.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is the story's strongest element. The flooded opera house, flickering lanterns, and lapping water are vivid, atmospheric, and integral to the plot. The water on the program is not just backdrop but the central tool that constrains and enables the protagonist's key actions, directly charging the final image. The specificity here is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is a significant strength, with the isolated, "liminal" mountain weather station providing a perfect crucible for the story's thematic questions. The atmosphere is palpable and consistent. The botanical illustration is a key recurring object that is introduced early and effectively charges the final image, directly symbolizing the story's conclusion about the "beauty of the unknown" and fulfilling the requirement for setting to constrain or charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story excels at establishing a thick, tangible atmosphere with strong sensory details like the "morbid perfume" of decay and rust. The setting feels immersive and tonally consistent. However, the environment itself is largely passive, a backdrop for the explorer's internal state rather than a force that actively constrains choice or forces adaptation, limiting its impact on the narrative's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's greatest strength. The setting of the overgrown library and catacombs is vivid, sensory, and purposeful, establishing a powerful tone of "crumbling peace" from the outset. The environment isn't just a backdrop; the obsidian refuge and the earth itself are active forces that directly motivate the character and charge the final image of stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting on Sage Ridge is established with effective, if gentle, sensory detail ("hush of dreaming roots," "sage-scented breeze"). The solar eclipse is more than a backdrop; it's an active environmental element that constrains the action and charges the final image, fulfilling the requirement for setting to influence choice. The keepsake curl also functions well as a recurring micro-setting object that anchors the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    The "reclaimed silo library" is the story's strongest element, creating a palpable atmosphere of history and mystery. Sensory details like the "scent of old books and dust" and the recurring motif of "bronze quiet" are highly effective. The setting directly charges the final image, as the story closes on the silo itself, "its secrets safe once more," making the environment an active presence in the narrative's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting of the mysterious lighthouse is the story's strongest element, effectively establishing a brooding, otherworldly atmosphere. It is consistently used to frame the narrative and reappears in the final lines ("The mysterious lighthouse stood watch, a sentinel of secrets") to charge the closing image with thematic weight. However, it functions primarily as a symbolic backdrop and never constrains a character choice, which holds it back from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.5)
    The atmosphere is strong, with effective sensory details like "sandalwood and myrrh" establishing a mystical tone. The "loop pedal" and the "artist's palette" serve as effective micro-settings or tools that constrain the action and help charge the final image. However, the macro-setting of the "dimensional anchor" remains somewhat generic and abstract, acting more as a stage than a dynamic environment that applies pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with the glass spire and mirrored horizon providing a vivid, consistent atmosphere that directly influences the character's internal state. The imagery is selective and purposeful, effectively charging the final moments with meaning. However, the setting primarily serves as inspiration rather than a tangible constraint that forces a difficult choice or alters tactics, keeping it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.1)
    This is the story's strongest element. The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active participant in the narrative, with the "glowing viaduct" serving as a barometer for the world's transformation. The initial sensory details ("wet earth and ozone") are effective, and the evolution of the light from "ethereal glow" to "deep, rich darkness" masterfully drives the atmosphere. The setting's change—specifically the absence of the viaduct's glow—is essential to charging the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cavern is rendered with effective sensory details, establishing a potent atmosphere of earthy, ancient magic. The setting provides the central objects (drums) and the necessary sanctuary for Aria's internal journey, thus enabling the story's core action. While vividly drawn, the environment facilitates more than it actively constrains choice, keeping it just shy of the highest tier where setting becomes an agent of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story effectively establishes an initial atmosphere of tranquility in the courtyard and credibly shifts it toward menace as the character's paranoia grows. Sensory details in the opening are evocative ("gentle rustle of leaves," "sweet scent of blooming flowers"). However, the setting primarily serves as a backdrop for internal thought; it enables the plot by providing solace but never constrains a choice or becomes an active force that charges the final image, limiting its overall impact.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    The greenhouse for extinct plants is a vivid and purposeful setting that perfectly mirrors the story's themes of memory and loss. Sensory details, particularly the scents and the effect of the ultraviolet light, are well-integrated and drive the emotional progression. The crystal perfume vial functions as a powerful micro-setting, constraining Elara's focus and charging the final image with its radiant emptiness, making the environment an active participant in her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with the terra-cotta grotto providing a vivid, atmospheric crucible for the character's internal journey. Sensory details are selective and purposeful, and the environment directly enables the story's central action of patterning stones. The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active participant, constraining choice and charging the final image as the poet's patterns become part of the grotto itself.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is superbly realized and atmospheric, with vivid, purposeful details like the "sunken orchard greenhouse" and "skeletal remains of shipwrecks" creating a potent initial mood. The greenhouse functions effectively as a thematic counterpoint and sanctuary, enabling the climax. However, the environment serves primarily as a backdrop and does not actively constrain or pressure the protagonist's choices, which keeps it from the highest tier of excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.5)
    The amber grotto is exceptionally rendered and integral to the story. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, creating a powerful atmosphere. Crucially, the setting is interactive, with the luminescent stones dimming and brightening in response to the character's process, which directly constrains her work (by enabling focus) and charges the final image, making it an indispensable element.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is established with some atmospheric, albeit clichéd, details ("musty scent of old books," "whispers of the sea"). However, the "breezy library under the stars" serves only as a pleasant backdrop. It fails to constrain character choice, apply pressure, or become integral to the story's central action, rendering it largely ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is evocative and described with some sensory detail, establishing a distinct atmosphere. However, the "crystalline orchard" functions as a passive, ornamental backdrop. It never constrains choice, presents an obstacle, or offers a unique resource that shapes the characters' tactics or the story's outcome; its specificity is purely aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting of the rooftop canal system is wonderfully imaginative and establishes a strong initial atmosphere. However, the environment itself is more of a backdrop than an active force shaping Lyra's actions. The real "setting" that constrains choice is the infinity symbol pendant, which functions effectively as a key tool and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is a distinct strength, with vivid, multi-sensory details that establish a potent and ethereal atmosphere. The "cavern orchard" is more than a backdrop; key elements like the "mosaic stepping stone" function as tools that enable the central action. The final description of the trees as a "pen and ink drawing" powerfully reflects the character's internal shift, charging the story's closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, rendered with vivid, selective sensory detail that creates a consistent and compelling atmosphere. The "shadowed library," "pipe chases," and the scent of "old books and dust" are integral to the character's existence. The final image on the "hidden shelf" functions as a micro-setting that directly facilitates and charges the closure, constraining the character's choice to this specific mode of communication.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, creating a palpable atmosphere of post-rain serenity that grounds Emilia's internal state. The mossy trellis and linden leaf function effectively as recurring objects that anchor her reflections and charge the final image with meaning. While the description is effective, it doesn't quite constrain a choice, which keeps it from the highest tier of excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story opens with a strong, atmospheric setting of a "tidal island shrouded in a perpetual gloom." However, after the initial paragraphs, the environment becomes a more generic backdrop for the quest. The key object, the amber brooch, functions effectively as a micro-setting element that constrains focus and charges the final image, but the broader island setting doesn't exert consistent pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element. The "musical crystal cave" is not merely a backdrop but an active participant, with its "vibrational frequencies" and "overlapping shadows" directly enabling the protagonist's transformation. The environment constrains the central action (she must inhabit its depths) and charges the final thematic image of "bright darkness," making it integral to the story's core conceit.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story opens with a strong, evocative atmosphere in the "ivory harbor after rain" and the "Maritime Relics" shop. The herald's trumpet valve functions effectively as a micro-setting, a charged object that rightfully constrains the archivist's attention and grounds the thematic resolution. However, after the initial scenes, the broader setting of the harbor becomes a passive backdrop rather than an active force that shapes or complicates the archivist's work.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting successfully establishes a mysterious and otherworldly atmosphere with evocative details like the swirling mist and glowing walls. The "cracks in the pavement forming arrows" serves as a functional micro-setting detail that guides action. However, the environment rarely constrains or pressures the protagonist; it primarily functions as a thematic backdrop rather than an active force shaping her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, with the "stargazer's open tower" and its view of the sea creating a vivid, resonant atmosphere that is integral to the theme. The environment directly constrains and enables the action, functioning as a "nexus" and "crucible." The magic square tile, as a micro-setting element, is the central tool that charges the entire narrative and the final image of peace.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is an active and essential participant in the plot. The "prismatic escondite" and the "solar storm" are not mere backdrops; they are tools Kael uses to enable the climax. The setting's visual motifs directly charge the final, transformative image of Kael stepping into a "kaleidoscope of possibilities."

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    The funeral home setting is potent, providing a unique atmosphere of sterile dread and purpose. The vintage ink pot functions brilliantly as a "micro-setting," a tangible object that directly constrains Lena's thinking and charges the final image. This element is central and fully integrated, easily satisfying the 9+ quick test, but the score is capped due to prose artifacts in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's most powerful element, rendered with vivid, specific sensory detail. The "blooming labyrinth of bonsai forests" is not merely a backdrop but the very subject of the character's work, constraining her choices and charging every moment. The juxtaposition of the fluorescent lamp against the natural, ancient-seeming environment is a particularly strong detail that elevates the entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is the story's strongest element. The "towering labyrinth of shipping containers" is a vivid and specific environment that functions both as a physical space and as the central metaphor for memory. Recurring sensory details like the sound of tides and the poison bottle label are integrated well, charging the atmosphere and directly supporting the story's thematic development and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is a significant strength. The "abandoned observatory on a cliff" is atmospheric and purposeful, housing the "ghosts of astronomers past." More importantly, key objects—the painted seashell and the half-finished cello—are not just descriptive details; they are integral tools that constrain and enable the central action, directly charging the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting concept of a "vibrant, ever-floating raft city" is evocative and established well initially. The atmosphere is palpable, and the use of the "foundation stone chip" as a recurring, meaning-charged object is a significant strength. However, the setting largely remains a backdrop; its unique features rarely constrain or enable specific actions, making it more atmospheric than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.5)
    The atmosphere is evocative, creating a palpable sense of desolate beauty. The use of the sand grain as a micro-setting that charges the final image is effective. However, the description of petals that "swayed gently in the breeze" on the Moon is a significant scientific inaccuracy that breaks verisimilitude and is inexcusable for a publication of this caliber, despite a weak attempt to self-correct.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, rendered through evocative, multi-sensory details that align with the blind protagonist's perception (mist, sound, vibration). The micro-setting of the fountain is not merely descriptive; it's a tool that is central to the plot's method and constrains the core action. The atmospheric details of the depot and the departing ship perfectly charge the final, tranquil image.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, rendered with vivid, selective sensory detail that creates a palpable atmosphere. The "rusted outpost" and "frozen lake" are more than backdrop; they are active participants in the narrative. The frozen lake, in particular, becomes the crucial arena for the final act, directly constraining choice and charging the closing image with both beauty and threat.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.2)
    Atmosphere is the story's greatest strength. The setting is rendered with evocative, selective sensory detail ("scent of decay," "wild hush") that serves the tone perfectly. Crucially, the environment is not static; the cobblestones actively participate in the plot by responding to the tuner's actions, directly shaping the narrative's progression and charging the final image, fulfilling the requirements for excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.0)
    The "forgotten underwater temple" provides a strong, atmospheric backdrop, though some descriptions remain generic. The category is elevated by the "crystal perfume vial," which functions as a micro-setting; its changing state (glowing, guiding) actively constrains Kael's choices and charges the final image, making the environment integral to the plot's execution.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, with vivid, purposeful details like the "lighthouse prison," "jagged reef," and the "lattice from a confessional." The "copperlight repose" creates a distinct and memorable atmosphere that filters the protagonist's experience. The lattice itself becomes an active element that "seemed to glow," guiding the character in the final moments and charging the closure, thus satisfying the conditions for a very high score.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmosphere is the story's strongest element, with evocative sensory details creating a potent sense of an ethereal, timeless space. The "alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night" is a vivid and memorable container for the narrative. However, the setting rarely moves beyond backdrop to actively constrain choices or shape the action on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is atmospheric and evocative, with strong sensory details like "damp earth" and "red canyon walls." It successfully establishes the story's mood and functions as a metaphor for the protagonist's inner world. The final image of the tapestry glowing in the dawn light uses the setting effectively to charge the closure. However, the environment remains a backdrop; the labyrinth never constrains choice or presents a tangible obstacle, limiting its impact on the narrative's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, with vivid, specific details like "trees' roots snaked between ancient bones." The atmosphere of the catacomb orchard is palpable and directly influences Maya's actions and internal state. The sundial base functions as a potent micro-setting that anchors her focus and charges the final image, effectively constraining her choices to the act of excavation.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "golden arcade at dawn" provides a strong, evocative atmosphere that supports the story's nostalgic tone. Details like the "ebony clipboard" and "sidewalk chalk drawings" add specificity. However, the setting remains a backdrop; it fails to constrain choice or apply pressure, as seen when the bustling crowd provides "a vibrant backdrop" but doesn't meaningfully affect Cipher's process.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is a significant strength, with the "cobalt observatory" and "eternal candle" creating a rich, consistent, and purposeful atmosphere. Details are selective and effective, directly contributing to the story's mystical tone. Crucially, recurring objects—the flame and the chart—are not merely descriptive but actively constrain the character's focus and charge the final image, fulfilling the requirement for setting to be integral to the story's core emotional and thematic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptional, moving far beyond a simple backdrop. Specific, charged elements like the "windowpane... suspended between two ancient mangroves" and the functional use of moonlight and luminescent fungi are deeply integrated. The environment directly constrains and enables the story's central action, with the rising voices of the "singing spirits" serving as an atmospheric pressure gauge that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    The atmosphere is the story's greatest strength, with the mist and twilight effectively mirroring the protagonist's internal state. The brain coral fragment functions perfectly as a "micro-setting," a recurring object that constrains the character's focus and powerfully charges the final image. The wider setting of the "atoll's atrium" remains vague, which slightly limits an otherwise exceptional execution.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, rendered with potent, specific sensory detail ("damp earth and decaying leaves," "gnarled branches"). The ruined orchard is not just a backdrop; it is an active force that inspires the protagonist, provides the central catalyzing object, and ultimately constrains her choice by becoming the gallery for her work, powerfully charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.2)
    The "sound wave garden" is an exceptional piece of world-building that is not merely decorative but functionally essential to the plot. The setting—specifically the mirrors and ambient sound—becomes the tool through which the character enacts her change. The environment directly constrains and enables the central action, charging the final image of the transformed mural.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.5)
    The entomologist's greenhouse is the story's strongest element. It's evocative, atmospheric ("thick with the scent of blooming flowers and the gentle hum of insects"), and integral to the plot. The setting is not just a backdrop but the very medium through which the central conflict is enacted, serving as both a tool and a shield for Lyra's clandestine activities. This specificity elevates the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptional: unique, atmospheric, and integral to the story. The "gargantuan shell" is not just a backdrop but a character-defining sanctuary and womb that constrains the poet's existence and enables her art. The postcard, as a key object, functions as a micro-setting that triggers the main action and charges the final image, satisfying the criteria for excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with the "opal library above the clouds" and "glass orchids" creating a potent and memorable atmosphere. The key objects—the cracked wind chime and the orchids—are not mere backdrops; they are central to the story's single action and charge the final image, directly participating in the closure. The sensory details are selective and consistently filtered through the story's melancholic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.2)
    The atmosphere of the archive is superbly rendered with evocative sensory details. More importantly, the 'glass ink well' serves as a perfect micro-setting; its physical state (emptying) drives the scene's momentum, and its symbolic weight charges the final image, fulfilling the requirement for setting to constrain action and heighten meaning. The shift in Elara's perception of the archive from isolating to a sanctuary also shows strong integration of setting with character arc.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with the "breathing" amphitheater inside a volcano providing a powerful, central metaphor that directly mirrors and influences the protagonist's internal state. Details like the scent of "damp earth and moss" and dappled light are evocative and well-integrated. The environment is not merely a backdrop but an active force that charges the final image of resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is superb, with vivid sensory details creating a palpable atmosphere. More importantly, the setting is not merely decorative; a key environmental feature—"the swirl of dust motes under a single skylight"—is transformed into the central tool Emilia uses to resolve her internal conflict. This integration of setting into the core action is exemplary, as the final image of the dancing motes is fully charged with the story's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.2)
    The "drifting prism terrace" is the story's strongest element. The setting is vivid, dynamic, and integrated directly into the narrative's central challenge, constraining the protagonist's actions. The atmosphere is consistently maintained, and the final image of walking through the "prismatic colors" effectively recharges the story's core concept, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, rendered with vivid, purposeful detail that creates a powerful and consistent atmosphere. The "faint luminescence" of the "bioluminescent organisms" is not just description; it's the central environmental feature that enables the character's quest. The setting directly constrains the character's perception and the burnt feather, as a key object, charges the final image, fulfilling the criteria for excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting of the "iridescent cave" is evocative and consistently maintained, creating a distinct atmosphere. The key object, the "crater glass," is well-integrated, acting as a focal point for emotion at the start, glowing with intensity mid-story, and serving as a "tangible reminder" that charges the final image. However, the larger environment remains a beautiful backdrop rather than a force that actively constrains choices or shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is a notable strength. The "tidal arcade, with its worn stone benches and flickering torches" is atmospheric and vivid. More importantly, the bishop's chess piece functions as an effective micro-setting, constraining Elian's thoughts, shaping the tactics of his performance, and charging the final image as it "seemed to weigh heavier, as if it held secrets waiting to be unlocked."

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is a significant strength, creating a potent atmosphere that is integral to the plot. The "twilight garden," "canvas of stars," and "lapping of the nearby ocean" are not just backdrop but active participants in Aria's creative process. The moonstone cabochon functions as a powerful micro-setting; it constrains her initial action by anchoring her hand and then charges the climax by glowing brighter, directly shaping the story's central event and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.0)
    The atmosphere is powerfully rendered, with the mist-shrouded bay and dawn light creating a potent mood. The setting is not merely decorative; the key elements—the reflective water, the ripples, and the prism atrium—are central to the protagonist’s internal journey. The recurring image of the prism atrium, in particular, serves to charge the final moments, successfully functioning as a resonant symbol for the story's core ideas.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.0)
    The atmosphere is consistently rendered with evocative descriptions of the moonlit ridge, creating a strong, ethereal mood. The landscape and celestial imagery effectively support the story's contemplative tone. However, the setting remains largely a backdrop; it establishes atmosphere but does not constrain choices or directly influence the action beyond providing a stage for Kael's internal reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is a significant strength. The "tide-polished grotto" is rendered with effective sensory detail, creating a strong, supportive atmosphere. More importantly, specific objects within the setting—the decorations and especially the "balloonist's altitude gauge"—are not merely descriptive but become causally active, with the gauge "pulsing with a soft, blue light" to trigger the climactic vision. This direct participation of a key object charges the closure, elevating the setting beyond mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    The atmosphere is the story's most successful element, with evocative details like the "ivy-veiled passage" and "crumbling plaster" creating a strong, consistent mood. The setting successfully anchors the story's tone and filters perception. It narrowly misses a higher score because the environment, while atmospheric, never actively constrains the protagonist's choices or forces tactical adaptation; it serves as a compelling but passive backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Atmosphere is the story's greatest strength, with vivid, purposeful sensory details creating a consistent and evocative mood. The setting—specifically the prism parapet and the mirrors—is not merely decorative; it is integral to the plot, constraining the character's actions and charging the final, resonant image of the glowing parapet. This direct involvement in the closure elevates the category significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting on the "ancient terrace" provides a consistent and functional atmosphere. The story's strongest element is the ebony clipboard, which acts as a micro-setting; it is successfully integrated and reweighted, culminating in the final image as a "symbol of his own redemption." However, the broader environment remains a passive backdrop rather than an active constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with vivid sensory details creating a palpable atmosphere of desolation and imminent change. The salt flat is not just a backdrop; it becomes a key tool ("a map drawn by the cracks"), directly constraining and then enabling the central action. The environment's transformation provides a powerful visual for the story's climax.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.5)
    The atmosphere of the "silver courtyard under snow" is evocative and effectively contrasts with the protagonist's internal state. The central object, the "prism sanctuary," functions as a micro-setting that is critical to the narrative; it draws the character's focus, acts as the catalyst for the climax, and charges the final image, fulfilling the requirement for a setting that constrains choice and shapes the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest element. The "decommissioned radar dome" is rendered with a palpable atmosphere ("ghostly sentinel," "eerie calm," "meteor hush") that directly enables the protagonist's internal shift. The environment acts as a crucible for the creative process, and the "campfire story stick" functions effectively as a recurring object that charges her inspiration, satisfying the requirement for the setting to constrain or enable choice.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto setting is vividly rendered and essential to the story’s ethereal atmosphere. Sensory details are consistent and establish a strong tone. Critically, the environment provides the materials (twigs, leaves) for Aria's central action and the moth wing, an object from the setting, serves as the inciting incident and charges the final image, fulfilling the requirement for a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's most successful element, establishing a potent atmosphere from the first sentence. Details are vivid, selective, and integrated directly into the story's climax, with the aurora "pulsing in harmony with her actions." This elevates the environment from a mere backdrop to an active participant that constrains the mood and charges the final, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is a significant strength, with the rewilded bunker and luminescent fungi creating a potent, mystical atmosphere that perfectly supports the story's introspective nature. The approaching storm is not just background; it's a key environmental element that paces the central dream sequence, constraining the action to its duration and charging the final scene with its aftermath. The setting is deeply integrated into the story's structure and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is potent, with the "reimagined" Babylonian palace creating a rich, consistent atmosphere. Sensory details are selective and effective ("crumbling frescoes whispered tales"). Crucially, the magic square tile—a micro-setting element—is not merely decorative; it is the central tool that constrains the final action and directly charges the closing image, fulfilling the requirement for excellence in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "soundless sanctuary" provides a coherent atmosphere that supports the story's initial state of discord and final state of harmony. However, the setting is rendered in generic terms ("serene oasis," "golden light") and remains a passive backdrop. It fails to constrain character choice or provide specific, sensory details that would elevate it beyond a symbolic container for the events.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, rendered with vivid, purposeful sensory detail that establishes a potent atmosphere from the first sentence. The "ruined orchard district," "thick fog," and "shimmer of twilight frost" are not just backdrop; they are active agents in the narrative's magical process. Crucially, the sextant and the frost act as key objects that constrain and enable the final choice, directly charging the final image and satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.0)
    The core image of a lush orchard within an abandoned cathedral is evocative and establishes a strong atmosphere. The setting provides a beautiful canvas for Elara's actions and internal state. However, the environment remains largely a backdrop; it enables her work but does not constrain her choices or apply pressure in a way that would elevate it beyond vivid scenery. The "quartz-eye" detail is an unfulfilled piece of world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    The "astral orchard" and the "dimly lit bathroom" create a potent, surreal atmosphere that supports the story's themes of nonlinear discovery. The pistachio shell cameo blank functions well as a recurring object that helps anchor the narrative and charge the final image, fulfilling the role of a micro-setting that constrains meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.0)
    The initial description of the bookstore is evocative, successfully establishing a mysterious atmosphere. However, the setting's potential remains underutilized; the "impossible geometries" and "treacherous shelves" are mentioned but never constrain a choice or complicate an action on the page. The bookstore functions as a memorable container for the plot but not an active participant in it.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, providing a potent atmosphere that is both specific and thematically resonant. The abandoned carnival ship is well-realized with evocative sensory details, and it functions effectively as a "micro-setting" that constrains the action and directly charges the final image of the hidden cove.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is a notable strength. The university clock tower mechanism room is not merely a backdrop; the clock's ticking becomes an active element of the plot, its distortion marking the temporal anomaly. This direct integration of setting into the central magical event elevates it beyond simple description, making it a force that shapes the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, creating a vivid and consistent atmosphere. Details like the ice cracks and the echo chamber stone are not merely descriptive but are integrated into the plot as essential tools and constraints, directly shaping the character's actions and charging the final image of "gentle luminosity."

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    The "glass humming pavilion" is the story's strongest element, successfully functioning as an active micro-setting. Details are evocative and integrated into the plot, with the star charts on the walls and the central orrery directly constraining the character's path and enabling the climax. The setting is not merely a backdrop but a crucial mechanism for the narrative's progression, satisfying the requirement for environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's most powerful asset. The "stormlit observatory" and "crystal whispering forecourt" are rendered with vivid, purposeful sensory detail that establishes a potent atmosphere from the first sentence. The crystal forecourt functions as a crucial tool, the direct mechanism for the story's climax, thereby deeply constraining character action and charging the final image. This is an exceptional fusion of setting and plot.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "blooming fortress at dusk" provides a consistent and effective atmosphere that supports the protagonist's emotional journey. Sensory details are present, particularly the visual of the fire-spinner's "kerosene rag knot," which becomes a recurring image that charges her creative process. However, the setting primarily functions as a beautiful backdrop rather than an active force that constrains choices or shapes tactics in a meaningful way.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with vivid, selective sensory details creating a palpable atmosphere. The grotto, with its starlight, salt-laced air, and dripping water, effectively supports the contemplative tone. The jade cicada functions well as a "micro-setting," a tangible object that anchors the protagonist's abstract thoughts and charges the final image, fulfilling the requirement for setting to be more than just a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    The "xenial trellis" is a highly effective and memorable setting that is inseparable from the plot. It's not just a backdrop but the mechanism that enables the central action, directly constraining choice and charging the final image. The sensory details of the floating objects and the golden light create a powerful, specific atmosphere that serves the story's core concept perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    Atmosphere is the story's most significant achievement. The "vaulting hush" is palpable and consistently maintained. While the "drifting prism terrace" is more of a beautiful concept than a tactile space, it, along with the storm glass vial, directly constrains the story's mood and charges the final image, fulfilling a key function of setting at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is established with evocative, specific details like the "kaleidoscopic waterfall" and "cybernetic birds," creating a strong atmosphere. The ruby flake, as a micro-setting/tool, constrains choice by guiding her path. However, the wider environment is more of a backdrop than an active force; the waterfall is easily passed and the trees part for her, presenting no real obstacle and thus limiting the setting's impact on her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    The atmosphere of the "ashen charcoal sanctuary" is strong and consistent. The doorknocker ring is the standout element, functioning as a key object that both constrains the initial choice to enter and is re-contextualized in the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement. While some descriptions are abstract, the tangible focus on the doorknocker and the central flame provides sufficient grounding and symbolic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is the story's most successful element. The "bioluminescent mushroom farm" provides a strong, unique atmosphere that effectively frames the narrative and charges the final image of glittering diamonds. However, the environment remains largely atmospheric, failing to apply pressure or constrain character choices in a way that would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    The "sepia reading room" is effectively established with consistent sensory details like aged paper, lantern light, and dust. The gramophone crank handle functions as a strong micro-setting, and the recurring motif of "golden shadows" is successfully re-charged with new meaning in the final image. The atmosphere is the story's most successful element, guiding the mystical tone throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is excellent and indispensable. The "alchemical orchard greenhouse" is not merely a backdrop but an active participant; the trees "lean in" and the glass "ripple," directly enabling and reflecting the magical climax. The "intricately carved wooden snap" also functions as a crucial tool that constrains and triggers the central action, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest element. The file room is evoked with effective sensory details ("musty smell," "faint scent of despair," "accumulated dust"). The core object, the infantryman's button, functions as a powerful micro-setting, constraining Emilia’s focus and charging the narrative. The atmosphere is consistent and effectively underpins the story's emotional core, with the setting itself feeling like a character.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.5)
    The "auric lagoon" is atmospheric and tonally effective, functioning as a necessary sanctuary that enables the plot. Details like the puddle-reflection map and luminescent orbs add to the otherworldly mood. The setting successfully charges the final image, but lacks the lived-in specificity that would make it truly memorable or tactile for the character.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength. The "prism atrium" and "radiant grotto" are not static backdrops but active participants; the atrium amplifies sound, and the mist responds to the music. This interaction between character, action, and environment is seamless and powerful, directly constraining the action and charging the final image with meaning, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, with vivid, specific, and tonally coherent details creating a powerful atmosphere. The "ashen skyborne arbor" is not merely a backdrop but an active force, with its falling leaves functioning as the central plot device. The "moonstone cabochon dust speck" serves as an effective micro-setting element that initiates the climax and charges the final image, fulfilling the criteria for excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is a significant strength, with the subterranean waterfall, decaying greenhouse, and scattered clock parts creating a unique and evocative atmosphere. The central object—the compass rose—functions as a "micro-setting" that directly constrains the protagonist's actions by guiding his hands. The environment consistently mirrors and informs Elian's internal state, particularly the greenhouse's "decay and rebirth."

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "rain-washed foundry" provides a strong initial atmosphere, effectively setting a melancholic tone. The zodiac coin functions well as a recurring object that charges the central reflection. However, the setting remains largely a passive backdrop; after the opening, it does little to constrain Elara's choices or actively shape the unfolding of her internal discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.0)
    The atmosphere of Echo Gorge is effectively established through selective sensory details like the "hush," "whispers," and "mist." The setting provides a strong mood. However, it functions primarily as a backdrop and does not constrain character choice or meaningfully shape the climax, limiting its score.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    The "ultraviolet forest" is the story's strongest element, an atmospheric and dynamic setting that actively participates in the narrative. It effectively externalizes the protagonist's internal state, with its pulsing light and writhing trees creating a palpable sense of otherworldly pressure. The setting directly constrains the central choice and charges the final image, making it integral to the plot and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, immediately establishing a rich, tangible atmosphere with details like "the scent of sandalwood and myrrh." More importantly, the setting provides the key objects—the lens and the painting—that drive the entire plot. The lighthouse lens fragment functions as a recurring object that constrains Lena's attention and directly charges the final image, fulfilling the requirement for excellence in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.2)
    The atmosphere of the abandoned ticket office is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details creating an eerie, melancholic tone. The setting is not merely a backdrop; it is the central puzzle. Critically, two objects—the mainspring barrel and the dust—function as micro-settings that directly constrain and enable the plot, charging the final image and making the environment indispensable to the story.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    Setting and atmosphere are the story's greatest strengths. The "glass orchard library" is a powerfully original and evocative image, and sensory details are specific and purposeful. Crucially, the setting is not merely descriptive; the frost patterns on the glass panes are the essential resource for the operator's work, directly constraining the central action and charging the final image. This integration of environment and plot is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is a standout strength, with the "baroque asteroid" providing a rich, evocative atmosphere that mirrors the protagonist's internal state. More importantly, the central object—the crystal vase shard—functions as a micro-setting that directly enables her choice to write and charges the final image. The environment is not merely backdrop but an active participant in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is superb, creating a potent atmosphere of mystical craft. The "resonance chamber" is not merely a backdrop; it becomes an active participant in the climax, its resonance required to align the melody. Furthermore, the golden chip functions as a micro-setting/tool that constrains the action, visibly glowing brighter under pressure and then dimming to signify the cost, directly charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    This is the story's greatest strength. The setting is rendered with vivid, purposeful sensory detail ("petrichor," "luminescent fungi," "resonant hush") that drives the textural narrative. The compass, as a key tool, constrains the character's physical choice of direction and is fully integrated into the final image of unity, satisfying the requirement for environment to charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, vividly rendered with effective sensory details that establish a powerful atmosphere. The storm-tossed archway is more than a backdrop; it provides the materials for the sculpture and the sensory input for Aria's reverie. The final image of the sculpture is directly charged by and integrated with the environment, making the setting an active participant in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story excels in creating a consistent, evocative atmosphere. The "amber pavilion," "etched glass windows," and "moonlit gardens" are rendered with purpose, and the cathedral window functions as a micro-setting that directly charges the final image of Luna's soul being similarly "etched." Sensory details are primarily visual but are selective and effectively filtered through Luna's contemplative point of view, successfully grounding her internal journey.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is a significant strength, with the hanger-like zeppelin library and the obsidian lagoon creating a unique and memorable atmosphere. The sensory details in the opening establish a strong sense of place and mood. Most importantly, the obsidian lagoon functions as a powerful recurring image that directly charges the final moment of closure, reflecting the story's themes of hidden depths and becoming the focus of Naomi's renewed purpose. The environment is integral to the story's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story’s strongest element, with the "paper-lantern cove" and "crumbling structures" creating a potent atmosphere of decay and potential. The amber bottle functions effectively as a micro-setting, a focal point that constrains the alchemist's attention. The final line successfully uses the setting to charge the closure image, reframing the cove from a place of neglect to a "canvas," which is a sophisticated move.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with the "ancient orchard garden atop a skyscraper" providing a vivid, compelling contrast. The wax cylinder phonograph shaving functions as a micro-setting, a tool that constrains the action and becomes the charged object in the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Sensory details are selective and consistently build the specified "velvet disquiet" atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "icebound atrium under starlight" provides a strong initial atmosphere, and the acorn cap functions effectively as a "micro-setting" that constrains the central action. However, the larger setting becomes a static backdrop after the opening paragraph, failing to evolve or apply pressure on the character during the vortex experience. The sensory details are primarily visual and lack the specificity to make the environment feel truly lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with the "windblown sanctuary" being both atmospheric and functional. The unique microclimate is not just backdrop; it's the system Ember studies and eventually harmonizes with. The cathedral bell, as a micro-setting, becomes a tool that directly constrains her choices and charges the final image, fulfilling the criteria for excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, creating a palpable atmosphere of "quiet reverence" and "tranquility." The tracking station functions as a sanctuary that enables the narrative's meditative quality. Crucially, a specific object within the setting—the yellow lantern glass—is used to charge the final image, fulfilling the requirement for a setting that constrains or shapes the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is evocative and establishes a strong initial atmosphere of decay and memory. The "abandoned beekeeping oasis" provides specific, purposeful details like the honeycomb fragments that ground the story's theme. While the environment doesn't directly constrain choices, the central object—the stained glass box—is integrated perfectly and charges the final image, functioning as a powerful micro-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "emerald silo" and its contents create a strong, consistent atmosphere of post-temporal decay and mystery. Details like the cracked clock and damaged time capsule are well-chosen and purposeful. The atmosphere is the story's greatest strength. However, the setting primarily functions as a backdrop; it establishes the mood effectively but rarely constrains the character's choices or forces tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is a significant strength, with vivid, selective sensory details establishing a palpable atmosphere ("burnished hush," "misty air of the cobalt lagoon"). The drake's feather functions as a crucial micro-setting or recurring object, grounding the poet's internal state and charging the final image. The environment is not just backdrop; it is the source of the story's central tension and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is established with evocative sensory details, creating a consistent and palpable atmosphere. The "living stone pillars" and "scent of blooming flowers" provide a strong initial anchor. However, the setting remains a beautiful but passive backdrop; it never constrains a choice, forces an adaptation, or acts as an obstacle, limiting its impact on the narrative's core tension.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    The atmosphere is the story's greatest strength, with the "rainwashed tower," "misty landscape," and "bronze quiet" creating a potent and consistent mood. The micro-setting of the fly amber is used effectively, as its pulsing light at the end charges the final image of connection. The environment directly contributes to the story's textural escalation, making the setting a key player in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    The atmosphere is the story's greatest strength, with vivid sensory details creating a potent, mystical mood. The setting—the contrast between the blooming jetty and the barren, battle-scarred destination—is not just a backdrop but the central problem the character must solve. The transformation of this space constitutes the story's core action and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is a clear strength, establishing a vivid post-apocalyptic atmosphere with effective sensory details like "the smell of creosote and ash" and "the soft crunch of gravel." The wasteland is more than a backdrop; it functions as the primary antagonist, creating the central obstacle for the characters' journey. The final image of the "tiny oasis in the desert of steel and stone" powerfully juxtaposes life and decay, charging the closure with environmental significance.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, effectively establishing an atmosphere of desolate grandeur and stillness. The "gilded compass rose applique" is not just descriptive but functions as a crucial plot device, constraining the character's attention and directly charging the final, decisive image of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting of an "icebound spire" is atmospheric and visually clear. Details like the "hint of ozone" and a chess board "carved from the very essence of the stars" add texture. However, the environment is largely a passive backdrop. The "treacherous ice tunnels" are stated as dangerous but present no specific, on-page obstacle that forces Moonwhisper to adapt, making the setting less a participant in the conflict and more a scenic route to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is atmospheric and purposeful. The "whispering gallery" isn't just a backdrop; its acoustics are used to amplify the historian's words, giving them prophetic weight. The chessboard functions as a potent micro-setting, its state directly reflecting the central conflict and its final reinterpretation charging the closure image, thus constraining a choice/charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest element. The "labyrinthine bookstore occupying an entire mountain" is a vivid and compelling anchor. Sensory details are well-chosen and establish a potent atmosphere. Crucially, the setting is not static; its final transformation into a "threshold to new possibilities" directly charges the story's closing image, fulfilling the requirement for an environment to shape the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmosphere is a distinct strength, with evocative concepts like the "time-frozen village" and the "woven hush" creating a potent initial mood. The shift from this hush to "birdsong" at the end effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal transformation. The central image of the "platinum labyrinth" is memorable, but its interior remains abstract, preventing the setting from actively constraining choices in the way a more tangible environment might have.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is a standout strength, functioning as an active force in the narrative. The mist is a tangible obstacle and the pale spire is a potent focal point for the conflict and its resolution. The environment directly constrains the character's actions and charges the final image, making it integral to the story's success.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.0)
    The initial imagery of a gears-and-cogs workshop on an acid sea is evocative and atmospheric. However, the setting's physical rules are contradictory and confusing, directly causing the plot's logical failure. The atmosphere is established but the spatial choreography is impossible, preventing the setting from constraining choice in a coherent manner and severely undermining the story's plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.5)
    The settings are evocative, with strong atmospheric and sensory details, particularly the quay at sunset and the luminescent oasis. The atmosphere effectively supports the story's lyrical, contemplative tone. However, while the setting inspires the character's actions, it never acts as a meaningful constraint that forces a difficult choice or trade-off, keeping it from reaching the highest tier of narrative integration.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is a distinct strength, with vivid sensory details like the "cobalt lighthouse" and the "heady mix of blooming flowers and fresh earth." Crucially, the setting is not merely atmospheric; the "scent of the garden at night" becomes a functional tool in the story's central action, directly enabling the climax and charging the final image. This integration of setting into mechanism is well-executed.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    The atmosphere is powerfully rendered, from the "starlit signal station" to the "canvas of shadows and light." Crucially, the "patina bronze censer foot" functions as a potent micro-setting; it's an object that anchors her to the past and constrains her emotional state. Its presence in her hand during the final moment of acceptance charges the closure, making it an indispensable part of the story's emotional machinery.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is a significant strength, actively shaping the narrative. The "battered and storm-torn landscape" is not just backdrop but a container for the plot's key objects and a reflection of the protagonist's inner state. The final image of the intensifying storm directly charges the closure, making the environment an indispensable part of the story's emotional and thematic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with vivid, purposeful details like the "opal dock" and "nautical twilight" creating a powerful atmosphere. The lighthouse functions as a key thematic and structural anchor, while the boutonnière acts as a perfect micro-setting object. These elements are not just backdrop; they are indispensable, constraining Kael's understanding and charging the final, resonant image of him holding the "key."

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.2)
    The blooming cavern is rendered with some effective sensory detail, creating a distinct atmosphere. However, the primary environmental element meant to apply pressure—the rising creek—fails to constrain choices meaningfully. It is described as a threat ("threatened to engulf the cavern"), but Emilia's actions are not altered by it, and it conveniently recedes, reducing it to a passive backdrop rather than an active force.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmosphere is the story's greatest strength, with evocative and sensory-rich descriptions of the cobalt and ember grottos creating a palpable sense of otherworldly mystery. The imagery is vivid, particularly the "sea of clouds" and the grotto's "fiery heart." The setting effectively drives the mood, though it doesn't ultimately charge the failed closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is a significant strength, with the "ember nexus" creating a vivid, magical atmosphere that supports the story's creative and wondrous tone. Details like the "scent of smoldering coals" and the pulsing light are well-integrated and purposeful. The nautilus shell itself functions effectively as a micro-setting, constraining the character's focus and charging the story's central inquiry and final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.0)
    While the broader setting of the "mountain ranger cabin" is somewhat generic, the "birch bark scroll" functions effectively as a micro-setting that constrains and enables the central action. This key object is integrated from the inciting choice to the final resonant image, where it "seemed to glow with an inner light," successfully charging the closure. The story leverages this specific object to make the internal journey tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength. The "water clock repair shop" with its "gentle lapping of water" and the "misty morning fog" create a potent, integrated atmosphere that reflects Elara's internal state. The midwife's birthing clamp screw functions as a powerful micro-setting, anchoring her reflections and charging the story's central contemplation. The environment is not just a backdrop; it's an active participant in the narrative's mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is a distinct strength, with the floating platform providing a vivid, purposeful atmosphere that perfectly mirrors the central tension between tranquility and instability. The faint tremors aren't just description; they are a key plot driver that pressures the character. The crow quill, a micro-setting element, is handled with purpose and its final state charges the closing image, satisfying the criteria for excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.5)
    The sheet music archive is evocatively rendered with sensory details that ground the initial scene. The antique perfume bottle serves as an excellent micro-setting and tool, directly enabling the story's central action. The sudden, un-anchored introduction of the orchard as a metaphor ("the hush before the orchard's trees were cut down hung in the air") feels spatially and tonally disconnected, disrupting the otherwise strong atmospheric immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    The atmosphere of the "ancient temple library" is effectively established with good sensory details like the "scent of aged parchment." However, the setting is primarily a backdrop. Neither the library nor the outside world presents a tangible constraint or resource that shapes Aria's choices; it serves the tone well but remains passive in the narrative mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.5)
    The atmosphere is evocative and consistent, with "fjord quiet" establishing a strong initial tone. The "horizon measurement station" and its hydraulic clocks create a unique and intriguing backdrop. The mantle clock and its key function effectively as a micro-setting, constraining the character's attention and charging the final image, but the larger setting remains a passive container for the character's thoughts rather than an active force that pressures choices.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is the story's most successful element, rendered with vivid and evocative sensory detail that establishes a powerful, ethereal atmosphere. The setting effectively mirrors Lena's internal state, particularly the moment of "stillness" before a vibrant mushroom cluster. While the environment influences her mood, it stops short of constraining a choice or charging the final image in a way that would elevate it to exceptional, functioning more as a beautifully painted backdrop than an active force.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    The "rainwashed library" provides a strong, consistent atmosphere that supports the story's pensive tone. The candle lantern with its mica pane is the standout element; it is introduced early, recurs, and is reweighted with new significance at the end, charging the final image of resolve. This use of a recurring object as a "micro-setting" that reflects the character's internal state is very effective.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, creating a potent and unique atmosphere through selective, vivid sensory details like the "hum of streetlamps" and the "ethereal tones" of the glass harmonica. The environment is not just a backdrop; the tunnel's liminal nature is what enables the story's central concept of connection through anonymity. The final image of the operator at peace is charged entirely by these established environmental details, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is competently established with evocative sensory details, creating a consistent and appropriate atmosphere. The blooming jetty at twilight serves as a suitable backdrop for the archivist's melancholic reflections. However, the environment remains largely passive; it never constrains a choice or meaningfully alters the character's actions, functioning more as elegant scenery than an active participant in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is excellent, immediately evocative ("ivy tendrils... like skeletal fingers") and integral to the plot. The disused station functions as a crucible, concentrating the narrative pressure and enabling the community formation. The setting is not merely a backdrop but a key component of the story's mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is highly imaginative and atmospheric, with strong, selective sensory details (ultrasonic sounds, floral scents) filtered through the POV. The "ultrasonic" nature is purposeful, creating the core navigational challenge. However, while the environment enables the plot, it doesn't actively constrain choices or charge the final image as forcefully as the platinum ring does, keeping it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting of the "gravitational anomaly" is evocative and integrated into the central action, with the atmosphere responding to Aria's work on the pen. The pen itself functions effectively as a micro-setting, a tool whose state constrains her choices and is the absolute focus of the final, charged image. While some descriptions are broad, the connection between the anomaly, the pen, and Aria's internal state is a significant strength.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.2)
    This is the story's greatest strength. The "luminous harbor by moonlight" is not just a backdrop but an active participant, with its sounds and light being "orchestrated." The vintage camera is a perfect micro-setting object that constrains the theme (capturing the uncapturable) and charges the final, resonant image. The sensory details are selective, purposeful, and consistently filtered through the story's magical-realist tone.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting creates a functional, eerie atmosphere with its "flickering fluorescent lights" and "dusty shelves." The faded tapestry fragment is used effectively, recurring as a motif and charging the final emotional moment, thus satisfying the core requirement for a setting element to impact the closure. Beyond this, however, the archive remains a somewhat generic backdrop rather than an environment that actively constrains or shapes Elian's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength. The "sound wave garden" and "auric lagoon" are not passive backdrops but active participants that respond to the character's actions and are indispensable to the story's causal logic. The environment directly enables the climax and charges the final resonant image, demonstrating exceptional integration.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story excels in creating a tangible, oppressive atmosphere. The "towering labyrinth of shipping containers," the "smell of salt and rust," and the raging geomagnetic storm are rendered with effective sensory detail. The setting is not merely a backdrop; the maze-like structure and disorienting storm directly constrain the character and charge the final scene with an eerie tension, making the environment an active force in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    Atmosphere is a primary strength, with the opening description of the "cobalt dock" creating a potent and specific mood. The dental mirror functions as an effective micro-setting, constraining the guardian's gaze and charging the final image. However, the score is capped from a higher band due to the vagueness of key actions; "weave a pattern with the shutters" remains a purely conceptual image without the specific, tactile detail needed to ground it.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    The atmosphere is the story's strongest feature, with evocative settings like the "cobalt library shrouded in mist" and the "magnetic grotto." The mist serves as an effective recurring motif that recharges at the end. However, the setting functions primarily as a symbolic backdrop; it rarely constrains choice or applies pressure, preventing it from becoming a truly active force in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmosphere is a distinct strength, with the "sublittoral fringe" at dusk creating a potent, liminal mood. Sensory details, like the whale's call vibrating through the dock, are well-realized. However, the setting primarily functions as an atmospheric backdrop rather than an active constraint that pressures Kael's choices, preventing it from reaching the highest tier of integration.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, creating a powerful, coherent atmosphere that is inseparable from the theme. The farmhouse and turbines provide a constant, oppressive presence that reflects the character's internal state. The dried bouquet functions effectively as a "micro-setting," becoming the focal point that constrains Echo's attention and charges the final image with meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.6)
    The setting is exceptional and indispensable; the "humming quartz colonnade" is not a backdrop but an active force that constrains choice, provides the central mechanism for the plot, and charges the final resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story establishes a clear and evocative atmosphere with details like "the soft clinking of furnaces" and the "murmur of artisans." The specific objects—the concertina reed tongue and the arranged plants—are well-integrated into the painter's actions. However, the setting functions primarily as a beautiful backdrop and does not apply pressure or constrain choices, limiting its impact on the narrative's core.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, with evocative and specific details like the "laboratory of lost sounds," "scent of old machinery," and "luminescent orbs." The atmosphere is rich and consistently maintained. The miner's carbide lamp lens functions as a key micro-setting, constraining the initial action and charging the final image as a symbol of the journey, making the environment an active participant in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is a significant strength, with the "timeless observatory" providing a potent atmosphere rich with sensory details like "sandalwood and myrrh" and the "kaleidoscope of colors." The "curtains of intention" function as a micro-setting that is not merely decorative; they are the central apparatus of the plot. Their changing state directly mirrors and drives the character’s internal transformation, charging the final image and fulfilling the requirement to constrain choice and action.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.2)
    The "rain-beaded skylight loft" is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail, evolving from workspace to mystical sanctuary and finally a "threshold to a deeper understanding." Atmosphere is the story's strongest element. Crucially, the "measuring tape" functions as a recurring object that constrains action and powerfully charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement by being integral to both process and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    The atmosphere of the archive is effectively established with evocative sensory details. The "bronze prism pagoda at twilight" functions as an excellent micro-setting; it is not just described but is the central tool that constrains the climax and its re-weighted meaning charges the final image of the historian's "transformed perception."

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting of the blooming library on a sea of clouds is evocative and establishes a strong, ethereal atmosphere. More importantly, the micro-setting of the river stone functions as a key narrative object; it anchors the protagonist, "grows warmer" to signal a breakthrough, and is carried into the final scene, charging the ending image with personal history and connection.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, with the "misty workshop under the stars" creating a potent, "shimmering stillness." The atmosphere is vivid, selective, and deeply integrated into Lena's internal state. The chameleon functions as a charged "micro-setting," and its physical presence directly constrains—or rather, enables—Lena's final shift in perspective, making the environment an active participant in the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story establishes a strong, evocative atmosphere with the mist-shrouded tower and luminescent plants. However, the setting remains a passive backdrop rather than an active force. Key objects like the hourglass are persistently present and thematically important, but they don't constrain choices or charge the final image in a way that would elevate them beyond sophisticated props.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is immediately evocative and rich with sensory detail ("scent of old celluloid and dust"), establishing a strong, consistent atmosphere. The film strip, as a key object, functions as a micro-setting that both constrains choice (by being the sole focus) and powerfully charges the final image. The environment is integral to the story's core conceit and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, with the "aurora-lit archway" providing a vivid, purposeful atmosphere that is integral to the plot. The astrolabe, as a micro-setting object, is handled with reverence and directly constrains the character's actions. Both the grand setting and the key object work together to charge the final image, making the environment an active participant in the narrative's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength. The imagery of a glowing dune after forest burns is vivid and atmospheric. Critically, the chess clock acts as a micro-setting that constrains a key choice (reactivating it) and its symbolic meaning is powerfully reconfigured in the final lines, charging the closure and elevating it from mere description to a crucial narrative engine.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is the story's most powerful and well-realized element. The "Mechanical rainforest" is rendered with specific, evocative details that create a consistent and compelling atmosphere. Crucially, the setting is not just a backdrop; it directly enables the plot and charges the final image, becoming the "catalyst" and "gateway" in a way that fulfills the 9+ test for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's most powerful element. The "veiled ridgeway" and swirling mist are not just backdrop; they actively constrain the characters' journey and embody the central conflict of uncertainty. The final image, where the mist clears to reveal the new path, is a direct and resonant payoff, fully integrating setting into the story's closure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is evocative and functional, with the "cobalt fortress" and "blanket of snow" establishing a potent atmosphere of isolation. The "slightest discoloration on the step" is the standout detail, functioning first as a practical guide for the character and returning later as a resonant symbol for navigating their existence. This elevates the setting from mere backdrop to an element that actively charges the final thematic understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.0)
    The atmosphere of the ancient library is well-established with effective sensory details ("scent of aged parchment," "eerie shadows"). The micro-setting of the "iron gall ink pellet" is used effectively, constraining Kael's actions to writing and serving as a resonant final image when left empty on the floor. While the broader setting is more of a backdrop than an active force, its tone is consistent and supports the narrative's mood of patient, ancient work.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is a significant strength, with the sea level monitoring station acting as both a physical place and a symbol of the scientific method Maya eventually moves beyond. Sensory details like the "rhythmic beeps" and the "gentle lapping of waves" are well-integrated. The worn atlas and broken drum serve as effective micro-settings that charge the final image and constrain Maya's choices, pushing her from analysis toward creation.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.4)
    Exceptional integration of setting and object. The abandoned spaceport establishes the initial emotional state, while the stone circle functions as the crucible for change. The recurring opera glasses are indispensable, evolving from a simple tool to a symbol that actively shapes the final, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and successfully integrated into the plot, with the hot springs providing a hiding place and the telepathically-linked plants acting as a key narrative device. The atmosphere is well-established and evocative. The final image, with Akira framed by the steaming springs, is effectively charged by the environment, connecting her to its "ancient power."

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, acting as a direct catalyst for the protagonist's change. The arboretum's features—the wind, the sea, and especially the personified trees—are not just backdrop but active forces that constrain Amira's attention and charge the final image. Her changing perception of the trees, from "withered fingers" to "gentle fingers," perfectly mirrors her internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    The atmosphere of the lighthouse library is powerfully rendered, creating a fittingly somber and mystical tone. The setting effectively mirrors the character's internal state. More importantly, the broken tarot card box functions as a crucial micro-setting; the artist's interaction with this object directly constrains her actions and charges the final image of her redesigned perception, fulfilling the key requirement for a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    The atmosphere is effectively established, and the artificial hummingbird drone and disappearing ink are strong, purposeful details that ground the speculative elements. The ink, in particular, functions as a micro-setting that constrains the search and charges the final image. The broader "wind-carved encampment" remains a bit generic, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is exceptional, moving beyond mere backdrop to become an active participant in the narrative. The library's "dizzying quiet" amplifies the tension of Aria's decision, and the falling snow is masterfully linked to her internal state. The final image, contrasting the serene library with the societal storm it has unleashed, powerfully charges the closure, meeting the highest standards of integration.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, a powerfully realized and specific "peculiar oasis." Key objects—the repurposed sandbag, the engraved stone, and the sheathed sword—are not merely descriptive but directly constrain Aria's choices and charge the final image of tranquility. The atmosphere is tangible, and the contrast between the domed farm and the ruined city is expertly handled.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's most powerful element, functioning as an active character rather than a backdrop. The "sound wave garden" is rendered with specific, purposeful sensory details that directly inform the protagonist's actions and the story's core mechanics. The rail spike, a micro-setting element, is handled at key moments, grounding the mystical events and charging the final image, thus satisfying the requirement for environmental pressure on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory setting is the story's strongest feature, functioning as a crucible for Adelaide's decision. The echoing silence, misty veil, and view from above the clouds powerfully mirror her internal state and the theme of uncovering hidden truths. The pen nib serves as an effective micro-setting, and the final image of the mist clearing is a resonant, if conventional, payoff that charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    The "laboratory of lost sounds" is the story's strongest element, delivering a thick, consistent atmosphere with well-chosen sensory details (sandalwood, myrrh, machinery hum). The setting is not merely decorative; the antique dresser is a key plot device that constrains and directs the character's actions. The environment directly participates in the story's central conflict and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    The whispering grotto is an excellent, evocative setting that actively shapes the narrative. The mist, the whispering gallery, and the damp stone create a powerful, consistent atmosphere. The sand mandala functions as an effective micro-setting, and the tile flake is an object that constrains choice and directly charges the final image, fulfilling the criteria for excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is a significant strength, functioning as both the core of the conflict and the source of its resolution. The specific object of the tessera acts as a powerful micro-setting, triggering the central memory and charging the final image. The plaza is not merely a backdrop but an active participant whose state pressures and defines the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is a standout strength, functioning as an active participant in the narrative. The mystic orchard garden transforms in response to Echo's actions—"the trees rearranging themselves to form a labyrinthine path"—which directly constrains her choices and escalates the magical stakes. The hand-painted tarot coin acts as a powerful micro-setting, anchoring her energy and charging the final image. Sensory details are vivid and consistently support the ethereal, nostalgic atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is a significant strength. The light painting studio is evoked through specific sensory details ("linseed oil and turpentine") and actively participates in the plot. The muscovite geode sliver functions as a potent micro-setting, focusing the character's actions, while the studio equipment delivers the pivotal static shock, making the environment a causal agent in the narrative's turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, rendered with vivid and purposeful sensory detail that creates a strong atmosphere. The coastal cave network is not just a backdrop but an active participant, providing the canvas for Aria's mapping and shaping her internal journey. The final image, where the cave becomes her "companion," demonstrates how the environment successfully charges the story's closure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    The atmosphere is the story's greatest strength, with vivid, consistent sensory details creating a palpable sense of an ancient, memory-laden space. The "amber warehouse" and "unearthed silence" are powerfully rendered. The score is capped below 9.0 because the setting, while evocative, serves as a backdrop and does not actively constrain choice or shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    The atmosphere is a distinct strength, with the mist and bluff creating a potent "silver hush" that effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal state. The setting actively participates in the narrative, as the clearing of the mist parallels her own clearing of mind. The engraved pillbox functions as an effective micro-setting, a recurring object that grounds her choices and charges key moments of decision, fulfilling the criteria for a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, rendered with precise, multi-sensory detail that creates a palpable atmosphere. The fog is not merely backdrop; it actively constrains the scene and its eventual clearing becomes the physical manifestation of the story’s thematic resolution, directly charging the final image. The yarn needle also functions effectively as a micro-setting, anchoring the character's internal state in a concrete, tactile object. This fulfills the 9+ gate requirement with ease.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with vivid, selective details creating a powerful atmosphere of desolation haunted by a vibrant past. The "scent of old honey and wax" and "chimney smoke...flatten[ing] across the horizon" are excellent. Crucially, the faded lantern glass acts as a micro-setting that constrains Akira's focus and directly charges the final image, fulfilling the requirement for environmental pressure on choice and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    The atmosphere of the "luminous harbor" is vivid and sustained. The setting excels by using the lockmaster's tooth as a potent micro-setting; this recurring object is not mere set dressing but actively constrains the character's internal state and charges the final image with meaning. This purposeful integration of a small object into the story's thematic and emotional core is a significant strength.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, delivering a vivid and purposeful atmosphere that directly serves the character's internal conflict. The tidal library functions as a sanctuary, and key objects like the sundial and stone circle act as micro-settings that constrain Lyra's attention and charge the final moments. The final image of the sundial "glinting like a promise" is particularly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is evocative and purposeful. The "thrush's nest twig spiral" functions as a perfect micro-setting element; it's an object that directly constrains a choice (weaving it into the art) and powerfully charges the story's final image. This integration of a specific detail into the causal and thematic chain is a significant strength.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting of the "university radio station" is functional, providing the necessary tools for the plot. However, it lacks specificity and does not constrain or pressure the character's choices. The atmosphere is told ("thick with tension," "ethereal grit") rather than evoked through sensory detail, leaving the environment feeling like a generic backdrop rather than a lived-in space that shapes the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.8)
    The atmosphere is effectively established with good sensory details like the "scent of damp earth" and the "lonely church organ." The "shadowed nexus" serves its purpose as a mysterious labyrinth. However, the setting primarily functions as a backdrop; it presents obstacles but never truly constrains Lyra's choices in a way that forces ingenuity or reveals character under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is a significant strength. The "shadowed quarry" and "swirling mist" are not just backdrop but active atmospheric elements that consistently reinforce the theme of concealed truths. More importantly, the micro-setting object—the masquerade mask ribbon—acts as the primary catalyst, driving the narrative forward and charging the story's central symbolism and the artist's final resolve. The environment is integral to the story's effect.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is a significant strength, with the "experimental weather station's transparent dome" serving as a powerful image of fragile knowledge amidst chaotic nature. The atmosphere of "spongey dread" is effectively built through sensory details and the contrast between the humming interior and the raging storm. The environment actively constrains the character, heightening her isolation and vulnerability in the final beat where the station becomes a "fragile outpost."

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element. The mountain scenic pullout is not just a backdrop but an active participant, providing the fog, the glass flake, and the scaffold wrap that all trigger the fiddler's internal journey. The final image directly charges the setting, transforming it from a "mere backdrop" into a "threshold to a new reality," fulfilling the requirement for setting to constrain choice and charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest element. The abandoned circus train is rendered with evocative sensory detail ("scent of aged wood and decay," "faint outline of a lion's den") that is filtered through Kael's perspective. More importantly, the setting directly serves as the catalyst for his entire reflection and functions as a powerful, non-obvious metaphor for his failed startup, "Echo Routes," thus charging the story's central concept.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, an atmospheric and functional environment. Details like the transparent dome, the scent of old books, and the hum of machinery create a vivid sense of place. Crucially, the setting constrains the action and charges the final image; the stars and inscriptions are not just a backdrop but the very tools and subjects of Lyra's work, directly shaping her final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    The atmosphere is effectively established with evocative details like "blooming flowers and decay" and "branches twisted into grotesque forms." The setting creates a palpable sense of hostility and mystery. However, the environment remains largely a backdrop; it influences mood but does not constrain the druid's choices or meaningfully alter their tactics, preventing it from reaching a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is a significant strength, with the "cobalt glade" and "intricate maze topiary" creating a potent atmosphere of mystery and magic. Sensory details like the "scent of damp earth and blooming wildflowers" are well-integrated. Crucially, the setting constrains action (the maze paths) and provides the central object for the climax (the ancient tree), directly charging the story's final image and making the environment an active participant in the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's most compelling feature, with the "catacomb orchard" providing a vivid and consistent atmosphere that is central to the narrative's tone. Details like "tree roots snaked between ancient bones" are evocative and purposeful. However, the environment functions more as a thematic backdrop and a source of spell components than as a force that actively constrains choice or presents meaningful obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is a significant strength, with the quarry office trailer and the surrounding valley used effectively to constrain the character and charge the final image. The contrast between the dusty, quiet trailer and the memory of concerts in the quarry grounds the internal conflict in a tangible space. The setting is transformed from a "refuge" and symbol of failure into a "launchpad," directly participating in the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=4.8)
    The Magnetic arbor is atmospherically described with phrases like "misty veil" and "gentle hum of magnetic forces," successfully establishing a mystical tone. However, the setting remains a passive backdrop. It provides atmosphere but never constrains Elara's choices or applies pressure to her actions. The one active element, the Knowledge fruit seed, functions more as a prop than as an integrated part of the environment that shapes the narrative's central turn.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story excels at establishing a potent atmosphere. The "tidal atrium" with its "scent of saltwater" and "wintersun serenity" is vivid and sustained, successfully mirroring the librarian's internal state. Details like the "titan-gear" and the "fisherman's bamboo creel" are specific and evocative. However, the setting remains a beautifully rendered backdrop; it reflects the character but never constrains or pressures their choices, limiting its narrative function.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest element. The "otherworldly silence" and "resonant hush of the crystal caves" create a potent atmosphere that is integral to the protagonist's internal journey. The environment directly charges the final emotional state, fulfilling its role as a crucible for the story's central transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with the ivy-covered station serving as a potent and evolving symbol for Elara's internal state—from forgotten journeys to rebirth. The atmosphere of decay and reclamation is vivid and consistent. The accordion also functions as a key "micro-setting" object, constraining the climactic action of playing her lament and charging the final image as a symbol of the "mended and the broken."

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, establishing a potent and consistent atmosphere from the opening line. The "glowing library" is not just scenery; it provides the key objects (book, watch) that enable the central action. The final image of the dreamer returning to the "mist-shrouded city" is charged by the setting, making the environment an active participant in the narrative's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is established with evocative sensory details, creating a strong initial atmosphere ("velvet observatory," "scent of blooming flowers," "hues of crimson and gold"). However, the environment remains a passive backdrop. Neither the observatory's functions nor the midsummer timing constrains or enables Elian's choices in a meaningful way; it is a well-painted but static stage.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.5)
    The setting is exceptional and acts as a central character in the narrative. The skyborne grotto and the aurora are not merely a backdrop; they are integral to the core action, with the grotto's crystals resonating and the aurora's essence being the substance of the climax. This direct participation in the plot elevates the story significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is the story's most successful element, with evocative and specific details like "umbral grotto," "scallop the clouds," and "vineyard hush." The atmosphere is consistent and strong. The recurring object—the hairpin—functions as a micro-setting and does charge the final image. However, the environment facilitates reflection rather than actively constraining choices or pressuring the character, keeping it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting is atmospheric but somewhat generic ("breezy lighthouse"). Its strength lies in the use of micro-settings: the wind chimes are a functional tool (though their mechanics are vague), and the hollow mirror shard is indispensable. The shard is not just scenery; it's the crucible for the story's final, resonant image of self-reflection, which elevates the score significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting creates a strong, serene atmosphere with evocative elements like the "magnetic grotto" and "sycamore hush." The central image of the pond's rings is effectively integrated as a functional tool within the narrative, directly influencing the teaching method. However, other key elements like the "floating rock meditation platform" remain largely atmospheric dressing rather than active constraints on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is evocative and integral to the plot, with the canyon's "vibrational hum" and the arrowhead acting as key environmental components that enable and constrain the skimmer's action. The atmosphere is potent and consistent, and the environment directly participates in the story's core mechanism of attunement. The imagery successfully charges the final moments of stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is evocative and establishes a strong atmosphere with details like the "icebound spire," "frosty corridors," and the hidden garden. The environment enables the entire plot by containing the secret garden and keystone. However, the setting acts more as a beautiful container than an active force that constrains choices or applies pressure, limiting its full narrative potential.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, with vivid, selective details like the "scent of saltwater and decay" and "creaking of the old wooden hull" establishing a potent atmosphere. The sunken ship's library is not mere backdrop; the final, crucial image of the sky lanterns is framed by one of its windows, directly charging the closure. This integration of setting into the story's climax is executed exceptionally well.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is a distinct strength, with the "ambered observatory deck" providing a potent and atmospheric stage. Sensory details, like the "sweet, pungent aroma" of distillation mingling with the "faint tang of starlight," are well-integrated and purposeful. The environment directly constrains the action (being the necessary place for this cosmic work) and powerfully charges the final images of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is a significant strength, with the "ancient observatory at dusk" creating a potent atmosphere of cosmic loneliness and deep time. The atlas page functions effectively as a micro-setting, constraining the form of the central magical act. The final image of the observatory standing as a "sentinel" after the reaper's departure is charged and resonant, directly serving the story's closure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is a distinct strength. The "sapphire viaduct at dawn" creates a potent and consistent atmosphere, reinforced by effective sensory details. The environment is not merely descriptive; it provides the core object of the plot and directly charges the final image, where the viaduct's hue deepens, reflecting the magic that occurred. This integration of setting into the story's thematic and emotional arc is very well-handled.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)
    Atmosphere and specificity are the story's greatest strengths. The "skeletal remains of buildings," the "morbid perfume" of decay, and the "mirrored hush" of twilight create a potent and coherent mood. Sensory details are vivid and consistently filtered through the warden's solemn purpose. While the setting primarily serves mood rather than constraining choice, its execution is evocative and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is a significant strength, with vivid, purposeful details like the "kaleidoscopic waterfall" and the ancient tree. The orchard is not just a backdrop; it's an active participant, providing the key objects (crystal, starlings) that constrain Elara's choices. The crystal itself functions as a micro-setting that directly enables the climax and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with the "nocturnal arbor" creating a potent atmosphere of serene isolation. Sensory details are evocative, and the setting acts as a "crucible" that shapes the protagonist's focus, thus constraining action. The parachute buckle functions effectively as a micro-setting object that charges the theme, and the final image of the dawn-lit clouds provides a resonant conclusion, fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.5)
    The "floating rock dojo" is an evocative image but functions mostly as a backdrop. While it provides "isolation," it does not constrain choices or supply unique resources that influence the outcome. The brain in the jar serves as a more effective micro-setting, but the larger environment remains passive and does not meet the 9+ test of charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "nocturnal haven beside a quiet brook" effectively establishes a contemplative atmosphere that supports the internal narrative. The sound of the flowing brook is well-integrated with the character's mental "flow." However, the setting serves primarily as a backdrop; it never constrains a choice or applies pressure, preventing it from reaching a higher tier of narrative function.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.5)
    The "desolate echo chamber tunnel" is a highly effective and purposeful setting. Its acoustic properties are not merely atmospheric but are essential to the plot's central mechanism, directly enabling the leaf blower symphony. The Maestro's primary tool, the leaf blower, also functions as a micro-setting that constrains and defines the action, making the environment integral to the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, acting as a primary force. The frozen garden and the mist are not just backdrop; they are active participants that constrain the character's perception and become the medium for her internal journey ("interiorizing exteriors"). The final image—statues in a "lunar glow"—charges the closure by reflecting the protagonist's changed perception, making the setting essential to the story's function.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is evocative and establishes a strong atmosphere. The "ember nexus" is not merely a backdrop but serves a functional role as the power source for the alchemist's experiment, thus directly influencing the plot. The recurring image of the twilight, described as a "frozen bloom," effectively charges the final scene, integrating setting with the story's climax and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with the "abandoned radio tower city suspended high above the gorge" providing a vivid and original canvas. Sensory details like the "scent of ozone and decay" are effective in establishing a palpable atmosphere. The environment successfully contains the plot and charges the final image. However, it falls short of top-tier execution as the setting primarily serves as a backdrop rather than an active force that constrains choices or forces tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is a notable strength, with the "spectral grotto" and the recurring "empty hourglass" being the most effective elements. The grotto is not merely a backdrop; its atmospheric hum and hidden markings are active forces that drive the plot. The final image powerfully recharges the hourglass motif, making the setting integral to the story's closure and successfully constraining the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, an active participant that "erupts" and transforms under the protagonist's influence. The sensory details are effective, and the "sinew thread" functions as a perfect micro-setting/tool that constrains choice and charges the final image. The optical illusion gallery is not just a backdrop but the very substance of the conflict and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=2.2)
    The "benthic city" setting presents a fundamental logical contradiction: teaching navigation by starlight from the bottom of the ocean. This core inconsistency is never addressed, shattering world-rule coherence. Beyond this, the description is generic, relying on labels like "eerie twilight" without providing specific, sensory details that would make the world feel lived-in or constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is a significant strength. The "mist-clad atrium" is not just a backdrop but an active participant in the story, establishing the "reeling hush" and responding to the emotional climax by clearing. Furthermore, the key object—the hearing aid—functions as a micro-setting, a tool that guides and constrains Aria's actions, directly shaping the plot and charging the final image as its pulses fade. The environment is inseparable from the narrative's core function.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.5)
    The initial description of the facility is atmospheric and effective, establishing a strong sense of place. However, the setting becomes a passive container for the plot rather than an active force. Beyond being "dark" and "cramped," the environment doesn't constrain Lyra's choices or tactics in a meaningful way, leaving its potential largely untapped. The "crashing hush" is a strong sensory anchor, but the physical space itself is generic.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, creating a powerful atmosphere of quiet, snowy isolation that perfectly matches the "midnight solace" tone. The "opal observatory" is a memorable and fitting location. The porcelain shard acts as a potent micro-setting; it is handled throughout, its meaning evolves, and its release in the final moment charges the closure, directly fulfilling the 9+ gate requirement for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Atmosphere and setting are the story's greatest strengths. The "canyon of endless echoes" and "towers of bone" are not merely a backdrop but an active participant, providing the raw materials (echoes, shadows) for the storyteller's art. The environment directly constrains the central task and charges the final image, as the shadows dancing across the bone towers are the very texture being translated. The specificity of the imagery is consistently vivid and purposeful, creating a powerful, mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is a significant strength, with the herbalist's underground garden creating a potent atmosphere of mystery and otherworldly energy. The sensory details are effective ("damp earth and blooming flowers"), and key objects—the phone and the arrowhead—are not mere props. The arrowhead in particular constrains the initial interaction and charges the final image, fulfilling the criteria for a setting that actively shapes the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story establishes a consistent, dreamlike atmosphere. However, it relies on generic fantasy descriptors ("shimmered like stardust," "blossoming dreams") rather than specific, grounded details. The setting acts as a passive canvas for the protagonist's magic rather than a force that constrains or pressures her choices, with only the locust shell functioning as a weakly charged object.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    The “cobalt arcade” provides a strong atmospheric frame, and the central object—the thunderstorm in a bottle—is vivid and effectively charges the key scenes. The bottle functions as a strong micro-setting, its internal state mirroring the external tension. However, the wider setting, such as the border and the alleyway, feels generic and the drone obstacle is resolved by a convenient “stray signal” rather than a specific interaction with the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story’s standout success, rendered with vivid, purposeful sensory detail ("soft chime of wind bells," "mist grew thicker, and the air cooler"). The abandoned circus train is not just a backdrop; it provides key objects like the halo fragment and atmospheric pressures like the mist that constrain action and facilitate discovery. The final image of the finished horse is directly charged by the journey through this evocative environment, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    The "scientific poetry library" is an evocative and well-realized setting that perfectly supports the story's themes. Specific sensory details like the "scent of old paper and the faint tang of sandalwood" create a strong atmosphere. Crucially, the tattered silk scarf functions as a recurring object that reflects the narrative's progress, glowing and shimmering to charge the final image with meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmosphere of the "whispering archipelago" is the story's greatest strength, with vivid, selective sensory details that create a palpable mood. The setting is consistently filtered through the POV's artistic sensibility. However, the environment remains a beautiful but passive backdrop; it enables the character's ritual but never pressures or constrains their choices, stopping it short of full integration.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting and atmosphere are the story's greatest strengths. The "shadowed nexus under starlight" is vividly rendered, creating a potent sense of myth and possibility. Crucially, setting elements are not merely descriptive; the first star is a narrative device that guides the character, and the transformed clearing becomes the physical manifestation of the story's resolution, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is the story's most powerful and well-integrated element. The "sunken orchard... ringed by the skeletal remains of shipwrecks" is not just a backdrop but an active participant, its "morbidly beautiful perfume" creating a palpable atmosphere. This environment directly mirrors Emilia's internal state of ruined/sunken memories and constrains the central action, fundamentally charging the story's final moments with meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is superb, functioning as more than a backdrop. The "forgotten library" is a character in itself, its hush and creaking shelves amplifying the archivist's solitary, delicate task. Key objects—the glass shard, the tea cup—are not just props but central to the narrative mechanism. The recurring sound of the empty playground swing provides a haunting, atmospheric anchor that charges the final moment of quiet triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, vividly rendered with consistent atmospheric details. The "verdant parapet beside a roaring waterfall" is not just a backdrop; it is the subject of the central action. Crucially, it transforms into a "threshold, a gateway to other worlds," directly charging the final image and becoming integral to the story's closure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    The "prism sanctuary under starlight" is an exceptional and highly atmospheric setting that is inseparable from the story's tone. Details like the "luminescent orbs" and the "kaleidoscope of colors" are not just descriptive but actively participate in the scene's progression. The core object—the net—functions as a micro-setting that constrains all action and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is a distinct strength, with the “rain-scoured fresco vault” and the scent of “damp earth and mold” creating a potent and cohesive atmosphere. The environment directly supports the central concept of the “whispered chapel” and effectively charges the final image, where Elara emerges into a “bright, rain-washed world,” providing a sharp, resonant contrast to the vault's gloom that mirrors her internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    The sunken ship library is an exceptionally vivid and purposeful setting, generating a powerful atmosphere of decay and discovery. The snow globe functions as a perfect micro-setting, constraining the protagonist's focus and returning to charge the final image with reweighted meaning, fully integrating setting with theme.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, rendered with evocative sensory detail ("wet stone and ozone," "tendrils of fog"). The environment is not merely a backdrop; the intensifying storm directly shapes the pacing and pressure of the central scene. The flower press bolt plate serves as a micro-setting, a tangible object that anchors the mystical and charges the final moment with new meaning, successfully constraining choice and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "icebound spire" creates a strong, consistent atmosphere of beautiful isolation. The setting informs the deciphering method ("sunlight danced through the ice crystals"), linking environment to action. However, the setting remains more of a backdrop than an active force; it rarely constrains choice or applies direct pressure on the character's actions within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is a significant strength. The isolated sky gondola provides a perfect container for the contemplative mood, and its panoramic windows are essential to the action. More importantly, the brass telescope functions as a "micro-setting," a key tool inherited from the mentor that is handled multiple times and becomes the direct instrument for the story's final, resonant image, powerfully charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's most powerful and original element. The "tree trunk library" is vividly realized through specific sensory details, establishing a unique atmosphere of reverence and decay. Crucially, the setting is not just backdrop; its imminent demolition provides the story's central conflict and charges the final image, making the artist's fleeting act of creation deeply meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.0)
    The antique airship setting is deeply integrated and atmospheric, providing not just a backdrop but the very tools of discovery (charts, phrasebook, hopscotch board). The environment directly constrains the plot by isolating Eli and containing the mystery. The "dusty hopscotch board etched into the floor" functions as a crucial micro-setting that enables the story's central turn, satisfying the requirement for the environment to charge a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with evocative and consistent imagery ("frozen library," "crystalline foundations," "icy shelves"). The atmosphere is well-established and maintained. However, the environment is largely decorative and does not constrain character choice or force adaptation; the "glittering frost" and "icy shelves" are described but never function as genuine obstacles for Kael to overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is described with evocative but generic fantasy language ("orchard planet," "floating rock arches"). These elements serve as a picturesque backdrop rather than an active force that constrains choices or shapes the conflict. The butterfly garden watering bell is the one detail that is integrated with some success, reappearing at the end to resonate with the thematic resolution, but this is an isolated strength in an otherwise decorative environment.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is a major strength, with the hidden lighthouse at dusk creating a potent, somber atmosphere. The puppet head is used effectively as a "micro-setting" object that constrains the character's focus and is central to the story's thematic action. The environment isn't just a backdrop; its fading light and palpable "hush" directly shape the narrative's pacing and emotional weight, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story presents evocative setting elements like the cursed orchard and the labyrinth with mechanical birds, and offers some concrete sensory details ("thick with dust," "jagged stones"). However, these elements remain largely atmospheric. The curse, the trees' resistance, and the patrolling birds provide texture but do not actively constrain the protagonist's choices or force tactical adjustments, functioning more as a backdrop than an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength. The "braided ravine," with its foam patterns and the chrysalis, is not just a backdrop but an active participant in the character's internal process. These specific environmental details are masterfully integrated, serving as the direct catalyst for her insight and as resonant metaphors that charge the final image. The setting directly enables the story's closure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength. The "glass orchard library" is imaginative, atmospheric, and integral to the plot, not merely a backdrop. It directly charges the final image and constrains choice by becoming the object of the protagonist's quest for understanding. The sensory details are vivid and consistently filtered through the serene, mystical tone, creating a memorable and functional environment.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    The atmosphere is strong, with evocative sensory details like "sandstone walls still damp" and the "coral icebound pavilion." The setting is more than a backdrop; the pavilion is the arena for the climax, and touching it is the pivotal action. The setting constrains and enables the conflict, particularly in the final confrontation, but stops just short of the highest tier as the final image returns to the fortress rather than leveraging the unique pavilion to its fullest resonant potential.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, creating a potent atmosphere with evocative details like the "hush of borrowed starlight" and the clock's "intricate mechanisms." The clock tower functions as more than a backdrop; it's the necessary stage for the central action and its mechanics are integrated into the scene's rhythm. The specificity of the setting helps ground the fantastical premise.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.1)
    The moonlit canyon provides a consistent and effective atmosphere, supporting the story's tone of "quaking reverie." While the broader setting is somewhat generic, the "broken periscope mirror" functions effectively as a micro-setting. This object is not merely described but is the central tool that constrains Elara's actions and directly charges the final, resonant image of her completed work.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    The atmosphere of the grotto and archives is well-established with evocative, if familiar, sensory details ("yellowed parchment crackled," "damp earth and moss"). The manuscript doodle is a key object that effectively constrains choice by becoming a map. However, the more fantastical setting elements, like the inverted gravity, feel more like conditions for the plot to happen rather than active pressures; she navigates the grotto "with ease," which deflates some potential environmental tension.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    The "siskin alder grove" is specific, atmospheric, and integral to the plot. Details like stained fingers and the contrasting porcelain insulator are vivid and purposeful. The setting constrains the action and directly participates in the climax, resonating with the music and charging the final image, meeting the high-band criteria.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.5)
    The atmosphere is evocative, with effective sensory details like the "polished basalt worry stone dent" and the "sweet scent of blooming wildflowers." However, the core speculative elements, such as the "magnetic nexus," remain functionally vague, serving as mystical set dressing rather than a force that constrains choices or charges the final image in an indispensable way.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmosphere is the story's strongest element, with evocative sensory details creating a palpable sense of serene, magical stillness ("sandalwood," "blooming jasmine," "hum of crickets"). The temporal setting—the quiet before the fireworks—is effectively used to charge the final image and contrast with Elara's internal state. While the physical workshop itself is somewhat passive, the overall environment successfully supports the intended mood and the story's climax.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    The atmosphere of the "mysterious treetop village" is evocative and consistent, establishing a clear tone. Sensory details, particularly scent, are central to the story and are filtered through the protagonist's specific capabilities. However, the setting itself is largely a picturesque backdrop; it does not constrain choice or apply pressure in a tangible way. The most active "setting" is Lyra's own body and senses, which effectively mediate her interaction with the key object, the seed.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The core concepts of the setting—an orchard planet with floating arches and inverted gravity—are imaginative and strong. The world-building provides a functional and evocative backdrop for the plot. However, the sensory details remain generic ("natural beauty," "glowing, iridescent pool"), preventing the atmosphere from becoming truly immersive. While the arrow tip charges the final image, the environment itself enables the plot rather than acting as a tangible constraint on Lyra's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, an active force rather than a backdrop. The "towering labyrinth of shipping containers" directly creates the complex, "rapidly adapting" wind patterns that are central to the plot's only discovery. Details like the "smell of rust and saltwater" and the "oppressive" silence create a potent atmosphere, and the final image of the labyrinth receding in the mirror directly charges the story's closure, fulfilling the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's most powerful element. The ice cavern is not a mere backdrop but an active participant, resonating with the music and refracting light, which directly enables the story's central action. Details like the "luminescent fungi" and "crystalline structures" are vivid and purposeful, charging the final image and making the atmosphere tangible. The environment is indispensable to the story's climax and emotional effect.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    The atmosphere is a distinct strength, with evocative sensory details like "avalanchingly quiet" and "scent of sagebrush" establishing a potent mood. Crucially, two objects—the gilded reed flute and the driftwood markers—function as micro-settings that directly enable the central action and charge the final image. The environment is not merely backdrop but an active participant in the character's mystical journey, constraining her experience and defining the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is both atmospheric and functional, satisfying the 9+ gate. The "Topaz workshop" provides a tactile anchor with its "musty scent of old metal type," while the "star-filled sky" is not mere backdrop; its degradation—the stars vanishing—becomes the story's ticking clock and primary source of pressure. This integration of environment into the core conflict is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.1)
    The atmosphere is the story's great strength, with the "aurora-lit ridgeway" creating a potent sense of myth and liminality. The pendant, as a micro-setting/tool, actively constrains Eira's emotional state and charges the final encounter, making the environment integral to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is a significant strength, with evocative and specific details like the "quartz arbor," "shifted hush," and "frost-etched patterns on a nearby car window." The environment is active, not merely descriptive; the clearing of the mist directly mirrors and enables the mystic's revelation, charging the final image and making the atmosphere integral to the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is a significant strength, creating a palpable atmosphere of isolated melancholy that is essential to the story's initial tone. The environment is not static; the bamboo forest is transformed from a "barrier" into a "conduit," directly mirroring and enabling the protagonist's internal shift. Key objects like the amber bead and the jigsaw puzzle function as effective micro-settings that constrain attention and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is skillfully woven into the narrative, providing both sensory texture (scent of orchards) and thematic weight. While the floating rock arches don't constrain a choice within the main forging scene, they are not mere description; they are integrated into the character's philosophy and return to powerfully charge the final image of transformation and destiny. This purposeful use of a key environmental detail to enhance the closure satisfies the requirement for excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.2)
    The opening setting in the "abandoned spaceport repair bay" is effectively established with specific sensory details ("scent of rust and decay," "skeletal remains of starships"). The green glass shard also acts as a strong micro-setting element. However, the core of the story—the parallel universes—is rendered with extreme generality ("a succession of worlds," "diverse landscapes," "a kaleidoscope of images"), failing to provide any specific, grounding detail and thus squandering the potential of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is evocative and functional, with the dark sea, the silent lantern room, and the rocky shore creating a potent atmosphere of isolation and responsibility. Key objects—the sea glass and the stones for the cairn—are not just descriptive but become central to the character's internal process and charge the final image, fulfilling the requirement for a setting that constrains or enables choice.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest element. The emerald lighthouse is not just a backdrop but a crucial tool that enables and constrains the central action. Details like the winding stairs and the beam piercing the darkness create a potent, otherworldly atmosphere that perfectly serves the story's mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Atmosphere is the story's greatest strength, with vivid, selective details creating a cohesive and mystical mood. The setting actively participates in the plot: the floating tea house provides the necessary isolation and perspective, and the "fading light" of the sun is the specific tool Kaito uses to trigger the story's climax, directly charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    The initial atmosphere of the stormlit tower is vivid and effective, using specific sensory details like "damp stone and ozone." The central object, the broken sextant, acts as a potent micro-setting that constrains the character's focus and charges the final image of its magical repair. The environment is a clear strength, actively shaping the story's tone and central action.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, creating a vivid, coherent atmosphere with "luminescent fungi" and shimmering plants. The "mica window" is not just descriptive but functions as a crucial tool, interacting with the protagonist's song to advance the plot. This integration of setting into action elevates it beyond mere backdrop, as it directly enables the story's central magical event.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is the story's strongest element. The secret library is more than a backdrop; it is an active force that enables the character's core method ("staying while leaving") and serves as the crucible for their internal journey. The atmosphere is well-established with specific sensory details, and the final image of Elys becoming "one with the silence" achieves a powerful synthesis between character and place, fulfilling the requirements for an exceptional score.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's greatest strength. The "secret tea house" of "woven vines and weathered wood" is a vivid and purposeful micro-setting that directly facilitates the character's internal journey. The setting acts as a sanctuary, constraining the emotional landscape and charging the final image as she departs. It functions as a "beacon of hope," directly shaping the narrative's central action and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is the story’s standout achievement. The "frozen library above the clouds" and its "quartz hush" create a potent and sustained atmosphere that perfectly complements the narrative's reflective tone. The central object, the magic lantern slide, functions as an effective micro-setting that constrains Elara's attention and charges the story's key moments, satisfying the 9+ gate test for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.5)
    The opening establishes a strong, evocative atmosphere with specific sensory details like the "smell of saltwater and desperation." The watch fob functions effectively as a "micro-setting" object that constrains the central confrontation when The Shadow recognizes it, charging the final image. However, the broader setting, while atmospheric, does not apply direct pressure on the character's choices beyond being a location for the events.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is evocative and purposeful, with the lavender bluff and aurora borealis creating a potent atmosphere. The key object, the tin compass ring, functions as a micro-setting that directly constrains Aria's choices, vibrating and physically guiding her toward the climax. This integration of object and environment to drive action is a significant strength, charging the final moments of the story effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.2)
    The subterranean crystal cave is an exemplary setting, functioning as an active force rather than a backdrop. Its luminescence, vibrations, and humming are integrated directly into Elara's creative process, guiding her hand and mirroring her internal state. The setting decisively charges the final image, with the lock's transformation into a crystalline object tying the story's resolution directly to the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.5)
    The initial world-building is evocative, with memorable details like the toxic sky and mutated orchids creating a strong atmosphere. However, the setting primarily functions as a backdrop and fails to constrain the protagonist's choices in a meaningful way. The "treacherous tunnels" are mentioned but not dramatized, leaving the environment's potential as an active force largely untapped.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting successfully establishes a mystical, ethereal atmosphere, with the Whispering Bluff and the kinetic sculpture serving as strong visual anchors. However, the environment remains a backdrop; it provides tone but never constrains choice or applies pressure. The details, while consistent, are often abstract ("mystical energy," "celestial harmonics") rather than specific and sensory.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is a significant strength. The "glass-domed enclosure" is not just a backdrop; it actively constrains the action and heightens the atmosphere by "amplifying the flames," creating a palpable sense of claustrophobia. This environmental pressure directly shapes the central conflict and charges the final image of the renewed farm, making the setting integral to the story's symbolic logic and emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "vibrant courtyard at dawn" provides a pleasant, atmospheric frame at the beginning and end. However, the setting is largely descriptive and does not constrain choice, apply pressure, or become integral to the plot's unfolding. It functions as a static backdrop for serenity rather than an active element in the story, such as influencing Emilia's investigative tactics or charging the final image with specific, irreplaceable detail.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sunken laboratory provides a consistent, moody atmosphere with effective sensory details like the scent of "saltwater and decay." The setting's strength lies in its micro-elements: the spider’s web functions brilliantly as both a metaphor and a ticking clock that constrains a choice. However, the broader laboratory setting remains a passive container, failing to impose specific, tangible obstacles that Aria must overcome, limiting its overall impact on the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.2)
    Setting and atmosphere are exceptional and the story's greatest strength. The "salt crystal growing chamber" and the final subterranean cavern are not just backdrops; the massive, pulsing crystal is the agent of the climax itself, directly enabling the story's resolution. The imagery of "gleaming silence" is vivid and perfectly integrated, charging the final beats with an ethereal quality.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is a notable strength, with vivid, selective sensory details creating a potent atmosphere. The "nocturnal haven" is well-realized and integral to the tone. Crucially, the crane's origami wing functions as a charged "micro-setting" or tool, and its use—particularly its final release into the brook—directly constrains and defines the final, resonant image of closure, satisfying the high-band requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is a significant strength, with the rooftop garden, city lights, and meteor shower creating a "magical glow" that is integral to the story's atmosphere. The meteor shower is not just scenery; its peak coincides with the story's climax, charging the moment of revelation. The antique desk seal acts as a potent micro-setting, constraining the initial focus and charging the final image as it is passed from tutor to student, embodying the transfer of knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "velvet garden at twilight" establishes a strong, melancholic atmosphere that supports the story's tone. The seashell functions effectively as a micro-setting that constrains Lyra's attention and drives the plot. However, the garden itself remains largely a backdrop, not an active force that pressures or alters choices.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, rendered with evocative and purposeful sensory detail. The marble sanctuary, the aurora, the dripping stalactites, and the scent of parchment and rose perfume create a powerful, almost sacred atmosphere. More importantly, the 'heritage rose thorn' acts as a micro-setting element that constrains action (pricking her) and is thematically recharged in the final image, fulfilling the 9+ criterion.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    The atmosphere of the "serpentine nexus under starlight" is powerfully rendered and sustained. The whispering seashell half functions as an excellent micro-setting; it's a tool that is not static but changes in response to Aria's song ("seemed to grow warmer"), directly mediating her climactic perception. This integration of object and action elevates the setting beyond mere backdrop and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is a distinct strength, with the "candle-lit shrine carved into the ice" creating a potent, ethereal atmosphere. Sensory details like the "flickering flames" and "scent of melting ice" are effective. Crucially, the key object—the melted snow globe—functions as a micro-setting that directly triggers the climax and charges the story's final image, meeting the high-band criteria by being indispensable to the story's central turn and thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story excels at creating a rich, consistent, and evocative atmosphere. Sensory details like the "whispering parapet," "soft mist," and "flickering lights of fireflies" are vivid and purposeful. The primary weakness is that the setting and key objects, like the tea whisk, serve as a beautiful backdrop but never constrain choice or apply pressure, preventing the environment from becoming an active force in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.0)
    The concept of a "wasteland orchard" thriving amid radioactive storms is intriguing and establishes a strong initial atmosphere. However, the setting primarily functions as a backdrop. Details like "twisted rows" and "creaking branches" are generic, and the mentioned dust storms fail to constrain Aria's choices or tactics in any meaningful way. The environment sets a mood but does not become an active force in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    The initial setting of the "stormlit observatory" and the recurring "cobalt glass portico" are strong, evocative, and purposeful. The portico, in particular, functions exceptionally well as a micro-setting, shifting in meaning from a frame for isolation to a symbol of achieved vision, thus charging the final image. However, the wider world remains an abstraction ("the land"), preventing the setting from exerting any concrete pressure on the plot beyond its atmospheric contribution.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "feral loft" is a strong micro-setting, with its grime and dusty relics effectively reflecting the poet's internal state of neglect and forgotten dreams. Key objects, like the music box and glass jars, are central to the action and directly charge the story's closure. The final-paragraph introduction of "the dunes" feels abrupt and unearned, a slightly jarring expansion of a previously contained and potent space.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, moving beyond mere atmosphere to become an active participant in the plot. The "marina's unique sonic signature" is the central challenge, and the recurring motif of the creaking ice effectively tracks the protagonist's internal shift from feeling fragility to comfort. This direct constraint on action and charging of the final image is exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is a significant strength, with vivid, purposeful details like the "basalt sanctuary" and "magnetic viaduct." The viaduct is not just scenery; it is an active element that hums with energy, reacts to the protagonist, and is the undeniable focal point of the climax. This integration of a key object-as-setting decisively charges the final image, fulfilling the requirement for a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is the story's strongest element. The subway tunnel is rendered with specific, evocative sensory details that create a potent atmosphere. Crucially, the setting constrains the character's focus, and a key object within it—the lantern—and a detail etched on the wall ("Free at last") are indispensable catalysts for Maya's internal journey, directly charging the final thematic resolution. The micro-setting of the lantern itself functions exceptionally well.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, creating a potent, resonant atmosphere that is both a refuge and a catalyst. The clockwork heart functions as a powerful micro-setting, constraining the chaplain's thoughts and charging the final image. The sensory details—ticking, whirring, glinting brass—are selective and purposeful, directly supporting the story's thematic core and making the environment integral to the chaplain's internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is evocative and establishes a strong, unique atmosphere with details like the acid sea and the gears-and-cogs workshop. Key objects like the kaleidoscope and the arrow tip are integrated into the character's process and the story's symbolic structure. The environment successfully charges the final image, where the "less menacing" acid sea reflects Zephyr's internal shift, yet it falls short of actively constraining choices or applying direct pressure on the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    The atmosphere of the "labyrinth of servers" is effectively established early on, creating a palpable sense of history and mystery. The setting provides a strong tonal foundation and is integral to the premise. However, it functions more as a compelling backdrop than an active force that constrains choices or directly charges the final image, preventing it from reaching a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    The atmosphere is well-established, with effective sensory details like the "crisp and still" air and the "scent of old wood and dust." The setting is integral to the plot; the orchard provides the problem (the crystal fragment) and the lighthouse mirrors provide the solution. This direct constraint on action, where a specific tool in the environment is necessary for closure, elevates the setting beyond mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.0)
    The drift-ice marina is an exceptional setting, functioning as more than a backdrop. It is both atmosphere and crucible, providing the story's core activity (disaster relief) and its dominant sensory palette. The recurring image of the ice constrains the character's world and directly charges the final image of peace found amidst wreckage, fulfilling the 9+ quick test by being integral to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, rendered with evocative sensory detail that establishes a consistent, melancholic atmosphere.

The environment directly constrains and shapes the final thematic realization, making it integral to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting effectively establishes a mystical, atmospheric tone with details like sandalwood and murmuring whispers. However, the key environmental elements—the "conjured clearing" and "kinetic parapet"—are more symbolic manifestations of an internal state than tangible spaces that constrain choice. While evocative, the setting serves atmosphere primarily, rather than pressuring the character's actions in a concrete way.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, with the juxtaposition of the lavender field and factory ruins creating a potent, memorable atmosphere. Sensory details are vivid and integrated, directly serving the central theme of beauty in decay. The environment is not just a backdrop but the primary source of the story's meaning, charging the final images of the vines reclaiming the walls.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.3)
    The atmosphere is superb, with the "shadowed library" and its "suspended hush" creating a palpable sense of isolation that contrasts effectively with the "crisp" air of the outside world. The crystal functions as an excellent micro-setting; it constrains action by shattering the silence when dropped and charges the final image by focusing the scholar's resolve. This integration of object and atmosphere elevates the entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    The atmosphere is superb, with the fog sculpture garden acting as a dynamic force in the narrative. The setting is not merely descriptive; the fog's movement directly influences the prophet's focus and is essential to the story's resolution when it erases her work. This active participation, which constrains choice and charges the final image, is a mark of high-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting of a "lunar observatory above the clouds" creates an initial atmosphere of isolation, but it's undermined by a critical world-building failure. The line "he was guided by the sound of a leaf falling from the nearby trees" directly contradicts the established "lunar landscape." This logical break shatters the setting's integrity and turns what should be a source of atmosphere into a point of confusion. The setting serves as a backdrop but rarely constrains or enables choices in a meaningful way.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    The atmosphere of the "radiant haven" is strongly established and consistent. Crucially, the setting is not merely descriptive; the "creak of the wooden floorboards" and other ambient sounds become integral tools for Lena's therapy. This integration of setting into action elevates the category, making the environment an active participant in the story's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting concepts ("nocturnal observatory," "floating isle") are evocative but function as a static backdrop. They establish a fantasy tone but do not constrain Lyra's choices, offer unique resources, or charge the final image in a meaningful way. The observatory could be a basement and the floating isle a remote mountain without altering the story's core intellectual conflict or resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    The secret garden is an effective catalyst, its atmosphere of "mystique" and "tranquility" enabling the protagonist's reflective journey. The micro-setting is dominated by the "changeling's baby tooth," which is not merely decorative but functions as a tool for introspection. The tooth constrains her attention and directly charges the final image, where it "seemed to glow with an otherworldly light," successfully meeting the high-band criteria.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, immediately establishing a potent atmosphere with specific sensory details ("damp earth and the faint tang of salt").

The soft luminescence filtering through the mist is a key environmental element that enables the story's central action and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest element. The abandoned data center turned moss garden is a powerful, specific, and resonant image that directly mirrors the theme of nature healing technology's ruins, and by extension, Aria's personal wounds. The "drip of thawing icicles" acts as a micro-setting that directly constrains her action (kneeling) and facilitates the story's pivotal encounter, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmosphere of the "feral nexus" is effectively established through the swirling mist and diffused light, creating a potent liminal space for the story's events. The spiral seashell fragment is a strong micro-setting element, acting as a focal point that anchors the novelist's initial state and later becomes a charged talisman. The setting is purposeful and directly enables the story's central turn.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is a notable strength, with the "verdant arbor at dawn" providing a lush, atmospheric backdrop that is well-realized through sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, vividly realized through sensory details like the "scent of damp earth and decaying leaves." The "withered orchard" within a "subarctic crater" creates a potent atmosphere of beautiful desolation. Crucially, the setting constrains and enables the action by providing the "discarded twigs and pebbles" for Aria's ritual, directly charging the thematic core and the final image of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is a standout success, with vivid, selective sensory details creating a potent atmosphere. More importantly, the cavern is not merely a backdrop; its luminescent crystals are integral to the protagonist's method. This direct constraint on action, combined with the way the environment charges the final image, demonstrates masterful integration of setting and plot.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptional, with evocative and specific sensory details like the "bronze grotto," "luminescent fungi," and "shingled hush." The environment is not just a backdrop; it is an active participant, enabling the weaver's work and becoming a vessel for the story's resonance at the end. The final image of the grotto humming with silence perfectly meets the criteria of a setting that charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is a significant strength, with the "rain-beaded skylight loft" functioning as a sanctuary that both isolates and protects the character, creating a potent atmosphere. The ash wood carving blank serves as an excellent micro-setting, a tangible object that constrains the character's focus and directly charges the final image of the completed carving. This integration of object and environment with the internal journey is exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, rendered with effective atmospheric details like "carnival smoke" and "faded letters."

The final image of the glowing terminal powerfully charges the closure, making the setting an active participant in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.1)
    The atmosphere is a distinct strength, with vivid and selective sensory details like the "soundless sanctuary" and the "crystal whispering forecourt." The setting effectively mirrors Elian's initial internal state of quiet solitude and is recontextualized by the sunrise and his newfound purpose at the end. The environment is not merely backdrop; it actively frames and influences the character's introspective journey, charging the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, establishing a palpable atmosphere of history and decay from the opening line.

The sensory details are selective and consistently support the story's quiet, introspective tone.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story excels in creating a palpable, immersive atmosphere. Sensory details—the lapping waves, falling snow, foghorn, scent of salt—are vivid and purposeful, establishing a tone of hushed mystery.

This object is pivotal, directly charging what should have been the final, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, with a vivid, memorable, and original core image ("suspended palace, anchored to giant stalactites"). Atmosphere is thick and purposeful, and the setting participates directly in the story's emotional arc ("the palace seemed to shudder and lurch, as if it too felt the prince's reverberating emotions"). The egg, a key micro-setting object, constrains the prince's actions and charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is a notable strength, with specific, evocative details like the "obsidian lagoon" and "volcanic beach" creating a potent atmosphere. The setting is not merely decorative; key elements like the black sand are integrated into the character's internal state and history, and the lagoon serves as a frame that charges the story's final image of earned peace. This strong connection between environment and interiority elevates the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is integral to the plot and stakes, with the "city of forgotten fountains" not just a backdrop but the object of salvation. The atmosphere of desolation is effectively established and provides a strong contrast for the resolution. The final image of the waters beginning to flow again directly charges the setting, fulfilling its role in the story's climax and theme of rebirth. While some descriptions lean towards the generic, the setting's function is powerful and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength, with a vivid, consistent atmosphere that reflects the protagonist's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is a significant strength. The "vanishing point gallery" and the specific details of the portrait—the porcelain mask, charcoal medium, powder-coated frame—are evocative and thematically resonant. The atmosphere of "somber marvel" is well-established and sustained, with the central art object charging the final contemplative image.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmosphere is the story's strongest element, with vivid sensory details of the sewer ("stench of rot and decay") and the "waterlogged tomb" of the city. The setting effectively establishes a mood of desolate contemplation. The chronometer cog serves as a strong focal point, but neither it nor the broader environment actively constrains a choice or fundamentally charges the final image, keeping the score out of the highest bands.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    The atmosphere is the story's greatest strength, with vivid, selective details creating a sanctuary-like mood.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is visually evocative with its "lightning collection tower" and "nectar dusk glow," successfully establishing a specific atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story excels at creating a serene, mystical atmosphere. The initial description of the bay and the perfumer's shop are evocative and purposeful.

The environment actively drives the narrative forward, making it integral and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    The atmosphere of the "mysterious lighthouse on a rocky island" is evocative and consistent, using strong sensory details like the "scent of salt and seaweed" and "musty bowels." The setting is not merely a backdrop; it constrains the action by hiding the yoyo in its depths.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is a significant strength, with the funhouse and its key objects (poster, clasp, mirror) effectively driving the narrative and creating a potent atmosphere of "decay and forgotten dreams." The environment directly pressures the protagonist's attention and choices, and the final image of the funhouse looming larger provides a powerful, charged closure. The specificity of the decrepit facade and musty corridors is well-realized.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is the story's greatest strength. The "orchard afloat on a circle of driftwood" is a powerful, original, and evocative image. The environment is not merely backdrop; it is the instrument itself, directly constraining and enabling the central action. The driftwood circle and branches are essential tools, and the final image of this "tiny, shining jewel" powerfully anchors the story's resonant closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central concept of a city on gargantuan turtles is fresh, and its details, like shell-etched patterns, are integral to the plot's inciting incident. The atmosphere of "sunwashed dread" is powerfully rendered, creating a potent tension between the bright environment and Lyra's internal state. The setting's absence in the final moments—the city dwindling behind her—effectively charges the final image by emphasizing her isolation and the scale of the unknown she faces.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story opens with strong, evocative atmospheric details, effectively establishing the station's decay with sensory specifics ("scent of damp earth and decay," "skeletal fingers"). However, after the initial setup, the setting becomes a passive backdrop. The ivy's personification ("press in," "relax") is a thematic gloss rather than a genuine constraint, so the environment never pressures or alters the character's choices in a meaningful way.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's greatest strength. The "submerged pavilion" is rendered with effective sensory detail, creating a palpable sense of stillness and history.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is evocative and establishes a consistent, ethereal atmosphere.

The basilica, in particular, acts as a recurring object that constrains Kaito's ambition and charges the final image with a sense of hopeful longing.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story establishes two contrasting atmospheres effectively: the visceral devastation on the ground and the sterile tranquility of the observatory. The geode crystal serves as the central object that connects these two worlds and is present at the closure. However, the observatory itself is a generic sci-fi setting that functions more as a necessary container for the plot than an environment that applies unique pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.1)
    The atmosphere is a significant strength, effectively juxtaposing ancient stone with modern technology to create a palpable sense of wonder. The setting is not merely descriptive; the observatory's star carvings function as a crucial plot device, directly enabling the protagonist's progress. This integration of setting and action is well-executed, though some descriptive language relies on familiar phrasing ("velvet expanse").

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.5)
    The setting is exceptional, moving beyond mere backdrop to become an active agent in the story. The atmosphere is dense and purposeful, and the specific detail of the "driftwood carvings washed up like skeletal fingers" directly catalyzes the story's central turn, satisfying the requirement for the environment to constrain choice and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is effective and economical.

This transforms the setting from a simple backdrop into an active component of the resolution, making the final symbolic weight of the poles feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is a significant strength, with the "underground bioluminescent lake" creating a potent and memorable atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is superb, with "choking beauty" and the scent of "damp earth and ozone" creating a powerful, specific atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is evocative, but its strength lies in the micro-setting elements.

These recurring objects directly constrain and enable the climactic action, charging the final image with their accumulated meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest element. The black sand beach, active volcano, and "whispering hush" of the waves create a potent, specific, and portentous atmosphere that is essential to the story's tone. The setting directly informs the central concept and charges the final image, functioning as an active presence that guides the character's perception and the story's thematic development.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting creates a strong initial atmosphere with the "luminous fort," "twilight," and "inky darkness." The half-painted sundial is an excellent, specific detail integrated directly into the plot. However, the broader environment remains largely a backdrop; it establishes tone but does not actively constrain the character's choices or pressure her tactics beyond the initial blackout.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is a significant strength, with vivid, purposeful details like the "aurora-lit horizon" and the "scent of salt and ozone" creating a powerful, otherworldly atmosphere.

The environment is inseparable from the story's central event.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, creating a powerful atmosphere that is inseparable from the character's internal state.

This integration of a setting element into the core action is a significant strength, charging the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, functioning as character, conflict, and symbol simultaneously. The "rusted library" is not just a backdrop but the central object that constrains the poet's choice, forcing them to act. The atmosphere of decay and potential is rendered effectively, and the setting directly charges the final image of rebirth, making it integral to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    The atmosphere is the story's greatest strength, with a vivid, surreal setting that feels cohesive and purposeful.

The ink well’s etchings return in the final glow, recharging the image, but the setting never physically limits her choices—she could have worked anywhere. Micro-setting (desk, parchment) is well handled; macro-setting remains atmospheric backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    Volcanic amphitheater is vividly sketched—damp earth, creaking stones, dappled sunset—and the breathing motif subtly reweights the final image. However, the setting never materially constrains Kaelin’s restoration tactics; it’s atmosphere more than obstacle. Micro-setting (chain in hand) is tactile but not choice-limiting.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    The attic’s sensory density (must, skylight glow, cooing) is selective and purposeful, constraining Emilia’s ritual space. The Mars chip and meteorite dust subtly mirror her alienation, charging the final gaze outward. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prism terrace operates as both spectacle and tactile labyrinth (“colors bleeding into one another”); the environment continually constrains viewpoint and steers footfall. Spatial poetics anchor each beat; however, final image relies on ethereal reunion rather than environment-locked choice, keeping it from 8.5+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Bioluminescent walls and “shadowseam wonder” create textured atmosphere, but the facility never constrains choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics; it remains backdrop. Sensory detail is vivid yet ornamental, lacking the integration that would push this into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Gleam, pool, crystal, mirror—tactile micro-world sustains POV wonder; geode walls directly generate the disappearing-path puzzle and final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Exotic naming without grounding costs it 0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.1)
    Tidal arcade is anchored early and revisited between acts; torchlight glint on stone and salt scent are vivid, selective. Bishop piece serves as micro-setting/object but never constrains a choice—only illustrates. Spatial choreography is clean; environment remains backdrop rather than obstacle or resource.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    The twilight garden is rendered through scent, lapping waves, and star gaps that literally guide the choreography. The moonstone cabochon functions as micro-setting, constraining her hand and later charging the final image. Spatial anchors hold; sensory selection is purposeful and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.1)
    Pearl Bay at dawn is vividly evoked through mirrored water, mist, and prism light. Sensory detail is selective and filtered by the glazier’s gaze. Setting does not actively constrain choice but supplies charged imagery that supports the reflective mood.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.1)
    The moonlit ridge is vividly rendered and filters through Kael’s exhaustion, guiding his gaze and footfalls. Yet the setting never materially constrains choice—no terrain obstacle, weather shift, or spatial limitation alters tactics. It serves atmosphere more than pressure, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.1)
    The grotto’s tide-polished surfaces and drifting light constrain Aria’s slow, seated ritual; the gauge’s soft blue pulse becomes a micro-setting that charges the final image. Selective sensory detail supports the serene upheaval tone without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.4)
    Ivy-veiled passage and cold hearth are evoked with selective sensory detail, but neither constrains a pivotal choice or charges the final image. Setting remains atmospheric backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.1)
    “Prism parapet after rain” is vivid and returns in the final image, reweighted by the painter’s triumph. Spatial anchors arrive by line 3. Yet the terrace itself does not constrain action; it is backdrop rather than tool.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.1)
    The terrace and midsummer heat are vividly sketched (“worn stone seemed to hum”), but they function as backdrop rather than constraint. The ebony clipboard is the only object that charges the final image; the terrace itself does not force a choice or alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.7)
    Salt flat’s cracked geometry literally underfoot mirrors the social rupture she repairs; sensory filters (dry crunch at sole, mineral sting in the rain) track with emotional pressure. Weather evolves from portent to active force, integrating with her choices. Micro-setting serves closure without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.1)
    Silver courtyard, snow, and prism are vividly selective; prism’s facets reflect starlight to mirror internal change. Environment constrains mood and supplies the transformative object. Sensory detail is filtered through the courtesan’s heightened perception. Final image of prism sanctuary as “beacon of hope” recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dome gains texture through selective sensory cues—“ghostly sentinel,” “meteor hush”—that modulate with Amaranth’s calm. No prop or architectural element constrains a final tactic; the campfire stick returns in satchel only as talisman, not lever.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.9)
    Grotto rendered with lush, selective sensory detail; the moth wing and knotted thread function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Environment guides action—twigs and leaves become signal structures—so setting constrains choice. Still, the grotto’s rules never test or limit Aria in a costly way.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    The icebound sanctum is more postcard than crucible until the aurora’s light “infuses the sanctum” and the rope’s hum charges the final image. Micro-setting (the rope as instrument) constrains her method and thus the outcome. Sensory selection is purposeful, filtered through her craft priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The vine-draped bunker and storm supply texture and ticking clock, but neither constrains a pivotal choice nor charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid yet ornamental; the wafer seal’s glow is the only object that re-weights meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.1)
    The palace is evoked in selective, sensory strokes—“crumbling frescoes whispered tales,” “twilight halls”—that filter through the astronomer’s awe. The tile itself becomes micro-setting, constraining the final gesture; its etched symbols glow and guide the covenant. Spatial anchors are clear early; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.2)
    The sanctuary is atmospherically sketched (“soundless…serene oasis”) but remains a backdrop; it neither constrains Elara’s tactics nor charges the ending. Spatial anchors are clear, yet the setting never becomes a crucible. The broken music box reappears as symbol, not functional object.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is thick, selective: “morbid perfume,” “twilight frost shimmer.” Fog and orchard remain backdrop rather than active constraint; the mirror itself becomes the micro-setting that charges closure, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    The cathedral-orchard is tactile and specific—stone columns, rafters, birdsong—and the ribbon-as-micro-setting constrains Elara’s ritual gesture. Spatial choreography stays clean; only the orchard’s sudden pilgrimage influx feels off-stage, slightly diluting the environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.7)
    “Astral orchard” and “lonely asteroid” are specific and atmospheric; the bathroom micro-setting constrains the breakthrough, but the orchard itself never limits choice or reappears to charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.8)
    Mountain-sized bookstore is vivid in hyperbole but distances Elara tactically; no shelf or aisle constrains a single pivotal choice. Lighting and texture drift toward catalogue; the final chamber is shown rather than navigated through embodied proximity or physical risk.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    The fog-shrouded carnival ship is evoked with sensory precision (“scent of decay,” “rickety rollercoasters”) and functions as a metaphorical crucible for memory; however, the Garden itself appears only as a postcard image, not constraining the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    The clock-tower mechanism room is evoked with selective sensory cues—echoing steps, ticking gears, shifting shadows—that create atmosphere and mirror the temporal distortion theme. However, the setting never materially constrains choice or supplies resources that alter tactics; it remains scenic backdrop rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    Harmonic caves, echo chamber stone, and ice cracks are vivid, selective, and filtered through POV. The stone’s glow and the shift to “gentle luminosity” constrain the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is coherent; no exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.5)
    The glass pavilion hums and glints with tactile specificity; the broken prism and orrery act as micro-settings that constrain choice. Sensory detail is selective, though “sweet scent of thistle” edges toward cliché. Setting subtly guides movement via star charts etched on walls.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stormlit observatory and crystal forecourt are vividly rendered; rain-refracted lightning and wet stone anchor mood. However, the setting constrains no tactical choice—the crystal could be any luminous relic—so the 9+ gate is missed.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lantern glow, bloom pigments, and spinner arc all constrain sight-lines and fuel imagery for fireworks sketches; micro-setting is tactile and selective, satisfying 8.0+ gate. The mosaic tile itself functions as an object constraint, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.9)
    Starlit grotto anchoring via salt/seaweed drip and damp stone grounds body in place early. Details (shadows, jade cicada, faint hum) return in closing image and constrain chronicler’s seated stillness; spatial choreography between figures and chronicler remains coherent for word count.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    The xenial trellis is vividly sketched—“latticework of gardens and pathways suspended above the clouds”—and the floating objects during inversion anchor the scene spatially; however, the setting constrains choice only atmospherically, not tactically, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    Drifting prism terrace is vividly rendered and filters every perception. Micro-setting (storm glass vial) constrains no choice but recharges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true; light and water guide mood. Spatial choreography is seamless; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    The orchard’s iridescent bark and cybernetic birds are vivid, but they remain backdrop; only the ruby flake’s light actively guides choice. Spatial choreography is clear, yet the environment never constrains Aria—she walks unimpeded. Final image of twin suns is lovely but doesn’t reweight the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sanctuary’s ashen charcoal palette and starlight are vivid, selective, and mirrored in the keeper’s mood. The doorknocker ring and flickering flame function as micro-settings that constrain choice. A hairline slip: “loaded emptiness” leans abstract, blurring the sensory edge at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bioluminescent farm is vividly sketched—sweet fungal air, soft blue-green glow—and the lab’s hum and whirr ground the fantastical premise. Spatial choreography stays coherent; the mushrooms’ glow intensifies at the end, charging the final image. However, the environment does not actively constrain choices; it serves more as atmospheric backdrop than tactical crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sepia reading room is vividly textured—“aged paper,” “golden shadows”—and the gramophone crank handle functions as micro-setting that constrains the final act. Spatial choreography is coherent; the room’s atmosphere evolves with the standing waves, charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    The greenhouse is vividly evoked—“leaves rustling with otherworldly energy,” “glass walls ripple like a pond”—and the mystical orchard directly supplies the energies the knight channels. Spatial anchors are clear early. The setting constrains the final act by coalescing into the shimmering entity, charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    The foster-care file room is vividly evoked through sensory selectivity (“musty smell,” “accumulated dust patterns”), and the button functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; environment subtly guides her tactile discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.1)
    The auric lagoon is vividly evoked—“shimmered with an otherworldly glow,” “luminescent orbs”—and its quiet lapping sound mirrors the covert mood. However, the setting never physically constrains choices or supplies resources; it functions more as luminous backdrop than active pressure. The reeds “guard secrets” metaphorically but do not alter tactics. Micro-setting (the key) is handled but not leveraged.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prism atrium and mist are vivid, selective, and return in the final image to reweight the scene’s calm. Dewdrops, crystalline facets, and curling fog create tactile pressure that guides the saxophonist’s stance. Environment constrains acoustics and visibility, directly shaping the act of playing.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.0)
    Moonlit arbor supplies micro-setting pressure—seed husks become tools, treetop height limits movement—and charges the final glow. Specificity anchors stakes without overstretching length.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    The subterranean waterfall, damp earth, and decaying greenhouse are vivid and selective; the greenhouse’s “swirling leaves” and “scent of decay and rebirth” mirror Elian’s internal shift and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.1)
    The foundry is evoked with selective sensory detail (wet earth, molten metal) that filters through Elara’s alchemical priorities. The zodiac coin functions as micro-setting, constraining her attention and later glowing to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; weather affects mood but not tactical choice. A touch more specificity about the foundry’s layout would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Echo Gorge’s mist, waterfall, and harp notes are vividly selective and filter through the collector’s practiced calm. The gorge functions as both comfort and workplace, constraining her path to the waterfall. The final image of the forgotten tooth reweights the setting as a repository of secrets, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ultraviolet forest pulses with consistent sensory energy and mirrors Elara’s internal state, but it never physically constrains her choices or supplies resources that alter tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent; the clearing is well-anchored. Atmosphere supports theme yet remains backdrop rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.9)
    The alchemist’s market is richly sensuous and spatially anchored; the fragment itself becomes micro-setting that constrains Lena’s grip and gaze, charging the final image. A hairline slip: “city rooftops” remains slightly generic, preventing the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.1)
    Ticket-office relics provide tactile props that guide Ezra’s fingers to hidden compartment; ceiling fluorescents “like skeletal fingers” physically mirror descent into past. Setting stays live—dust trail on counter literally steers discovery. Could sharpen one spatial constraint (locked door) to hit 9.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glass orchard library is vividly rendered—crystalline spires, refracted light, swirling clouds—and the frost patterns on panes become a tactile tool. However, the setting constrains choice only implicitly; the library’s resonance is described rather than exploited for stakes. Spatial choreography remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)
    Baroque asteroid is rendered through tactile, lived detail—dust on facets, luminescent air—that constrains movement and mood. The shard functions as micro-setting, charging the final image. Sensory selection mirrors interior narrowing under pressure. Spatial choreography is coherent; no static repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.5)
    Resonance chamber is evoked through tactile sound (“air vibrated with whispers”) and tool-specific detail (“luminescent orbs”). The golden chip and music box serve as micro-settings that constrain Erebus’s choices. Sensory hierarchy is biased to auditory and luminous, matching POV. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no static exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    Subterranean lagoon is vividly evoked—petrichor, luminescent fungi, glassy water—yet it remains backdrop; it does not physically constrain her choices or reweight the final image. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, but the setting never pushes back.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.7)
    The storm-worn archway is a tactile presence, dictating shelter and the type of debris Aria seeks; however, it doesn’t materially tighten her final choice. The lantern slide does, however, so overall the setting is vivid and contributory.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    Amber pavilion, autumn chill, and cathedral glass are atmospherically vivid. Select sensory detail—glinting etched panes, fading warmth—integrates with Luna’s hush. However, none of these micro-settings or objects actively constrains a tactical choice; they color mood more than they tighten options, so the 9+ gate (environment must constrain choice) is missed. Highest credible score within band.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.7)
    The zeppelin library is richly sensed (“aged paper,” “soft hum”), and the obsidian lagoon’s mirror-like surface reappears to frame the final image, charging the mood. Spatial anchors are immediate and stable; bodies and objects track cleanly. The setting’s influence on choice is suggestive rather than concrete—no door locks or altitude problem shapes tactics—so it falls short of the 9+ gate. Still, the atmosphere is integral and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    Paper-lantern cove is atmospherically rich—scent of decay, shifting amber reflections—yet the lanterns only “seem to grow brighter”; they never physically constrain or enable the alchemist’s next move. Micro-setting (the bottle) is present but static, so environment doesn’t quite charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    The orchard-garden atop a skyscraper is vivid and specific, filtering perception through scent, lantern-glow, and leaf-rustle. Spatial anchors are consistent; the wax cylinder functions as micro-setting that absorbs emotion. However, the garden never physically constrains the scribe’s actions—its role is atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.1)
    Icebound atrium and starlight are evocatively sketched, but the glass panes never constrain action; the thaw is backdrop, not obstacle. Micro-setting (acorn cap) does charge the final image, lifting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.1)
    The windblown sanctuary is evoked with crisp, selective sensory detail; the cathedral bell and shifting microclimate function as micro-settings that constrain Ember’s choices and charge the final image. A few stock phrases (“gentle whisper of the breeze”) keep it from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.1)
    Station is evoked with selective sensory detail—soft hum, golden glow, velvet dark—filtered through the janitor’s hushed attention.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    The beekeeping oasis is rendered through precise, POV-filtered detail ("stained glass box," "honeycomb fragments") that constrains the recluse’s movements and charges the final image. Environment is both backdrop and tool.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.1)
    The emerald silo and the cracked clock are vividly sketched and return in the final image, but they serve more as atmospheric backdrop than active constraints on choice; the capsule itself is the only object that meaningfully narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.1)
    Cobalt lagoon, wet sand, drifting mist are vivid and selective. The drake feather returns in the final image, charging closure. However, the setting does not actively constrain choice; it serves as backdrop rather than obstacle or resource. Micro-setting (feather in hand) qualifies but lacks causal bite.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stone pillars, orchard scents, and copper wire are vividly sketched and filtered through caretaker attention. The setting subtly guides action—copper on oak is spatially precise. However, the temple’s “living stone” remains atmospheric backdrop; it never constrains a choice or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is vivid and selective—rain-slick stones, encroaching vines, bronze quiet—yet only the tower’s threshold actively gates the final moment. Micro-objects (fly amber) do constrain attention, but broader environment remains backdrop rather than tactical obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    Jetty, dying reef, twilight petals are lush but mostly scenic; seed pods and terrain constraints pollinate — seeds must be hand-scattered before dark, grounding stakes. Sensory blend (scent/music) reinforces motif rather than guiding choice. Specificity earns 9-gate; final garden image re-charges seed ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.7)
    Scrapyard atmosphere saturates action without stalling it; the wax-orb, the tanker shade, and spring’s shimmer serve as micro-settings that guide and constrain choices—objects and place shape the final hushed image.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.1)
    The observation deck’s decay and the compass rose’s glow are tactile and selective; the gilded applique constrains the final choice by literally orienting Aria toward the unknown light. Spatial anchors are clear early, and the micro-setting (compass rose) functions as both prop and setting to charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Icebound spire, ozone-laden air, crystal chamber—vivid and selective. Environment guides movement and mood, but never constrains a choice or exacts a price. The sundial is a micro-object but remains symbolic rather than tactical. Final sky image is lovely yet doesn’t hinge on setting detail.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    The whispering gallery’s acoustics and chessboard’s missing pawns are vivid, selective, and thematically charged; they constrain the final stance crystallization. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The “nomadic penumbra” remains atmospheric rather than materially constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mountain-bookstore is atmospherically rich, its “vaulted ceiling” and “shadows like restless spirits” feeding tone. Yet the setting never physically constrains choice; it serves as backdrop rather than obstacle or tool. Micro-setting (the pedestal) does host the climax, giving partial credit. Sensory layering is strong but stays ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.8)
    The frozen village’s “wet earth and ozone” is filtered through the tutor’s exhausted attention; the tapestry border and labyrinth portal function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.4)
    Starlit signal station and wrecked landscape are atmospherically vivid, but the setting never physically constrains her path or resources; the censer foot serves as micro-setting yet remains inert, so the environment doesn’t tighten the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    Storm-battered orchard is vivid, selective, and mirrored in the psyche; the antique glass eye functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Weather and terrain pressure tactics without slipping into postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.9)
    Mist and salt arrive in vivid pulses, but they never materially confine or empower a choice. The dock stays decorative; the lighthouse functions only as thematic echo. No environmental detail is weaponized into tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    The blooming cavern’s scent and dripping water filter through Emilia’s map-trained attention, guiding her pattern recognition. The creek’s rising edge supplies a ticking pressure that, while not fully leveraged, charges the threshold moment. Spatial choreography is clear; the stone-map puzzle constrains her path.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    Cobalt and ember grottos are evoked with sensory precision (“fiery heart still burning bright”), and the setting’s lacy glow constrains the queen’s perception of menace. The environment subtly guides her final step, charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ember nexus’s warm pulse and salt breeze are vivid and selective, anchoring twilight without clutter.

The setting constrains mood more than choice, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.8)
    Cabin and scroll function as micro-setting; scroll constrains the act of writing and is recharged in final image. Woods remain generic backdrop; sensory detail selective but not choice-driving. Spatial choreography minimal—no impossible moves, yet no tactile navigation either. Lacks the 9+ gate of environment forcing tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)
    The water-clock shop is economically anchored—reservoir lapping, mist, soft ticking—and the midwife screw functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection skews visual, but the muted soundscape mirrors Elara’s olfactory absence. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt. The environment does not constrain a visible choice, capping Q3 just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.5)
    Platform, breeze, and scent anchors recur and finally cohere into the sunset tableau; sandalwood becomes a sensory constraint. Micro-setting drifts rather than pressures—anchor four gates only three are met.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    The archive’s “aged paper and forgotten melodies” are filtered through Lyra’s synesthetic attention; the perfume bottle becomes micro-setting that channels her intent. Spatial choreography is clean—bottle between volumes, glowing etchings—though the orchard remains a distant, static symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The temple library is vivid, selective, and thematically charged; its “sentinel” shelves and “aged parchment” scent constrain Aria’s solitude and focus. Micro-setting (dictionary as tactile object) reappears to charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    Horizon station and hydraulic clocks are sensuously anchored; the mantle clock key’s tactile return recharges the final image. Setting constrains mood and ritual, but never forces a tactical choice, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.7)
    The bioluminescent farm is vividly evoked and spatially coherent, but it remains atmospheric backdrop; the mushrooms never constrain her choices or charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through POV, yet the setting does not evolve with events.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rain-soaked library and subway seats are vividly sketched, but only the candle lantern’s mica pane recurs to charge the final image. Micro-settings (desk, train seat) constrain attention rather than choice. Sensory hierarchy is consistent with Elara’s academic lens.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    Subway tunnel and glass harmonica tones are vividly evoked and filter through operator’s lonely vigil. However, the setting does not materially constrain any choice or charge the final image; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    Jetty at twilight is vividly evoked—scent of flowers, lapping waves, fading light—and the locket photo functions as micro-setting that constrains attention. Spatial choreography is clean; weather and light evolve with the scene’s mood. However, environment never materially alters her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ivy-choked station is vividly sketched and mirrors Raven’s entrapment, but it never constrains a choice or supplies a resource. It serves as textured backdrop rather than active pressure. Strong sensory filter, yet lacks final leverage.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.1)
    Ultrasonic forest is rendered through synesthetic detail—trees “sang,” air “alive with scent”—and the compass ring’s glow becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial anchors are clear; world rules remain consistent. Setting constrains perception rather than action, so 9-band gate not met.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    The gravitational anomaly is rendered through sensory thickening—“air seemed to thicken”—and the pen itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.5)
    Moonlit harbor is vividly sketched and filters through the advisor’s selective attention (“luminosity taking on a new quality”). The vintage camera returns as a charged image at closure, reweighting memory. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive’s “aged parchment” air and fluorescent gloom are vivid and selective, anchoring early. The tapestry fragment returns to charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the single scene; however, the broader desert geography remains a postcard backdrop rather than a tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sound-wave garden’s petal-resonance and auric lagoon are vivid, selective, and filtered through Aria’s perception. The lagoon’s glow evolves from beacon to fading ember, charging the final image. Micro-setting—the metallic perch—constrains her drumming posture and thus the sound propagation. No spatial contradictions; the garden feels tactile and lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.1)
    Container labyrinth is vividly sketched—“salt and rust,” “flickering lights,” “shadows cast by the storm”—and the geomagnetic interference grounds the timeframe. However, setting functions mostly as backdrop; containers do not physically constrain choices or shape the final beat. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, yet the environment never becomes an active obstacle or resource.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.1)
    Cobalt dock, wet sheen, and shutter-shadows are vividly textured and return in the final image, but none constrains a choice or charges the closure. Micro-setting is atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt library and mist are evocatively anchored early and return in the final image, but they never physically constrain Elian’s choices; they serve mood more than tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.9)
    The sublittoral fringe is rendered with tactile economy—“weathered fishing boats,” “wooden slats” vibrating under whale song—anchoring who/where early. The scrimshaw’s glow and the whale-lit water function as micro-setting that constrains Kael’s choice to swim, charging the final image. One slip: “lunar light” appears suddenly without prior cue, a minor spatial wobble.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    Farmhouse, turbines, and bouquet function as micro-settings that constrain Echo’s choices; the bouquet on the mantle charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    Catacomb orchard is tactile and specific (“tree roots snaked between ancient bones”), and the burned tarot card functions as micro-setting that constrains her final choice. The environment’s shift from decay to blooming scent charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate, though the spatial choreography of the corridors remains lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.0)
    Quarry trailer is sketched with selective sensory cues—dust, rock smell, golden light—but setting remains backdrop; it never constrains choice or charges the final image. Objects (desk, phone, grille cloth) are more active than the larger space. Micro-setting suffices, yet fails the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.1)
    Magnetic arbor’s humming air and drifting clouds create sensory, active micro-setting; however, the physical forces never directly constrain her movements or shape crucial choices, so it charges atmosphere more than strategy.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tidal atrium is vividly sensorial—salt-laced air, lapping waves, moonlit shelves—and the bamboo creel’s tactile reprise in the last paragraph charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear; environment subtly mirrors the librarian’s fluid identity without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lighthouse, breeze, and chimes are vividly sketched and filter through the conscience’s selective attention; the hollow mirror shard functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial anchors hold; weather and time-of-day subtly mirror the thematic shift from night-certainty to dawn-nuance. One slip: “breezy lighthouse” is repeated almost verbatim, a minor cadence stutter.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting is evocatively anchored (floating rock, sycamore hush, lapping water). Magnetic grotto is mentioned but never physically constrains choice; it remains atmospheric. Micro-setting (pond rings) does guide lesson metaphorically, meeting 9+ gate partially.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.1)
    The canyon’s bone towers and echoing winds are vividly selective, anchoring who/where early. The arrowhead and skimmer surface act as micro-settings that constrain the final contemplative stance, though spatial choreography is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.9)
    The spire’s “icebound” corridors and “twisted, ethereal design” are tactile and constraining; the garden’s star-like flowers and glowing keystone anchor the final image. Selective sensory detail (crisp air, soft light) filters through Eira’s wonder. However, the spire’s physics-defying trait never limits her choices, keeping it below the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.1)
    Micro-setting (crippled hull, lantern glow across water) constrains choice and charges the ending image. Salt-tactile detail stays character-filtered; consistency holds.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.1)

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.1)
    Early anchoring—“floating rock dojo, soft hum of levitation engines”—plants spatial footing with sensory restraint. The brain jar recurs like a villainous object, its “haunting reminder” intercut with breath to bond décor to psychic weight. Micro-setting subtler: body on tatami mat is filtered by Kaito’s selective attention (jets, jar, heartbeat). However, none of these details later constrain a single decision or final image.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    Nocturnal brook and seed-as-micro-setting are vivid and selective. Seed returns in final image to charge closure, satisfying 9+ gate.

Setting constrains mood more than tactical choice, keeping score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    The echo chamber tunnel is more than backdrop—its acoustic properties literally enable the symphony and shape the final charged hush. Sensory detail is selective (worn grip, off-key wind) and filtered through Maestro’s ear. Micro-setting (leaf blower as instrument) constrains tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    Frozen garden and mist are vividly rendered and filter through the guardian’s perceptual bias. The statues’ shift from macabre to serene mirrors her internal reconfiguration, charging the closure. Pendant’s glow and mist’s thickness constrain her path, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ember nexus is more than backdrop; its sulfur stink and scorched earth constrain the alchemist’s breathing and tools, while the twilight’s frozen bloom charges the final image. Spatial anchors are present by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    The suspended radio-tower city is vividly sketched—“ozone and decay,” “creaking rusty metal”—and the gorge’s drop charges every step with latent danger. The Hollywood star fragment acts as micro-setting, its glint guiding Aria to the hidden chamber. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. One missed beat: the city’s former vitality is told, not tactically used.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    The spectral grotto is evoked with starlight, hum, and etched symbols; these details constrain Elara’s attention and guide her decoding, but they do not directly limit her final choice, so the 9+ gate is missed.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.1)
    Gallery is rendered with selective sensory detail—“old glass,” “fluorescent hum,” “swirling vortex”—that charges the final image. The space functions as micro-setting: proximity to mirrors and thread constrains her weaving and guides perception. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible positions. Atmosphere supports the theme without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.1)
    The benthic twilight and star-scattered abyss are vividly sketched and filtered through Lyra’s pedagogical gaze. Spatial anchors hold; the city’s outer rim and silted square are distinct. Yet the environment never actively limits or endangers the lesson; it remains backdrop rather than tactical constraint. The boat anchor chain is specific but inert—handled only by the camera, never by character choice.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mist-clad atrium is evoked with selective sensory detail—twilight hush, fog swirl, hearing-aid hum—filtered through Aria’s listening stance. Setting guides movement: pulses draw her, mist parts after her words. Yet the environment never constrains a choice or exacts a price; it mirrors mood rather than limiting tactics. Strong texture, but no 9-band constraint keeps it capped at 7.1.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    The seafloor facility and cable hum are vividly evoked (“steel walls covered in anemones,” “crashing hush”), but the environment never constrains her choices; it’s backdrop, not obstacle. The codex and gold fleck function as micro-setting objects, yet their integration is late and light. Still, sensory specificity is strong and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.1)
    Setting is vivid, selective, and thematically charged; the towers of bone and kinetic bird-shadows constrain perception and guide the translation task. Sensory hierarchy reflects the POV’s priorities. The canyon’s echo-system functions as both environment and tool, directly shaping the final image. Meets the 9+ gate but lacks a single detail that physically limits the storyteller’s final move.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.1)
    Garden tunnels, damp earth, moss-covered stone, and the cordless phone create a tactile, olfactory micro-world that stays consistent. Spatial choreography is clean; Lena’s body and objects track.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt arcade’s neon and the alley’s shadows are sharply filtered through the mailman’s wary gaze, constraining his route and timing. The thunder-bottle functions as micro-setting, charging the final image; a stronger sensory anchor at the border itself would lift it to 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.1)
    Atmosphere is rich and selective—rusty wheels, halo glow, wind-bell chime—yet the circus train never constrains a choice; the oasis appears by author fiat rather than environmental logic. Sensory detail is vivid but ornamental; no object or setting state alters tactics or charges the final image beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    Setting is sensory ("soft glow of reading lamps," "scent of old paper") and atmospherically cohesive, but its influence on choice remains diffuse—no locked doors, no deadline, only ambiance. Early orientation clean by line-5; the library never materially constrains the librarian’s tactical options, so it charges the image but doesn’t steer it.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Archipelago and heirloom palette are vividly etched, but only the palette is handled twice; the islands stay postcard-lovely and never constrain a choice or charge the final image. Sensory selection is biased toward the visual; haptic or olfactory cues could have grounded the ritual more.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.7)
    Atmosphere is lush and selective—starlight, gnarled tree, ribbon—yet the micro-setting (tree branch) does not actively constrain the locksmith’s tactics; it serves more as symbol than obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sunken orchard and shipwrecks are richly sensed and filtered through Emilia’s gaze; the greenhouse constrains movement and the glowing mushroom charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear, but the setting does not force a choice that forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.1)
    Library and playground swing are evoked with selective sensory detail; the shard-mirror and tea cup function as micro-settings that constrain the archivist’s precise movements. Final image of the empty cup recharges the motif, though the swing remains atmospheric rather than choice-shaping.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.7)
    Verdant parapet and waterfall are vividly rendered, but they function as static backdrop rather than constraint; the waterfall’s shift to “shimmering veil” is evocative yet does not alter Aria’s tactics or charge the final image with new stakes. Sensory detail is lush but undifferentiated by urgency; the setting never pushes back.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prism sanctuary, starlight, and the net create a tactile micro-setting; the net’s fibers literally constrain her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.1)
    Airship cabin, hopscotch board, and starling murmurs are vivid and selective; the hopscotch board constrains the decoding choice. Micro-setting (phrasebook, charts) functions as lived-in tools, though the final image does not hinge on a specific environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    The frozen library above the clouds is vividly sketched—“frost-encrusted doors,” “icy shelves and glittering frost”—and the setting’s cold materially slows Kael’s movements, but it never forces a trade-off or directly constrains the final choice; specificity is high, functional pressure moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    The orchard planet’s lushness and floating rock arches are sketched with sensory economy; the arches become gathering sites, grounding social ritual in physical space. The butterfly garden and watering bell serve as tactile micro-settings that echo the larger transformation. Details are filtered through communal wonder rather than individual perception, keeping the lens coherent. Environment constrains action modestly—paths must be carved, energy channeled—but never threatens.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.7)
    Hidden lighthouse at dusk is evoked with selective sensory strokes; glass pane and lantern room constrain movement and amplify hush.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    The obsidian lagoon and volcanic beach are rendered with selective, sensory economy; the black sand pouch functions as micro-setting that constrains her tactile ritual and reappears in the final breath, charging the closing image. Weather and tide remain consistent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.5)
    “City of forgotten fountains” is more epithet than lived environment; nevertheless the dry basins, dusty streets, and hidden chamber ground the quest. The geese motif recurs to charge the doorway, satisfying micro-setting use. Still, the fountains only awaken off-stage; they do not physically constrain Aria’s final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    The nebula garden is rendered with lush, selective sensory detail that filters through the POV’s cosmic preoccupation. Spatial anchors are clear early; the “quiet sigh of falling petals” recharges the final image. Environment constrains only atmospherically, not tactically, keeping it just shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.1)
    The greenhouse’s mist, scent, and lunar sheen are selective and POV-filtered; the headstone and ribbon act as micro-settings that anchor memory. The final butterfly cluster charges the image, but the environment never actively constrains her choice—she simply sits in it.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.1)
    Obsidian ridge’s salt spray and rocky torque constrain footing and mood; the tower’s pendulum arc anchors space. Micro-setting—the cracked rake handle—functions as prop that Elara physically manipulates, tying reflection to action. Sensory specificity is selective, avoiding catalog, and the final lunar glow recharges the ridge’s darkness. Enough to satisfy the lower 7+ band but not the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is vividly textured: cobalt silo, starlight, lavender dust. These details create atmosphere and subtly guide the gardener’s ritual, but they do not constrain a final choice or charge the closure image, keeping it just shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    Obsidian spire and frozen lake are vivid, selective, and serve as constraint that “drives their work.” Micro-setting (quill, velvet box) charges the final image. Spatial anchors clear; environment subtly guides choice.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ember alcove, radio dial glow, and mist are vividly selective and filter through Emilia’s focus. The dial’s “secretly luminous face” constrains her attention and later dims to mark closure. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome. Micro-setting (desk, dust motes) functions as pressure vessel.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    The vanishing point gallery is sketched with selective, atmospheric strokes—“powder-coated surface,” “somber tones”—that filter through Lena’s perception. The charcoal dust itself becomes micro-setting, constraining her action and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Details serve mood rather than tactical constraint, keeping it just under the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sewer’s rot, the “watery grave” of the sunken city, and the cog’s tactile presence are sharply filtered through Kael’s priorities; the micro-setting (cog in hand) constrains attention and mirrors his mental state. Spatial anchors hold. However, the ruins never exert causal pressure on his choices; they remain backdrop rather than active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.1)
    Velvet library and autumn leaves are vividly filtered through Emilia’s musical priorities; the zither-as-micro-setting constrains her tactile choices. However, the environment never actively narrows options or supplies a resource that alters the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    The greenhouse is rendered with textured decay and fragrant specificity—“rusted metal beams corroded by time”—and ultimately houses the sprout that constrains the closer choice, satisfying the micro-setting bar.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.1)
    “Nectar dusk glow” and “hum of machinery” create a coherent sensory envelope. The tower and beehive are sketched but do not physically constrain choices; the lacquer box is a token, not a tool. Atmosphere supports theme yet never becomes a functional obstacle or resource.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bay, shop, and house perimeter are sketched with selective sensory detail; the orris root shard functions as micro-setting that constrains Eli’s ritual. Spatial choreography is clean, but the environment never actively resists or limits her, keeping the score just below the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    The underwater garden is vividly rendered (“coral and anemones swayed like ballerinas”) and filters through the statue’s stony perception. Spatial anchors hold; decay and renewal are textured through sensory detail. The garden’s state constrains the statue’s final stance, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stairwell is consistently rendered through sound, shadow, texture; the dice become micro-setting in the palm. While environment never constrains bodily danger, it exerts thematic pressure that reweights the ending image of endless ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rooftop greenhouse, smog, and moonlight are vividly filtered through the painter’s selective attention; the moon-tipped brush functions as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture. Sensory hierarchy favors sight and touch, justified by the visual art context. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible moves. The environment subtly mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto’s damp air, luminescent fungi, and frozen chamber are sensory and specific, anchoring the tour. However, the environment never constrains Elena’s choices; it serves as backdrop rather than obstacle or tool. The bread sculptures finally charge the final image, but the setting itself remains largely atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.4)
    “Rocky island,” “musty bowels,” and “flickering candlelight” give tactile anchors, yet the lighthouse never constrains action; it’s backdrop. Salt scent and seaweed are atmospheric but don’t shape tactics or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    Funhouse atmosphere is vivid—decay, glow, cracked mirror—but the setting never constrains a choice or weaponizes its geography. Sensory detail is strong yet ornamental; the mirror could be anywhere.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is lush, selective, and filtered through prophet’s synesthetic perception. Driftwood circle and orchard constrain movement and supply resonant surfaces; final image recharges the motif. Micro-setting (mallet, branches) functions as extension of body and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.1)
    City-on-turtles is vividly sketched early and the cracked shell functions as micro-setting that enables the map reveal. Sensory detail is selective (sunwashed streets, shell patterns) but occasionally generic (“the air was thick with tension”). Setting guides choice only at the shell crack; otherwise backdrop. Meets 9+ gate partially—shell constrains one beat but does not charge final image.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    The station’s damp rot and ivy are vivid and selective, but they never constrain Emilia’s choices; the ivy merely “seems to relax” at the end, a decorative echo rather than a force that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.1)
    Submerged pavilion is vividly textured—“silt and aquatic life,” “warm orange glow”—and the inkwell serves as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture. Sensory hierarchy aligns with professional gaze. Environment guides the only physical choice (retrieve, then relinquish), charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Library’s “reclaimed stillness” is filtered through Elara’s senses and constrains her to silence and slow motion; the stamp as micro-setting object charges the final beat. Selective sensory detail supports mood without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    Floating tea garden and lantern filigree anchor early; the glass basilica’s glint reappears to charge the final longing. Micro-setting of silk threads and misty depths constrains movement and mood, integrating sensory detail with emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.1)
    The drone-strike wasteland and the humming Observatory are sharply opposed, each filtering through Amira’s stunned senses. The geode crystal functions as micro-setting, its facets “reflecting the dying light” and later “vibrating,” constraining her focus and guiding the hunt. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    The observatory’s dusk light and stone carvings are selective and purposeful, guiding Lena’s eye and drone sensors; the “brilliant dimness” motif recurs to charge the final image. Setting constrains choice only implicitly—no spatial or social pressure alters tactics—so it stops short of the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.3)
    The cobalt terrace, watch hand, and driftwood carvings are vividly rendered and filtered through the POV’s melancholy. The terrace’s “lunar glow” and the carvings’ “skeletal fingers” constrain mood and mirror internal stakes. Yet none of these micro-settings physically limits her next move; they serve atmosphere more than tactic, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.1)
    The parapet’s mist and wind are vivid, selective, and mirrored in the emotional hush. Weather constrains visibility and speech volume, shaping the hushed delivery. The antique pull functions as micro-setting, but its materiality never alters a tactical choice; it remains symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.0)
    Coastal launch and utility poles are sketched with light sensory detail. The poles finally constrain choice (new method), but the setting never exerts physical pressure or hazard; water and weather remain backdrop. Micro-setting (kayak, paddle) is handled competently.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bioluminescent lake is vividly rendered—“mist-shrouded,” “ethereal glow”—and the baseball’s inner light ties object to setting. Yet the environment never constrains Lena’s movement or choices; it remains backdrop rather than pressure. Spatial anchors hold, but specificity does not charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.1)
    The orchard’s moonlit lantern-fruit and spice-scented air are vivid and selective, filtering through Lyra’s perception. However, the setting never physically constrains choices; it serves as atmospheric canvas rather than tactical obstacle. Spatial choreography remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.3)
    The midnight glade above clouds is atmospherically vivid—mist, moon, ozone—yet functions more as mood than constraint. The dolls’ saucer and hand-tracing book act as micro-settings that do charge the final image: the crack reframes time’s fracture. Sensory selection is biased toward the cartomancer’s mournful attention; no spatial contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.7)
    The recycled ship is evoked with tactile diction (“worn metal and faded wires,” “scent of aged paper”), but never constrains Aurora’s choices or the closure image; details are sensory wallpaper rather than tactical leverage.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    Black-sand beach and volcano are vividly sketched and return in the final image, but they never physically constrain Aria’s choices or charge the closure; the setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.1)
    The luminous fort at twilight and the blackout are atmospherically vivid, but the setting never constrains the sentinel’s choices. The cradle’s glow is a backdrop, not a tactical factor. Spatial choreography is coherent; the sundial’s shadows are the only detail that guides action.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.1)
    Setting is selective and purposeful: the tidal bluff, aurora, and painted rocks constrain placement and ritual motion; the “borrowed dawn” tone modulates from wonder to earned stillness. Micro-setting (rocks, stardust) charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.1)
    The stormlit observatory is tactile—wind, lightning, altitude—and the darkroom timer’s ticking threads through body and storm, constraining the vigil’s rhythm. Spatial choreography is clean; the setting charges the final image without ornamental overload.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass atrium and brook are vividly anchored and return in the final image, but they remain backdrop rather than constraint; no tactical use of light, glass, or water shapes the duel. The sundial’s coded angles are described but never exploited spatially. Sensory detail is selective—gleaming arm, gurgling brook—yet the environment never narrows options or charges the final image. Micro-setting (needle card) is handled twice, earning partial credit.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rusted library steps, moonlight, and dawn are vivid and selective. The library itself constrains the final action (it must be rebuilt), satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible moves. Sensory detail is mostly visual; other senses underused.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    “Tidal arbor above the clouds” is vivid, selective, and tonally consistent; mist, wet stone, and ozone filter through the pianist’s grief. Yet the setting never physically constrains her choices; it’s atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure. Final mist return reprises the opening image, earning a modest reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ridge in bloom is rendered with selective, sensory strokes—“sweet scent,” “warm sunlight”—that mirror Aria’s mood. Micro-setting (seedling, soil) constrains her daily labor, but the environment never materially limits her choices; it mostly serves as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.3)
    The breezy, post-rain islet is evoked through salt scent, wet earth, and lapping waves; micro-setting (rock, shore) constrains Kaito’s ritual. Compass and lace function as charged objects that guide and then release memory. Details are selective and POV-filtered, though “cerulean” edges toward palette cliché.

    Bioluminescent lake functions as micro-setting: its glow guides Lena’s epiphany about dim light = empathy. But sensory detail leans visual-heavy; "ethereal/otherworldly" clichés dilute specificity. Final image charged by lake’s pulse, yet tool (baseball) doesn’t constrain choices.

    Orchard's rare spices constrain ritual success and charge closure; scent motif evolves from Aria's arrival to spirit manifestation, making environment indispensable to the final image's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Midnight glade's ozone/mist functions as micro-setting—constrains perception during the hand-tracing memory, charging the final image of "cloudbound memories" with atmospheric cost.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Kwan Yin's Tear constrains choice (happiness affecting weight) and charges final image; storage bay's aged paper scent mirrors emotional decay. Micro-setting (photographs as tools) actively shapes tactics during stitching climax.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.3)
    Volcanic black sand beach creates vivid atmosphere, yet setting functions as decorative backdrop rather than constraint—rumbling volcano exerts zero pressure on choices. Misses 9+ gate: environment fails to charge final image or narrow tactics. Sensory details (waves, sand texture) are selective but don't alter Aria's actions or the bottle exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.6)
    Vivid twilight/fort imagery functions as backdrop but doesn't constrain choices; cradle's light charges the ending image yet environment remains decorative rather than tactical. Misses 9+ gate for active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.1)
    Vivid sensory details (salt/ozone, aurora glow) anchor the setting early, but the tidal bluff never constrains choices. Stardust and rocks function as micro-setting yet fail to charge the final image beyond decorative symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stormlit observatory creates vivid atmosphere but fails to constrain choices—wind doesn’t threaten the envelope or force adaptive movement. Darkroom timer recurs but functions only as passive symbol; its ticking doesn’t alter tactics or charge the final image beyond thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    The danish tin sewing needle card charges the final image through tactile recurrence, yet the glass atrium remains postcard scenery; environmental pressure on choices (e.g., brook's sound affecting concentration) is implied but never concretely constrains tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rusted library details evoke decay/resilience ("rusty hinges creaked"), yet setting never constrains choices—broken furniture is a "canvas," not an obstacle. Final dawn image resonates but lacks causal tie to earlier specifics; coffee tin's "false bottom" is ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rich sensory detail fails 9+ gate: no environment/tool constrains choices. Film reel mechanics matter but arbor remains postcard backdrop. "Wet stone and ozone" scent lacks causal role. White-room syndrome in film realm undermines spatial coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sensory details (blooming flowers, insect hum) are vivid but decorative; ancient ridge never constrains choices or supplies resources affecting outcome. Monsoon's arrival alters atmosphere but not tactics—Aria's work concludes identically regardless of rain, failing to charge the final image with environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.1)
    Atmosphere vivid but decorative; compass/lace never constrain choices. "Cerulean regret" is label-heavy, missing micro-setting pressure that could charge the final image.
