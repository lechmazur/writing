  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.1)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse is described vividly in the opening and returns intermittently, but it never constrains a choice or charges the final image—Maria moves through it without the environment altering her options. Sensory detail is present ("scent of damp earth," "grimy panes") but remains decorative. The butterfly wing and dust function as thematic objects rather than spatial pressures. Micro-setting standard is not met; the environment supplies atmosphere but no tactical friction.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.8)
    The canyon setting anchors space and time cleanly, and sensory details (frost patterns, starlight, crisp air) are vivid and purposeful. However, the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome—frost "guides" her walk but does not alter tactics or charge the final image with concrete pressure. Micro-setting potential (body, ledger strip as tool) remains ornamental; the strip is unrolled and pondered but does not impose spatial or tactile friction that shapes her decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.7)
    The winterglass conservatory is vivid—frosted panes, tropical plants, automated light spectrum—and the setting constrains the scene spatially. The heat-map device and tuning fork case are handled on the page, charging the final collaborative moment. However, the environment does not force a tactical choice or alter the protagonist's options; it remains a backdrop for the emotional arc rather than a pressure that shapes the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.1)
    The underwater library is vividly sketched with "dusty tomes," "ornate device," and "luminescent creatures," but these details remain postcard-descriptive. The environment does not constrain a single tactical choice—navigation, object handling, and restoration are all recounted in summary. The broken lens clicks into place without spatial friction, and the "impossible spaces" are occupied off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.1)
    The terra-cotta arbor and ridge setting are anchored early with sensory detail (warm orange glow, lanterns, blooming flowers). However, the environment remains decorative; it does not constrain choice or supply resources that affect outcome. The midnight food runs and cottage are mentioned but not spatially choreographed or integrated into pressure. Spatial grounding is competent but the setting does not charge the final image or alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.1)
    The viaduct's wisteria and stone arches receive vivid sensory treatment and the twilight ambiance is sustained. However, the environment remains postcard backdrop; no spatial feature constrains Aria's choice or alters her tactics. The camera obscura—her profession—is mentioned once without on-page use. The pilgrim's appearance and departure ignore spatial logic (no entry/exit anchors). Micro-setting credit: Kwan Yin's Tear is handled twice (pouch touch, final clutch) but does not materially shape a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.8)
    The living bridge garden offers vivid sensory details (chirping birds, blooming flowers, dappled shadows) that establish tone but do not constrain a single choice or alter tactics. The halo fragment is described as crystalline and glowing but functions as a passive prop. Spatial choreography is coherent within a single clearing, and the garden's transformation into "a realm of wonder" is asserted without mechanical grounding. The micro-setting option (the fragment as object-setting) is present but ornamental; it does not force a trade-off or shape the ending's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.6)
    The carnival prize redemption center is mentioned but never used to constrain choice or supply resources; it functions as a waypoint for a piano clue, then disappears. The vault itself is "heavily guarded" in assertion only—no spatial choreography of the infiltration appears. Sensory detail (sugar and smoke, dust) is generic and ornamental, never filtered through the liberator's professional or personal priorities. The dry soil that later flourishes is told in summary across untracked seasons.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.1)
    Setting anchors are vivid and early: "sunken orchard greenhouse, ringed by skeletal remains of shipwrecks," ashen forge under aurora. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it functions as atmospheric backdrop. The forge "seemed to whisper secrets" and "held a key" in declarative summary rather than dramatized interaction. Sensory details (colors, hum, creaking) are filtered through synesthesia but remain postcards; no tool, object, or spatial feature shapes the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.1)
    The emerald station and moonlight anchor the setting adequately. Sensory detail leans heavily visual ("soft, ethereal light," "silver glow") with little tactile or auditory grounding. The jar of moonbeams is described but never handled or used to constrain a choice; it remains a decorative object. Spatial choreography is minimal—Lumina moves "with the precision of a ghost" without legible proximity or effort.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.1)
    The abandoned control room is vividly rendered (cracked panes, dust-coated consoles, dripping water) with selective sensory detail. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Elian could craft the orb anywhere without narrative consequence. The glass orb itself is handled across beats but functions as symbol rather than spatial constraint. Spatial choreography is coherent, but the environment remains postcard backdrop rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    The rusted library under stars, dusty shelves, and dim light establish mood and anchor the scene spatially. The whispering seashell half and the smudged note on a child's cast function as micro-setting objects that guide attention and supply the decryption puzzle. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—the protagonist sits, deciphers, stands, and walks out without the setting imposing cost or friction. The seashell's "soothing hum" and the note's cryptic message shape the discovery beat but do not reconfigure options at closure. Sensory detail is present but leans visual and generic ("long shadows," "stars twinkled"); no scent, sound-texture, or tactile resistance sharpens the moment under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sensory detail is vivid and controlled: sandalwood, candle glow, storm sounds, textured darkness. The ridge fort and storm frame the opening and close, but neither constrains a single choice—the oracle walks out "into the darkness" with no spatial resistance or resource limit. The body, booklet, and shadows are described but never alter tactics. Micro-setting credit: the booklet glows and is clutched throughout, yet this presence does not shape the map-drawing or transform the silence.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.1)
    The frozen courtyard and ice-crystal violin are described vividly and recur across the text. However, neither constrains a choice or charges the final image with new pressure; they remain atmospheric anchors. Sensory detail (frost crunch, pale blue glow, whir of limbs) is selective and consistent with POV, but the environment does not tighten options or shape the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.1)
    The crystal forecourt and wet stone appear early and recur, but function as postcard backdrop rather than constraining choice or charging the closure. The lens is handled twice (clutched, raised to eye) yet its mechanics do not alter tactics or outcomes—it "transforms" the view in an abstract claim without spatial or perceptual specificity. Sensory detail defaults to generic (scent of wet stone, resonant hush) without POV filter or urgency modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.8)
    The garden maze setting is vivid and sensory ("scent of blooming flowers and the gentle withering of spent blossoms"), but it remains decorative rather than constraining choice or supplying resources that alter outcome. Spatial choreography is clear, and the "withering beauty" tone integrates with the flora descriptions. The marbles and vines are handled across beats, giving the piece a micro-setting quality, yet neither the maze's paths nor the garden's measurable luck pressures a decision on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.8)
    The research station is anchored early (laboratory, workstations, atmospheric simulator) and the simulator's mechanics (pumps, valves, holographic displays) ground the repair task. However, setting detail remains largely decorative: the simulator enables the nexus replication but does not constrain Kaelin's choices or alter her tactics under pressure. The planet's winged creatures and twilight atmosphere are mentioned but never pressure the closure moment. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=5.4)
    The flooded opera house and flickering lanterns create vivid atmosphere, and the water lapping against the viola grounds sensory detail. However, the setting remains largely decorative—the flood doesn't constrain Rachel's actions or shape her choices. The program's water damage becomes a plot convenience rather than an environmental pressure that forces tactical adaptation. Spatial choreography is coherent but the environment never meaningfully limits or enables the protagonist's path.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mountain weather station is anchored early with sensory detail (crisp air, ozone, metal grating) and the botanical illustration provides a recurring image. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; neither the weather patterns nor the station's physical layout constrains Aria's investigation or charges the final moment. The illustration returns at closure but as thematic echo rather than an object that alters tactics or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.6)
    The tunnel setting is vivid ("scent of decay and rust," "twisted and rusted" train cars) and consistently atmospheric. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—the explorer walks freely without obstacle or pressure from the space itself. The beaded valve wheel is handled twice (picked up, clutched) but remains ornamental; it does not charge the final image or force a decision. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("morbid perfume"), meeting baseline competence, but the setting functions as backdrop rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.1)
    The overgrown library and catacombs are vividly anchored with "dusty tomes," "flickering candles," "scent of aged parchment," and the obsidian refuge creates a memorable locus. Sensory detail is consistent and atmospheric. However, the environment remains largely decorative: it does not constrain a key choice or charge the final image in a way that alters tactics or forecloses options. The burrowing uncovers "hidden veins of crystal and ancient artifacts," but these discoveries do not shift the keeper's course or create tension.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sage Ridge is anchored early with sage-scented breeze, cicadas, and lunar glow; sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through Aria's calm professional lens. The eclipse environment charges the final image, and the keepsake curl functions as a micro-object with symbolic weight. Spatial choreography is clean (Aria seated, Eli beside her), and the setting supports the ritual's mood without imposing constraint or altering tactics. No occupational systems (music therapy techniques, instrument mechanics) appear to test choice, keeping the piece in mid-range for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.1)
    The silo library is anchored early and sensory detail is selective: "scent of old books and dust," "bronze quiet," narrow windows casting shadows. The fragment of the tapestry is handled physically ("carefully lifted," "clutched in her hand"), and the half-burned diaries are present as tactile objects. However, the environment never constrains a choice or charges the final image; the setting remains a backdrop rather than a pressure. The "bronze quiet" tone is maintained but does not evolve with any escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.1)
    The lighthouse and tavern anchor location early, and the wooden box holding the specs is tactile. However, the environment never constrains a choice or charges the final image—it serves as static backdrop. The stranger's satchel, the lighthouse door, and the night-to-dawn transition are present but ornamental. Spatial choreography is vague (the stranger "approaches," the room "shrinks") without clear blocking.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dimensional anchor, sandalwood/myrrh scent, and loop pedal establish place and tool early. However, the environment remains static postcard description—no spatial choreography, no evolving constraints. The palette's single blue color is mentioned three times but never handled or used to alter a tactic. Sensory hierarchy is absent; the POV does not filter details through professional or personal priority, and no setting element constrains a choice or charges the final image, capping the score below 7.0 per the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glass spire and frozen lake are vivid and consistently anchored, filtered through the writer's longing gaze. However, the environment remains postcard-static: neither location nor object constrains a choice or alters the final image. The nautilus shell is held and pulsed with "rhythmic energy" but does not pressure tactics. Sensory detail is present but does not modulate with urgency or reflect the character's professional priorities in a lived-in way.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.6)
    The viaduct's glow and mist establish atmosphere but remain decorative—no choice hinges on the setting's physical properties. "Labyrinthine corridors of her own mind" suggests interiority rather than spatial choreography, and the procedural generation remains abstract without concrete constraints. Sensory detail is generic (wet earth, ozone, puddles) and not filtered through the protagonist's priorities. The setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image, capping the score despite vivid adjectives.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cavern is vividly described with sensory specificity (damp soil, sweet wood, earthy magic), and the drum's vibrating surfaces anchor the setting texturally. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Aria's actions (touching the drum, humming) would play identically in any quiet workspace. The broken phonograph needle and scattered tools are catalogued but not used in ways that pressure decision-making. Micro-setting credit is limited because no object or spatial feature charges the final image or forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.1)
    The courtyard is anchored early with sensory detail (leaves, crickets, blooming flowers, stone pavement, fountain), and the setting provides a space for contemplation. However, the environment does not constrain any choice or alter tactics; it functions as backdrop rather than pressure. The message tube is handled (removed, examined, clutched), giving modest object-as-setting functionality, but the courtyard itself remains static description. The final image ("darkness seemed to recede") offers atmospheric resonance but no causal link to the protagonist's action.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=5.1)
    The terra-cotta grotto under starlight is described vividly and consistently, with tactile detail (rough stone, rust-red rocks, flickering light). However, setting remains postcard: it does not constrain a choice, supply a needed resource, or evolve causally with events. The stones she patterns could be anywhere; spatial choreography is coherent but inert. The environment does not charge the final image or alter tactics, capping the score in mid-band despite the sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=5.1)
    The sunken greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is vivid but functions as postcard backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The mendicant's bowl is handled twice (picked up, cradled), meeting minimal involvement, but its presence does not charge the final image with cost—it is merely "tucked into her pocket." Sensory detail (charred earth, blooming flowers) shifts arbitrarily to mood rather than POV priority. Spatial choreography inside the greenhouse is vague; we do not track where the violinist sits relative to the bonfire or storytellers.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.4)
    The amber grotto receives sustained sensory detail (luminescent stones, honey-like light, aged amber scent, warmth) and recurs throughout, but it never constrains a choice or charges the final image with pressure—it remains postcard description. The petal is handled twice (sensed, then packed), offering minimal spatial constraint. Micro-setting use is present but ornamental, preventing entry to the 9-band despite vivid atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.1)
    The breezy library under stars is anchored early and sensory details (sea breeze, musty scent, embossed letters) are filtered through Lena's professional lens. The setting enables the locket discovery and provides a backdrop for conversation but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The harbor reference ties setting to Lena's cargo-brokering but remains ornamental. Spatial choreography is clear; the starlit stroll provides atmosphere without pressing the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.1)
    The crystalline orchard and glimmering obsidian arbor are vividly named and provide atmospheric specificity. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it remains scenic backdrop. The street artist's tag is described but does not shape Kael's tactics or reweight the final image with pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=5.6)
    The rooftop canal and city towers are named and described but remain postcard backdrops; no environmental feature constrains Lyra's choices or alters her tactics. The pendant is handled twice (focused upon, then glowing) but does not function as micro-setting. Sensory details ("gentle lapping," "warm light of morning") are generic and do not reflect Lyra's professional illustrator lens or shift under pressure. Spatial choreography is vague—her descent and the giant's location "beneath their feet" lack concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cavern orchard with luminescent fungi, dripping stalactites, mosaic stepping stone, and moonlit ceiling is vividly rendered and sustains atmosphere throughout. The mosaic stepping stone constrains the ritual choice (kneeling, coaxing patterns) and the glass eyes recur with charged significance at closure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (scent of flowers, eerie stillness, vibration of energy). The setting charges the final image (trees looming, stalactites dripping) and the orchard's transformation from "ambiguous loss" to "realm of possibility" ties to the thematic arc, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint/closure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.1)
    Pipe chases, emergency lights, and hidden shelves are signaled early and recur with specificity. The tape reel fragment constrains one beat (the memory trigger) but does not alter a subsequent choice. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The "sapphire hush" and flickering lights charge atmosphere but do not pressure a decision at closure, keeping the setting functional rather than indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.1)
    The mossy trellis and linden leaf are described vividly in the opening beats and return in the final image, creating a purposeful frame. However, neither constrains a choice or alters tactics on the page—they remain symbolic containers for reflection rather than spatial or material pressures. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Emilia's professional lens, but the nursery itself never supplies a resource or obstacle that affects outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.1)
    The tidal island setting provides atmospheric grounding ("crumbling buildings," "overgrown streets"), and rain trails offer a purposeful tracking method. However, the environment rarely constrains choice—the painter wanders freely, and spatial choreography during the stranger encounter is vague ("doorstep," "lair" without concrete detail). The brooch as micro-object charges the final image, lifting the score slightly, but the island itself remains postcard backdrop rather than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.1)
    The musical crystal cave is vividly described (luminescent crystals, vibrational frequencies, overlapping shadows) but remains ornamental. Aria's descent and attunement are told in abstract terms; no on-page moment shows the cave's acoustics or geography constraining a choice or altering tactics. The cave pearl appears as a prop without physical handling across beats. The setting does not charge the final image or supply a resource that affects outcome; it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than active element.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ivory harbor after rain provides vivid opening sensory detail (mist, ocean-spray, weathered stones) and the Maritime Relics shop grounds the middle beat. The valve's brass surface and intricate etchings offer texture. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—installations appear via summary, and the revitalized harbor at the end is described rather than shown shaping the protagonist's final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=4.1)
    The starlit vault offers atmospheric gestures (mist, ethereal glow, twisting corridors) but remains a postcard backdrop that never constrains choice or alters tactics. Spatial choreography is vague—Emilia navigates "twisting passages" and "alcoves" without coherent positions or distances, and the phantom train ticket punch rests on "a nearby pedestal" whose placement and context are unexplained. The cracks in pavement forming arrows appear once without integrated spatial logic (pavement inside a vault?). No sensory hierarchy filters detail through urgency or professional bias; every description reads at the same ambient register regardless of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.8)
    The tower's latticework, sea views, and hidden compartment provide spatial grounding, and the whale migration offers atmospheric texture. Sensory detail is present (fog lifting, morning light, wind through beams) but largely postcard description—none constrains a choice or alters tactics. The tile's surface "shimmer[s]," the air "thicken[s] with an otherworldly presence," yet these remain ornamental mood-setters rather than micro-setting elements that pressure Emilia's decisions or charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prismatic escondite supplies vivid color-driven atmosphere ("swirling colors," "kaleidoscope of possibilities") and the solar storm provides temporal frame. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the colors dance and the storm rages without materially constraining Kael's choices or supplying a resource that alters tactics. Spatial choreography remains abstract—magnetic fields are woven and distortions created without grounding in physical consequence or proximity that matters to the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prep room anchors setting with formaldehyde, cold steel tables, and flowers, and the ink pot's "delicate curves and weighty presence" provides tactile specificity. However, spatial choreography is vague—Lena's position relative to the door, her father's movements, and the director's location remain unclear. The setting's funeral-home particulars (embalming equipment, lighting, acoustic details) are underused; the room functions more as backdrop than constraint. The ink pot does charge the final image, meeting the micro-setting threshold for mid-band placement.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.1)
    The bonsai labyrinth and mountaintop setting are vividly described with sensory detail (cherry blossoms, chirping birds, dappled light), but they function as backdrop rather than constraint or resource. The fluorescent lamp on a tree stump is spatially incongruous and its presence is never justified by world logic. The setting does not pressure a single choice or alter tactics; the stationer moves through it freely, collecting textures without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.1)
    The shipping-container labyrinth is vividly sketched ("rusty steel canyons," "faded labels") and the tides provide a recurring sensory anchor. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains postcard staging. The poison-bottle label is handled as static symbol rather than a tool or resource that affects outcome. Spatial choreography is coherent but ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.1)
    The observatory setting offers vivid images (crumbling domes, rusting telescopes) and the cliff-edge frame is consistent. However, the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome—it remains postcard description. The shift into "the whisper of closing pages" and "surrounded by ghosts of astronomers" lacks spatial grounding, creating white-room syndrome in the pivotal beat. The painted seashell is handled across multiple beats but its physical properties (vibrant colors, texture) do not alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.1)
    The raft city carnival is vividly sketched in the opening (music, smells, makeshift engineering) and returns in the final third as "a beacon of hope." The foundation stone chip is a concrete object that recurs and charges the graffiti motif. However, the setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains scenic backdrop rather than pressure. Spatial choreography (food stall, walls) is clear but static. The micro-setting allowance is not met because no object or space forces Ava's hand in a scene.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "moonlit summit" and "lunar flora" setting is described but internally contradictory: petals "swayed gently in the breeze" and "every molecule of air, or rather, the lack thereof" directly conflict, breaking world-rule consistency. Sensory detail (silvery glow, translucent petals, golden light of dawn) is generic postcard description that does not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics. The hourglass sand grain is handled twice (picked up, returned) but does not shape a decision. The setting provides backdrop without pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.1)
    The mist-coated depot and fountain are evocative and return at the end with the clearing fog, creating a lyric frame. However, the setting remains largely decorative: the depot's idle trains and rail context never constrain Emilia's choices, and the fountain serves only as a visual/thematic backdrop for the light-refraction method. Spatial choreography is vague (shop corner, workbench, "outside" mist) and the ship's harbor departure feels detached from the repair-shop interior. The body and tools (drone, fountain) are handled but do not pressure the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.4)
    The outpost and frozen lake are vividly sketched with sensory economy (crunch of snow, wood smoke, golden sunset glow). Spatial choreography is clean through the buildings and onto the ice. However, setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; the ice and outpost do not constrain a choice or charge the final image—Emilia walks forward unimpeded. Micro-setting (windowpane, phrasebook) is handled but does not alter tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ancient archway and cobblestones anchor place early and recur in the final image. The ebony tuning fork is held and hums, constraining the method. However, the setting remains postcard-static—no choice is altered by proximity, access, or environmental resistance. The fork's frequency "resonates deep within the earth," but this detail never narrows a tactic or charges a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.1)
    The underwater temple setting provides atmospheric anchors (salt, decay, crumbling stone, labyrinthine passageways) and the crystal orifice at the heart serves as the goal location. However, spatial choreography is vague—how Kael moves through passageways, what tools or physical constraints she encounters, and how the decaying infrastructure resists her work remain abstract. The perfume vial's light "guides" her, but this is told rather than shown constraining navigation choices. The setting does not visibly alter tactics or charge the closure image; it functions as backdrop rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lighthouse prison, reef, lattice, and copperlight are vivid and consistent, but none constrains a choice or charges the ending image—the boy merely walks and observes. Spatial choreography is clear (door → corridor → metal door) yet the environment functions as backdrop rather than pressure. The Q3 9+ gate (environment/object constrains choice or charges closure) is not met, capping eligibility at 8.8; actual execution remains mid-band due to lack of tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.1)
    The greenhouse's "luminescent orbs," "blooming flowers," and "endless night" establish vivid sensory anchors, and the carved stone bead functions as micro-setting. However, the environment does not constrain choice or alter tactics; the alchemist simply reaches out and claims the bead without spatial friction. The "over the hush of winter-cracked fields" tag appears twice but remains disconnected from the greenhouse interior. Occupational detail (transmutation, resonant awakenings) is mentioned but not shown through tool use or process that shapes the protagonist's moves.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.1)
    The labyrinth and canyon are described vividly in multiple passes but function as postcard backdrop rather than constraint or resource. Aria's workbench, the worn fabric, and the tide pools are mentioned but never alter a tactic or choice. The illustration plate sits inert on the workbench until it "seemed to glow" at the end—a decorative reprise without causal pressure. Spatial choreography remains clear; the setting's lyric specificity ("red canyon walls," "twisted tunnels") lifts the score above generic but does not reach the 7.0 gate requiring environment to constrain choice or charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.4)
    The catacomb orchard anchors early with vivid particulars: roots snaking between bones, dappled shadows, scent of blooming flowers and damp earth. The sundial base receives concrete attention (grooves, worn smooth stone). However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Maya works "tirelessly" without spatial or material friction. The tomb's "dark corridors" and "passageways" remain abstract; no object or micro-setting charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.1)
    The golden arcade at dawn is vividly evoked (neon glow, worn bench, sidewalk chalk) and the ebony clipboard recurs as a tactile anchor. However, the environment supplies no constraint or resource that alters Cipher's choices—the bustling crowd and clinking glasses remain backdrop. The clipboard's "otherworldly energy" is asserted decoration. Micro-setting (body, tool) is present but does not charge the final image or narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cobalt observatory and autumn air are named early, and the eternal candle recurs across beats. However, the setting remains postcard description—no environmental constraint shapes a tactic, and the chart's spatial mechanics (how adjacent possibilities translate to needle-work) are never grounded. The flame "dances" and "burns brighter" as atmosphere, not as a resource or obstacle that alters the embroiderer's choices at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.1)
    The mangrove labyrinth is richly textured—singing spirits, luminescent fungi, damp earth, twisted roots—but remains postcard description; no environmental feature constrains a choice or charges the closure image. The suspended windowpane arrives late, used once for the condensation effect, then mentioned in passing at the end. Spatial choreography is vague: "twisting waterways," "a clearing" with no distance, access, or tactical pressure. The setting supplies atmosphere but does not alter Aria's options.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.8)
    The atrium, mist, and twilight are invoked repeatedly but function as atmosphere rather than constraint or resource that shapes choice. The brain coral is handled and described but does not alter tactics. Sensory detail leans heavily visual ("pinkish-orange," "soft, ethereal glow") with minimal embodied perception or micro-setting pressure. Spatial choreography is vague—Kael sits beside an operating table yet no medical action occurs—and the child's cast appears as artifact rather than integrated object.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.6)
    The ruined orchard is vividly rendered with scent, fog, and gnarled trees anchoring the atmosphere throughout. Sensory detail is purposeful and layered, supporting the daydream-like tone. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters Lena's tactics at closure—she paints freely, unimpeded, and the fog swirls decoratively rather than complicating her work.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sound wave garden supplies vivid sensory anchors—tuning forks, water lapping, mirrors angling sound—and spatial choreography remains clear. The mirrors function as tools that Lena manipulates across multiple beats, grounding her actions. However, the setting does not constrain choice or pressure a tactic; Lena arranges mirrors without friction, and the garden's transformation feels consequence-free, lowering integration with the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.1)
    The greenhouse is anchored late and functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or charge the final image. The gourd rattle seed's "unique properties" and "subtle vibrations" are asserted but never shown affecting tactics. Spatial choreography is vague—plots, soil, and plant arrangements are described generically without micro-setting pressure. The entomologist role is ornamental; no tool or environmental detail alters Lyra's options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    The gargantuan shell and bioluminescent fungi establish a vivid, specific micro-setting. The shell is described as both prison and womb, signaling thematic weight, and the fungi pulse in response to the song, lending sensory coherence. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active participant in the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean, and sensory detail is selective and apt for the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=5.1)
    The opal library, glass orchids, and wind chime are described with vivid sensory detail ("sweet with the scent of old parchment," "filigree-like structures," "cracked bamboo tube"). However, the setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains postcard description. The micro-setting test is not met—no object or tool pressures the caretaker's decision-making. Spatial choreography is vague (the museum's "labyrinthine structure" and "forgotten landscape" are mentioned but not navigated).

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.1)
    The archive setting supplies atmosphere (aged parchment, luminescent orbs, shadows) and the glass ink well recurs with shifting significance. The ink well's near-empty state and "otherworldly light" at closure attempt to charge the final image, meeting the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography is minimal but coherent. Sensory detail skews heavily visual; the scent of aged parchment appears once and is not integrated into choice or perception under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.1)
    The amphitheater/volcano setting is vividly described with sensory detail (damp earth, moss, creaking stones, dripping water), but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the "breathing" building creates atmosphere, yet no environmental feature pressures a choice or charges the final image. The surveyor's chain is handled but does not alter tactics. Micro-setting potential (body, tool, object) is present but not leveraged for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.1)
    The vintage bookshop attic is anchored early with sensory specifics (musty scent, dusty skylights, cluttered papers). The setting provides atmosphere and houses the pigeons, meteorite chip, and skylight central to the ritual. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains backdrop rather than pressure. The dust motes under the skylight recur but function thematically (clearing her mind) rather than spatially shaping decisions. Spatial choreography is clear but static.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "drifting prism terrace" provides vivid sensory detail—prismatic colors, blooming flowers, insect hum—but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. No spatial choice depends on the terrace's layout, and the protagonist's navigation is unopposed. The father's corn-maze design and the wooden bench carvings are mentioned but never limit or enable an action. The setting modulates atmosphere without charging the closure, which occurs when the father simply beckons from the edge.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.6)
    The underwater research facility is named but never grounded in spatial choreography—corridors, a central lab, and bioluminescent walls float without distance, access logic, or tactical constraint. Sensory detail (bioluminescence, hum, shadows) is generic and repetitive, unfiltered by the astrologer's professional or personal priorities. The burnt feather and facility do not pressure a single choice; setting functions as backdrop only. No object, environment feature, or body constraint shapes the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.1)
    The iridescent cave and crystal geode are vividly described (shimmering pools, glittering facets, crystalline walls), but sensory detail remains static postcard description rather than constraint on choice. The crater glass is handled twice (fingers run over it, clutched at the end) yet never alters a tactic or decision. The seeds on the ground function as a passive trail marker, not an environmental pressure that forces adaptation. Micro-setting potential is present but unused; the geode never narrows options or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.1)
    Tidal arcade setting is anchored early with sensory detail (worn stone, torches, waves, stars). The bishop's chess piece receives textural attention and spatial tracking (pocket, props, torchlight). However, environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; it remains postcard description. The micro-setting test is not met—no tool, body, or object alters tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.1)
    The twilight garden, ocean, and stars are anchored early with sensory detail (night flowers, lapping waves), but the setting remains postcard decoration rather than constraint or resource. The moonstone cabochon and weathered stone are named yet never used to complicate or enable choice. "Obsidian grace" appears as a metaphor for movement without spatial consequence. The environment does not tighten decisions or charge the final image; Aria moves through it unimpeded.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.1)
    Pearl Bay at dawn is anchored with mist, water, and sky, and the prism atrium recurs visually. However, no environmental feature constrains a choice or charges the final image; the setting functions as backdrop for abstract contemplation. The ripples from the stone are described but do not alter tactics or supply a resource that affects outcome. Spatial choreography is minimal (standing at edge, turning to leave) and reads as generic postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.1)
    The moonlit ridge path is anchored early and sensory details (gravel crunch, silvery glow, velvet expanse) are vivid. The cracked porcelain box functions as a micro-setting object and appears in multiple beats, though it constrains no choice. Spatial choreography is clean. The moon and stars recur but remain ornamental; removing them would not alter Kael's trajectory or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.1)
    The grotto is vividly rendered with tide-polished stone, lapping waves, and filtered light, and the decorations (shells, pebbles, driftwood) are handled on the page. However, the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome; it remains atmospheric backdrop. The altitude gauge pulses with blue light but does not functionally shape tactics. Spatial choreography is clear, but the setting serves illustration rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ivy-veiled passage and fireplace provide spatial grounding, and the film strip/diaries anchor discovery beats. However, setting remains postcard description ("long shadows," "cold and dark hearth") without constraining a choice or charging the final image. The "climate shifts" mentioned twice never pressure tactics or alter the cartographer's access. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) is present but ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prism parapet and echoing terrace are named but remain postcard backdrops: no spatial choreography, no constraint on action, no tactile interaction. "Spring rain," "ancient mansion," and "mirrors on the walls" are generic placeholders without sensory hierarchy or POV-filtered detail. The parapet returns at the end as a "beacon of possibility" but does not constrain choice or charge the final image with earned pressure—merely decorative recurrence without functional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ancient terrace and midsummer sun are mentioned repeatedly but never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is absent—delegates arrive and depart without clear positioning or movement. The ebony clipboard appears often but remains a static symbol rather than a tool that shapes action. The "slow dance of celestial bodies" is described but never tightens a deadline or pressures a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=5.1)
    The salt flat receives vivid sensory detail ("cracked expanse," "dry earth crunched," "brittle, fractured sound") and the cracks function as a navigational map, marginally constraining her method. However, spatial choreography remains vague—her position, the water's source, and the mechanism of release are never grounded. The setting anchors atmosphere but does not force a tactical choice or charge the final image with specificity; the storm and landscape are backdrop rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.1)
    The silver courtyard and prism are described vividly but remain postcard backdrops. No environmental feature constrains a choice: the courtesan could untangle threads anywhere. Snow "continued to fall" as atmospheric filler; the prism "began to glow" as spectacle without altering her tactics or options. Spatial choreography is clean, but the setting does not charge the final image or supply resources that affect outcome, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.1)
    The decommissioned radar dome is established early and provides consistent atmosphere ("eerie calm," "dim, flickering light," "soft, ethereal light"), but it functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint. The dome's "uncommonly serene atmosphere" soothes rather than pressures, and no environmental feature alters Amaranth's tactics or choices. Spatial choreography is minimal—she sets up, works at an unspecified workspace, and leaves—without tactile engagement. The campfire story stick appears in her satchel but is never handled on the page in a way that involves the physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.1)
    The grotto is vividly described with sensory detail (flowers, insects, light, moss), but functions as postcard setting rather than constraining choice. No environmental feature pressures a decision or alters tactics. The moth wing, though recurring, remains ornamental; it is held and gazed upon but does not enable or complicate any action. Spatial choreography is clear, and the verdant imagery is evocative, yet setting remains decorative rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.1)
    The icebound sanctum and aurora supply vivid sensory anchors (candles, hiss/crackle, ethereal glow) and the ceremonial rope is handled across multiple beats. However, the setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint: no environmental detail narrows Akira's options or complicates her work. The aurora "seemed to grow brighter" and "pulsed in harmony" but this remains observational; the space does not pressure the task.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.1)
    The vine-draped bunker and rewilded forest are vividly sketched with selective sensory detail (damp earth, ozone, luminescent fungi), and the storm modulates from approach to zenith to subsidence in step with the dream journey. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Hindsight navigates "with ease" and the bunker supplies only atmosphere. The wafer seal and stone table are handled but do not pressure the protagonist's moves, keeping the setting in mid-band despite strong texture.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.1)
    Vivid atmospheric descriptors ("dusky harmony," "twilight and stardust") but the palace remains a postcard backdrop with no spatial choreography or environmental constraint on action. The magic square tile is described lyrically but never handled, manipulated, or used to shape a choice. Setting does not pressure tactics or contribute to the ending's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "soundless sanctuary" anchors location but remains generic; no specific sensory detail or spatial constraint shapes Elara's choices. The music box is described but not used as a tool—its broken pin does not constrain action. The "golden light" and "melody from the walls" are ornamental atmosphere without affecting tactics. Micro-setting elements (her seat, the audience's spatial arrangement) are absent, leaving choreography unclear.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ruined orchard and twilight frost establish mood, and the sextant appears as a concrete object with tactile detail ("brass surface tarnished and worn"). However, the setting never constrains a choice: the fog is backdrop, the undergrowth a discovery site without spatial consequence. The body and tool (sextant) are held but not used to alter options. The final image ("glass mountains… reflected in the mirror maker's masterpiece") charges closure with lyric weight, meeting the micro-setting allowance and lifting the score into mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.1)
    The orchard-in-cathedral image is vivid and present throughout, creating atmospheric continuity. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraining choices or supplying resources that alter tactics. The hair ribbon tied to a branch is a symbolic gesture without spatial or material consequence. Sensory detail remains generic ("soft chirping," "rustle of leaves") and does not filter through Elara's professional or personal priorities under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.1)
    The astral orchard is vivid and recurs with slight modulation (blossoms "shone like stars" at the end), but it does not constrain a curator choice or alter tactics—it functions as backdrop. The pistachio shell cameo remains in hand as a portable anchor, and the bathroom's "swirling patterns" are described but do not shape the curator's breakthrough. Spatial choreography is clear (grove → bathroom → away from grove), and the lonely asteroid frame is consistent, but setting primarily decorates rather than pressures the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.6)
    The bookstore is described in generic terms ("musty depths," "narrow aisles," "twisting shelves") without spatial coherence or particular sensory detail. No object, tool, or environmental constraint shapes a choice. The "unheard symphony" and "intricate carvings" remain ornamental. The Orientation Test penalty in Q2 caps Q3 at 7.0; execution debt lowers the score further.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    The abandoned carnival ship, fog, and bay anchor setting vividly with sensory specificity (decay scent, rusting corridors, rickety rollercoasters). Spatial choreography is coherent across decks and the hidden cove arrival. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining a choice or charging the final image—the ship's "decaying grandeur" mirrors theme but does not alter Lyra's tactics. The emerald card and leather-bound book serve as plot tokens without physical interaction that tests capability.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.1)
    The clock tower room is anchored early with ticking gears, dim light, and stone walls. However, the space never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it remains atmospheric backdrop. The rope's physical reconfiguration is described but its mechanics don't pressure the scene. Spatial choreography is clean, but the setting functions as postcard rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.1)
    The harmonic caves and the echo chamber stone anchor the setting with purposeful sensory detail (vibrations, luminosity, ice crack patterns). The ice examination constrains the mapkeeper's method and the stone's glow tracks her progress, giving micro-setting weight. The "hammered repose" tone and "gentle luminosity" at closure charge the final image. However, spatial choreography within the caves remains vague—she walks away from the stone at the end, but her movement and the cave's layout are not tracked across beats. The setting supports atmosphere and method but does not pressure a choice with visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.4)
    The glass humming pavilion is vividly rendered with sensory detail (vibrations, light refracting through crystal, sweet thistle scent) and recurs across beats. The star charts etched into walls guide the custodian's path, demonstrating spatial constraint. However, the environment does not force a difficult choice or alter tactics under pressure—it serves as atmospheric backdrop. The orrery appears at closure and sparks light, but the pavilion itself remains static decoration rather than a pressure vessel that shapes the final image or decision.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.9)
    The stormlit observatory and crystal forecourt are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (wet stone, ozone, refracted lightning). However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it serves as atmospheric backdrop. The shadow-length method is mentioned but never shown in granular action that pressures a decision. Spatial choreography (descent, central monument) is clear but purely transit.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.4)
    The blooming fortress and fire-spinner performance provide vivid postcard detail (kerosene rag knot, lanterns, foliage-hidden mosaic), but the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image with cost. Sensory selection is broad rather than urgent; the stroll maintains a touristic distance throughout. The micro-setting (mosaic note) briefly anchors a beat but does not shape tactics or recur with reweighted meaning at closure, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.1)
    The grotto under starlight is established early with sensory detail (salt, seaweed, dripping water, crickets) and returns at the ending. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it functions as backdrop for internal musing. The jade cicada is handled but remains symbolic ornament rather than a tool that affects outcome. Spatial choreography is minimal (cross-legged, seated, rising) and the setting does not pressure the chronicler's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.1)
    The trellis is anchored early (latticework above clouds, gardens and pathways) and the inverted gravity supplies a vivid sensory frame (objects float, golden light, expectant stillness). The porcelain doll hovers as a concrete image at the closure beat, lending micro-setting charge. However, the trellis itself never constrains a choice—Eli's journey is internal and the environment functions as backdrop rather than obstacle or resource that shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=5.1)
    The drifting prism terrace supplies vivid postcard description ("facets reflecting soft hues," "kaleidoscope of pastel colors") but never constrains a choice or alters tactics. Water lapping, wooden structures creaking, and the storm glass vial swirling are sensory catalog items that remain static across all beats. Spatial choreography is coherent (gondola → dock → terrace → dock) and the micro-setting (vial on chain) recurs, lifting the score into functional range, but the environment does not pressure the operator or charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.1)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall and iridescent orchard trees provide vivid imagery, and the setting shifts Aria's access (waterfall as entrance, staircase revealed by light). However, spatial choreography is vague—distances, proximities, and the mechanics of "peeling paint" are ungrounded. The orchard and staircase do not constrain tactics; they are backdrops traversed without friction. Because setting participates in one key turn (light reveals path) and supplies the closure location, it escapes the lowest bands but remains functional rather than essential.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight" and doorknocker ring provide atmosphere, but spatial choreography is vague—descent into "depths" lacks concrete anchors. The flickering flame at the heart constrains the keeper's final action, meeting the 9+ gate narrowly, but sensory detail is heavily visual and generic (starlight, grey, soft glow). The cap at 7.0 from Q2's orientation debt applies, limiting the score despite the flame's role in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.1)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm supplies vivid sensory anchors (sweet scent, ethereal glow) and the lab machines hum and whir, but spatial choreography within the lab remains generic. The submarine porthole bolt is handled twice (found, then touched in pocket) but does not constrain a choice or charge the final image in a way that alters tactics. Sensory detail is present but not filtered through Lyra's professional or personal priorities; the setting reads as backdrop rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.1)
    The sepia reading room is described with vivid sensory detail (aged paper scent, golden lantern shadows, tall windows) and remains spatially coherent. However, it functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no environmental feature narrows a choice or charges the final image. The gramophone crank handle is handled repeatedly but does not create tactical friction or a closure-specific charge beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.1)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is anchored early and sensory details (blooming flowers, mystical tang, glass walls, whispering trees) are present, but they remain largely decorative. The wooden snap is handled twice (grasped, unsnapped) and triggers a cascade, so it functions as micro-setting. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—trees lean in and walls ripple in response to the knight's actions rather than pressuring them. Spatial choreography is coherent but static; the knight wanders without environmental friction shaping their moves.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.1)
    The file room supplies concrete anchors (shelves, boxes, accumulated dust) and the infantryman's button functions as a micro-setting object. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; Emilia moves through the space without friction. Dust patterns are mentioned but remain decorative rather than shaping discovery or closure. The setting creates mood but does not charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.1)
    The auric lagoon is rendered with vivid sensory detail (shimmer, starlight, luminescent orbs, lapping water), and the setting is named early. However, it functions as backdrop rather than constraint: no environmental feature shapes a choice or alters tactics. The phone booth key and worn-leather map are described but never used in action; the clearing and reeds do not pressure the gathering or the ending. Micro-setting and object-as-setting tests fail—nothing about place or tool charges the final image or narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prism atrium and radiant grotto supply vivid, repeated images (refracted light, mist tendrils, dewdrops) that anchor the scene spatially. Sensory detail is selective and poetic, filtered through an elevated register. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it remains backdrop. The mist "responds" to music metaphorically but imposes no friction. Micro-setting use (the body, the instrument) is minimal; the saxophone is mentioned but not handled in detail across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.1)
    The arbor is described with vivid sensory detail (shimmering bark, otherworldly softness, misty clouds), but remains a static backdrop that does not constrain any choice or alter tactics. Spatial choreography is vague—she works "in" the arbor but her position, the layout of trees, and her physical interactions remain abstract. The moonstone speck and monuments are mentioned but never integrated into the environment as tools or obstacles. Setting does not charge the final image; it simply persists as atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.1)
    The subterranean setting, waterfall acoustics, and neglected greenhouse are rendered with sensory specificity ("scent of damp earth and mold," "swirling leaves," "glass panes cloudy with grime"). The greenhouse functions as a micro-setting where improvisation occurs, meeting the two-beat threshold and contributing to the ending's spatial frame. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=5.1)
    The foundry anchors early and recurs with sensory detail (wet earth, molten metal, rain), but it never constrains a choice or shapes tactics—it remains atmospheric backdrop. The zodiac coin is handled but does not alter action. Spatial choreography is minimal; Elara's movements through the laboratory are gestural rather than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.4)
    Echo Gorge supplies vivid sensory anchors—mist at ankles, damp earth, waterfall, distorted harp notes—and spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting provides atmosphere but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the collector moves freely and the environment never complicates her task. The crocodile's tooth and harp are described rather than handled in ways that change options. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) does not charge the final image, capping the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.2)
    The ultraviolet forest is vivid and recurs across beats, and its "pulsing light growing brighter" subtly pressures Elara's approach. However, spatial choreography inside the forest is vague—trees "twisting and writhing" without clear distance, proximity, or path logic. The clearing's "intense, pulsating energy" charges the conceptual climax but remains abstract; no tool, body constraint, or micro-setting detail alters Elara's tactics or final choice. The cap at 7.0 due to orientation debt in Q2 applies.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.1)
    The alchemist's market is named early and described with sensory specificity (sandalwood, myrrh, rooftops). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it functions as backdrop for Lena's reflective loops. The lighthouse lens fragment and paintings are handled but remain static props rather than environmental pressures. Spatial choreography is vague (stalls, canvases, vendors fade into background) and does not track across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.8)
    The abandoned ticket office is vividly rendered with faded posters, dusty stubs, and skeletal fluorescent lights. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (Ezra's observant gaze). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or charge the closure; it remains atmospheric backdrop. The mainspring barrel sits on a shelf and is handled, but spatial choreography of the hidden compartment and Ezra's physical engagement with the dust trail lacks concrete blocking.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.8)
    The glass orchard library, swirling clouds, and frost-patterned panes are vividly described and sustain a consistent ethereal tone. Setting details recur (glass structures, mist, frost) and the final prints are visibly tied to the morning-frost patterns. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains postcard backdrop rather than a pressure-applying force. Spatial choreography is coherent but the library floats passively, and the operator's interaction with machinery and prints is externalized ritual without felt friction or resource scarcity.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.7)
    The baroque asteroid with its ornate carvings, labyrinthine passages, and shimmering time-aura is vividly established and recurring. The shard and laboratory workbench anchor micro-setting. The storm and covered mirrors add atmospheric pressure. However, no environmental constraint decisively narrows a tactical choice in a high-pressure beat—the setting frames mood and discovery but does not force a tradeoff or enable a key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.4)
    The resonance chamber is vividly rendered with luminescent orbs, labyrinthine passages, and a palpable aura of "tinkersong wonder." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the craft. The golden chip glows brighter as a cue tied to the protagonist's work, and the chamber "vibrates in approval" at closure, charging the final image. However, the setting remains atmospheric backdrop; it does not constrain a key choice or alter tactics in a concrete way, capping the score below the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.1)
    The subterranean lagoon, luminescent fungi, and limestone cliffs are described vividly and consistently. Spatial choreography is clear (tunnels, water's edge, grotto), and sensory detail is selective (petrichor, lapping water, glassy surface). However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains postcard backdrop. The compass vibrates and points, but the grotto symbols are deciphered without obstacle, so setting serves atmosphere rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.1)
    The archway and shore are anchored early with vivid sensory detail (storm-tossed stones, tangled wreckage, stormy light). The setting supplies the slide but does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—Aria could have found the object anywhere. The micro-setting (body, tool) remains abstract: we see no tactile handling of driftwood or sculptural work that alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    Amber pavilion, cathedral window, and postcards anchor setting across beats and return at closure. The etched glass constrains Luna's quest visually but never alters a tactic or bars an option. Sensory detail is vivid yet ornamental—autumn hues, fading light, melting snow—filtered through Luna's perspective but not integrated into choice. The cathedral window charges the final image conceptually, lifting the score despite static use.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.1)
    The floating library and obsidian lagoon are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (aged paper scent, glassy expanse, sand dunes framing the window). Spatial choreography is clear (narrow aisles, rear window, floor patterns). However, setting remains postcard description: neither the zeppelin's motion nor the lagoon constrains a choice or charges the final image. The micro-setting allowance (Ada's debris floor) is visible but does not alter tactics or drive closure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.8)
    The paper-lantern cove and amber bottle provide vivid visual anchors, and the description of lanterns growing brighter creates atmospheric specificity. However, setting remains purely decorative—the cove does not constrain any choice, and spatial details (crumbling buildings, overgrown streets) are catalogued rather than integrated into action. The bottle is observed but never handled across the 800-word span, missing the micro-setting opportunity.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=5.1)
    The rooftop orchard atop a skyscraper is vividly established with lanterns, leaves, blooming flowers, and distant city hum. However, the setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint: no spatial detail shapes a choice, limits access, or charges the final image. The wax cylinder shaving sits on a bench and "absorbs" emotions in assertion only; its physical presence never alters tactics or the scribe's movements.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.1)
    The icebound atrium and starlight anchor setting early with vivid sensory detail (glass panes, melting frost, vibrating air). The cap's "intricate patterns" and the hum during the vortex sequence offer textural specificity. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—space and objects remain postcard backdrops rather than resources or obstacles that alter tactics. The final walk "into the unknown" and starlight "canopy" reprise earlier imagery but remain decorative rather than pressure-bearing at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.4)
    The windblown sanctuary is anchored through sensory details (crisp air, breeze whisper, wind patterns) and the cathedral setting provides spatial grounding. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric rather than constraining choice—wind and architecture inform Ember's experiments with the bell but do not pressure a key decision or narrow options. The bell itself (object-as-micro-setting) does constrain one choice (repairing the crack with glue, waiting for it to dry), lifting the score above mid-band, though the environment otherwise supports mood more than stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.1)
    The shooting star tracking station is named early but remains postcard-level: "dimly lit room," "various contraptions," generic "astronomical instruments." The yellow lantern glass sits on a desk and is relocated to "a place of prominence" with no constraint on action. No tool, environment feature, or micro-setting detail pressures a choice or charges the closure image; sensory detail is present but ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.1)
    The wasteland, oasis, hives, and stained glass box are vividly described with sensory specificity (ash-heavy air, grime-muted colors, labyrinthine metal and glass). Spatial choreography is coherent. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains a static backdrop. The box sits on a pedestal and is opened without friction. No tool, boundary, or physical condition shapes the recluse's actions or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.6)
    The emerald silo is named but never grounded in sensory detail, spatial layout, or functional constraints. Generic placeholders ("vintage clock," "damaged time capsule") appear without embodied handling or tactical pressure. Micro-setting allowance cannot apply when no object constrains a choice or charges the final image. The Orientation Test penalty in Q2 caps this category at 7.0, but execution alone merits mid-4s.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.8)
    The cobalt lagoon after rain anchors early and recurs throughout, providing sensory specificity (mist, wet sand, lapping water). However, setting remains postcard descriptive—it never constrains a choice or alters tactics. The feather, water, and dawn imagery supply texture but do not function as micro-setting that shapes the protagonist's single decision to walk away. The 9+ gate (environment/object constrains choice or charges final image) is not met; the lagoon is backdrop only.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.1)
    The orchard, living stone pillars, and copper wire are described with moderate vividness but remain postcard elements; none constrains a choice or alters a tactic. Spatial choreography is vague—no legible distances, no body-environment interaction beyond "walked through" and "wrapped." The 9+ gate (environment/body/tool constrains choice or charges final image) is not met, capping the category at 8.8 even if other elements were strong. Sensory selection defaults to generic "scent of blooming flowers" and "soft hum of insects" without POV filter or urgency modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.1)
    The rainwashed tower and overgrown sculpture path supply vivid, selective sensory detail (worn stones with ethereal light, tangle of vines, sweet scent of blooming flowers) that establishes atmosphere. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—the skeptic walks unimpeded through description. Spatial choreography is loose; the tower's interior/exterior relationship and the path's convergence with "a larger, more formal route" lack clear geometry. The fly amber pendant is described but never handled or used as a tool that matters to the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.1)
    The blooming jetty, twilight, and dying reef are mentioned but remain postcard descriptions without constraining choice or altering tactics. Spatial choreography is loose—horses are released to graze, coachman works the soil, then climbs back on the coach—but distances and layout are never made concrete. The seed pods and satchel function as props without tactile handling or evolving use across beats. Sensory detail ("sweet scent of blooming flowers") recurs as a static refrain rather than shifting with the scene's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.2)
    Scrapyard details (twisted metal, tanker truck, cracked earth, rust-and-decay kaleidoscope) are vivid and filter through scavenger-POV priorities. The spring functions as a payoff but does not constrain an earlier choice. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (rummaging, walking, cresting a dune), though the phonograph cylinder's location and use remain vague. Sensory hierarchy is present (Kael's nose, creosote smell, gravel crunch) but does not narrow under crisis pressure; the journey reads as travelogue rather than tactically inflected movement.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.4)
    The observation deck is anchored early with selective sensory detail (metallic walls, compass rose applique, stars against blackness). The gilded compass functions as a micro-setting element that charges the final act when it "glows" and aligns with the distant light. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, much description serves atmosphere over constraint; the deck does not meaningfully limit Aria's options or force tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.1)
    The icebound spire is visually evocative (crystalline structure, ice tunnels, star-essence board) but functions as postcard backdrop—no environmental detail constrains a choice or alters tactics. The pocket sundial lid is described twice but never handled or used as a tool under pressure. Spatial choreography is clear but static; the setting does not resist, complicate, or charge the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.1)
    The whispering gallery setting is named and its acoustics noted ("seemed to amplify the historian's words") but never constrains a choice or alters tactics. The chessboard with missing pawns appears twice but remains symbolic furniture; no character handles it or uses its configuration to guide action. Spatial choreography is vague (the historian "emerged from the shadows," the trio "walked" in patterns) without coherent blocking or distances.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.1)
    The labyrinthine bookstore and mountain setting supply vivid visuals ("shelves upon shelves," "vaulted ceiling," "long shadows") but remain decorative—no spatial constraint shapes a choice. The lost language stone's "intricate patterns" and the feather's "delicate barbs" are described yet never constrain action or charge the closure. Micro-setting credit: the stone on the pedestal anchors one beat, lifting the score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=5.6)
    The time-frozen village, cobblestones, and platinum labyrinth are visually specific but remain postcard backdrops—no environmental feature constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. The labyrinth's "twisting passages" are described but never require navigation decisions or embodied struggle. Spatial choreography is vague throughout the walk and interior sequence. The tapestry functions as an informational unlock but is not handled in tactile, lived-in ways that would ground micro-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.8)
    The canyon, towers, spire, and mist are described repeatedly but remain postcard imagery without spatial coherence or constraint on choice. No anchors for distance, layout, or accessibility; the spire "seems to draw closer" by narrative fiat rather than movement or perception. The setting never pressures a decision or supplies a resource. Sensory detail cycles through vision and vague "swirling" without POV filter or purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.4)
    The acid sea and floating workshop create vivid, high-stakes atmosphere and the breath-holding imposes a time constraint. The pockmarked statue and yellowed parchments anchor the task concretely. However, spatial choreography is vague—how Kaelin "dove back into her task" while holding her breath underwater is unclear, and the workshop's interior layout never grounds her movements. The setting pressures the ending (she breaks surface, collapses) but doesn't constrain a mid-scene choice.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.1)
    The quay, shore rocks, driftwood, and cave oasis are visually present, and the luminescent moss adds specificity. However, setting remains postcard description—no environmental feature constrains a choice or alters tactics. The seashell becomes a focal point on canvas but never pressures the painter's hand or her decision to reveal the oasis. Spatial choreography inside the cave network is vague; no sense of distance, difficulty, or navigation cost.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cobalt lighthouse and garden are described vividly with scent anchors ("night-blooming flowers," "fresh earth") and the setting recurs in the opening and closing images. However, neither environment constrains a choice or alters tactics: Elian tends plants off-page, stands in the garden during his metaphysical ritual, then climbs stairs—no spatial pressure or resource limit shapes the outcome. Micro-setting (the vial cork on the workbench, the winding stairs) is present but ornamental. The piece satisfies basic anchoring and sensory economy but does not reach the 9+ gate (environment must constrain choice or charge closure).

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.6)
    Setting elements are present but generic: "starlit signal station," "devastated landscape," "great, empty plain" function as mood boards rather than constraining geography. The censer foot is handled twice (recovery, clutched at dawn) but does not alter a choice. No tool, body state, or environmental feature pressures a decision. Spatial choreography is coherent within the station-to-plain journey, but the walk itself remains unanchored—no distance, terrain obstacle, or resource test shapes her path.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.1)
    The storm-battered orchard and ravine are described vividly but never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—the forager navigates "with ease." The antique glass eye and tattered textbook appear as discoveries but their physical properties don't affect tactics. Sensory detail (twisted trees, tangled undergrowth, damp soil) is present and filtered through the forager's perspective, grounding the reader in place, but remains ornamental to the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.4)
    The opal dock, mist, and lighthouse are vividly rendered with consistent sensory detail (salt, damp earth, swirling fog). The setting charges atmosphere throughout, and the lighthouse legend subtly pressures the stranger's gaze and Kael's final retrieval. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it remains backdrop rather than active constraint at closure, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=4.6)
    The creek, cavern, and blooming flowers are named but never constrain a choice or alter tactics; spatial choreography inside the cavern is vague (no distances, no physical obstacles). The type foundry chip "glimmers" three times without tactile handling or evolving meaning. Sensory detail cycles through generic "heavy scent" and "dripping water" without POV filter or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cobalt grotto, ember grotto, and sea of clouds are visually vivid but function as postcards rather than constraints. Spatial choreography is coherent (edge → darkness within → climb to ridge → into ember grotto), and sensory detail is present (ozone, smoke, ash). However, no environmental feature shapes a choice or alters tactics: the queen moves through spaces without resistance, tools, or micro-setting friction. The "lacy glow" and "fiery heart" are ornamental rather than purposeful, and the final descent into darkness remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ember nexus and nautilus shell are named and visually described, but neither constrains a choice or charges the closure image. Setting elements function as postcard backdrop: the nexus "glowed softly," "pulsed," then "faded" without altering the alchemist's tactics or options. Spatial choreography is minimal and the grasses, breeze, and twilight remain ornamental throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.6)
    The mountain ranger cabin anchors location, and "birch bark scroll" offers tactile specificity. However, the setting remains static backdrop—neither the woods nor the cabin constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Sensory detail is sparse and generic ("silence of the woods," "scratch of my pen"). No spatial choreography or environmental pressure shapes the writing act.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.1)
    The water clock shop is vividly rendered with sensory particulars (lapping water, soft ticking, muted fog) and the birthing clamp screw receives tactile attention. However, setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint: none of the shop's tools, spatial layout, or temporal pressure shapes Elara's choices. The fog recurs lyrically but does not narrow options or charge the final image with consequence. Occupational detail (water clocks, aromatherapy) remains ornamental, never tested in a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    The floating platform and tea ceremony setting anchor the scene early with vivid spatial detail (wooden floorboards, low table, wispy clouds). The tremors beneath his feet signal instability, and the setting's drift frames the ending image. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Kaito's writing proceeds unaffected by the platform's motion. The scent of sandalwood and the clearing sunset charge atmosphere but remain largely ornamental, not causal.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.1)
    The archive is vividly sketched ("scent of aged paper," "raised notes and rests embossed into the covers") and the antique perfume bottle anchors one sustained beat. However, spatial choreography is vague—we never learn room layout, shelf arrangement, or how Lyra navigates the space. The orchard timeframe is poetic but remains external decoration; it does not constrain her method or alter her tactics. The bottle's etchings and hum charge the middle section, lifting the score into mid-range, but the setting does not shape the final image or force a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.1)
    The temple library is sketched with stock gothic imagery ("shelves that stretched like sentinels," "scent of aged parchment") that does not constrain a single choice. Spatial choreography is vague: Aria steps "out into the temple's surroundings" and later "re-entered the temple" without legible geography. The dictionary appears as a prop in multiple beats but its physical state never alters tactics or charges the final image, remaining ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "horizon measurement station" and "hydraulic clocks" provide conceptual setting, but spatial choreography remains vague—no anchor for scale, layout, or tactile detail. The mantle clock key is handled twice (turn, replace), giving modest object-as-setting function. Sensory detail defaults to generic ("serene landscape," "warm orange glow") without POV filter or choice constraint. The final image does not charge through environment.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rainwashed library and candle lantern are described with consistent sensory detail and recur across beats, charging the final image. However, the subway setting remains generic—no spatial choreography or concrete sensory hierarchy shapes Elara's attention. The mica pane is mentioned repeatedly but never constrains a choice or alters tactics, preventing entry to the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=5.1)
    The subway utility tunnel, streetlamp hum, and glass harmonica are vividly described with sensory specificity (dim light, soothing hum, ethereal tones). However, these details remain atmospheric decoration; the environment does not constrain a single choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is minimal—one static booth in one tunnel—and the setting does not charge the final image, capping the score below 9-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.1)
    The jetty is vividly rendered with blooming flowers and twilight glow, but it functions as postcard description rather than constraint or resource. The archivist's documentation task and the locket photo receive concrete handling across multiple beats, qualifying as micro-setting. However, neither the jetty's spatial features nor the photo's physical properties alter her tactics or charge the closure image, keeping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ivy-covered railway station is anchored early with vivid detail ("ivy tendrils curling around their ankles like skeletal fingers"). However, the setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains scenic backdrop. The crowd, food, shelter, and station activity are summarized rather than shown through spatial choreography or micro-detail that pressures Raven's moves. The final image—"ivy-covered station fading into the darkness"—reprises the location but does not charge it with new meaning or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ultrasonic forest is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (frequencies beyond hearing, scent of blooming flowers, musical notes as spatial cues). However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—the mapmaker moves through it without friction, and the setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure. The platinum ring and tattoos are described but not used as tools that shape a decision. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the forest's specificity lifts the score above generic, but the micro-setting test for 9+ is not met.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=4.6)
    The gravitational anomaly is mentioned repeatedly but never constrains a choice or alters spatial access—Aria moves freely in her workspace and garden without pressure from the setting. Sensory detail defaults to visual generics ("air seemed to thicken," "whispers grew louder") without POV-specific filtering. The pen as micro-setting object is handled across beats, but its exotic nib's properties remain vague; the garden weeds appear once and vanish. No tool, body state, or environmental feature charges the final image or limits tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.1)
    The harbor setting is painted in broad strokes ("luminous," "moonlight," "gentle lapping of waves") but never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics. The vintage camera appears as a static symbol rather than a tool or micro-setting element that charges the closure. Spatial choreography is vague: we know there's a stall and a crowd, but no concrete distances or sensory hierarchy filters through the advisor's professional or personal priorities. The orientation cap from Q2 is waived here because the setting detail, while generic, does not create additional confusion once the scene is established.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.6)
    The archive setting is established early with sensory hooks (aged parchment scent, fluorescent lights, dusty shelves), but remains static decoration throughout. No environmental constraint shapes a choice: Elian moves freely through corridors, creates art without material limits, and the space never pressures tactics. The tapestry fragment and vandalized portrait function as thematic tokens rather than objects that alter action. Spatial choreography is vague—"labyrinthine corridors," "hidden alcove"—without legible distances or access friction that would ground movement or decision.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sound wave garden is vivid and present throughout: petal-like structures, metallic surfaces, vibrations responding to drumming. The auric lagoon anchors multiple beats (opening gaze, intensifying glow, dimmed reminder at departure) and charges the final image with its lingering light. Micro-setting (the surface she drums on, her perch) enables her ritual action. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than a lever that forces a decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.4)
    The container labyrinth is vivid and consistent—salt, rust, graffiti, flickering lights, howling wind—and spatial choreography tracks cleanly. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; she navigates "every twist and turn" without friction. The compass spinning wildly is atmospheric set-dressing; the storm does not force a tradeoff. The zodiac coin and key are handled but do not shape movement or access, missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cobalt dock and mist establish atmosphere, but setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—it remains decorative postcard description. Sensory detail (wet earth, ozone, lapping water) is present but does not filter through POV urgency or alter tactics. The dental mirror and shutters are handled, yet spatial choreography (distance, sight lines, guardian's exact position) drifts vaguely across beats. The micro-setting allowance is not met; no tool or object forces a tradeoff at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cobalt library and magnetic grotto are described with atmospheric detail ("scent of old parchment," "otherworldly energy") but remain postcard backdrops; neither location constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. The grotto visit occurs off-page between paragraphs, and spatial choreography during key moves (organizing displays "in his mind") is absent. The mist recurs as thematic dressing without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sublittoral fringe and dockside setting are evoked through "weathered fishing boats," "wooden slats," and "fading light," establishing mood effectively. The scrimshaw as a recurring object charges the final swim, and the water itself becomes a micro-setting when Kael slips in and swims into darkness. However, spatial choreography during the swim remains vague—how far, how deep, what physical cost—and the glow of the scrimshaw illuminates "the path ahead" without concrete geography. The setting supports atmosphere but does not constrain a key choice or supply a resource that alters outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.1)
    The farmhouse and wind turbines are vividly anchored early and return in the final image, lending atmospheric coherence. However, neither environment nor object constrains a choice or alters tactics; the setting remains postcard description rather than pressuring Echo's decisions. The dried bouquet is handled (placed on mantle, gazed upon) but never limits or enables an on-page action. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("rustic charm," "overgrown gardens"), supporting mood without functional consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.4)
    The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and humming quartz colonnade are described vividly but remain static backdrops; they do not constrain choice or charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is coherent (Lyra's position at the lake's edge, the colonnade as sentinel), and sensory details are selective. However, the environment never pressures a decision or supplies a resource that alters outcome, keeping the score in the mid-band despite vivid description.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glassblower's courtyard is anchored early with sensory markers (clinking furnaces, murmur of artisans, breeze through plants). Spatial choreography remains clear across movements. However, setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no choice is pressured by proximity, tool access, or environmental limit. The concertina appears once, the plant arrangements are described but never shown altering tactics. Functional but decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.1)
    The laboratory setting is vividly described with luminescent orbs, peculiar instruments, and old machinery, but functions as postcard description rather than constraint. The miner's carbide lamp lens is cleaned and placed on a shelf; it does not limit or enable a choice. Spatial choreography is coherent, and sensory detail is selective, but the environment never pressures the protagonist's decisions or charges the final image with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.1)
    The observatory setting is vividly established (domed glass ceiling, sandalwood and myrrh scent, celestial bodies) and remains spatially coherent. However, it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image in a way that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The "curtains of intention" are described extensively but remain ornamental rather than spatial pressures that shape the protagonist's action.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft is vividly established and modulates from mystical to beckoning across the night. Sensory details (rain drumming, onyx-ink, coiled measuring tape) are concrete and filtered through the character's contemplative stance. However, the setting never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure. The measuring tape is handled but does not shape a turn.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.1)
    The archive is anchored early with sensory detail (aged parchment, luminescent orbs, grimy windows). The pagoda's facets reflecting twilight and the manuscript appear on the page. However, setting details remain decorative; no environmental constraint shapes a choice or charges the final image. Spatial choreography is generic ("depths of the lost civilization archive") without purposeful micro-setting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.1)
    The blooming library, floating shelves, and luminescent orbs establish vivid sensory anchors early. The river stone recurs across beats and the clouds frame the final image, satisfying micro-setting criteria. However, no environmental constraint materially alters a choice or tactic; the library functions as backdrop rather than pressure. Spatial choreography (moving through shelves, sitting, walking) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=5.1)
    The misty workshop under stars is evoked consistently and the chameleon's enclosure anchors the scene, but setting never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome. Sensory detail ("damp veil," "scent of damp earth") is vivid yet decorative, filtered through a generic poetic register rather than Lena's professional priorities as a handler. Spatial choreography is vague—no sense of how the workshop is laid out or how Lena moves through it during her work.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.1)
    The tower, plants, and hourglass are described vividly but remain ornamental; no environmental feature constrains a choice or alters the protagonist's path. Spatial choreography inside the tower is vague (descent, depths, hidden chamber) without coherent distances or access obstacles. Sensory detail (damp earth, luminescent plants, frosted symbols) decorates but does not pressure the quest. The hourglass clutched throughout does not interact with the environment or charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.4)
    The projection booth is vividly anchored early (celluloid scent, dust, reels, projector hum) and returns at closure to frame the exit. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the vision sequence. However, the setting never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome; it functions as atmospheric container rather than active pressure. The film strip is handled twice (pickup, replacement) but does not evolve or force a trade-off. Sensory detail tilts visual-heavy without POV-filtered selectivity during the vision.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.1)
    The aurora-lit archway is mentioned repeatedly but functions as postcard backdrop rather than constraint or pressure. The astrolabe is held and adjusted but never shapes a tactical choice or alters available options. Spatial choreography is minimal; the dreamer stands in one spot throughout, and no environmental detail forces a decision or charges the final image. Sensory detail defaults to the visual (aurora glow, falling stars) without POV-specific filtering or urgency modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glowing dune is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (warm sand, shimmer, swirling patterns), and the chess clock's tactile reactivation provides a concrete moment. However, the environment does not constrain Asa's choices or supply friction; she moves freely without spatial or resource pressure. The "after the last forest burns" timeframe remains decorative background rather than a lived constraint that alters tactics. Micro-setting potential (clock, sand) is present but underutilized for causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.1)
    The Mechanical rainforest is vividly sketched with steel trees, wires, and machinery mimicking a heartbeat. Sensory detail is present but never constrains a choice or charges the final image—it remains atmospheric backdrop. The gear is clutched and studied but doesn't alter tactics or outcomes. Spatial choreography is loose (trees "fade into the background" twice without clear cause), and no environmental feature shapes the philosopher's decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "veiled ridgeway" and "twilight" supply lyric atmosphere but remain generic postcard backdrops; no tactile detail—footing, gradient, vegetation—constrains movement or choice. The star-stamp and wooden staff are described but never handled in a way that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is abstract: the clearing, the shore, and the sand lack anchoring landmarks or distances. At this length, a micro-setting (body, tool, or recurring object) should charge the closure; here the mist's clearing is meteorological decoration rather than a constraint or catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=5.9)
    The cobalt fortress, snow, and dusty spiral staircase are vividly sketched and recur throughout, lending atmospheric coherence. However, they remain largely ornamental: no environmental feature constrains a choice or alters the bellhop's tactics. The piano bench bolt is handled once by the figure but does not reappear or charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (staircase, bottom, shadows), but the micro-setting does not pressure the protagonist's stance or participate in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.1)
    The temple library is described with vivid sensory anchors—aged parchment, candlelight, cold stone—and the iron gall ink pellet appears twice (open beside Kael, then discarded). However, setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains postcard backdrop. The "rune of drift" and "pause of shifting constellations" are atmospheric but never shown shaping access, proximity, or cost. No micro-setting or tool changes the protagonist's approach on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.1)
    The monitoring station setting is anchored early with specific sensory markers (beeps, wave lapping, logbooks, atlas). The drum and drumsticks appear in multiple beats and the atlas's torn page recurs, lending mild object-as-setting texture. However, neither the station nor its tools constrain a choice or charge the final image—they remain backdrop. Spatial choreography is clean but the environment never pressures Maya's decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.1)
    The spaceport and stone circle are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (rusting steel, moss-covered grey stones, low-frequency hum), and the barefoot contact grounds key moments. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop; the opera glasses and bare feet recur but do not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The hum charges the final third emotionally but does not force a decision with on-page cost, capping micro-setting credit.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.1)
    The volcanic hot springs provide atmospheric description (sulfur, steam, bubbling) but do not constrain Akira's actions or tactics. The kite and glowing orb are handled on the page, and the setting recurs in the final image, offering modest integration. Spatial choreography is vague—how the orb was in the spring, why the kite was there—but the sensory layer (primordial aroma, quivering leaves) anchors mood throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.1)
    The arboretum setting is vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (twisted trees, sea breeze, cliff edge, orange sunset glow) and filters through Amira's trauma-informed perception. The cliff edge and stillness of the trees contribute atmospheric pressure. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Amira passively receives its balm. The setting charges the final image but does not shape tactics, keeping it shy of the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.6)
    The lighthouse library is painted in broad strokes ("dusty tomes," "worn leather," "flickering light") without spatial choreography or micro-setting that constrains action. No tool, body state, or environmental detail shapes a choice. The setting remains postcard description—evocative but inert—never pressuring tactics or charging the final image. Orientation penalty already applied in Q2; descriptive vividness cannot lift the score when setting does not participate in pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.1)
    "Wind-carved encampment," "rocky outcroppings," and "precipice" offer visual placeholders without spatial coherence or sensory texture beyond sight. The disappearing ink on rock is the sole tactile detail that might constrain action, but it fades passively rather than forcing a choice. The final "soft, ethereal light" is generic atmosphere. No detail—terrain, tool, or body—meaningfully narrows Kael's options or charges the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    The library setting is vividly established with snow, cryogenic pods, and "preservation gel" gloves, but these details remain decorative; the environment does not constrain Aria's choices or supply resources that affect outcome. The "dormant networks" are mentioned but never shown as a spatial or tactical element. Spatial choreography is coherent, and sensory detail (snow falling "in sync with her heartbeat") is purposeful, but the micro-setting does not charge the final image or shape the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glass-domed desert rose farm is vividly established and the airship wreckage repurposed as planter grounds the post-collapse setting. However, the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics; it remains postcard description. Sensory detail is present but not filtered through urgency or POV bias—Aria's perception is uniformly serene regardless of context. Spatial choreography is coherent but static.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.1)
    The sound wave garden is vividly described with synesthetic detail (hum, whispers, vibrations) and the sleepwalking constellations supply atmospheric specificity. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop: no spatial constraint alters the fisher's path, no environmental feature enables or forecloses a tactic. The rail spike is held but not used in relation to terrain or sound properties. Sensory selection does not shift with urgency because no urgency materializes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.1)
    The observatory above clouds is vividly sketched with mist, echoing silence, and swirling clouds, and the rosewood pen nib receives texture ("exquisite," "passed down through generations"). However, the setting does not constrain a choice: Adelaide picks up the pen, ponders, and descends without the environment pressuring her tactics or altering available moves. The clouds and mist function as mood rather than spatial or physical factors that shape outcome. Micro-setting (the pen nib on the console) is present but does not charge the final image with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.1)
    The laboratory setup is vivid (sandalwood, myrrh, machinery hum, antique dresser), and the amber talisman recurs across beats. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—objects are described but not used to pressure decisions. The "meteor hush" tone is asserted rather than built through sensory modulation. Spatial choreography is minimal; the tattooist works alone with no physical friction from the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.2)
    The grotto setting supplies vivid sensory anchors—mist, damp stone, whispering walls—and the sand mandala functions as a recurring micro-setting element. However, the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome; it remains atmospheric backdrop. The tile flake is handled twice (picked up, examined; held at closure) but doesn't pressure a decision. Spatial choreography is clear, and the lilac light at closure offers a charged image, lifting the score into mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ancient plaza, shattered sky, charred stalls, and rubble-strewn ground are vividly sketched and maintain spatial coherence. However, setting details remain decorative: the tessera is unearthed and studied, the mosaic stepping stone is approached, but neither object constrains a choice or alters Aria's path—she would proceed identically without them. Sensory detail is visual-dominant and generic (glint of color, vibrant hues, cracked stone pavement) rather than filtered through Aria's professional or emotional priorities. The environment does not guide or limit action; it serves as backdrop to abstract rumination.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.1)
    The mystic orchard and hedge maze are described with some sensory specificity (glowing paths, sweet scent, shimmering lights), but they never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters Echo's tactics. The tarot coin is handled twice (found, then clutched), meeting minimal beats, but its presence does not change spatial choreography or pressure. The setting remains a postcard backdrop rather than a functional constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.4)
    The light painting studio is anchored early with sensory details (linseed oil, turpentine, equipment) and the muscovite geode is handled across multiple beats, meeting basic setting requirements. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; no studio tool, spatial constraint, or material property forces a choice or alters Luna's tactics. The geode's "fractally precise structure" is described but never shown to enable or constrain an action with cost, and the final light paintings emerge without the setting imposing visible friction or resource limits.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.6)
    The coastal cave network is vividly rendered with bioluminescent fungi, salt scent, and dripping water. Spatial choreography remains clear across tunnels and the final cavernous space. However, the environment functions as scenic backdrop rather than constraint—Aria navigates "intimately" without obstacles, distances, or tactical friction. The elm leaf fossil remains in the satchel with only tactile description; it does not constrain a choice or charge the final image beyond metaphoric glow. Setting detail is purposeful but does not pressure the protagonist's path.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.1)
    The amber warehouse, cliffs, and hourglasses are vividly named and anchored early, satisfying orientation. However, setting remains postcard description—no spatial constraint alters a choice, no proximity or access shapes tactics. The "canyon echo" jar is handled once without consequence. Sensory detail (aged wood, golden light) decorates rather than pressures, and the final image reuses the opening's static tableau without evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=5.1)
    Zephyr Bluff and the mist are established early and recur throughout, providing atmospheric coherence. However, the setting remains largely decorative: the snow is mentioned as hiding a message but never examined in detail, and the path's discovery feels convenient rather than constrained by terrain. The engraved pillbox is handled twice (pocket touches) but does not alter tactics or choices. Spatial choreography is vague—"small clearing" and "path winding down" lack the specificity needed to ground action or create pressure through environment.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.6)
    The fog-bound crossing is vividly rendered with sensory detail (mist, lapping water, damp earth, dripping canopy) and the setting constrains perception throughout. The yarn needle and ferry's wooden slats provide tactile micro-setting. However, the environment never narrows a choice or alters tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop. The needle "glinted" and "seemed to glow" but does not charge the closure image with a constraint or resource that matters to the outcome, capping the score below 7.0 despite the lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.4)
    Vivid sensory work: "scent of old honey and wax," "sun beat down," "cracked ground," and the lantern glass's "delicate patterns" anchor the wasteland setting effectively. Spatial choreography is clear (Akira seated, glass on rock, distant smoke), and the oasis's former life as a beekeeping site provides textural specificity. However, the environment never constrains a choice—Akira's decision to leave is unaffected by the setting's physical or social pressures. The glass charges the final image but as a talisman of understanding, not as a micro-setting element that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.1)
    The harbor and fire escape are named but never constrain a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome. Sensory detail (moonlight, oars) is vivid yet ornamental, filtered through no POV bias. The lockmaster's tooth appears as a pocket token without spatial or tactical consequence. Micro-setting credit withheld; nothing in the environment shapes the gardener's final act.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.1)
    The tidal library above clouds, brass sundial, and stone circle are vividly described but remain postcard elements; none constrains a choice or charges the final image. The sundial's "atomically reflective surface" is mentioned but never enables or blocks an action. Spatial choreography is coherent (workbench, windows, library interior), yet the environment functions as backdrop rather than pressure. The Orientation Test penalty in Q2 caps this category at 7.0; absent that, vivid description would place it near 6.8, but without tactical constraint it cannot reach the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lotus temple and lily pond are vividly rendered with sensory detail (sweet scent, lapping water, diffused light) and the thrush's nest provides a tactile micro-setting element. The public art installation introduces spatial choreography that remains clear. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image in a way that would elevate the score; the setting functions primarily as backdrop rather than shaping Lena's decisions or the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.1)
    The university radio station is named and the console glows, but spatial choreography remains vague—no constraints on movement or resources that alter Lyra's tactics. Astronomical charts are "spread out before her" and annotated, yet they function as set dressing rather than tools that pressure choice. The "cramped" station and "hiss of static" provide atmospheric texture, but the environment never narrows options or charges the final image. Sensory detail is present but ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "shadowed nexus" provides concrete sensory anchors (damp earth, rough stone walls, ancient door with cryptic symbols) that ground the reader spatially. The compass point is used functionally to pick the lock, demonstrating tool-as-constraint in one beat. However, the starlight and chamber setting remain decorative postcard elements that do not pressure Lyra's choices or alter tactics at closure, and the "fallow period" timeframe is purely atmospheric without tightening decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.2)
    The quarry mist and thorn bush anchor space and supply the ribbon fragment, which returns at closure. Sensory detail is selective—"dripping water," "damp earth," "soft scratch of brush on canvas"—and filtered through the artist's perceptual priorities. The mist swirls throughout, but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than a pressure element that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.1)
    The weather station dome and copper nail receive repeated mention, but setting detail remains atmospheric rather than constraining. The journals and nail are held or scanned without altering tactics; the "spongey dread" and storm create mood but do not force spatial or resource choices. Micro-setting potential (the nail, the workstation) exists but is not leveraged to charge the final image, which itself is withheld.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.1)
    Mountain scenic pullout anchors location early; mist-shrouded peaks and scaffold wrap provide visual specificity. However, setting remains postcard-static: no environmental constraint shapes a choice, and spatial choreography (ground→shoulder→mountain path) is vague. The glass flake and scaffold wrap are described but do not alter tactics or access. Meets micro-setting allowance minimally through the flake as recurring object, but it charges the final image only by assertion ("otherworldly light"), not through demonstrated constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.1)
    The abandoned circus train is vividly anchored with selective sensory detail (aged wood, decay, faint lion's den outline, spiders). Spatial choreography is coherent as Kael moves through the train, and micro-setting objects (carved wooden bird, graffiti tag, makeshift altar) texture the space. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—Kael walks away unchanged, and the train remains atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.4)
    The celestial mapping observatory is anchored early and sensory detail (starlight through the dome, scent of old books, hum of machinery) establishes atmosphere. The daylily-pressed telegram and variable stars are recurring objects, but neither constrains a choice or charges the closure—they function as ornamental motifs. Spatial choreography is minimal but coherent; the setting remains static description rather than shaping tactics or outcome. The observatory's archives are mentioned but never used in a way that alters Lyra's path.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.6)
    The "swirling orchard vortex at the heart of the cursed lake" and "trees twisted into grotesque forms" offer vivid but generic fantasy imagery without spatial grounding—distances, layout, and choreography remain abstract. Sensory detail leans heavily visual with occasional texture ("spongy and uneven") but lacks the POV filter that would show what a druid prioritizes. The frozen figure suspended in ice provides one concrete image, but it does not constrain the druid's approach or choices. The setting recedes after the opening rather than pressuring tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cobalt glade and maze topiary are described with vivid sensory language (damp earth, wildflowers, rough bark), and the glowing scars add a purposeful motif. However, the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics—Aria walks freely through the maze without spatial friction or cost. The "after the future arrives early" timeframe is mentioned but does not shape the setting's rules or pressure. Spatial choreography is clear, and the ancient tree provides a focal anchor for the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.1)
    The catacomb orchard setting is vivid and atmospheric in early description ("tree roots snaked between ancient bones"), but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The burned tarot card is handled twice (pickup, pocket), yet neither touch alters a tactical choice or charges the closure image—it serves as symbolic luggage. Spatial choreography is coherent, and sensory detail (damp earth, decaying leaves) anchors the reader, but no environmental feature shapes a decision or forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.1)
    The quarry office trailer is named early and returns in the final third, but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint—Jack could conduct this internal monologue anywhere. Sensory detail is sparse and generic ("dusty antiques," "faint smell of rock dust," "warm, golden light"). The speaker grille cloth scrap is handled twice (picked up, stored away) and charges the closure attempt, providing the story's strongest object-as-setting moment. The "echo valley" image in the final third feels ornamental, a phrase rather than a lived spatial experience that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.1)
    The Magnetic arbor is vividly sketched (mist, magnetic hum, drifting clouds) and anchors the single scene. The Knowledge fruit seed glows and pulses, offering sensory detail, but neither environment nor object constrains a choice or alters tactics on the page. The final image recycles description ("arbor...bathed in warm light") without new pressure. Micro-setting potential exists but remains ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=5.1)
    The tidal atrium receives vivid sensory detail (saltwater scent, lapping waves, wintersun serenity) and the bamboo creel is visually specific. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it functions as backdrop. Spatial choreography is coherent but static. The setting supports atmosphere without shaping the story's outcome or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.1)
    The crystal caves are vividly described with "crystalline formations" and "latent radiance," establishing atmospheric specificity. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint shapes Aria's choices or alters her tactics. The pearl and shell are handled but do not constrain action—they trigger reflection rather than physical or tactical problem-solving. Spatial choreography is minimal and the caves remain static.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.4)
    The disused railway station supplies vivid ivy-shrouded atmosphere but remains postcard backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters Elara's path. Spatial choreography is stable (bench, accordion, map) yet the setting never pressures her forgiveness quest. The accordion as micro-object is handled twice (leaning, played) but its patched bellows function as symbol only, not tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.1)
    Mist, glowing shelves, worn leather, and the watch's intricate mechanisms provide vivid sensory anchors. The doorway that appears when mist parts is a purposeful late reveal tied to the dreamer's documentation work. However, the library functions as scenic backdrop rather than constraint: no spatial detail alters a tactic, no tool limits a choice. The watch is handled twice but never shapes an on-page decision under pressure, missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.1)
    The velvet observatory, midsummer setting, and sensory details (blooming flowers, crimson/gold sky) are vivid and coherent. However, the environment remains decorative; no spatial element constrains a choice or charges the final image. The transparent violin is described but never handled as a tool that alters tactics. Solid atmospheric grounding without functional integration into pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.1)
    The grotto, aurora, and emerald chip are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (crystalline refraction, gentle hum, pulsing glow). The micro-setting (workbench, gemstone) and larger environment (floating grotto, aurora curtains) are integrated into Aria's actions. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; the aurora's energy and the grotto's resonance are described but do not force a trade-off or block a path. The final image references the grotto's "eternal vigil" without the environment shaping the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.1)
    The umbral grotto is described through generic pastoral detail (lush vegetation, rustling leaves, chirping birds) without constraining choices or supplying resources that affect outcome. "Scallop the clouds with her fingers" offers a striking image but remains decorative—it does not alter tactics or charge the final moment. The hairpin is mentioned repeatedly but never handled or used in a way that tests spatial logic or pressures a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lighthouse setting is vivid in broad strokes—"breezy heights," dawn light, wind chimes—but spatial choreography is thin: we never learn where the conscience stands, how they ascend or descend, or how the chimes are positioned. The hollow mirror shard is held but not used in a way that alters a choice. Sensory detail tilts heavily visual; the "warm glow" and "morning mist" repeat without shaping a decision or charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.1)
    The floating rock platform and pond are described vividly and anchor the scene early. However, the setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint: no spatial feature pressures a choice or alters tactics. The "magnetic grotto under starlight" is mentioned twice but never dramatized—its "unique properties" and "otherworldly energy" remain asserted rather than shown affecting perception or action.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.8)
    The canyon setting and bone towers are vivid in early description, but they never constrain a choice or evolve causally. Spatial details remain static postcards across centuries; the arrowhead and dust accumulate as atmospheric touches without altering tactics. The flock of birds appears once to deliver exposition ("the skimmer discerned the arrowhead's story") rather than function as a recurring constraint. Because setting does not shape the ending, the 9+ gate is not met, capping at 8.8, but execution flaws prevent even mid-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.9)
    The icebound spire is vividly rendered with "intricate carvings," "frosty corridors," and "twisted, ethereal design," but remains largely postcard description. The garden and keystone are present in the closure image, yet neither constrains a choice—Eira simply touches the keystone and receives inspiration. Spatial choreography is clear (spire → corridors → hidden garden → folly), and the "lingering luminance" recurs, but the environment does not pressure her tactics or alter her options. The keystone charges the final image but does so passively, missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.9)
    The forgotten library and sunken ship are vividly anchored with sensory detail (saltwater, decay, creaking hull, dusty tomes). The sky lantern release functions as atmospheric backdrop but does not constrain Kael's choices or complicate his descent. The circular window in the final beat offers a charged image, though the environment itself does not pressure his agency. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the descent and library exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ambered observatory deck and starlight appear multiple times and frame the action, providing spatial coherence. However, setting remains postcard description—stars "twinkle," deck is "ambered"—without constraining a single choice or altering tactics. No tool, body state, or environmental pressure shapes the distillation or the final act. The micro-setting (distillation apparatus) is present but inert; it does not complicate or enable outcome, so the 9-band gate remains closed.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ancient observatory at dusk is vividly rendered with sensory detail (warm orange glow, worn stone balcony, scent of old stone). However, the setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint; the reaper's actions could occur in any isolated location without altering the outcome. The atlas page is described but not used tactilely, and the observatory's archives are mentioned in summary rather than explored on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.8)
    The sapphire viaduct and dawn sky are vividly rendered with color and scent anchors. The bell's cracked metal and its "tiny, musical ring" under each drop offer concrete micro-setting detail. However, the environment does not constrain choice or alter tactics—the mage's hands move unimpeded, the ritual space provides no friction. The final image reprises the viaduct's deepening hue, a purposeful callback, but it does not charge the closure with new cost or reweighted meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sensory anchors are present—mud, damp earth, decay, creaking street sign—and filtered through the warden's task. The midnight ridgeway and resurfaced streets supply atmospheric specificity. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop: no environmental detail constrains a choice or charges the final image. The wind chime is mentioned twice but remains static metaphor rather than a tactile object that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall, ancient tree, and orchard are vividly rendered with sensory specificity. However, the setting remains largely decorative—the orchard supplies ingredients and atmosphere but doesn't constrain Elara's choices or limit her access in ways that shape the outcome. The crystal's location among roots is the only moment where setting detail directly enables plot progress, earning mid-band placement.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.4)
    The nocturnal arbor is vividly anchored with sensory specificity (wooden beams, whisper-thin wires, cloud-dwelling air, star-light on slats) and the setting remains spatially coherent throughout. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a pressure element that shapes the protagonist's options or charges the final image, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.1)
    The floating-rock dojo is vividly named but functions as postcard backdrop; it never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome. The brain-in-jar sits on a shelf across multiple paragraphs without Kaito touching it, moving it, or using its proximity to force a micro-decision. Sensory detail is generic ("air thick with tension," "hum of levitation engines") and not filtered through Kaito's professional or personal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.8)
    The echo chamber tunnel is invoked repeatedly but never grounds spatial choreography or constrains a choice. Sensory details ("cold stone walls," "vibrating air") remain generic postcards. The leaf blower—potentially a micro-setting object—is described ("worn grip") but does not evolve in use or charge the final image. No tool, environment, or body detail alters tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.1)
    The frozen garden, mist, and statues are described with atmospheric density and sensory detail (damp earth, decaying leaves, frost-rimed paths). However, these elements function as backdrop rather than constraint; no environmental feature narrows her options or supplies a resource that alters her tactic. The pendant glows and pulses but never becomes a tool she must handle or manipulate to achieve an end. Spatial choreography remains clear, and the mist's thickening modulates pressure symbolically, lifting the score into functional range despite the lack of tactical integration.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ember nexus and twilight are vividly described ("scorched earth," "charged atmosphere," "frozen bloom of color") but remain postcard backdrops—no environmental constraint shapes a choice or alters tactics. The broken crozier is handled across beats, yet spatial choreography of the gathering and weaving remains vague. Micro-setting allowance applies, but the object does not constrain action or charge the final image with felt cost, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.1)
    The abandoned radio tower city suspended over a gorge is vividly sketched with ozone, decay, rusty metal, and the gorge's rush below. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Aria navigates freely without spatial friction. The Hollywood star fragment and hidden chamber appear as set pieces rather than resources that shape her path. Micro-setting credit: the tower's foundation and the etched wall charge the discovery moment moderately, lifting the score into mid-band despite lack of choice-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.9)
    The grotto's starlight, hum, and etched markings create vivid atmosphere and the hourglass anchors the ferry's history. However, the environment does not constrain a single choice or alter Elara's tactics; she walks, notices, deciphers, and advances without spatial friction. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, but the setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.1)
    The optical illusion gallery is described with atmospheric specificity ("scent of old glass," "fluorescent hum," "reflections and distorted perspectives") and returns at the end, but it never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it remains backdrop. The thread is handled across multiple beats, yet its mechanics are vague ("seemed to pulse," "seemed to be imbuing"). Spatial choreography is coherent within the single location. The setting charges the final image through reprise but does not pressure the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.1)
    The benthic city is described but never constrains a choice or alters tactics. Details like "abyssal plain," "dimly lit thoroughfares," and the anchor chain link remain decorative postcards rather than active elements shaping movement or decision. The stars are invoked for thematic weight but do not supply a resource or obstacle that changes what Lyra can do. Spatial choreography is coherent but does not pressure the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.1)
    The mist-clad atrium at twilight is established early and sustained through sensory detail (fog, hush, gentle hum). The mist clears as Aria speaks, offering one moment where setting mirrors internal state, yet it does not constrain choice or alter tactics—Aria's approach and the woman's acceptance proceed identically whether the mist lifts or not. The hearing aid functions as a conceptual beacon but is never handled or used in a way that shapes the final image with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.3)
    The undersea facility anchors location with sensory particulars (steel walls, anemones, coral, faint glow). The tidal timeframe creates a constraint that pressures the return journey. However, spatial choreography inside the facility is vague—rooms and corridors lack distinguishing features or navigational logic. The "crashing hush" of the cables is evocative but remains atmospheric rather than a tactile environmental force that alters a choice. The phase-transition mechanics are asserted, not grounded in observable detail.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.1)
    The opal observatory and snow provide atmospheric grounding, and the porcelain shard recurs with shifting symbolic weight. However, the setting does not constrain choice—Akira's actions (pouring ink, studying patterns) could occur anywhere. The snow "seemed to grow deeper" and then stops without affecting tactics or the ending. Sensory detail is present but filtered through stock poetic diction ("eerie beauty," "serene landscape") rather than Akira's professional or personal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=5.8)
    The towers of bone, canyon acoustics, and bird-shadow kinetics provide vivid, purposeful anchoring that supports the thematic frame. Sensory detail is selective and image-driven (copper veins, bone towers, shadow-dance), filtered through a consistent lyric POV. However, the environment remains postcard-static—no object, distance, or micro-setting detail constrains a choice or alters a tactic on the page, capping the score below 7.0 per the quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.1)
    The underground garden supplies vivid sensory anchors (damp earth, blooming flowers, moss-covered stone) and the cordless phone becomes a focal object. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; Lena moves through it as a tourist. Spatial choreography is clear, but the setting remains postcard description rather than pressure. The cap at 8.3 (orientation debt applied in Q2) and the lack of choice-constraint keep the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=5.1)
    The orchard is vividly described—flowers "shimmered like stardust," sky-bridge gains "ethereal light"—but remains postcard scenery. The living statues police the grounds yet never obstruct Luna or test her music against resistance. The locust shell is clutched but not handled or used to alter tactics. Setting does not constrain choice or charge the final image; it decorates the declared transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.6)
    The "cobalt arcade at twilight" recurs at opening and close but functions as postcard description rather than a spatial constraint that alters tactics. The thunderstorm bottle is handled twice (turn, hand over) but remains decorative—it does not guide choice or charge the closure image with environmental pressure. Spatial choreography (alleyway, border, drone positions) is legible but generic; no tool, body state, or micro-setting element narrows options at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    The abandoned circus train, carousel, and oasis are vividly rendered with sensory detail (rusty wheels, faded paint, tranquil pool). Spatial choreography through the mist-shrouded carriages is clear. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop; the oasis does not constrain the carpenter's choice or alter tactics—it offers beauty, not friction. The halo fragment's "gentle glow" recurs but remains ornamental. Micro-setting elements (workbench, lantern) anchor the scene without shaping the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    The library setting is vivid with selective detail: "tomes," "reading lamps," "sandalwood," "labyrinthine shelves." However, these function as atmosphere rather than constraint—no environmental detail alters a tactic or shapes the ending. The scarf returns at closure but as ornament (a "symbol") not as a tool that charges the final image through changed use. Spatial choreography is clear but static across the entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.1)
    The whispering archipelago and dawn imagery are vivid but postcard-static; no environmental constraint shapes Elian's choices or charges the final image. Sensory details (lapping waves, golden glow, luminous absence) recur without evolving causally or filtering through urgency. The weathered dock and heirloom palette are mentioned but never constrain action. Spatial choreography remains coherent within the single recurring scene.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sensory detail is vivid in spots ("gnarled tree," "latticework of overhead branches") but remains postcard description without constraining choice. The lock of hair on the branch is the sole object handled, yet its mechanics are summarized ("set to work…tools…used with finesse") rather than shown. The "shadowed nexus" and clearing function as backdrop; spatial choreography is coherent but inert. No environmental feature pressures a tactic or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.1)
    The sunken orchard, greenhouse, and shipwrecks provide vivid sensory anchors—"damp earth and decaying fruit," "skeletal remains"—that establish a distinct milieu. However, the environment remains postcard description: no object, spatial constraint, or sensory detail alters Emilia's tactics or charges the final image. The fairy ring's "delicate white gills" and "otherworldly energy" are asserted textures without functional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.1)
    The library is anchored through dust motes, creaking shelves, old books, and the playground swing outside. The empty cup and tea leaves are handled across beats and constrain the annotation method, giving the setting functional pressure. However, the environment does not alter a choice or charge the final image decisively; the archivist's actions would proceed identically in any archive. Sensory hierarchy and spatial choreography remain clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.8)
    The verdant parapet and waterfall are named but never constrain choice or supply tactical pressure. Sensory details remain generic and ornamental: "sweet scent of blooming flowers," "warm, golden light." Spatial choreography is vague—Aria's movements and the transformation of the landscape lack concrete grounding. The environment functions as backdrop rather than active element shaping decisions or charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prism sanctuary and starlight are vividly rendered with shifting kaleidoscope colors that charge the atmosphere. However, the setting remains largely postcard: it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the restorer's approach. The tapestry needle and net are handled, but the sanctuary itself functions as backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.1)
    Rain-scoured fresco vault and henge are anchored with vivid sensory detail ("damp earth and mold," "drumming against the vault's stone roof"). The henge constrains Elara's method (comparing footage) and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement. However, spatial choreography inside the vault remains vague—where Elara stands, moves, or sets up equipment is untracked. The "spot where a map tears" is metaphorical rather than a literal spatial constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=5.6)
    The sunken ship library is evocatively seeded (luminescent fish, salt and decay) but remains static backdrop; no environmental constraint shapes Eli's choices or charges the final image. Spatial choreography is loose: wading through debris, picking up objects, and moving between areas lack clear distances or physical consequence. The snow globe and fishing net function as symbolic tokens rather than tools that alter tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.4)
    The misty courtyard is anchored with vivid sensory detail (ozone, wet stone, swirling fog, statues) and the atmosphere is sustained throughout. However, the setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains a backdrop for contemplation rather than a pressure that shapes action. The flower press bolt plate is handled twice (picked up, gathered at the end) but its "new significance" is told, not shown through changed options.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.1)
    The icebound spire, frost-etched walls, and ethereal chamber provide atmospheric description but remain postcard-static. No environmental detail constrains a choice or alters tactics; the elevator's ascent and the shrine discovery are spatial backdrops, not pressure points. The airship goggles are mentioned three times without functional use, failing the micro-setting test for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.6)
    The sky gondola and brass telescope are named and described with some atmospheric detail ("panoramic windows," "etched patterns"), but neither object constrains a choice or alters Lyra's tactics. Sensory selection is generic ("sea of clouds," "deep, foreboding grey") and lacks POV-specific filtering—no professional meteorological detail shapes what she notices or ignores. Spatial choreography is vague (telescope "in the corner," control panel mentioned but not used), and the setting functions as backdrop rather than pressuring action. The Orientation Test penalty in Q2 caps this category at 7.0; even absent that cap, the setting does not charge the final image or supply a resource that affects outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tree trunk library is vivid and specific: hollowed by a scholar's guild, musty silence, dappled light through branches, book-lined shelves with the hidden safe. The pre-demolition stillness and the rumbling machines outside create temporal pressure. The coin's faint indentations function as micro-setting, guiding brushstrokes and charging the portrait with intricate beauty. The setting constrains the artist's window of opportunity and charges the final image (indigo sky mirrored within walls), meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment shapes choice or final image.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.2)
    The airship cabin, navigation table, dusty hopscotch board, and recurring starlings provide atmospheric anchors. The hopscotch board constrains Eli's code-breaking in one beat, lifting the score. However, spatial choreography remains soft (where is the phrasebook relative to the table? how does the luminance "dance"?), and the logbook's sudden appearance mid-scene feels ungrounded. Sensory detail skews visual; no scent, temperature, or tactile weight appears under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.4)
    The frozen library above clouds and the frost-encrusted door are vividly rendered early and anchor spatial progression. However, the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics—it functions as a postcard backdrop through which Kael walks unhindered. The door's gear-etched surface is observed but does not impose a puzzle or cost; Kael simply "reached out to uncap the delicate lock" without friction, blocking the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.1)
    The orchard planet and floating rock arches are described but never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. Lyra's butterfly garden and watering bell appear as atmospheric details without pressure application. Spatial choreography remains abstract—settlers "gather beneath arches" and "work together" without legible physical positions or tool interactions. The nebula's energy signature is told as a world-building fact but not dramatized through sensory perception or POV-filtered attention.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lighthouse lantern room and fading dusk anchor setting early and return at closure. The "pane of hush" operates more as metaphor than physical constraint—it does not alter a choice or supply a resource. Spatial choreography is coherent but static; no tool, body state, or environmental feature narrows options. The final shimmer of the pane charges the image slightly, lifting above ornamental description.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cliffside labyrinth and mechanical birds create atmospheric potential, but spatial choreography remains vague—we never learn how the stones are positioned or how the impressions work physically. Sensory detail leans heavily visual ("golden glow," "ethereal light") without body or tool grounding. The cottage search and stone-marking lack tactile specificity. The labyrinth constrains the task's scope but doesn't pressure a choice; the caretaker completes her work unimpeded.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.4)
    The braided ravine, foam patterns, and chrysalis are vividly rendered and sensory detail is selective. The empty chrysalis functions as a charged image that Maria observes and that reappears at the end, constraining her reflection and charging the closure moment. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The environment supplies metaphorical pressure but does not materially constrain a choice or alter tactics in a concrete way, which caps the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    The glass orchard library setting is vivid and consistently maintained (delicate structures, swirling clouds, crystalline lattice). The bottle functions as a micro-setting object that Ember handles across multiple beats, and the library's "soft, ethereal music" creates sensory texture filtered through her perception. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—she can wander freely, pick up objects, and reflect without spatial pressure. The setting remains more backdrop than crucible, beautiful but passive.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.1)
    The desert fortress, dunes, tidal pool, and coral pavilion are vividly rendered with sensory detail (wet sandstone, ozone, cool sand, otherworldly glow). The tidal pool and pavilion constrain Elara's path spatially—she walks out, kneels, enters the pavilion—but do not alter a tactical choice at a pressure point. The micro-setting (sand transmitting memories via touch) is noted but does not force a trade-off. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout; the setting charges atmosphere but does not pivot a decision or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    The clock tower is anchored early with vivid detail ("intricate mechanisms," "winding stairs," "cuckoo clock weight"), and the grain elevator is spatially placed ("outskirts of town"). Sensory selection is purposeful ("hush of borrowed starlight," "rusty voice"), though the metaphorical density risks ornament over constraint. The tower's mechanisms "whirred and clicked, keeping time" during the conversation—a micro-setting moment that charges atmosphere but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The final sunrise image is postcard-generic and does not reconfigure the setting's pressure on Emilia's goal.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.1)
    The moonlit canyon and broken observatory provide atmospheric anchors, and the moon's ascent tracks time visually. The mirror is handled across multiple beats (analyzing fragments, reassembling). However, spatial choreography inside the canyon remains vague, and the environment does not constrain a single choice or charge the final image; it functions as backdrop. Sensory detail tilts toward generic ("silvery glow," "otherworldly energy") without POV-filtered specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.1)
    The grotto's "twisting passages," "damp stone," and "scent of damp earth and moss" provide functional atmosphere, and the manuscript's yellowed parchment anchors the opening. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—the archivist navigates "with ease" and finds the chamber without spatial friction. The inverted gravity is declared but never embodied in movement or perception; no detail of how she adapts or what it costs her physically. Sensory selection remains generic (mist, dampness, silence) rather than filtered through the archivist's professional or personal priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.7)
    The siskin alder grove is anchored early and sensory details—sap-stained fingers, half-buried insulator, trees swaying—are filtered through the sculptor's priorities. The porcelain insulator's "delicate, glazed surface" contrasts with "rough-hewn trees" and is integrated into the sculpture, constraining the final sonic texture. Spatial choreography is clear (forest floor, underbrush, trees). The setting modulates the ending: trees "whisper thanks" and "sway gently," charging the closure image with environmental response. No implausible detail or drift noted.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "magnetic nexus" and "polished basalt worry stone dent" are named repeatedly but function as atmospheric set-dressing rather than constraining choice or supplying resources. Sensory details (wildflowers, crickets, stars) are generic postcards that do not filter through the tutor's professional or emotional priorities. Spatial choreography is minimal but coherent (bench to walking away). The setting never alters a tactic or charges the final image, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sandalwood, jasmine, crickets, and lunar glow are vivid but ornamental; none constrain Elara's choice or shape the diary-opening. The workshop remains a postcard setting—no tool, spatial constraint, or environmental pressure alters her action. Micro-setting allowance (body, tool, recurring object) is not leveraged: the clasp glows on command without earned friction.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.8)
    The treetop village is introduced with vivid sensory cues (sweet air, blooming flowers, rustling leaves) but remains a postcard backdrop; it does not constrain a single choice or shape tactics. The corpse flower seed functions as a recurring object, but its handling is minimal—Lyra holds it, tends it off-page, and observes the bloom; no micro-setting detail alters a decision. Spatial choreography is clean within the implied single location, and the "wildflower hush" fragrance charges the bloom moment, but the environment itself remains ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.9)
    The floating rock arches, orchard, and iridescent pool provide vivid visual anchors, and the inverted gravity creates atmospheric pressure. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint; Lyra navigates smoothly without the arches or gravity inversion forcing difficult spatial choices. The arrow tip and pool appear but do not materially alter her path. Sensory detail is largely visual, missing tactile or kinesthetic grounding during the weightlessness that would charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.4)
    The labyrinth of shipping containers is vividly anchored early with rust, saltwater, and creaking steel. Sensory detail (orange glow at sunset, oppressive silence) is selective and mood-appropriate. The environment subtly guides her movement—"particularly narrow juncture," "convergence of steel and shadow"—but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; she surveys and leaves. The setting charges atmosphere but stops short of forcing a trade-off or reshaping the final image, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.1)
    The ice cavern is vividly described (crystalline structures, luminescent fungi, aurora colors) but remains postcard scenery; no environmental feature constrains a choice or charges the final image. The amber music sheet is mentioned twice but never handled in a way that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is vague: Elian's position, the sculptor's distance, and the marble's location never cohere into a legible stage.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.1)
    The Thunder-echo range supplies vivid sensory anchors—sagebrush scent, canyon walls, distant thunder—and the driftwood markers gain symbolic charge in the final image. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains a postcard backdrop. The flute qualifies as a micro-setting object and is handled across multiple beats, and the closing reprise of "canyon hush" and driftwood markers charges the final tableau, lifting the score above mid-band despite the lack of spatial pressure on action.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.4)
    Topaz workshop, letterpress, luminescent orbs, and Halo fragment are named but remain static set-dressing. The vanishing stars create atmospheric pressure but never constrain Echo's choices—work continues unaffected. Spatial choreography is vague (Echo "positioned" the fragment, "stepped back," then "disappeared into the night" with no tracked movement). The press and fragment are handled in two beats, meeting minimal threshold, but neither object alters tactics or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.1)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway anchors location early and receives vivid sensory treatment. However, the setting never constrains a choice or charges the final image—it remains postcard backdrop. The pendant and the woman's appearance are described but do not alter Eira's tactics or the closure moment, keeping the score in the functional-but-replaceable band.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.1)
    The quartz arbor and mist are evocative but remain postcard description; neither constrains a choice or alters tactics. The car window is introduced without spatial anchors—where is it in relation to the mystic? The prism refracts light, but this is told rather than shown affecting her perception or action. Sensory detail is vivid ("scent of damp earth," "frost-etched patterns") yet ornamental, not integrated into goal-driven action. Micro-setting allowance: the prism and frost could function as setting, but they never pressure a decision or charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.1)
    The forgotten orchard and bamboo forest are established early with vivid sensory detail (blooming flowers, rustling leaves, dappled light), and the setting recurs at closure when the forest "whispers its own message." However, the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics; it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure. The tree sap amber bead is mentioned three times but remains ornamental—no on-page action demonstrates how it enables or limits a move. Spatial choreography is loose (the weathered box "spilling out onto the grass" appears without prior grounding).

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory anchors are present (blooming orchard scent, glowing metal, shimmering silk, pickaxe echoes) and the floating rock arches establish the planet's texture. The forge and mine shafts recur but function primarily as backdrop; neither constrains a choice or charges the final image. The orchard scent frames the opening and the rock arches close the piece, offering a purposeful reprise, but the spatial details remain decorative rather than pressure-applying. The magician's silk's "mystical properties" are asserted without grounded mechanics that would satisfy realism standards.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.1)
    The repair bay is anchored early with concrete detail (rust, decay, grimy windows, skeletal starships), and the green glass shard is handled twice (picked up, glows). However, the "parallel universes" remain generic placeholders—"diverse landscapes" and "ever-changing topography" without sensory specificity or POV-filtered detail. The shard's glow guides her but does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; it simply fades when she's done. Spatial choreography within each world is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.2)
    The lantern room, sea glass, and cairn receive vivid sensory treatment ("soft blue, like the first hint of dawn," "rocky shore," "dusty prisms"). However, the haunted lantern room does not constrain a choice—it's a backdrop for reflection. The sea glass warms in the pocket but does not alter tactics. Spatial choreography is loose (descent from tower, arrival at shore, boat push-off lack clear distances). Micro-setting (the body, the stones) charges the ritual moment but does not drive a decision. Solid atmospheric work without tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.1)
    The emerald lighthouse and glass lantern anchor spatial and sensory detail throughout, and the setting's verticality (winding stairs, top platform) structures the ascent. However, the environment never constrains a choice or complicates tactics; it functions as a postcard backdrop for the ritual rather than a pressure source. The "total internal reflection" mechanic is named but not shown altering options or access. Sensory catalog (beam, shadows, stars, warm golden light) remains static across beats without POV-driven selection or stakes-driven evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.1)
    The floating tea house is sketched early ("ancient engineering," "mist-shrouded valley") but never constrains a choice or shapes tactics—it remains a postcard backdrop. The blue morpho wing is handled twice (gazed at, then refracted), meeting minimal beat involvement, but does not alter movement or options. Sensory detail is generic ("soft, ethereal glow," "warm, golden glow") and filtered through abstract language rather than Kaito's professional dye-master lens. Spatial choreography is vague (no anchor for where others sit, how Kaito positions the wing).

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.1)
    The stormlit tower, observatory, and moonlight are vividly described and create atmospheric coherence. Spatial choreography remains clear across the climb and descent. However, the setting does not constrain a single choice or alter tactics—the storm "intensifies" in parallel to the worker's task without applying pressure, and the moon functions as ambient backdrop rather than a resource or obstacle that shapes the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.1)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is described with vivid sensory detail (luminescent fungi, shimmering leaves, golden light) but remains a backdrop; none of its particulars constrain a choice or alter tactics. The mica window pulses and refracts light across multiple beats, approaching functional integration, but its mechanics are ornamental—it does not limit access, impose cost, or shape the memory keeper's decision to continue. Spatial choreography is clear, yet the setting reads as a catalog rather than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.1)
    The secret library is vividly established with sensory detail (dusty tomes, lantern glow, musty scent) and remains coherent throughout. The setting provides atmosphere but does not constrain a single choice or alter tactics; Elys moves freely within it without spatial friction. The book *The Harmony of Opposites* functions as a micro-setting object that delivers the message, meeting the minimum threshold for a purposeful detail that charges the ending moment, though the library itself remains backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.9)
    Vivid setting (woven vines, weathered wood, crumbling stones, blooming flowers) grounds the reader early and consistently. The tea house itself functions as micro-setting that anchors recurring action (sipping tea, tending plants), but it never constrains a choice or alters tactics—visits are frictionless. Spatial choreography is clean; sensory detail leans visual with scent accents (jasmine, blooming flowers) but remains static across visits.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.1)
    The frozen library and quartz hush establish atmosphere, and the magic lantern slide is handled twice (lifted, returned). However, setting remains postcard-vivid without constraining a choice or altering tactics—Elara's work proceeds unimpeded by cold, altitude, or archive logistics. Spatial choreography is coherent but static. The slide glows "as if" but does not force a trade-off or charge the final image with micro-setting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.1)
    The pirate market setting is vividly anchored early with sensory detail (saltwater, rotting pier, rusting machinery). However, the environment remains decorative rather than constraining choices—Lena navigates stalls without spatial friction, and the sunrise timeframe doesn't pressure her tactics. The watch fob is handled twice (vendor handoff, Lena clutches it during standoff), which charges the final third modestly but doesn't alter the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lavender bluff and aurora are vividly described and anchored early, establishing a clear sensory baseline. However, setting remains postcard-level: neither environment nor the tin compass ring constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. The "forests in the distance" and "elections" are told, not shown, and spatial choreography is vague (how far is the stranger? how long does Aria walk?).

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cave's crystalline formations and vibrations are vividly described and anchor the setting early. However, the environment functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint; crystals "hum" and "respond" poetically but never limit Elara's choices or materially shape her tactics. The lock's transformation from rusted to crystalline sheen suggests symbolic engagement but remains ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.1)
    The greenhouse city, toxic sky, and undercroft tunnels establish vivid atmosphere and are signaled early. However, setting remains postcard description—Aria navigates "treacherous tunnels" and "hidden chambers" without spatial choreography or environmental constraint shaping a single choice. The zinc plate and gilded scripts are mentioned but never handled on the page in a way that alters tactics. Micro-setting (the cluttered studio) does not return or charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.1)
    The bluff, clouds, and sculpture are described lyrically but never constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. Sensory detail defaults to visual glistening and generic "gentle hum"; no body-state, tool-friction, or spatial choreography that pressures action. The iceberg fragment is introduced late as a passive aesthetic object rather than a meaningful constraint. Setting functions as backdrop, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.1)
    The glass dome and desert roses are vividly established and return at closure, charging the final image with renewed beauty. The fire's intensity and the enclosure's claustrophobia pressure Aria's actions in the middle beats. Spatial choreography (Aria moving among enclosures, surveying aftermath) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.1)
    The vibrant courtyard is mentioned repeatedly but functions as generic backdrop; dawn light, bird chirping, and "gentle hum of morning activity" are stock descriptors without POV filter or tactical constraint. The thrift store and mailbox appear but do not shape Emilia's choices—she could conduct the same inquiry in any setting. The locket's physical presence (intricate details, faded photographs, inscription) is described but never handled in a second beat or used to alter a decision, missing the micro-setting option.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.1)
    The sunken laboratory is anchored with sensory detail (saltwater, decay, rusting equipment) and the spider's web offers a purposeful image. However, the setting does not constrain choice or supply resources that alter Aria's tactics; she moves freely without spatial friction. The micro-setting elements (dice, journal) are handled but do not pressure her decisions in a way that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.1)
    The salt crystal chamber is vividly described ("glittering crystalline structures," "gleaming silence," "ethereal glow") and the subterranean chamber has clear atmosphere. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the tunnels and chamber do not constrain the lighter's choices or supply resources that alter tactics. The whale on the shore bookends the narrative but does not pressure action. The coffee grounds ritual and the crystal are present but do not shape the lighter's approach—they deliver information and resolution without spatial friction.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.1)
    The nocturnal haven, brook, and flowers are described vividly but never constrain a choice or alter tactics; the summoner could perform the same ritual anywhere. Spatial choreography (sitting, walking to brook edge, releasing wing) is minimal and generic. Sensory detail (scent, rustle, glow) decorates rather than pressuring the stake, and the origami wing's physical handling lacks tactile specificity that would charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.4)
    The rooftop garden and meteor shower provide atmospheric grounding, and the antique desk seal receives physical attention twice (opening and closing). However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the environment doesn't constrain a choice or charge the final image in a way that alters tactics. The city lights and blooming flowers remain decorative rather than integral to the dramatic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.1)
    The velvet garden at twilight is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (shadows "like ethereal ballerinas," "velvet flowers"), but it functions primarily as backdrop. The seashell—discovered among the flowers, held on a bench, carried out—operates as setting-proxy and constrains one micro-choice (to sit and listen), meeting the micro-setting allowance. However, the garden does not pressure the final decision to leave; Lyra's transformation occurs through internal summary rather than spatial constraint or resource.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.1)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, candles, and stalactites supply vivid atmospheric detail filtered through a consistent authorial lens. However, none of these elements constrains a choice or charges the final image—they remain postcard description. The heritage rose thorn and the key are mentioned but never used tactically. Spatial choreography is coherent and sensory selection (scent of parchment, pearl twilight hue) adds texture, keeping the score in mid-band despite the lack of causal setting work.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.1)
    The "serpentine nexus under starlight" and "whispering seashell half" are named but never anchored in concrete spatial or sensory detail that constrains action. No body, tool, or environment meaningfully pressures a choice or alters tactics. Descriptions are atmospheric but generic—"universe hums," "stars closer," "morning dew"—without POV-filtered specificity or causal involvement in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=5.1)
    The candle-lit shrine and glacier ice provide vivid texture ("frozen floor," "melting ice scent"), and the melted snow globe is handled twice (touched, then carried out). However, setting never constrains a choice—Aria could conduct this vision anywhere. The final walk onto "the glacier's vast expanse" arrives too late to pressure tactics, reading as postcard backdrop rather than lived constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    Setting is vivid and atmospheric (whispering parapet, mist, fireflies, moon path, gardens), anchoring who/where/when clearly. The bamboo tea whisk and moon path function as symbolic objects but do not materially constrain choice or alter tactics. Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through the philosopher's perceptual frame, though they serve contemplation rather than pressure. The micro-setting (stone bench, water) supports the final beat but does not drive it.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.6)
    The wasteland orchard is vivid in its setup ("radioactive dust storms," "twisted rows of trees"), but after the opening it becomes a passive backdrop rather than a constraint that shapes choice. Dust storms "howl and buffet" Aria but don't alter her path or tactics. The "strange, pulsating glow" charges the final image slightly, yet the environment's role in the closure is purely scenic. Spatial choreography is coherent; sensory selection is adequate but not filtered through urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.1)
    The cobalt glass portico and stormlit observatory are mentioned repeatedly but never constrain a choice or alter tactics. Spatial choreography is absent—no body, tool, or environment pressure. Sensory detail is generic ("winds howling," "tempest raging") and filtered through declaration rather than POV-specific perception. The setting functions as backdrop, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.4)
    The loft, music box, and glass jars supply vivid anchors and the "feral" modifier recurs purposefully. Sensory detail is present but generic ("grimy windows," "dusty relics"). The dunes appear only in the penultimate paragraph as external postcard, not as a constraint that shapes any choice. The music box winds and plays, charging one reflective beat, meeting the micro-setting allowance; the loft itself remains backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.1)
    The drift-ice marina, weathered cabin, and lighthouse are anchored early with vivid sensory detail (ice creak, golden light, gull cry). Setting description dominates the text yet remains postcard: no spatial constraint alters Azure's path, no environmental feature complicates the artifact procedure. The final image invokes the lighthouse as symbol without tying its physical properties to a choice or cost, missing the micro-setting constraint that would lift the score into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.1)
    Basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are named and visually sketched (metal curves, raindrops, silver glow) but remain postcard backdrops. The viaduct "hums" and "surges" atmospherically without constraining a choice or supplying a tactical resource. Sensory detail is present (cold air, snow crunch, wind whipping) but generic and filtered through summary emotion rather than goal-directed perception. No tool, body state, or environmental feature alters the mapper's options at the closure beat, keeping the setting functional but ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    The subway tunnel is anchored early with sensory detail (damp earth, decay, dripping water, graffiti, rusty pipes) and the lantern provides recurring concrete imagery. The inscription "Free at last" is discovered and charged with meaning at the closure. However, the environment never constrains a choice—Maya moves freely without spatial challenge, and the setting functions as mood rather than obstacle. The lantern's "rich history" is told rather than demonstrated through specific mechanics or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.1)
    The shop setting is described vividly ("gentle ticking," "grimy windows," "brass components glinting") but remains backdrop—no tool, object, or spatial feature constrains a choice or charges the final image. The clockwork heart is observed, not handled or used to alter tactics. Sensory detail is present but does not modulate with pressure or reflect the chaplain's professional lens. The music box gift appears at the end without prior spatial grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.1)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop and acid sea are vividly named and recur throughout, but neither constrains a choice or alters tactics. The kaleidoscope and arrow tip function as static props rather than tools that shape Zephyr's attempts. Sensory detail (churning acid, noxious clouds, glinting edge) remains decorative, filtered through summary ("odd sense of wonder") rather than immediate perception that pressures a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.4)
    The archive setting is evoked with "labyrinth of servers and dusty hard drives," "dimly lit room," and "rows of metadata," anchoring mood and context. The digital detritus and forgotten passwords supply a textural backdrop. However, the environment does not demonstrably constrain a choice or charge the final image—Lena navigates it without friction, and the spaceship patch and recurring numbers function as clues rather than spatial or material obstacles. Micro-setting (the patch, the servers) is present but does not alter tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes and vintage store mirrors supply vivid, recurring anchors. The mirrors constrain her method (she must move mirror to mirror, seeking patterns), and the reconstituted crystal charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear. However, the ice floes and orchard remain postcard backdrops; they do not pressure a choice or alter tactics. The mirrors' mechanics—how glimpses yield the crystal's pattern—stay vague, limiting their constraint value.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.1)
    The drift-ice marina is anchored early with concrete sensory detail (creaking ice, cold air, light on ice). The parasol tip is handled twice but remains ornamental—it does not constrain a choice or charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean across the dock-to-shore-to-relief-center moves. The setting supplies atmosphere but does not pressure tactics; the protagonist could perform the same emotional arc in any disaster zone.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.1)
    Autumn vineyard imagery is vivid ("golden leaves," "ripe grapes and damp earth," "weathered stone bench") and spatially coherent within the pavilion scene. However, the setting never constrains a choice or charges the final image—props like the bench and the fragment remain decorative. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) does not alter tactics; the vines' "destined mismatches" function as conceptual backdrop, not physical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sensory detail (sandalwood, myrrh, blue light) is present but generic and ornamental. Spatial choreography is vague: the "conjured clearing" and "kinetic parapet beneath the dunes" lack concrete anchoring in action or perception. The pavilion functions as backdrop without constraining choice or charging the final image. No object, tool, or environment meaningfully alters tactics or participates in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lavender field and rusted ruins are vividly rendered with sensory detail (purple hue, sweet scent, warm orange glow, rustle of leaves), and spatial choreography is clear. However, the environment remains postcard-static: no element constrains Luna's movement, alters a tactic, or charges the final image with pressure. The vines climbing the factory wall recur but function as decorative metaphor rather than shaping choice or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.4)
    Setting detail is vivid and atmospheric (aged parchment, grimy windows, stone floor). The library frames the opening mood effectively, and the transition to the city is signaled. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; the crystal's fall is noted but does not alter tactics. The shift from library to city streets is described without spatial pressure on the scholar's decision, falling short of the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.2)
    The fog sculpture garden supplies vivid sensory texture (mist, gravel crunch, statues) and the chalk/driftwood function as micro-setting objects handled across beats. The garden does not meaningfully constrain a choice or alter tactics—the prophet arranges driftwood without friction or resource scarcity. The final image ("fog closed in once more") recharges the opening mist motif with modest effect, enough to lift the score into mid-6s under the Accumulative lens, but the environment remains largely postcard backdrop. Spatial choreography is clear; no orientation debt beyond the Q2 penalty already applied.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lunar observatory setting provides initial atmosphere but functions as postcard description rather than constraint. The "thin air" and "silence of the lunar landscape" (confusing—moon or mountain?) are mentioned but never pressure a choice or alter tactics. The leaf sound contradicts the earlier "silence" and "above the clouds" mountain setting without explanation. Spatial choreography inside the observatory remains vague throughout; we never see how the structure's reinforcement works or how the space shapes Eli's movements during the tremors.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.8)
    The haven anchors locale early with sensory markers (sweet air, blooming flowers, candlelight, wooden floorboards). Micro-setting elements—the vinyl shard on Lena's lapel, the creaks woven into soundscape—are present and described. However, environment does not constrain choice or alter tactics; the haven remains postcard backdrop. The vinyl shard is handled twice (Emma's gaze, final significance claim) but does not pressure the closure moment. Setting supports atmosphere without driving story mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.1)
    The nocturnal observatory and floating isle are named early but remain postcard descriptions that never constrain a choice or supply a resource affecting outcome. The wind and stars appear in static flourishes without altering tactics. Spatial choreography is minimal—Lyra moves to a workbench once, then all action dissolves into summary. The setting does not charge the final image, capping the category below 7.0 per the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.6)
    The hedge maze and secret garden are vividly rendered with sensory detail (vibrant flowers, lush greenery, soothing sounds), and the bench functions as a discovery site for the tooth. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it serves as backdrop for reflection rather than pressuring Emilia's decisions. The spatial choreography is clear but static; she walks, stands, studies the tooth, then leaves. The garden's "mystique" and "tranquil atmosphere" support the nostalgic tone but remain ornamental to the central non-conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.1)
    The serpentine grotto, mist, damp stone bench, and sea glass are vividly described with sensory detail (scent of damp earth, tang of salt, soft luminescence). However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it functions as atmospheric backdrop. The polishing wheel appears late and is not integrated into spatial choreography or used to pressure the protagonist. Micro-setting and object-as-setting tests are not met; the grotto remains a postcard rather than a crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.1)
    The moss garden setting is described with some textural detail (vines, moss, rusting servers) and supplies the icicle pattern as a micro-setting moment. However, the environment does not constrain choice or charge the closure—it remains backdrop. The icicle pattern is ornamental: Aria kneels to admire it, but it does not alter tactics or options. Spatial choreography is clear, but the setting functions as postcard description rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=3.1)
    The "feral nexus" remains an abstraction without spatial anchors, sensory hierarchy, or physical constraint. The mist "swirls" decoratively in opening and closing without altering tactics or access. The shell is described visually but never handled, moved, or used to constrain a choice. No body, tool, or environment constrains the protagonist's options or charges the final image—setting functions as atmospheric wallpaper.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.1)
    The verdant arbor is anchored with vivid sensory detail (dew, hum of insects, vine tendril) and the vine physically touches Elara's wrist, providing tactile grounding. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; the arbor functions as scenic backdrop rather than pressure. The device's "tiny gears and cogs" and "vibrational frequency" remain generic without craft specificity. Spatial choreography is vague—villagers "gather around" without clear positions or distance affecting the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.4)
    The withered orchard and subarctic crater are vividly drawn ("morbid perfume," "trees standing like sentinels"), and the storybook plate is handled across multiple beats. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it functions as atmospheric backdrop. The gravel crunch and twilight modulate mood but do not charge the final image or shape the outcome, keeping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    The marble cavern, luminescent crystals, and clockwork device are vividly described and recur across beats. The crystals function as a study tool ("reflection angles") and later as "approving friends," but this remains atmospheric rather than constraining a choice. The spatial choreography (tunnels, approach, working, departure) is clear. However, the setting does not pressure Elian's tactics or alter his options; it serves as backdrop for solitary work rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.1)
    The bronze grotto and starlight are signaled early and return at the end, providing spatial consistency. However, the setting remains postcard description—luminescent fungi, damp earth, morning mist—without constraining a single choice or altering tactics. The kerosene lamp burner is lit mid-scene but does not affect action; the loom and threads are described without showing how environment or tool shapes the weaving. Micro-setting potential (body, tool, object) is untapped.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.7)
    The rain-beaded skylight, kettle, stove, and ash wood create a coherent micro-setting with sensory layering (rain sound, tea aroma, wood grain, scraping tool). The loft filters perception through the widow's craft focus, and the carving blank constrains her hands and attention across multiple beats. The setting does not decisively narrow a choice or charge the final image—it supports rather than pressures—but the recurring wood and kettle anchor the ritual structure and ground the ending tableau, qualifying for mid-band recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lagoon is vivid in palette ("blues and whites mirrored") but remains a postcard without spatial constraints—no distance, access, or physicality that shapes the scavenger's path. The camera wheel clicks and whirrs but never constrains a choice. Sensory detail is visual-only and static; "fractured stillness" is asserted repeatedly without modulation. The final photograph charges the closure image slightly, lifting the score into mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.6)
    The abandoned spaceport is established early with concrete details (crookedly hung signs, rusting pipes, dusty surfaces). However, the environment functions as postcard backdrop rather than tactical constraint: Maya encounters no locked valves, missing parts, or spatial obstacles that force choices or alter her restoration sequence. The "maze of intentions" etched on walls/ceilings is described but never used to block or enable an action. The sextant piece sits inert in her pocket until a late, ornamental mention.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory detail is present and purposeful: "petrichor nostalgia," "crystal whispering forecourt," "glacial hush" establish atmosphere. The clock tower, courtyard, and pond provide spatial coherence. However, setting does not constrain a key choice or charge the final image; the sanctuary remains backdrop rather than pressure. The "excruciatingly gentle" bear and the wet stones are vivid but do not alter Elian's tactics or outcome. Micro-setting (the clock mechanism, the courtyard stones) appears but does not foreclose options or participate in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.1)
    The twilight canal setting is evocatively described ("warm orange glow," "scent of damp earth and decaying vegetation") but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. No environmental feature pressures a choice or alters tactics; Lyra moves through "twisted waterways" without spatial or material friction. The sundial's emergence from "silt and debris" is told, not shown through excavation or tool use. Sensory detail remains atmospheric rather than actionable.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.1)
    Setting detail is vivid (golden dock, snow, fog, salt scent) but remains primarily atmospheric postcard. The dock, rope, and fulgurite glass do not constrain a choice or alter tactics; they decorate rather than pressure. Spatial choreography is clear, but the environment never forces a decision or charges the final image—she simply leaves when done, with fog as backdrop rather than obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.1)
    The shadowed autumn garden supplies vivid sensory detail (damp earth, decaying leaves, lunar glow transformation) and the carpet/thread functions as a recurring object. However, the garden does not constrain a single choice or alter tactics; it remains backdrop for meditation. The carpet is handled (touched, clutched) but does not enable or block an action with consequence. Micro-setting potential exists but is not leveraged for pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.6)
    The suspended palace and stalactites are vividly sketched but remain postcard elements; they do not constrain a single choice or alter tactics. The egg is handled once with a trembling hand but never used or revisited to charge the closure. Spatial choreography within the palace is vague—no sense of distance, access, or how the device's assembly interacts with the space.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.1)
    The obsidian lagoon and volcanic beach are named but function as postcard backdrops without constraining choice or shaping tactics. Sensory detail ("kelp-drift peace," "sweet scent of wet earth") is atmospheric but does not pressure Aria's actions. The black sand pouch and coin are mentioned as talismans without altering access, proximity, or spatial logic. Spatial choreography is coherent but the environment never narrows her options or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.1)
    Setting is vividly rendered with consistent sensory detail (dry fountains, dusty streets, glittering glass shards, hidden doorways). The city's forgotten state remains coherent throughout, and the final image of flowing fountains reconfigures the initial dryness. However, the environment never constrains a choice or forces a tactical trade-off; it functions as vivid backdrop rather than active pressure. Spatial choreography is clear and anchored, meeting baseline needs but not charging the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.6)
    The nebula garden supplies vivid sensory anchors (tendrils, cosmic dust, diffuse light) and spatial choreography is consistent, but the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics. The calculating machine gear and sonar pinging apparatus could function as micro-setting objects but remain inert—handled once, never used to solve a problem or charge the final image. Description is filtered through the sentimentalist's contemplative stance yet remains postcard-level without pressure-driven selectivity.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ancient greenhouse at dusk is vividly anchored with tropical plants, headstones, and lunar glow, filtered through the carver's professional POV. Spatial choreography remains clear across the scene. The setting provides atmosphere and frames the butterfly arrival, which charges the final image, but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—the carver works, then stops, then sits. The greenhouse functions as backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.6)
    The tidal obsidian ridge is vividly described but functions as backdrop rather than constraint or resource. Spatial choreography is coherent (tower to shore to horizon), and sensory detail is present ("salt and seaweed," "wind-sculpted trees"), but the setting does not alter Elara's choices or charge the final image. The clock tower and pendulum remain static symbols rather than lived-in tools.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cobalt silo and starlight are vivid but postcard-static; they do not constrain a choice or supply resources that alter outcome. Spatial choreography inside the silo is vague (no body-positioning or tool-handling that matters to escalation). The recurring "lavender sachets" and "velveteen gloom" are atmospheric labels without on-page pressure work, though the silo's presence in the opening and closing offers minimal lyric framing.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.8)
    The frozen lake and obsidian spire anchor location clearly and recur throughout, providing visual coherence. However, neither environment constrains a choice or charges the final image—they remain picturesque backdrops. The kingfisher feather quill nib is handled (attached to pen), giving tactile specificity, but the object doesn't alter tactics or create friction. Sensory detail is present but decorative rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ember alcove, mist, shortwave radio dial, and dust motes are vividly rendered with consistent sensory detail. The radio dial's glow and the swirling dust anchor multiple beats and contribute atmospheric texture. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Emilia's actions would play identically in any isolated workspace. The mist outside "swirls in anticipation" but remains scenic rather than pressuring her decisions, preventing entry into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.1)
    The vanishing point gallery is named and the mask's "powder-coated surface of the frame" supplies tactile detail, but setting functions primarily as backdrop. The charcoal and powder return at the scattering beat, where Lena "powders the remaining charcoal"—a concrete action that charges the final image with ephemeral texture. Spatial choreography (Lena before the portrait, Eli approaching) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sewer and sunken city ruins are vividly anchored early with sensory specifics: "stench of rot and decay," "waterlogged tomb of steel and stone." The chronometer cog is handled twice (found, turned over), giving it physical presence. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric; it does not constrain a choice or shape the final image—Kael's smile and contemplation are internal, unaffected by spatial or material pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.1)
    The velvet library and autumn light anchor setting early with sensory specificity ("kaleidoscope of colors," "soft glow of the table lamp"). The zither rosette receives focused description that subtly mirrors Emilia's harmonizing goal. However, the environment remains postcard-static; no tool, spatial constraint, or recurring object alters a choice or charges the final image—the library functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than dramatized pressure on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.1)
    The rusted greenhouse is vividly sketched with sensory detail (vines, corroded beams, ethereal light). However, spatial choreography remains vague—Aria's movements through the space are not tracked, and the environment does not constrain a single choice or charge the final image. The seed pot and alignment light remain postcard description rather than tools that alter tactics. Micro-setting test not met; cap at 8.8 ineligible.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "lightning collection tower" and its machinery provide a vivid backdrop, and the blackout context gives the setting conceptual weight. However, the tower's environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics on the page; the toll keeper and woman ascend without obstacle, and the beehive's physical disarray is observed but does not pressure the investigation. Sensory detail is decorative ("sweet scent of blooming flowers," "soft hum of machinery") rather than filtered through urgent POV priorities. The lacquer box and matchbox are handled, but spatial choreography during the inspection remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "quiet bay in spring" and shop are sketched with pleasant but generic detail (blooming flowers, soft lapping waves, warm orange glow). The orris root shard's "delicate, creamy hue and intricate patterns" is described but never handled in a way that constrains action. Spatial choreography during the house ritual is vague—no sense of distance, objects placed, or how the house's perimeter is navigated. The shard appears in the final paragraph but as a passive token rather than a tool that charges the image.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.1)
    The underwater garden setting is visually specific ("coral and anemones," "foxglove-stained glass ampoule") and anchors early. However, the environment remains decorative—no current, depth, visibility constraint, or physical property of water meaningfully alters a choice or tactic. The ampoule "drifts lazily" and is caught without resistance; spatial choreography (statue on pedestal, fish movements) is present but passive. The setting charges atmosphere but does not constrain action or shape the closure image with tactical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.1)
    The infinite staircase is described repeatedly but never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it remains a static backdrop. Sensory detail is sparse and generic ("dim light," "narrow windows," "stone and shadow"). The dice appear as held objects but their physical handling is not integrated into spatial choreography. The setting provides atmosphere but does not function as a crucible for decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.1)
    Rooftop greenhouse and smog are anchored early and the moon recurs across beats, but setting remains postcard-descriptive rather than constraint-active. The brush is handled once; no tool, spatial fact, or environmental feature alters a choice or charges the closure image. Sensory detail defaults to visual cataloging ("ethereal glow," "silver glow") without urgency modulation or POV bias.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.1)
    The grotto city setting is vividly described (luminescent fungi, frozen chamber, rough stone walls) and anchors the story spatially. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains postcard description without pressure. The emerald-tinted opera glass lens is mentioned three times but never handled or used to affect Elena's perception or decision. Sensory detail is filtered through generic tour-guide observation rather than POV-specific urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lighthouse, rocky island, and low tide frame the action, and sensory details (salt, seaweed, candlelight, wind) are present. However, the environment never constrains a choice—the clock maker navigates "dimly lit corridors" and finds hidden compartments without friction. Spatial choreography is vague (we never learn the lighthouse's layout or how deep "the depths" are). The setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.4)
    The funhouse setting provides vivid Gothic detail (tattered banner, dusty dream dictionary, cracked mirror) and is present across beats. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—the protagonist moves freely through corridors without spatial friction. The opera cloak clasp and poster are described but do not pressure decisions. Micro-setting allowance partially met through recurring objects, but they remain ornamental rather than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.1)
    The orchard-on-driftwood image is vivid and consistently rendered across beats, and the blue-hour sky anchors mood. However, the setting remains postcard-descriptive; it does not constrain a choice or charge the closure. The driftwood circle is mentioned repeatedly but never alters tactics or options—it creaks gently, an atmospheric detail without consequence. Micro-setting allowance (body, tool, object) is present (xylophone mallet handled twice), lifting the score slightly, but setting never pressures the protagonist's path.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.1)
    The turtle-shell city is vivid and specific (patterns etched into shells, oldest quarter's worn surfaces). The cracking shell mechanism constrains Lyra's discovery and advances plot. Spatial choreography is clean through narrow streets and the city's edge. The setting charges the final image—Lyra leaving the shells behind, watchers looming—making it indispensable to the closure's visual weight. Sensory detail is selective (sun beating down, dust settling) and filtered through Lyra's cartographer lens. The gate of environment shaping a choice is met when the shell's crack reveals the hidden compartment.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.8)
    The railway station is vividly described (ivy as skeletal fingers, crumbling walls, grimy windows) but remains postcard scenery. The hidden room's location is convenient rather than earned through spatial problem-solving. The ivy recurs but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it "presses in" then "relaxes" without causal force. Sensory detail is present (damp earth, decay) but filtered generically rather than through Emilia's professional historian's priorities. The station does not pressure the work or supply resources that affect the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.1)
    The submerged pavilion is vividly anchored with selective sensory detail (silt, aquatic life, stonework) and the drawbridge signals temporal transition. However, the environment functions primarily as scenic backdrop rather than constraining choice or charging the final image. The inkwell is handled once (retrieved) but does not alter tactics or shape the ending beyond symbolic presence. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.8)
    The forgotten library and antique ink stamp are established early and described with concrete detail (dusty tomes, aged paper, ornate handle). The stamp is handled multiple times and leaves a visible mark, satisfying micro-setting criteria. However, the environment does not constrain choice or materially affect outcome—Elara's decryption proceeds unhindered by the water, darkness, or blackout. The stamp's "deep, rich blue" impression charges the final beats modestly, but spatial choreography and the sunken city remain largely postcard description without tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.1)
    The floating-island setting and glass basilica supply vivid atmospheric detail, and the filigree of lanterns at the garden's edge provides spatial grounding for the final beat. However, environment never constrains a choice: Kaito could perform identical actions in any workshop. Sensory detail (clouds, mist, orange glow) remains decorative rather than filtered through urgent POV priorities. The tea garden functions as backdrop, not crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.1)
    The wedding wreckage is anchored through "scent of smoke and blood" and tactile geode touch. The Floating Observatory is described generically ("gentle hum," "soft glow") without spatial choreography or constraint. Circuit breakers cooling is mentioned but never shown to limit Amira's movement or choices. The geode crystal returns frequently but as talisman rather than environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    The observatory setting supplies vivid selective detail ("aged dust," "brilliant dimness," stars as "celestial map") filtered through Lena's astronomical lens. The carvings function as a puzzle rather than a spatial constraint on choice. The hidden compartment and console are props that enable rather than resist. Sensory hierarchy shifts appropriately (dim chamber → night sky), and the "brilliant dimness" motif recurs to charge the final image. However, the environment never forces a tactical trade-off or complicates her search—it remains a backdrop that cooperates fully.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt terrace and forgotten shore are evoked with some sensory specificity (salt, decay, driftwood), and the watch hand recurs. However, spatial choreography is loose—terrace, table, shore, and return path never cohere into a legible map. The carvings are handled on the page and one (woman's face) triggers memory, meeting the micro-setting threshold. This interaction constrains the protagonist's attention and primes the closure move, lifting the score into the 6-band despite the lack of occupational or world-rule grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.6)
    The parapet, mist, and moon are vividly evoked and anchored early. However, the environment never constrains a tactical choice or alters the negotiator's options—it remains atmospheric backdrop. The antique drawer pull sits on a pedestal and is pocketed but does not shape an action. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven, but the setting does not charge the final image or force a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.6)
    The coastal kayak launch and utility poles anchor the scene spatially. The broken compass is handled twice (on ground, clutched at end) but does not constrain a middle choice. Sensory detail is generic (golden glow, sea sparkled) and filtered through summary rather than Jack's professional navigator lens. The poles function as a navigational device but their physical presence does not pressure a tactic or charge the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.1)
    The underground bioluminescent lake is vividly described with sensory specificity (mist, glow, dripping water), but it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice or enabling tactics. Spatial choreography is clear (dock → shore → edge → hidden path) and the setting's "otherworldly energy" is consistent, yet no environmental detail alters Lena's options or charges the closure image. The ball half-buried in dirt and the revealed path are the closest to micro-setting integration, earning functional credit without reaching the gate for choice constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.1)
    The orchard and permanent moonlight establish atmosphere early, and sensory anchors (spices, luminescence, silvery glow) recur at key beats. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the trees, fruits, and moonlight do not constrain Lyra's ritual choices or supply tactical obstacles. Spatial choreography (gathering beasts, lighting spices, apparition forming) remains clear but generic. The final image ("bathed in the moonlight") is a postcard moment rather than an environmental element that charges the closure with cost or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.1)
    The midnight glade, mist, and ozone are vividly described and establish atmospheric consistency. The dolls' tea-set saucer appears as a static object beside the protagonist but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as symbol rather than spatial pressure. Micro-setting (the body, the saucer, the book) is present but ornamental—removing any would not change the cartomancer's decision path or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.1)
    The recycled spaceship is described but never constrains a choice or alters tactics; Aurora floats through it without friction. The storage bay and photographs are static backdrops. Spatial choreography is vague (where exactly is she stitching, what is the bay's layout?). The Kwan Yin's Tear object recurs and changes state with her mood, providing the strongest setting-adjacent detail that charges the final image, lifting the score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.1)
    The black sand beach and active volcano anchor early but remain postcard description—vibrant setting details never constrain a choice or alter tactics. The rock formation and bottle are handled as symbols rather than objects with physical properties that matter. Sensory selection is generic ("whispering hush," "pulsing light") without POV-specific filtering or urgency modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.1)
    The fort is anchored by twilight and blackout, and the sundial's shadow pattern provides one moment of spatial constraint that matters to the decoding beat. However, most setting detail is abstract ("luminous fort," "ancient structures," "ethereal light") without tactile specificity or POV filter. The blackout as timeframe pressure is declared but not felt; no fumbling, mis-steps, or resource limits emerge from the darkness. The cradle's glow is described but does not alter tactics or complicate movement.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sensory detail is vivid ("salt and ozone," "aurora-lit horizon") and the tidal bluff is signaled early. However, the environment never constrains a choice—the herder works "with deliberate slowness" but no weather, tide, or physical obstacle alters tactics. The painted rocks and stardust remain postcard elements rather than tools that shape the outcome. Spatial choreography is clear, preventing a lower score.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.1)
    The stormlit observatory and churning clouds provide vivid visual anchors, and the darkroom timer offers tactile grounding. However, the setting remains postcard-descriptive—wind, lightning, darkness—without constraining a single choice or altering tactics. The bus timetable and envelope are named but not spatially choreographed (where does she pull them from? how does wind affect handling?). No occupational detail (observatory instruments, access) or micro-geography (rail, door, interior layout) shapes her actions, leaving the location ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glass atrium and brook anchor the opening cleanly. Sensory detail (sunlight through panes, gurgling water, scent of metal and sweat) is present but largely ornamental—none of it constrains a choice or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.0)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse is concretely evoked through damp earth, decaying plants, grimy panes, and flood-borne sediment, creating a coherent, lived-in space. These details are filtered through Maria’s pattern- and decay-obsessed perception, which ties environment to theme. The butterfly wing and dust function as recurring micro-setting objects that charge the atmosphere and final image, though they don’t strongly constrain action. The world feels specific and tonally aligned, even if the setting’s influence on choice is limited.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.2)
    The canyon, stars, and morning frost are consistently evoked and do create a gentle, coherent atmosphere. The frost patterns echo the coded ledger in a thematically neat way, especially as she walks “guided” by them. However, the environment rarely constrains her options or behavior; it’s more backdrop and metaphor than an active setting. Many descriptors (quiet canyon, ethereal light, warm glow) are pleasant but generic, limiting distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    The winterglass conservatory is vividly and consistently rendered, from frosted panes and heating hum to light-spectrum shifts and plants that “lean in” at the end. Details are well integrated into action and mood rather than feeling like a static tour. The contrast of external chill and internal shelter mirrors the survivor’s emotional arc and charges the final image of her carrying the conservatory’s “music” out into the cold. While the setting doesn’t strictly constrain choices, it meaningfully shapes tone and the thematic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.8)
    The underwater city library, luminescent creatures, and the humming device provide a distinctive, atmospheric backdrop. Descriptions like the eerie stillness of the abandoned halls are evocative, but they rarely shape or limit his choices in specific, tactile ways. Much of the setting work leans on broad strokes (“labyrinthine structure,” “tomes bound in a material that shimmered like the moon”) rather than lived-in detail tied to action. The final image with musty books and soft glow is strong but could be sharpened with more concrete, character-filtered specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.5)
    The terra-cotta arbor, lantern light, and ridge at night provide a coherent, pleasantly atmospheric frame, and late details like the scent of blooming flowers and the clang of a pot deepen that mood. However, the setting rarely shapes choices or constrains actions—it functions mainly as backdrop and symbol rather than as a live environment with stakes. Most sensory input is visual and general rather than sharply filtered through Akira’s particular priorities. The bell is the only object that edges toward charged micro-setting, but even it stops short of affecting tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    The twilight viaduct in bloom is vividly rendered—wisteria, ethereal light, muffled city sounds—all clearly filtered through Aria’s sensibility. The setting sustains a consistent atmosphere that supports the “foggy lucidity” tone, and the recurring blossoms and city lights feed the final benediction image. However, the environment remains mostly decorative; it doesn’t constrain her choices or tactics, only mirrors her interiority. The camera obscura and physical specifics of the viaduct’s structure are lightly sketched rather than fully inhabited as tools/constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    The living bridge garden is sensorially vivid at the start—mist, birds, flowers, dappled light—and gives the piece a tangible locus. After the opening, though, the setting mostly freezes into backdrop while the prose turns inward and abstract. The environment rarely constrains or enables choices; it frames mood rather than interacting with action. Still, the consistency of tone between setting and metaphysical subject matter works reasonably well.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.2)
    The abandoned carnival prize center and the piano bench offer the most vivid, sensory setting work (“faint scent of sugar and smoke,” “keys yellowed with age”). Beyond that, environments (rubble-strewn streets, hidden vault, lush fields) are rendered in broad, almost emblematic strokes that support theme but rarely constrain or complicate choices. The world’s rules and geography stay coherent but feel thinly sketched. Setting never meaningfully presses tactics or the final choice; it mainly decorates an abstract allegory.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting elements—the sunken orchard greenhouse, shipwreck ring, ashen forge, aurora—are vivid and tonally cohesive, and the forge’s whispers conceptually mirror Lyra’s work with sound and absence. However, these details are largely atmospheric; the environment doesn’t constrain her options or materially shape tactics beyond aesthetic inspiration. The forge is hinted to hold a “key” but never actually affects a decision. Still, the specificity and integration with mood are strong for a lyric piece.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    The emerald station, golden sunset shifting to moonlight, and the jar of moonbeams create a vivid, unified atmosphere that clearly places us in space and time. Details like the bouquet on the bench and the “silver glow over the emerald station” are consistent and sensorially concrete, even if heavily visual. The setting supports the magical-realism tone but doesn’t materially constrain choice or tactics; the station could be almost any liminal place without altering the plot. Still, as a textural engine for mood, it works strongly.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    The abandoned control room, cracked panes, dust-coated consoles, and melting ice are vividly rendered with multisensory detail and a coherent atmosphere. The environment reflects the thaw/renewal theme effectively, and recurring elements like light through broken glass enrich the final image. However, the setting remains largely decorative; the fact that it is a control room, as opposed to any ruin, never constrains choices or tactics. The strong description doesn’t quite translate into functional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.8)
    The “rusted library under the stars” and dusty shelves offer an evocative opening image, and the whispering seashell adds a faint uncanny texture. Yet the environment is mostly static backdrop: the rust, stars, and library architecture don’t constrain movement or materially influence decisions. Setting details are serviceable but could belong to many stories with minimal change, and they don’t evolve as his inner state shifts beyond the final walk into a vague “brighter future.” The seashell edges toward micro-setting, but its unique properties never force a specific choice.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ridge fort, storm, candles, and thickened darkness are sensually vivid and consistent, giving the story a strong, immersive atmosphere. Details like the creaking walls and candles burning down are well chosen and reinforce tone instead of feeling like a tourist catalog. However, the environment almost never constrains choice or tactics—the same events could occur in any isolated chamber during a storm. As a result, setting is beautifully rendered but more decorative than structurally decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    The frozen courtyard at twilight and the ice-crystal violin are vividly and consistently evoked, giving the story a clear, unified atmosphere. Details like the pale blue glow, the crunch of mechanical feet on frost, and the glowing violin effectively mirror Zeta's contemplative state. The environment, however, rarely constrains behavior or tactics; it functions more as mood than as active pressure. The final image of Zeta and the violin in the frozen courtyard does carry some charged resonance and helps anchor closure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    The “crystal whispering forecourt after the rain” is vivid and sensorial, with wet stone, crystal structures, and a monolith reflecting the starry sky. The environment consistently mirrors her internal state (hush, clarity, transparency) and recurs effectively at the end. However, the setting remains mostly atmospheric; it doesn’t materially constrain options or force specific actions beyond providing surfaces to reflect and “whisper.” It’s strong mood work, but not yet fully integrated as a structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    The garden maze is sensorially and tonally vivid—towering hedges, twisting paths, scents of bloom and wither—and the marbles as recurring objects effectively charge the final image. The environment mirrors the thematic cycle of life and decay and creates a strong atmosphere of secluded devotion. However, the setting rarely constrains action or choice; the maze quality is more symbolic than functional. Still, it’s a memorable, coherently rendered backdrop that supports the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    The xenobiology station, twilight atmosphere, and iridescent nexus are vividly rendered, with consistent visual mood and some tactile detail (“sterile atmosphere,” “soft, blue light”). Setting is more atmospheric than functional, but the simulator and nexus do act as concrete loci of action. The alien landscape fragment post-transition is brief yet clear enough to re-anchor space. However, the xenobiological angle and winged creatures remain largely decorative rather than constraining choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.0)
    The flooded opera house, lapping water, and flickering lanterns are vividly evoked and remain consistent throughout, giving the piece a strong atmosphere. The setting is integrated with action when Rachel tilts the program and uses the water as a medium to reveal images, tying environment to method. Still, the environment rarely constrains her choices or introduces real hazard; it’s more mood than pressure. The final image of lanterns and water echoing La Bohème effectively charges the ending, but mostly at a tonal level.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mountain weather station is vividly evoked—the mists, ozone, metal grating, and automated systems create a tangible, liminal place. Setting details like the observation deck, logbook, and botanical illustration are well-integrated with Aria’s mental state and the thematic focus on margins and uncertainty. The environment, however, mostly supports mood rather than constraining choices or tactics; the weather and machinery don’t significantly alter what she can or must do. Still, the station and peaks meaningfully charge the final image of her vanishing into the landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.1)
    The abandoned tunnel and rusted train cars are vividly evoked with smell (“decay and rust”) and sound (echoing footsteps), and the atmosphere is consistently gloomy and industrial. Setting is integrated into action—walking, stumbling on the logbook, handling the valve wheel—rather than as static description. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or tactics; it colors the experience more than it shapes decisions. The beaded valve wheel has potential as a charged object but isn’t meaningfully reweighted by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story’s strongest asset: the overgrown library, catacombs, damp earth, crystals, and “crumbling peace” build a clear, moody atmosphere. Sensory details (aged parchment, damp earth, faint tang of forgotten memories) are specific and consistently filtered through the keeper’s contemplative gaze. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or introduces new possibilities beyond general mood; it’s backdrop and echo rather than an active engine of change. Strong for tone, somewhat underused for pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is evocative—“Sage Ridge,” cicadas, lunar glow, and the eclipse build a cohesive, gentle atmosphere. Details like “sage-scented breeze” and “hush of dreaming roots” give the piece a sensory signature. However, the environment doesn’t really constrain choices or tactics; it frames mood rather than driving action. The recurring ridge and eclipse imagery do help charge the final tone, but mostly at a decorative rather than structural level.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.2)
    The reclaimed silo library, dust, old books, and “bronze quiet” create a consistent, mildly evocative atmosphere. However, the setting functions mostly as backdrop and metaphor; it rarely constrains Emilia’s choices or changes what is possible. Sensory detail leans heavily on smell and vague visuals, with recurrent but static phrases (“scent of old books and dust”). The environment feels coherent but underutilized as an active force in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.0)
    The lighthouse, rocky island, and emptied tavern create a coherent moody backdrop, and the recurring lighthouse image books the piece nicely. However, the setting often reads as label-level (“mysterious lighthouse,” “otherworldly energy”) rather than embodied through specific sensory detail. The environment does not constrain choices or tactics; the same scene could occur in almost any lonely building at night. The final lighthouse-as-sentinel image supports tone but doesn’t add new pressure or reweight the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.0)
    “Dimensional anchor” plus sandalwood, myrrh, and the single blue on the palette create an evocative, almost liturgical atmosphere. However, the setting stays abstract and static; we rarely see the priest physically inhabiting or constrained by this place. The anchor and scents feel like poetic backdrops rather than environments that shape his options.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, and mirrored horizon are vividly rendered and recur in ways that clearly charge the atmosphere and final image. The environment is filtered through the writer’s artistic sensibility, with reflection and symmetry echoing their inner quest. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, the mirrored horizon and dawn light are tightly bound to the story’s meaning and closure. Description occasionally leans toward ornamental repetition, but spatial and tonal anchoring remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.7)
    The opening image of the glowing viaduct after rain, the misty city, and wet-earth/ozone scent is evocative and anchors place and mood effectively. Later, the environment becomes more abstract (“deep, rich darkness that seemed to pulse with an inner light”), losing some tactile specificity. The setting rarely constrains choices or affects tactics; it functions mainly as atmospheric backdrop. Still, the viaduct/city/darkness motif frames beginning and end in a visually coherent way.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drum maker’s cavern is sensory and specific: damp earth, cut wood, scattered tools, and womb-like imagery give it atmosphere and thematic heft. The setting coherently supports the idea of a sanctuary where sound and silence blur and where Aria can feel vibrations rather than hear. However, the environment rarely constrains concrete choices; it is more symbolic container than active pressure. Still, its recurrence meaningfully charges the final stasis of her remaining there.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.8)
    The courtyard at dusk is anchored with sensory detail (rustling leaves, crickets, scent of flowers, deepening darkness), creating a gentle, consistent atmosphere. However, the setting functions mostly as backdrop; it rarely constrains options or is used tactically by the character. Repetitions of tranquility and stillness border on generic, and the environmental menace (looming trees) is gestured at without payoff. The final image reprises the courtyard and stars but doesn’t reweight them in a strikingly new way.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.4)
    The greenhouse for extinct plants, the ultraviolet lights, and the scented air are vividly evoked and well-matched to the story’s concerns with memory and fragility. Details like hidden patterns revealed under UV and “crystal shadows” charge the atmosphere and return in the final image. The setting mostly functions as a lyrical backdrop rather than a constraint on choice, but it does meaningfully color Elara’s perceptions and the thematic frame. More tactile interaction with the space (beyond observation) could further elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    The terra-cotta grotto under starlight is vivid and consistent: rust-red stone, flickering light, tactile rock surfaces, and the sense of a nexus of times. Setting is woven into action (trailing fingers on stone, arranging small stones on the ground) rather than delivered as a static postcard. However, the environment rarely constrains her options or generates new pressures; it mostly mirrors theme. It charges the final image but doesn’t shape tactics strongly enough for the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific: charred rainforest, twisted trees, a “sunken orchard greenhouse” ringed by shipwrecks, and the lush interior clearing all create a strong atmosphere. Environmental details mirror the emotional arc—desolation outside versus vibrant green within—but rarely constrain her choices beyond providing a place to arrive. Still, the repeated sensorial cues (ash, glass, rust, bonfire, flowers) are well integrated and tonally coherent. The setting charges the final image of stars and blooming flowers, though mostly as mood rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    The amber grotto with luminescent stones and aged-amber scent is richly evoked and sustained throughout, giving the story its main sensory and tonal strength. Details like “softly crackling stones” and honey-like light feel specific and atmospheric. However, the setting rarely constrains action or forces choice; it is primarily backdrop and mood. It charges the final image somewhat but doesn’t actively shape the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.2)
    The seaside library under the stars is pleasantly evoked with breeze, sea smell, and old books, giving a gentle, cohesive atmosphere. However, the setting does not meaningfully constrain options or shape tactics; it’s backdrop rather than pressure. Sensory detail is front-loaded, then thins into abstraction as the story shifts to summary. The sea motif at the end gestures toward resonance but doesn’t significantly reweight the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    The crystalline orchard at the crater’s edge, the humming trees, and the “murmur of lost languages” create a distinctive and consistent atmosphere. Sensory details (glow, scent of flowers, humming) are present, though heavily biased toward visual shimmer and generalized lyricism. However, the environment rarely constrains behavior or affects tactics; the same plot could mostly unfold in any pretty, slightly uncanny grove. The setting enriches tone but doesn’t yet operate as a meaningful pressure or choice-shaping force.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    The rooftop canal between towers is a vivid, unusual image, and the city’s “fabric” and echo-laden stones add atmosphere and conceptual depth. However, the environment rarely constrains action or forces tactics; Lyra doesn’t have to navigate the canals or towers under pressure, she simply sits and works the spell. The infinity pendant functions as a quasi-micro-setting object by charging the final image, but the physical world stays largely decorative rather than active.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cavern orchard is vivid and sensorially specific—luminescent fungi, dripping stalactites, pen-and-ink branches—and it sustains a strong, coherent atmosphere. Details are well-filtered through a contemplative, ritualistic gaze, which keeps the description from feeling like a tourist catalogue. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, it does charge the glass eyes and mosaic stone with a numinous quality that supports the final images. This rich atmosphere is one of the story’s primary strengths.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    The library, pipe chases, and outage-lit city are grounded with strong, multi-sensory detail (“scent of old books and dust,” “soft, sapphire hush”), and the environment feels lived-in. Setting is consistently filtered through the dweller’s tactile, scavenger’s attention—scraps, recesses, shelves—rather than as a neutral backdrop. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or forces tactics; it functions more as atmosphere than as an active pressure. The ferromagnetic tape and hidden shelves charge the final image somewhat, but not to the level of full structural indispensability.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.5)
    The mossy trellis, raindrops, and nursery create a coherent, gentle atmosphere and recur to frame the opening and closing images. However, the setting is largely postcard-like: it mirrors theme (growth/renewal) without meaningfully constraining Emilia’s choices. Sensory detail skews visual and becomes somewhat generic and repetitive (“serene beauty,” “warm light of a new day”). Stronger use of environment as pressure or resource would lift this above competent lyric background.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=5.5)
    The tidal island and post–water wars devastation provide a moody frame—“crumbling buildings and overgrown streets”—but stay largely atmospheric. The environment rarely constrains choice or shapes tactics beyond justifying solitude. Details like “following rain trails” gesture at a specific ecology but are not deeply integrated into action. The final image leans on the glowing brooch more than on any charged evolution of setting.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.0)
    The musical crystal cave is the most vivid element, with consistent motifs of vibration, song, and luminescent crystals that create a coherent, enchanting atmosphere. However, the environment mostly decorates rather than constrains action; Aria “delves deeper” and “inhabits the depths” in a fairly generic way without concrete spatial or sensory evolution tied to specific choices. The cave does help charge the final image of “bright darkness,” but more tactile, situated detail would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.0)
    The ivory harbor and the shop interior are evoked with some concrete detail—“ivory harbor,” “mist‑shrouded alleyways,” “rusted anchors”—creating a gentle, consistent atmosphere. The setting mostly serves as mood and metaphor rather than an active constraint on choices; weather, geography, and social conditions don’t significantly alter tactics. The herald’s trumpet valve works as a recurring object that charges the final image, though its physical properties never matter beyond symbolism. Overall, atmosphere is pleasant and legible but not fully exploited for narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.5)
    The “starlit vault in mist” is atmospherically rendered, with repeating images of mist, glow, twisting corridors, and cracks in the pavement. The environment does guide movement via the arrows and the distant light, but beyond that it rarely constrains or complicates her options. Description leans heavily on the visual and on reiterated abstractions (“otherworldly,” “ethereal”) rather than fresh, specific sensory detail. Still, the vault is clearly established and coherently maintained as the story’s primary space.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tower, sea, fog, and whales create a consistent, gently numinous atmosphere, with some strong images (latticework, open tower, whale songs on the wind). However, the environment almost never constrains options or forces tactics; it’s more backdrop than active pressure. Sensory detail leans heavily on the visual and auditory in generalized terms (“haunting songs,” “otherworldly presence”) instead of concrete, POV-colored specifics. The final image of the wind through the latticework echoing the whales’ “unheard symphony” is thematically apt but still more decorative than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prismatic escondite and solar storm create a vivid, coherent visual palette, with colors and energy repeatedly evoked. However, the setting mostly decorates rather than constrains action—Kael’s choices would remain largely the same in any suitably “magical lab.” The one functional touch is that the escondite amplifies energy and becomes a “gateway to the infinite,” but that’s told rather than deeply dramatized. Atmosphere is strong; integration with stakes and tactics is moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    The funeral home prep room is vividly evoked through smell (“formaldehyde”), texture (“cold steel tables”), and lighting (lamps reflecting off the ink pot), and the atmosphere of morbid calm is consistent. The setting feels integrated with mood—“deathly vitality” is an effective encapsulation—and the environment mirrors Lena’s liminal mental state. Still, the room rarely constrains tactics or choices; it’s more tonal stage than active pressure. The ink pot functions as a micro-setting object, but mostly as symbol rather than as a practical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bonsai mountaintop, cherry blossoms, and the town below are vividly evoked, with consistent sensory layering (scent, light, sound). However, the environment rarely constrains choices or changes options; it serves atmosphere more than pressure, so the forest reads as a beautiful backdrop rather than a crucible. Still, the fluorescent lamp’s glow on miniature trees and the “labyrinth” path give the piece its most memorable specificity. The setting evolves slightly with time of day but not in a way that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.2)
    The port city’s labyrinth of shipping containers and the recurring tides provide a consistent, if somewhat generic, atmospheric frame. The poison-bottle label is a more specific image that recurs and is saved, lightly charging the final impression. However, the setting rarely constrains behavior or generates new possibilities; it’s backdrop and metaphor rather than a live environment. More tactile, selective details tied to the survivor’s goals would elevate this considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.0)
    The abandoned observatory on a cliff and the sea are vivid and recurrent, giving a clear atmospheric frame. Details like “crumbling domes and rusting telescopes” and the wind whipping her hair do good mood work but are repeated rather than deepened. The setting rarely constrains choices or alters tactics; she could perform the same ritual in almost any haunted, science-adjacent ruin. The observatory does charge the final image a bit, but mostly as backdrop rather than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.8)
    The raft city and “perpetual carnival” are vivid in premise, and details like the food stall and foundation stone chip give some texture. However, description stays broad and repetitive, leaning on generic phrases (“vibrant,” “exotic foods”) rather than specific, character-filtered observations. The environment rarely constrains choices; the story would largely work in any threatened urban community. The setting charges the opening and closing images but doesn’t evolve meaningfully through action.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lunar summit, dawn light, and delicate flora are vividly rendered, and the atmosphere of stillness and reverence is consistent and strong. Recurrent images (moonlight, craters, the grain of sand) contribute to tone and thematic texture. However, some details are physically dubious or unclarified (“breeze,” “molecules of air” on the Moon), slightly undermining credibility in a piece otherwise leaning on realism. The environment shapes mood and the need to time the photos with dawn more than it concretely constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mist-coated rail depot, fountain, and harbor create a vivid, coherent atmosphere, with sensory detail (fog, water, light, distant horns) woven throughout rather than dumped. The fountain and rainbow are nicely integrated into Emilia’s method, so setting is not purely decorative. However, the depot and trains themselves are mostly mood pieces and do not significantly constrain her choices. The closing image of mist clearing and soft, diffused light adds resonance but not a sharp reweighting of options.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and silent, snow-laden landscape are vividly and consistently rendered, giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine. Details like the wood smoke, the falcon, and the condensation on the windowpane feel organically of this place rather than generic. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics beyond providing the glass “cipher” and the literal ice to step onto at the end; weather and terrain don’t meaningfully alter her options or behavior. Still, the setting’s mood strongly supports tone and theme, even if it doesn’t fully drive choice.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.5)
    The ghost town, cobblestones, and ancient archway are vividly evoked, with a consistent sensory palette and mood of decay turning toward renewal. Details like “worn smooth by centuries of use” and the stars like “diamonds scattered across the velvet expanse” build a cohesive atmosphere. The environment supports the premise but rarely constrains action or forces choices; it is strongly scenic rather than dynamically operative. Still, for a lyric piece, the setting is specific, consistent, and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.9)
    The underwater temple, salt-and-decay air, and glowing crystals create a consistent if somewhat generic atmosphere. The crystal vial functions as a micro-setting object, lighting her way and charging the final image, which is effective. Still, the temple itself rarely constrains choices or tactics beyond mood—its “underwater” nature and physical geography don’t materially shape what she can or cannot do. The setting is evocative, but its specificity and functional integration could be sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.0)
    The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, salt-and-decay air, and confessional lattice create a vivid, coherent atmosphere, with the copper light and worn scuffs giving the place history. Setting is consistently filtered through the boy’s near-reverent gaze, which preserves tone. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or generates concrete obstacles; it’s more stage than pressure. The final image of the lattice “glow[ing] with an otherworldly light, guiding him through the darkness” does charge the ending, but again more tonally than tactically.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.5)
    The greenhouse “shrouded in endless night,” luminescent orbs, and “winter-cracked fields” create an evocative, coherent atmosphere. However, the environment rarely constrains action or meaningfully shapes choices; it’s a beautiful backdrop rather than an active pressure. The carved bead functions more like a mystical switch than a tool embedded in a tactile space. The setting’s lushness is a strength, but its role in the story’s mechanics remains mostly decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    The labyrinth, red canyon walls, and tide pools create a distinct, atmospheric space that’s consistently referenced and tonally aligned with the piece’s meditative mood. Sensory detail skews visual and abstract rather than tactilely lived-in, and the environment rarely constrains action or forces choices—it mostly reflects theme. The final image of the labyrinth “bathed in a warm, golden light” does help charge the reconfiguration from ruin to reverence. Overall, evocative but more postcard than fully operational setting.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.5)
    The catacomb orchard, roots threading through bones, and the scent of “blooming flowers and damp earth” create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels particular to this piece. Setting is consistently filtered through Maya’s sensibility and supports tone well. However, the environment rarely constrains or forces choices; it is more backdrop than active pressure. The sundial base and orchard do charge the final image, but mainly symbolically rather than as lived constraints on action.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    The golden arcade, neon lights, and ebony clipboard are vividly and consistently evoked, giving the piece a strong atmospheric cohesion. However, the environment rarely constrains action or choice; it serves more as an aesthetic backdrop than an active pressure. Some details (children’s sidewalk chalk, morning patrons) do gesture toward a lived-in space that contrasts with Cipher’s solitary focus. The final image of the arcade and neon as “a beacon of creativity” ties setting to theme reasonably well but without added complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.8)
    The cobalt observatory, autumn air, stars, velvet, and eternal candle create a consistent, moody atmosphere with a clear sense of place. Details are mostly visual and somewhat generalized, but they are recurrent and integrated with the action (needle and flame moving in rhythm). The setting supports tone more than it constrains choices—nothing in the observatory concretely shapes tactics beyond providing a mystical workspace. The final image with the candle and vibrating chart is charged, though still more decorative than decisively functional.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mangrove labyrinth, mist, luminescent fungi, and singing spirits create a vivid, sensorially rich atmosphere that’s consistently filtered through Aria’s presence and vocation. Environmental elements are not just decorative: the window suspended between mangroves, condensation, and moonlight all participate directly in the supernatural mechanics. The setting’s tone (primordial, damp, haunted) reinforces the emotional weight of regret and unsent words. While the environment doesn’t sharply constrain choices, it does actively charge the key images and ending.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mist-clad atrium, twilight light, and glowing brain-coral create a coherent, atmospheric space that matches the interior mood. Details like the coral’s “delicate, pinkish-orange structure” and the smudged cast give some tactile specificity. However, the environment rarely constrains options or tactics; it mainly underscores tone. The setting charges the final image symbolically rather than functionally, which is effective but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ruined orchard and pervasive fog are vividly evoked with concrete sensory detail (damp earth, decaying leaves, gnarled branches), and this atmosphere is sustained to the end. The setting does some thematic work—desolation reborn through art, the veil between reality and dreams—but mostly functions as evocative backdrop rather than a true constraint on choice or action. The fresco fragment and fog recur and help charge the final image of the orchard “reborn, one brushstroke at a time.” Still, the place rarely shapes tactics; Lena could do almost the same story in any ruinous, liminal space.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sound wave garden is vivid and sensorially rich—the hum of tuning forks, water against stone, mirrors, and reactive pigments are all concretely evoked and filtered through Lena’s work. Setting meaningfully shapes action: the mirrors and sound-emitting sculpture provide the mechanism for her experiment, and the mural itself is both workspace and portal. Details generally feel purposeful rather than touristic, and the recurring garden imagery charges the final sense of a “living, breathing entity.” The world’s rules (sound-responsive pigments, reflected waves) are sketched rather than deeply grounded, but remain internally consistent at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    The entomologist’s greenhouse and community gardens are pleasantly evoked—the scent of flowers, hum of insects, and coded plots give a distinct if generalized atmosphere. Setting is integrated with concept (a public, “innocent” space that hides language resistance), which is strong. However, details remain high-level and repetitive; we seldom see Lyra navigating concrete physical constraints or specific, idiosyncratic features of the place. The final image uses the greenhouse and plant symbolically, but the environment never quite becomes a lived-in, choice-shaping world.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    The gargantuan shell, bioluminescent fungi, and off-key wind create a distinctive, tactile atmosphere, with the shell convincingly evolving from prison to womb. Details like the blue-green pulsing fungi that “echo” her song nicely mirror her inner state. The galaxy postcard functions as a charged object in the space, but the broader world rules of this cosmos remain hazy. Overall, the setting is vivid and thematically aligned, though it seldom constrains concrete choices.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    The opal library above the clouds, glass orchids, and the museum of extinct feelings are vividly imagined and sensorially specific, giving the piece its strongest dimension. Details like the cracked bamboo tube and luminescent orbs feel of a piece with the world and reinforce the mood. The setting mostly charges atmosphere and theme rather than constraining action, but it does meaningfully infuse the final image. Occasional descriptive redundancy keeps it from pushing higher.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.5)
    The extinct language archive, luminescent orbs, and the etched glass ink well are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Elara’s scholarly obsession. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain action, but it does function as a psychological and thematic frame—what was once “daunting and isolating” becomes a sanctuary, mirroring her internal shift. The ink well in particular is well used as a recurring object whose emptied, glowing state charges the final image. Greater interaction between the physical space and her work process or risks could have elevated this further.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dormant volcano amphitheater is vividly realized—“building breathed,” “damp earth and moss,” creaking stones, and flickering sunset light create a strong, consistent atmosphere. Details are sensorially specific and integrated with her perception rather than feeling like a tourist catalog. However, the environment is more backdrop and metaphor than constraint; it rarely forces or shapes specific decisions beyond generic inspiration. The breathing architecture charges the mood and final image but stops short of materially affecting tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.5)
    The vintage bookshop attic, dust-filled skylight, and cooing pigeons create a vivid, consistent atmosphere, with strong sensory anchors (musty paper, soft light, dust motes). The environment feels lived-in and character-specific: the attic functions as sanctuary and mental workspace. The dust motes under the skylight meaningfully charge the final image and embody her balancing ritual. However, outside of mood and that ritual, the space rarely constrains or complicates her options.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.2)
    The “drifting prism terrace” and “shattered light” provide a vivid, consistent visual frame, and the scent of flowers and hum of insects add some sensory breadth. However, the setting mostly decorates the mood rather than constraining choices; the terrace as labyrinth is thematically apt but doesn’t materially alter tactics or stakes. Spatially, we know only that the narrator moves along a shifting, colored space toward the father at the edge. Atmosphere is pleasant but more postcard than fully dramatized environment.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.0)
    The underwater city research facility and bioluminescent organisms give the story a distinct spatial and visual anchor. However, these details rarely affect what the astrologer can or cannot do; the space is observed more than inhabited, with almost no tactile interaction beyond picking up the feather. The environment does not evolve or complicate the ritual—its mood stays static from first description to last. As atmosphere it works; as an active setting, it’s underused.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    The iridescent geode interior is vividly and consistently evoked—crystalline walls, crater glass, pools of light, and mirrored facets all create a strong atmosphere. The environment participates modestly in action (the seeds form a trail; the crystal cluster hides the chamber), but mostly it’s scenic rather than constraining choice. World rules stay stable, and the tone of otherworldly luminescence is well maintained. The setting charges the final image somewhat, yet it seldom meaningfully limits or complicates her behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tidal arcade, torches, starry sky, and waves are vividly evoked and consistent, with sensory detail that suits the contemplative mood. However, the setting rarely constrains action or alters options; Elian could almost be anywhere performing the same act. The environment mirrors theme (tidal rhythm, celestial ballet) but leans toward postcard description rather than integrated pressure. Still, the motif of tide and stars gives the piece a coherent, if gentle, atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.0)
    The twilight garden, ocean, and starry sky are vividly rendered and consistent, giving the piece a clear atmospheric identity. The moonstone and the sensory details of night flowers and waves are integrated through Aria’s perception rather than feeling like a catalog. That said, the environment mostly decorates rather than constrains action; it sets tone but rarely affects what Aria can or cannot do. The moonstone comes closest to acting as a charged object in the final image but still doesn’t significantly alter choices.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.5)
    Pearl Bay, the mist, and the prism atrium are vividly and consistently rendered, giving a clear sense of place and atmosphere. The water’s reflectivity and the clearing mist mirror the glazier’s introspection in a thematically apt way. However, the environment rarely constrains or enables concrete choices; it functions mostly as a scenic backdrop and metaphor reservoir. The repetition of similar visual descriptors flattens some of the potential texture.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.9)
    The moonlit ridge path, celestial imagery, and the porcelain box create a consistent, gently atmospheric environment that suits the contemplative tone. However, the setting is largely decorative: the ridge, night, and sky do not constrain his actions or meaningfully influence the transformation beyond providing a pretty backdrop. Descriptions lean on familiar phrases (“silvery glow,” “velvet expanse,” “twinkled like diamonds”) rather than sharply particular sensory details filtered through a firefighter’s eye. The cracked box comes closest to a charged micro-setting but still functions more as announced symbol than as a lived-in tool that shapes choice.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.0)
    The tide-polished grotto, lapping waves, shells, pebbles, and driftwood create a coherent, soothing atmosphere that fits the contemplative mode. Details are sensibly filtered through Aria’s focus on patterns and revitalization, and the environment’s calm contrasts with the implied vastness of the multiverse vision. However, the grotto rarely constrains choices or alters tactics; it is a lyrical backdrop rather than an active pressure. The final image doesn’t significantly reweight the setting beyond reaffirming that she is “exactly where she was meant to be.”

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.0)
    The ivy-veiled passage, ancient estate, and post–climate shift world provide an evocative frame, but details remain mostly generic and visual. Setting rarely constrains action or forces choice; the estate feels mood-rich but tactically inert. The climate shifts and “ancient walls” conceptually support theme but are not grounded in specific physical or sensory reality beyond a few repeated phrases. The environment decorates the story more than it actively shapes it.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    The atmospheric work is strong: “prism parapet,” “last wisps of spring rain,” “echoing terrace” build a coherent, lyrical space that matches the story’s mood. The parapet and mirrors recur and are visually legible, anchoring us in a specific, if somewhat abstracted, mansion setting. However, the environment rarely constrains or redirects choice; it decorates the ritual rather than shaping its tactics. The final image of the glowing parapet as “a beacon of possibility” does charge the setting, but primarily at the level of mood, not stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.0)
    The ancient terrace, midsummer sun, celestial bodies, and night flowers provide a consistent, gently atmospheric backdrop. These details are pleasant but fairly generic and could be swapped for another solemn setting without significantly changing events or choices. The ebony clipboard begins to function as a micro-setting object by the end, charging the final image with ritual and responsibility. Still, the environment rarely constrains tactics or behavior; it mostly supports tone.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.0)
    The salt flat, cracked earth, and approaching storm are vividly rendered and recur throughout, giving the piece a strong visual and atmospheric spine. Setting and weather loosely influence stakes (drought, looming rain) but rarely constrain concrete choices or tactics. Details are mostly visual, with some effective sound (“brittle, fractured sound,” “rushing water”) adding texture. The egg as a recurring object charges the final image but could more sharply interact with environment-driven constraints.

    The “silver courtyard under snow” and the falling flakes create a consistent, wintry stillness that suits the introspective, lyric mode. The prism sanctuary as a visual object has presence and returns at the end as a “beacon of hope,” but the environment rarely constrains her actions or introduces real friction. Most sensory work is visual; snow and courtyard feel more like a backdrop than a lived-in space she navigates. Still, the atmosphere is legible and thematically aligned, if underutilized for choice-making.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    The decommissioned radar dome and its “meteor hush” are vividly and consistently evoked, giving the piece a strong atmospheric backbone. Sensory detail leans heavily on sound and light (hush, flickering, ethereal), but the space remains legible and tonally coherent as a sanctuary. However, the environment rarely constrains or enables distinct choices; it functions more as mood than active setting. Some phrases and images recur without new inflection, edging toward static description.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto above the clouds is vividly rendered through smell, sound, and light, and the atmosphere of suspended, “blushing stillness” is sustained with consistency. Details like the hum of insects, moss-covered stone, and ethereal glow are well integrated with Aria’s actions rather than feeling like postcard description. The setting charges the final image—the empty grotto, glowing wing, and fragile structures—but rarely constrains choice or behavior. It’s strong, immersive ambience rather than an active pressure source, which keeps it just below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    The icebound sanctum, candles, and aurora are vividly and consistently evoked, and the aurora’s hiss and light echo the themes of memory and preservation. Setting details (cold, glow, rope, organ card) are well integrated into her focused attention rather than feeling like a neutral backdrop. The environment does not significantly constrain her choices—she could do this in many other mystical locales—but it does charge the mood and final image. The “snowmelt ardor” and brightening aurora give the closure a clear atmospheric shift.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.5)
    The rewilded forest, vine-draped bunker, luminescent fungi, and storm are clearly and attractively drawn, with a few non-visual sensory touches (“damp earth,” “ozone,” “wet earth”). The atmosphere aligns with the ethereal, introspective mode and gives the piece a legible locus. Yet the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; the bunker could be any secluded chamber, and the storm remains mostly a mood device. The final emergence into the fresh, reborn forest is thematically apt but more symbolic tableau than pressured setting.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.2)
    The “ancient Babylonian palace reimagined” and “twilight halls,” “crumbling frescoes,” and “dusky harmony” create a consistent, moody atmosphere. However, most details are broad and decorative rather than specific to this palace or this astronomer, and they seldom evolve in response to action. The environment does not really constrain or enable choice; it mainly supplies a backdrop of grandeur and decay. The magic tile as object-as-setting fares better, but even that remains more symbol than tactile tool in space.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.5)
    The “soundless sanctuary” is a strong initial image, and the music box adds an anchoring object, but beyond that the environment remains hazy and under-detailed. Atmosphere leans on abstract light (“soft, golden light”) and generalized serenity more than lived-in sensory specificity. Spatially and temporally, it’s clear we’re in one contained space and moment, but the sanctuary never meaningfully constrains options or tactics. The music box’s brokenness does charge the final image somewhat, though more as stated symbol than organically felt constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ruined orchard, thick fog, damp earth, and twilight frost are vividly evoked and consistent in tone, with the frost/fog motif returning to charge the final image. Setting is strongly atmospheric but only lightly engaged as constraint—fog and ruin rarely force or complicate choices. The sextant and mirror operate as micro-setting objects that carry some weight into the ending. Overall, the world feels sensuous and coherent, if slightly static and repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.0)
    The abandoned cathedral with an orchard in the rafters is vivid and memorable, and details like birds, leaves, and the hair ribbon on a branch create a gentle atmosphere. However, the setting is mostly scenic; it rarely constrains action or forces tactical choices beyond giving Elara a place to tend. World rules (e.g., what a “quartz-eye mender” is) are suggestive but underdeveloped, functioning more as flavor than as a lived-in system. The final image of the thriving orchard as a pilgrimage site does help charge the ending, even if it remains somewhat postcard-like.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    The astral orchard and lonely asteroid are vivid and sensorial (shimmering blossoms, intoxicating scent), and the bathroom’s “vibrant, swirling patterns” and incense create a nicely odd contrast. These details effectively build atmosphere and a liminal, ritual space for the breakthrough. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; it mainly decorates rather than pressures the action. The recurring orchard imagery at the end modestly charges the final image but not decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.2)
    The opening image of the bookstore sprawling across a mountain with impossible geometries is vivid and promising, and the musty, parchment-scented aisles establish atmosphere. After that, the setting becomes vaguer: treacherous shelves, hidden door, and dim chamber are all more generic than the premise allows, and the “mountain” aspect never meaningfully constrains action. The labyrinth rarely functions as a concrete obstacle in specific moments; it’s more concept than lived space. As a result, the environment colors the story but doesn’t sharply shape choices or the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.3)
    The abandoned carnival ship in foggy bay is a strong, atmospheric image, with details like “rickety rollercoasters and faded game stalls” nicely aligning with memory and decay. However, the environment doesn’t constrain action or tactics; Lyra never has to solve a problem because of this specific setting. Much of the description stays at a generalized, moody level rather than grounded, POV-filtered specificity. The final approach to the cove is evocative but still more backdrop than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.0)
    The university clock tower, ticking mechanism, and shifting shadows create a serviceable, if somewhat generic, gothic-academic atmosphere. Setting details (narrow stairs, dim room, vibrating air) support tone but rarely shape choices or constrain action. The environment feels more like a backdrop than an active participant in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    The “harmonic caves,” ice walls, and energy beings create a distinctive, if abstract, environment, and the echo stone ties the setting into the action. Atmosphere is consistently serene-lyric, and the world rules (vibrations, resonance, cracks revealing stresses) are internally coherent. Still, sensory detail skews conceptual and luminous rather than tactile and embodied, keeping the space from feeling fully lived-in. The environment supports theme more than it concretely constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glass humming pavilion, broken prism, thistle scent, and crystal orrery create a vivid, coherent atmosphere with strong visual and aural specificity. Details like “star charts etched into the walls” and vibrations attuning to footsteps are well chosen and POV-filtered. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or introduces tangible risk; it’s more an evocative backdrop than an active shaper of action. The final image of the pavilion “singing a new tune” is thematically apt and visually strong.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting is vivid and sensorial—“stormlit observatory,” “wet stone and ozone,” “crystal whispering forecourt” all create a strong, coherent atmosphere filtered through her sensibility. Environmental details recur (storm, clouds, moon, crystal) and support mood, especially as storm gives way to stillness. Yet the environment rarely constrains or enables concrete choices; it frames rather than pressures the action. The specificity is strong, but its functional integration stops short of the highest literary bar.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.5)
    The “blooming fortress,” lanterns, gardens, and fire performers create a coherent, pleasant atmosphere with some visual specificity. Setting is consistently present and aligns with the theme of beauty sparking creativity. However, the environment rarely constrains action or forces choice; it functions mostly as postcard backdrop rather than an active pressure or resource. The fortress and garden details could be swapped for another picturesque venue with limited structural impact.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto, starlight, dripping water, and salt/seaweed scent are vivid and consistent, creating a coherent, sensory-rich atmosphere. However, the environment largely decorates rather than constrains action; the grotto is a sanctuary, not a pressure source, and nothing the chronicler does depends on its concrete affordances. The jade cicada does charge the setting slightly as a recurring object, but again in a mostly symbolic, not tactical, way. Strong evocation, modest functional integration.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    The xenial trellis above the clouds, inverted gravity, and the gilded hush create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels distinct from generic SF/fantasy backdrops. Details like floating objects and specific silences (snow on a frozen lake, desert under stars) lend texture and a believable internal logic. The setting is more container than constraint—Eli’s options are not sharply limited by its physical rules—but it does shape the entire mode of experience. The final image of leaving the trellis with the doll as a token gives the place lasting charge.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drifting prism terrace, gondola, and water are vividly evoked with a consistent, pastel, reflective atmosphere. Setting is integrated into perception (reflections, calm water, lapping against the hull) and tone, though it rarely constrains choices beyond enabling serene movement. The storm-glass vial as a micro-setting object recurs and charges the final image, even if more symbolically than causally. Overall the world feels distinct and sensorially present, if slightly ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is vivid and coherent: kaleidoscopic waterfall, cybernetic birds, iridescent trees, and twin suns all support the “futuristic nostalgia” tone. Details are clear and consistently integrated into Aria’s movements (passing through the waterfall, navigating the orchard, uncovering murals). However, the environment is more atmospheric than functional; it rarely constrains choice or imposes tangible risk. Strong descriptive work, but it stops just short of shaping the story’s stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.8)
    Atmosphere is consistent, with recurring images like “ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight” and shadows as tentacles, but the setting remains hazy and mostly visual. Little is grounded in tactile, auditory, or practical detail, and the sanctuary does not constrain tactics beyond being a vague “depths” to travel through. The doorknocker and inner flame are evocative objects but feel more like symbols than lived-in tools or obstacles. The final image is charged by tone more than by concrete setting reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.5)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vividly evoked at the beginning and returns in the final image, giving the piece a coherent, luminous atmosphere. The sensory focus on glow and scent grounds the otherwise abstract science-fantasy elements. Still, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics—the lab and farm could be swapped for many other settings without altering the plot. The mushrooms charge the closing tone but do not shape the conflict itself.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    The sepia reading room, lantern glow, and golden shadows are vividly rendered and consistent, giving the piece a clear atmospheric identity. Details like dust, aged paper, and the gramophone help ground the otherwise abstract mystical language. However, the setting does not evolve or materially constrain choices; it remains largely a static backdrop for interior transformation. The same effect could be achieved in many other “mystic study” locations with minimal changes.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse in endless night is vividly evoked and consistently present, with glass, trees, and light all participating in the climax (walls rippling, trees leaning, golden eruption). Setting details are sensorial and integrated into action rather than static description. The environment helps charge the final image, though it rarely constrains choices or tactics—this could almost occur in any “mystical chamber.” Strong atmosphere and specificity, but not yet fully weaponized as pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.2)
    The foster-care file room, dust, shelves, and mustiness create a consistent, slightly oppressive atmosphere that suits the subject. The infantryman’s button is a solid recurring object that acquires symbolic weight and sits in the final image. However, much of the setting description leans generic (“repository of forgotten dreams,” “sanctuary of remembrance”) rather than concretely lived-in. The environment rarely constrains choices or action; it functions more as mood-board than engine.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    The auric lagoon, starlight, reeds, and luminescent orbs produce a strong, consistent atmosphere with some striking images. However, the environment rarely constrains behavior or alters options; it’s more lyrical backdrop than active setting. The lagoon does charge the final image as sanctuary and beacon, giving some resonance. Description leans visual but is concrete enough to avoid “white room” issues.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.3)
    The radiant grotto, mist, dewdrops, and prism atrium are vividly and consistently evoked, with strong visual and atmospheric specificity. However, the environment rarely constrains action or creates obstacles; it mainly serves as an aesthetic echo chamber for the music. The repetition of similar images (“tendrils of fog,” “prism structures”) verges on static rather than evolving. The final image of the glowing atrium in mist is charged, but more symbolically than situationally.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ashen skyborne arbor is vivid and specific—misty cloud-trees, lunar bark, rustling leaves—creating a strong, cohesive atmosphere. Details feel sensorial and mostly filtered through the protagonist’s awe. However, the environment rarely constrains action or forces choices; it is more a beautifully painted backdrop than an active pressure. The recurring moonstone glow charges the mood but stops short of materially shaping tactics beyond being “something to look at and honor.”

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    The subterranean world, waterfall, and neglected greenhouse are vividly rendered with smell, sound, and decay/rebirth imagery, and these details consistently support the mood and theme. The compass rose as a recurring object helps charge the final image. Still, setting rarely constrains his choices or tactics; it’s more atmosphere than active pressure. With a bit more functional use of environment—e.g., the greenhouse or waterfall forcing a specific decision—this could rise into top-tier territory.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.4)
    The rain-washed foundry and the mix of wet earth and molten metal create a coherent, moody atmosphere, and the recurring image of the laboratory as sanctuary vs. failure is effective. Yet environment rarely constrains or enables choices; the rain and foundry do not tangibly affect what she can or must do. Details trend general (“once-vibrant laboratory,” “soft glow of the laboratory”) rather than idiosyncratic to this specific place and person. The zodiac coin fares better as a recurring object, but still feels more symbolic than operative.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    Echo Gorge, mist, waterfall, and the hidden sunrise are vividly evoked and consistent with the mood, giving the piece a clear atmospheric identity. The setting is mostly textural rather than constraining, but the waterfall, glow, and harp locate action in a tangible space. Repetition of mist, hush, and echo reinforces the liminal atmosphere without major confusion. The gorge does not sharply shape choices, yet it does charge the final sense of quiet and secrecy.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.0)
    The ultraviolet forest is a striking image and establishes a distinctive atmosphere, especially as it pulses outside the clinic and then envelops her journey. Still, the environment is more symbolic backdrop than operative constraint; the trees “twisting and writhing” don’t meaningfully alter her tactics or choices. The clinic setting is minimal and largely utilitarian. The final image of the forest pulsing in the background offers some resonance but doesn’t feel deeply reweighted by the events.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.5)
    The alchemist’s market above the rooftops, with sandalwood, myrrh, stalls, and paintings, is vivid and consistent, giving the piece a strong atmospheric anchor. The lighthouse lens and rooftop city vista at the end serve as recurring object/setting elements that charge the final image, though they rarely constrain concrete choices. World rules are sketched lightly but feel internally consistent for a mystical space. Some phrases lean toward generalized lyricism instead of sharply particular detail, keeping it below the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.0)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly sketched via fluorescent lights, faded posters, dusty stubs, and the surrounding city, creating a strong melancholy atmosphere. Detail selection generally reflects Ezra’s gaze, especially on tools and dust, and the circus’s decay mirrors the “forgotten stories” theme. The mainspring barrel functions as both setting object and structural hinge, returning in the final image. Still, the environment rarely constrains her choices or behavior; it’s textured backdrop more than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.5)
    The glass orchard library and cloud sea are vivid, recurring, and sensorially specific, with the frost on the panes and the machinery integrated into the operator’s work. The environment evolves—resonating at a new frequency, bathed in golden light, fading into clouds—so setting is not static postcard. However, it rarely constrains choice or forces tactics; it mostly supports mood and theme rather than exerting pressure. Even so, as atmosphere and final image-charger, the setting is a genuine strength.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    The baroque asteroid, dim galleries, and visible time mantle are evocative and consistent, and the shard, storm, and covered mirrors recur meaningfully. Setting is filtered through her sensibility and supports the elegiac tone. However, the environment rarely constrains options or tactics—it remains more atmospheric than operative. Still, specificity and mood are strong enough to be a highlight of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.5)
    The resonance chamber, luminescent orbs, and labyrinthine passages create a strong, coherent atmosphere that matches the story’s mystical tone. Details like the chamber’s “whispers” and the chip glowing in response to Erebus’s work feel integrated rather than postcard-like. The chamber’s resonance explicitly matters at the climax, when aligning the box’s melody with it unlocks the song. Still, the setting could do more to constrain or complicate action; it rarely pressures Erebus beyond serving as an evocative stage.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.0)
    The subterranean lagoon, limestone tunnels, luminescent fungi, and petrichor are vividly and consistently evoked, giving the story a strong atmospheric spine. Setting clearly shapes tone and frames the mystic experience, though it rarely constrains specific choices or tactics beyond “go deeper toward the grotto.” Sensory detail is skewed toward sight and smell but is purposeful rather than touristic. The environment charges the mood of the final unity image even if it doesn’t impose concrete logistical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.0)
    The “storm-tossed archway” and the relentless sea are vividly evoked and recur throughout, giving the piece a clear atmospheric spine. The environment occasionally intersects with action (shelter of the archway, waves bringing in driftwood and wreckage), and the storm’s subsiding neatly brackets the experience. Still, the setting rarely constrains choice or changes tactics; it’s more backdrop and metaphor than active pressure. Strong mood work, but the world doesn’t bite back enough to elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.0)
    The amber pavilion, cathedral, etched glass, and moonlit gardens are sensually and consistently evoked, creating a distinct nocturnal atmosphere. However, these settings seldom constrain action or force choices; they function more as mood-scapes than as operative environments. The repeated imagery (etched glass, moonlight, postcards) does help charge the final sense of quiet revelation. Strong ambience, but more decorative than structurally integral.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.3)
    The setting is the story’s strongest asset: the “hanger-like interior” of a zeppelin library, aged paper smell, hum of engines, and a distant obsidian lagoon give a vivid, coherent atmosphere. Details are sensibly filtered through Naomi’s archival lens (dusty tomes, forgotten documents) and the lagoon functions as a recurring image that frames her sense of purpose. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; it’s a mood backdrop rather than an active pressure. The final image of the lagoon “below” does charge the tone, but not in a way that forces a different decision.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ghost town and paper-lantern cove are evocative, with decay vs. warm lantern light building a clear atmosphere, and the sense of the town “stirring” works well. Details like crumbling structures, overgrown streets, and festival nights sketch a world that feels coherent, if somewhat generalized. However, the environment rarely constrains action; it mostly serves as backdrop and symbol rather than as a live tactical or emotional pressure. The amber bottle’s presence in the final image helps charge the setting, but not quite to a transformative degree.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.7)
    The rooftop orchard, lanterns, foghorn, and wax cylinder create a distinct, cohesive atmosphere with a few nice sensory notes (scent of blooming flowers, distant city hum). The orchard atop a skyscraper is intriguing but mostly serves as backdrop and metaphorical echo of the memory-orchard, rather than constraining choices. Environmental details do not notably evolve or affect tactics as the emotional patterns shift. Strong mood, but the setting isn’t fully exploited as an active element.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.5)
    The icebound atrium under starlight is a strong initial image and the thawing plants plus glass panes create an effective, quiet atmosphere. That said, the environment quickly recedes into a generic mystical void once the vortex opens; the setting does not significantly constrain action or choice. The acorn cap functions as a charged object, but the broader world remains more backdrop than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    The windblown sanctuary above the clouds and the cathedral are appealing and tonally coherent, with recurring attention to wind, hush, and sound that suits the concept. The setting is more atmospheric than operative; the environment rarely constrains choices or forces specific tactics beyond justifying Ember’s interest in microclimates and resonance. Still, the bell, wind, and “solstice hush” create a unified mood and recognizable place rather than a white room. Stronger, more tactile or spatially grounded use of the sanctuary as a constraint would lift this further.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.4)
    The station is anchored clearly (dim room, hum of machinery and computers, view of stars) and the atmosphere is consistently calm and reverent. The yellow lantern glass and the observation window provide a few concrete images that echo the internal state. However, much of the description stays at a generalized, almost “museum placard” level; the environment rarely feels physically inhabited beyond sweeping. The setting doesn’t constrain choices or tactics—it functions mainly as a backdrop for theme.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.3)
    The beekeeping oasis in a scorched wasteland, the ash-heavy sky, and the labyrinth of twisted metal and glass create a strong, coherent atmosphere that’s threaded through the piece. The stained glass box and the ghosts, plus the honeycomb fragments, give the setting a tactile, particular texture that supports the themes of decay and remembrance. The environment doesn’t significantly constrain choices—nothing the recluse does depends on material obstacles in the space—but it does charge the final image of the glowing box as a beacon in desolation. Overall, the specificity and mood are strong, if more evocative than functionally engaged.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.2)
    The “emerald silo” and damaged time capsule are evocative, and there’s a consistent ruined-temporal hub atmosphere. However, details are mostly visual and conceptual, with little tactile or functional engagement that constrains action. Objects (clock, urn fragment, capsule) serve as symbols more than lived-in tools or obstacles. The setting supports tone but rarely shapes choices or the ending image in a concrete way.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lagoon, wet sand, mist, dawn light, and feather create a clear, sensuous environment with consistent tone. Setting details are integrated into the poet’s experience (lapping water, swirling mist, rising sun) rather than listed. The cobalt lagoon and burnished dawn help charge the final image, but they seldom pressure or limit her actions; this is atmosphere more than constraint. Still, the place feels specific and lived-in for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.1)
    The temple orchard, flowers, insects, and living stone pillars provide a coherent, gently lyrical atmosphere, and the copper-wrapped oaks add a distinctive texture. Details are sensorial (scent of blooming flowers, hum of insects) and generally filtered through the caretaker’s vocation. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; it is more backdrop than active pressure. The final image of the orchard and copper wire gains some charge, but could be further individualized and made more causally integral.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.0)
    The rainwashed tower, overgrown sculpture path, and “bronze quiet” are vividly rendered with consistent sensory texture (mist, damp earth, blooming flowers). Setting is integrated into the walk and encounter rather than tacked on, and the fly amber’s glow against foliage and tower subtly charges the final image. However, the environment almost never constrains or changes choices; it’s mostly mood and backdrop. This keeps the atmosphere strong but limits functional depth.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is the strongest element: the jetty, twilight, reef, and blooming flowers create a clear mood and sensory frame. However, the details skew generic and repetitive (“sweet scent of blooming flowers” appears more than once) rather than sharply particular. Environment rarely constrains action or alters choices; it mostly serves as backdrop and symbol. Still, atmosphere is consistently evoked and supports the gentle, sacred tone of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.5)
    The scrapyard settlement, cracked wasteland, and “tiny oasis in the desert of steel and stone” are evocative and coherent, with some nice sensory touches (creosote, ash, rust). The environment meaningfully underpins the premise—water has weight in a barren scrap-world—but rarely constrains tactics beyond serving as a backdrop. The spring and the glowing wax orb modestly charge the final image, though they don’t reshape options in a concrete way. More integration of terrain or ruins into their decisions on the journey would strengthen atmosphere as an active force.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    The observation deck and the gilded compass rose are visually clear and recur in meaningful ways, especially the compass aligning with the mysterious light. Atmosphere leans on familiar cosmic imagery (“stars twinkling like diamonds,” “void”) rather than fresh, POV-specific perceptions. Still, the setting supports tone and the final image, and the compass-as-setting-object modestly charges the ending. World rules around time dilation are gestured at but not dramatized, limiting depth.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.0)
    The icebound spire, swirling mists, and crystalline interiors are consistently evoked and sustain a coherent, slightly mystical tone. The star-essence chessboard and singing crystals give some specific, appealing images, and the environment’s chill and “otherworldly energy” are present throughout. However, the setting rarely constrains tactics or forces concrete choices—Moonwhisper never has to adapt to ice, altitude, or the spire’s dangers—so it’s more atmospheric than functional. Strong mood, limited integration with action.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.0)
    The whispering gallery and old floorboards create a mild sense of place and tone, and the acoustics amplifying the historian’s words is a nice touch. The chessboard works more as a symbolic object than as a lived-in tool or constraint. Sensory detail remains mostly visual and conceptual, rarely interacting with the characters’ bodies or tactics. The setting supports mood but does not really shape options or impose pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mountain-spanning labyrinthine bookstore is vividly rendered through smell, shadow, and scale, creating a strong, consistent atmosphere. Details like ancient tomes, artifacts, and vaulted ceilings are well-integrated into the seer’s movement and perception. However, the environment rarely constrains or redirects her choices—it’s more lush backdrop than active pressure. The final image of the bookstore as a “threshold to new possibilities” does reweight the setting nicely, lending it some closing charge.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.0)
    The time-frozen village, wet earth, ozone, and “woven hush” create a strong, unified atmosphere that feels particular rather than generic. The platinum labyrinth adds a striking visual and conceptual anchor to the world. However, the environment rarely constrains the tutor’s options or tactics; it mostly serves as mood-rich backdrop. The final image of the village returning to motion ties setting into closure, but still more as a symbolic echo than as an active force.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    The canyon of endless echoes, towers of bone, mist, and pale spire are vividly rendered and tonally unified, giving the piece a strong, distinctive atmosphere. Description is mostly visual but still effective, and the recurring spire and mist gain symbolic weight as they respond to the artist’s words. However, the environment seldom constrains choices or offers practical obstacles; it functions more as a metaphysical backdrop than a lived space. This keeps the setting from reaching the highest tier, despite its evocative imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.8)
    The acid sea and floating gears-and-cogs workshop are vivid, recurring images that create a distinct atmosphere and situate the work physically above danger. However, the environment mostly remains backdrop; the acid sea and rickety workshop don’t materially alter her tactics beyond generic creaks and an ambient sense of peril. The best-integrated setting choice is the micro-setting of her own body as a constraining “air clock,” though its physical logic is stretched by the extended interiority. Overall, the world feels specific and textured, but its details seldom constrain choice in a way that would push this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.8)
    The quay, sea, rocks, driftwood, and luminescent cave oasis are clearly and often evocatively rendered; the story never feels like a white room. Details like the seashell and the luminescent moss help atmosphere and dovetail with the art motif. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; it mostly provides a picturesque backdrop and source material. The setting thus enriches mood but doesn’t fully charge the final image or force decisions.

    The cobalt lighthouse, garden, cool breeze, and sea are sensorially vivid, especially the “scent of the garden at night” and the light “dancing across the waves.” Environmental details are consistently filtered through Elian’s devotional mindset, so the setting feels like an extension of his inner state. However, the setting rarely constrains or complicates action; it mainly supports atmosphere and theme rather than exerting pressure. The lighthouse does effectively charge the final image as a symbol of guidance and whisper-like illumination.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.2)
    There are some strong atmospheric anchors—the “starlit signal station,” an industrial hub after hydraulic failure, a “great, empty plain”—that give the piece a faintly speculative, post-industrial feel. The patina bronze censer foot as a recurring object helps charge the final image. Yet most setting detail is visual and abstract, with little tactile or spatial specificity, and the environment almost never constrains options or tactics. The world feels suggestive rather than fully lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.0)
    The storm-battered hanging orchard in the ravine is a constant presence and mirrors the forager’s “fractured” psyche, and details like twisted trees and damp soil give some concreteness. However, the setting rarely constrains choices or tactics; it functions mainly as mood backdrop and metaphor. Weather and landscape don’t materially alter what the forager can or can’t do. Stronger integration of environment with action would be needed for higher-tier scores.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.5)
    Setting and atmosphere are the story’s strongest elements: the opal dock, mist, salt smell, and looming lighthouse create a vivid, cohesive environment. The lighthouse as a “repository” of memories ties the physical setting directly to theme and the final image. Weather and mist actively color perception and underscore isolation, though they rarely constrain concrete choices. Some descriptive phrases recur without evolution (“mist swirled,” “witnessed isolation”), which slightly blunts impact but does not undercut the overall strength.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.5)
    The shop, creek, and blooming cavern are clearly and repeatedly evoked, with sensory cues like flowers’ scent and dripping water creating a recognizable atmosphere. The rising creek and cavern do begin to matter slightly as the water threatens to engulf the cavern, then recedes to leave peace. Still, much of the setting work leans on repeated, almost incantatory mentions (“blooming flowers,” “creek rising/receding”) rather than fresh, precise detail. The environment supports theme and mood more than it actively constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.0)
    Imagery of the grottoes, clouds, ember light, and “sea of clouds…like silk” is vivid and consistent, giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine. The environment rarely constrains choice—the queen never has to adapt tactics to terrain or danger—so setting functions more as backdrop than active pressure. Still, the ember grotto’s fiery, “living” quality and the above-cloud vista effectively mirror the queen’s awe and dread. The world’s rules remain mostly implicit but feel internally consistent at this lyric scale.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    The “ember nexus,” twilight light, salt tang, and rustling grasses create a distinct, sensuous atmosphere that feels coherent and lived-in. Setting details are woven through the action rather than dumped, and the return of the ember nexus fading in the final paragraph nicely mirrors the waning of the moment. That said, the environment rarely constrains options or forces specific tactics; it mostly functions as poetic backdrop. The story gains texture from the setting but not meaningful structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=5.8)
    The mountain ranger cabin and surrounding woods are established quickly and return at the end with the “launching pad” notion, but they rarely affect what the narrator can or cannot do. Most of the piece lives in a hazy mental interior; sensory specifics beyond the “scratch of my pen” are sparse and interchangeable. The birch bark scroll is a more concrete anchor, yet even it is described more as symbol than tactile object. The setting supports atmosphere in a generic way rather than acting as a live constraint or charged presence.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.5)
    The water clock repair shop and morning fog are vivid and distinctive, with sensory cues (lapping water, soft ticking, diffused light) that create a strong atmosphere. Details like the mist, reservoirs, and the odd combination of tools feel specific and thematically apt to time and hidden processes. However, the environment rarely constrains action or forces choice; it mainly serves as an evocative backdrop. The setting charges the mood and final image more than it shapes narrative stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    The floating rock tea platform, drifting in a sky of clouds and storms, is vivid and consistently rendered, with tea, sandalwood, tremors, and the parting storms all reinforcing the meditative, liminal mood. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but it does charge the final image of sunset and later darkness, framing his creative act against a broader elemental calm. Details generally feel purposeful rather than touristic. A bit more interaction between Kaito’s actions and the unstable platform could have raised the functional stakes of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.0)
    The sheet music archive is sensorially grounded (“scent of aged paper,” “raised notes and rests embossed into the covers”) and tonally apt, and the orchard adds a secondary atmospheric layer. These settings support mood and theme rather than remaining white-room backdrops. However, the environment rarely constrains Lyra’s options or creates friction; the archive is evocative but not decisively active in her choices. The bottle functions more like a charged object than the setting itself shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.2)
    The “ancient temple library lost in time” and the surrounding still world create a consistent, hushed atmosphere, with the aged parchment and endless shelves doing solid mood work. However, the setting is more backdrop than engine; Aria rarely engages with it beyond walking and shelving the dictionary. The environment does not constrain choices or tactics in any concrete way. Stronger, more specific interaction with the temple could have deepened both tension and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.8)
    The “horizon measurement station,” “fjord quiet” air, and hydraulic clocks create a gently distinctive setting, and the recurrent mantle clock offers a focal object. However, the environment rarely constrains action or meaning; it’s more backdrop than pressure source. Sensory detail skews visual and auditory and is somewhat generic beyond a few phrases. The final image of dawn and ticking clocks is pleasant but not deeply reweighted by prior environmental specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.5)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vividly realized—the damp soil, glowing caps, and pre-dawn birdsong create a strong, coherent atmosphere. Details are consistently filtered through Lena’s calming familiarity, giving the space a lived-in feel. However, the environment rarely constrains or enables specific choices; it’s a beautiful backdrop rather than an active pressure. The recurring farm imagery does charge the final departure, but mostly in mood, not in altered options.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    The rainwashed library, musty books, and glowing candle lantern create a cohesive mood, and the subway setting with graffiti adds a second, texturally distinct environment. The lantern and its mica pane recur as a symbolic object, charging the final image with a sense of fragile guidance, though they do not truly constrain action. Sensory detail leans visual and atmospheric but is purposeful rather than touristic. The settings support tone and theme more than they shape choices, keeping this solid but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.0)
    The subway utility tunnel, hum of streetlamps, and glass harmonica create a strong, unified atmosphere that’s vivid and consistent. The environment fits the themes of liminality and anonymity and is clearly anchored from the outset. However, the setting rarely constrains action or forces choices; it mainly serves as mood-rich backdrop. Repetition of the same details (hum, dim tunnel, haunting music) starts to feel static rather than evolving with the operator’s inner state.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.0)
    The blooming jetty at twilight, scented flowers, and lapping waves create a clear, gentle atmosphere that matches the story’s contemplative mode. These details recur and mirror the archivist’s mood, but they remain mostly static and decorative rather than constraining action or choices. The environment does not evolve in response to the archivist’s presence beyond generic intensifiers (“seemed to bloom more vibrantly”), and it does not materially shape tactics. The final image of the blooming jetty as legacy-adjacent is evocative but still postcard-like.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.2)
    The disused, ivy-covered station is a vivid initial image that immediately orients us and suits the tone. Once established, however, the setting mostly dissolves into generalized “atmosphere” and abstractions about the crowd, with little sensory evolution or use of the environment to constrain choice. The ivy and railway specifics become ornamental rather than active. The final beats do not meaningfully re-charge the setting image; the station could be swapped for any generic shelter with minor edits.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.5)
    The ultrasonic forest, blooming scents, and synesthetic language-tattoos create a rich, multisensory atmosphere that feels specific to this world. The platinum ring and soundscape recur and charge the final image, even if the environment rarely constrains concrete choices. Details are generally filtered through the mapmaker’s sound-centric and tactile perception, which grounds the lyricism. The setting is a clear strength, though more functional interaction with it could heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.0)
    The gravitational anomaly, cluttered workspace, garden, and exotic pen give the setting a distinct conceptual flavor. Yet details stay high-level and visual; there’s little sensory specificity or tactile engagement beyond “air seemed to thicken” and “whispers of the cosmos.” The anomaly doesn’t quite become a constraint or tool—more a poetic backdrop. Still, the recurring image of the restored pen within the anomaly does charge the final tableau somewhat.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.7)
    The luminous harbor, moonlight, and waves create a consistent, gentle atmosphere and anchor us effectively in space. However, many details are generic (“luminous harbor,” “moonlight,” “expectant hush”) rather than sharply particular, and the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics beyond serving as a pretty backdrop. The camera and stall hint at more textured micro-setting, but they’re used more symbolically than as concrete, lived-in space. The final image of the moonlit harbor “forever tuned” is aesthetically pleasing but not fully earned by earlier environmental specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.2)
    The archive and desert are sketched with a few evocative details (aged parchment, flickering fluorescent lights, dusty shelves), giving a basic sense of atmosphere. After the opening, setting mostly recedes into a generalized backdrop while abstractions about art and civilization take over. The faded tapestry fragment functions as a recurring object but more as symbol than environment that constrains choice. Overall, the place feels plausible but underused as an active, shaping force.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    The “sound wave garden” and “auric lagoon” are vivid, recurring images and establish a distinct atmosphere; the environment responds to Aria’s drumming in a clear, concrete way. However, most sensory detail skews visual and abstractly lyrical, with limited tactile or spatial specificity, and the rules of this world remain hazy. The setting supports tone but rarely constrains options or creates dilemmas—it’s more responsive backdrop than active pressure. The final image of the dimmed lagoon still glowing on the horizon offers a nice, if gentle, environmental charge to the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    The container labyrinth, salt smell, rust, and storm-driven wind create a vivid, textural environment that feels specific and lived-in. The setting is well filtered through her familiarity with the maze and her job, avoiding a tourist catalog. However, aside from the spinning compass and eerie atmosphere, the environment rarely constrains her options or forces tactical choices. It operates more as mood than as an active pressure on the story’s outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cobalt dock, rain, mist, and reflections are vivid and coherent, creating a strong, unified atmosphere. Details like the wet surface reflecting the grey sky and the intricate shutter shadows are sensorial and specific. However, the setting rarely constrains or enables action; it mostly serves as a mood canvas rather than a pressure source. The final image of the empty dock and abandoned mirror is effective but more decorative than structurally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.0)
    The cobalt library, mist, and magnetic grotto provide a coherent, atmospheric frame with some vivid images (“cobalt library shrouded in mist,” “grotto pulsed with an otherworldly energy”). Setting is more backdrop and tone engine than active constraint: neither the library nor grotto strongly channels or limits Elian’s options. Still, the return to both the library and grotto at the end gives the environment a modest structural and thematic charge. Sensory detail favors the visual and abstract over fully embodied physicality.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    The maritime setting and “sublittoral fringe” are sensuously evoked; whale-song vibrations through the dock and the glowing scrimshaw in dark water create tangible atmosphere. The environment, however, mostly serves as backdrop and metaphor rather than constraint—there’s little sense of physical risk or resistance from the sea itself. The scrimshaw’s glow nicely charges the final return image and gives the place otherworldly specificity. Overall, strong mood and imagery, but the setting doesn’t significantly shape tactics or limit choices.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    The farmhouse and looming wind turbines are vivid and recur throughout, effectively establishing a desolate, post-mandate atmosphere. The environment doesn’t really constrain choices, but it does meaningfully charge the images—the turbines as sentinels, the reclaimed fields as scars, the farmhouse transforming into sanctuary. The dried bouquet as an object in space is also well-placed on the mantel and folds into the setting rather than floating symbolically. Overall, the world feels specific and tonally unified, if not deeply interactive with plot.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting—cobalt atrium, frozen lake, humming quartz colonnade—is vivid, sensorial, and consistently threaded through the piece. Environmental details mirror Lyra’s internal state effectively (frost, light on the ice, the pulsing colonnade), and the final image of the colonnade as beacon is strong. However, the environment rarely constrains or complicates her actions; it mainly serves as aesthetic backdrop and symbol. With more tactical interaction or stakes grounded in place, this could reach a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.0)
    The glassblower’s courtyard, furnaces, and plants provide a coherent, mildly vivid backdrop, especially in the opening where “soft clinking” and “light danced through the courtyard” do some atmospheric work. However, the setting rarely constrains action or meaning; it mostly decorates the abstract theme. The “after the phoenix rises” world and the concertina reed tongue’s provenance remain gestural rather than fully embodied. The final image gestures toward charged objects (plants, reed, furnaces) but doesn’t deepen them beyond prior description.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.0)
    The “laboratory of lost sounds,” luminescent orbs, and peculiar instruments create a vivid, coherent atmosphere with some nice images (golden light, etched lens). However, the setting functions more as static backdrop than constraint; nothing in the environment meaningfully limits or reshapes choices. Repetition of “golden light/shadows” and generalized description keep it from feeling fully particularized.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    The observatory, domed glass ceiling, and star-charged curtains provide a vivid, cohesive atmosphere, with sensory touches like sandalwood and myrrh. However, the environment is mostly backdrop and metaphor rather than a constraint that shapes decisions or tactics. Details like the “curtains of intention” and glowing stars are evocative, but they rarely interact concretely with the character beyond mirroring their emotional state. The setting is strong in mood but underused as a functional stage for choice.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.5)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft is vivid and consistently evoked, creating a strong, coherent atmosphere of contemplative isolation. However, the setting rarely constrains her options or meaningfully alters tactics; the rain and skylight become a repeated emblem rather than an active pressure. Worldbuilding about the post-cryptocurrency-crash reality remains abstract, with almost no concrete external markers beyond conceptual mention. The final image of the empty loft as “beacon” is pleasant but more decorative than structurally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.0)
    The archive, luminescent orbs, scent of parchment, and twilight through grimy windows create a strong, consistent atmosphere, and the bronze prism pagoda is a well-chosen focal object that charges the final image. Details are filtered reasonably through her scholarly lens, and the environment matches the mood of excavation and nostalgia. Still, the setting rarely constrains or enables choices—it’s backdrop rather than an active pressure or resource. With more tactical interaction between environment and action, this could climb higher.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.5)
    The blooming library above the clouds, luminescent orbs, and sea of clouds form a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that clearly reflects and supports the story’s contemplative, otherworldly tone. Details like “river stone” and “cloud-soft floor” are integrated into action rather than pure cataloguing. However, the environment rarely constrains her choices or tactics; it’s more a beautiful backdrop and metaphorical beacon than an active pressure. The final glow of the library does charge the last image, which lifts the score.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.0)
    The misty workshop, stars, and damp air are vividly and consistently evoked, giving the story a strong atmospheric unity. The chameleon, its enclosure, and tactile details like the tail in her hand root the reflection in physical space. However, the setting largely decorates rather than constrains action; the workshop doesn’t force particular choices or tactics. The recurrence of mist and starlight slightly over-presses the lyric mood, edging toward sameness rather than evolving with the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.3)
    The tower, damp earth, luminescent plants, and “meteor hush” create a strong, coherent atmosphere with good sensory layering (smell of soil, visual glow, tactile silence). World specifics like the telepathic flora and the hidden chamber under the tower feel integrated rather than pasted-on. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics or forces different choices; it’s evocative backdrop more than an active pressure, so the setting’s role in the final change is primarily tonal rather than operative.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.0)
    The vintage movie palace projection booth is vividly evoked—the “scent of old celluloid and dust,” reels, hum of the projector, and distant thunder build a coherent, moody atmosphere. Details mostly serve tone rather than constraining choice; the booth provides the film strip but doesn’t actively shape tactics or options once the vision starts. Still, the setting’s recurrence in the opening, trance, and return gives the space a gentle frame function. It feels specific and lived-in, but not yet fully weaponized against the character.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.0)
    The aurora-lit archway, starlit sky, and astrolabe are vividly evoked and sustained, creating a consistent, immersive atmosphere. However, the setting functions chiefly as luminous backdrop and metaphor rather than as a constraint on choice or tactics; the environment doesn’t materially alter what she can do. The recurrence of aurora, archway, and stardust does charge the final images, but largely in a decorative rather than structurally necessary way.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glowing dune, blooming flora, and post-burn world are vividly and consistently rendered, with the chess clock and archive integrated as recurring, charged objects. The setting’s atmosphere (shimmering sand, vibrating air, swirling patterns) strongly supports the piece’s lyric, otherworldly tone. However, the environment rarely constrains Asa’s choices or creates concrete obstacles; it’s more backdrop than active pressure. Strong imagery but still more decorative than fully tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    The “Mechanical rainforest” is vivid and sensorially present: steel trees, wires, mechanical eyes, and the wind through mixed-material leaves create a strong, coherent atmosphere. Details are consistently filtered through the philosopher’s quest for insight, so environment and interiority align tonally. However, the setting rarely constrains action or forces decisions; it’s lush backdrop rather than an active shaper of choice. Its strong imagistic coherence earns a solid score despite limited functional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.5)
    The veiled ridgeway, mist, twilight, and shoreline are consistently evoked and provide a stable, dreamy atmosphere. The ticket punch’s star stamp and the glowing marks on palms are strong concrete touches that tie environment and symbol together. However, the setting rarely constrains choices or alters tactics; it’s more backdrop than active pressure. The final image of mist clearing over a new shore is effective but still generalized rather than sharply particular.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.8)
    The cobalt fortress, snow, dusty spiral staircase, and discoloration motif establish a strong, cold, cloistered atmosphere. These details are sensibly filtered through the bellhop’s perspective and recur at the end to echo the idea of a path through stillness. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; it mostly reflects mood. The snow and fortress could be swapped for other isolating images without fundamentally changing the action.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.8)
    The ancient temple library, candles, parchment, and shadows create a clear, atmospheric setting, and the iron gall ink pellet functions as a small but effective recurring object. However, the environment rarely constrains action or forces tactical choices—it’s more mood than engine. Details skew toward generic “mystic library” imagery rather than highly particular, character-filtered noticing. The final image of the changed library/beacon is strong but not fully prepared with concrete evolutions of the space.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sea level monitoring station and reef environment are consistently and concretely evoked (beeps, logbooks, waves, coral recovery), creating a coherent atmosphere. Setting details are filtered through Maya’s professional and emotional lens, tying environment to her concerns about paths and sea-level rise. The station, atlas, and ocean do charge the final image, but they rarely constrain concrete choices; the environment is more mood and symbolism than active pressure. Still, the specificity and integration are strong enough to feel lived rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    The abandoned spaceport, mountains, and mossed stone circle are evoked with solid sensory detail and a consistent contemplative atmosphere. The opera glasses and bare feet help tie environment to body and attention, especially when the circle’s hum is felt physically. However, the settings mainly serve as mood backdrops rather than constraints on choice; little in the environment truly forces tactics or limits options. The strong, coherent atmosphere earns a good score, but the setting is not yet fully weaponized in service of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    The volcanic hot springs and sulfurous air are sensorially specific, recurring, and filtered through Akira’s affinity for the place, giving the piece a strong, coherent atmosphere. The plants’ physical presence and whispers blur environment and consciousness in a purposeful way. The final image—Akira with the glowing embryo amid steam and bubbling earth—feels visually and tonally earned by the earlier grounding. The setting could more strongly constrain action or introduce risk, but it already does significant atmospheric work.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.4)
    The seaside arboretum and cliff are vividly rendered—the bent trees, salt wind, blue-gray sea, and creaking branches create a strong atmosphere that mirrors her inner state. Details are sensory and purposeful, with the setting shifting from “twisted, tortured” to “sanctuary” in step with her emotional arc. However, the environment mostly provides mood rather than materially constraining her choices, which keeps this out of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse library is vividly rendered—the dusty tomes, worn leather, and beam of light all harmonize with the introspective mood. The setting functions symbolically as labyrinth, sanctuary, and beacon, and it recurs at the end to frame her new orientation. However, it seldom constrains specific actions or options; it’s more a richly atmospheric backdrop than an active environment. The world feels coherent and tactile enough for this length and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.0)
    The “wind-carved encampment,” rocky outcroppings, and fading eclipse give a clear visual frame, and the disappearing ink and hummingbird drone add textural specificity. However, setting mostly functions as atmosphere; the environment rarely constrains tactics or alters what’s possible. Sensory focus is heavily visual, with limited integration of other senses or lived-in interaction beyond “walking,” “cresting a ridge,” and “breeze.” The landscape is evocative but could be swapped for another desolate terrain with minimal revision.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    The “echoing library under snow” is vividly sketched, and the weather and quiet tone nicely mirror the thematic tension between serenity and upheaval. Details like flakes on windows and cryogenic pods create a specific, atmospheric space. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; Aria could execute the same plan in almost any secure archive. Setting works well as mood and image but doesn’t quite charge the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.5)
    The glass-domed desert rose farm, the ruined city outside, and the airship scrap planter are vivid and give a strong sense of place and atmosphere. Scent, light, and enclosure are nicely evoked and consistent with the tranquil mood. However, the environment rarely constrains action or choice; it’s more a backdrop than an active pressure. The final image is charged by setting only in a soft, decorative way rather than as a decisive constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    The “sound wave garden,” “whispering grasses,” and “sleepwalking constellations” create a vivid, coherent atmosphere with a clear tonal aim. Setting details are thematically aligned with sound, silence, and blurred reality/dream boundaries. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or alters tactics; it mostly hums and responds in kind once she’s already succeeding. The rail spike as tool-object and the garden’s vibration at the climax hint at deeper integration but stop short of materially shaping her options.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.5)
    The echoing observatory above the clouds and the mist “shrouding the world” provide a coherent, atmospheric backdrop that matches the story’s introspective mood. The rosewood pen nib functions as a micro-setting object that recurs and charges the final image, albeit more symbolically than causally. However, the environment barely constrains options or action; Adelaide could make the same decision almost anywhere quiet and elevated. Description leans on repeated clouds/mist imagery rather than evolving, situation-driven detail.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    The “laboratory of lost sounds” is vivid and sensorially specific—sandalwood and myrrh, whirring machines, flickering candles, meteor hush all create a clear, textured world. Objects like the antique dresser, amber, and cord recur and help charge the atmosphere, with the cord in particular affecting action. The environment mostly supports mood rather than constraining options, but it’s consistently filtered through the protagonist’s sensibility. The final image of the quiet lab and dawn light meaningfully reweights the earlier eerie atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto, mist, whispering gallery, and mandala are sensorially vivid and tonally unified, with damp stone, murmurs, fog, and lilac light working together to create a distinct atmosphere. The tile flake and the grotto’s whispers integrate setting with theme and character, rather than feeling like postcard décor. However, the environment largely frames mood rather than constraining choices or tactics; she never has to navigate the space in a way that alters options. Strong lyric atmosphere, but the setting’s role remains more symbolic than operative.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ancient plaza, shattered sky, and charred stalls form a vivid, coherent atmosphere that supports the emotional register. The mosaic elements (tessera and stepping stone) recur meaningfully and help charge the final act of renaming. Details are largely visual, but they are selective rather than touristic, and the ruins subtly mirror the internal project of reclamation. The environment does not much constrain choices, but it effectively frames and colors them.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mystic orchard garden and hedge maze are vividly evoked through light, scent, and sound; the atmosphere is consistent and immersive. Details like the rearranging trees and vibrating flowers effectively embody the magic responding to Echo’s actions. The tarot coin also functions as a recurring object that charges the final image. However, the setting rarely constrains or complicates choices; it mostly decorates and echoes theme rather than operating as active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    The light painting studio is concretely realized with scents of linseed oil and turpentine, static from equipment, and Luna moving through light sources—these details feel lived-in and anchored to her craft. The muscovite geode functions as a recurring object that charges multiple images and frames the final moment. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or introduces friction; it serves more as evocative backdrop than active pressure. Still, the sensory specificity and consistent use of the studio and geode are above-average for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.2)
    The coastal cave network, bioluminescent fungi, salt and seaweed, and damp echoes are vividly and consistently rendered, giving the story a strong atmospheric spine. Details are filtered reasonably well through Aria’s mapping-focused perspective. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or introduces danger; it’s primarily a stage for mood rather than an active pressure. The fossil as object gains some final-image charge but still feels more symbolic than operative.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.0)
    The amber warehouse, cliffs, and hourglasses generate an evocative, cohesive atmosphere, and details like “scent of aged wood” and “warm, golden light” are pleasant if familiar. However, the environment rarely constrains action or forces choice; it’s a static backdrop for reflection rather than an active pressure. Objects such as the jar and buttons are thematically important but not used in tactile, problem-shaped ways. The final image of the warehouse as beacon of shared wisdom has some charge but still leans on abstraction over concrete, lived-in setting.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.2)
    Zephyr Bluff, mist, deep snow, and the “silver hush” create a consistent, moody atmosphere with some sensory texture (wet earth, cool air). However, the environment rarely constrains action or tactics; she could do almost the same story on any foggy hill. Repetition of mist/swirl/silver hush begins to feel static rather than evolving in response to her internal shifts. The setting supports tone more than it drives story.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.5)
    The fog-bound crossing, ferry, water, and rain gutters create a rich, coherent atmosphere with strong sensory layering (sound of lapping water, smell of damp earth, tactile mist). The environment subtly mirrors the thematic movement from obscurity to clarity. Yet the setting rarely constrains choice or action; the coachman’s tactics don’t significantly depend on these details beyond delayed sight of the traveler. As atmosphere, it’s strong; as a pressure system, it’s underused.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is vivid and sensorial: scorched earth, old honey and wax, flattened chimney smoke, and the beekeeping remnants all contribute to a textured atmosphere. The environment mirrors the internal inquiry about care, abandonment, and resistance to change in an organic way. However, the oasis almost never constrains action or tactics; it is evocative but largely passive. The lantern glass earns some micro-setting credit as a charged object framing the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    The harbor by moonlight, the fire escape, the lone boat, and the city’s “dark corners” are all clearly and consistently evoked. The setting is integrated into mood and theme—especially the luminous water and oar-rhythm echoing the gardener’s motions. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; it is more backdrop and metaphor than an active pressure. Still, the final image of dawn over the harbor gives a solid atmospheric cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.5)
    The tidal library above the clouds, the ever-changing seas, and the humming stone circle are vivid, coherent anchors that give the story its strongest texture. Setting is well-integrated with mood—the hum “resonated deep within her chest” and the shifting light across the sundial mirrors her internal attention. However, the environment rarely constrains action or choice; it mainly provides an evocative backdrop rather than active pressure. Still, the library, stones, and sundial meaningfully charge the final image, giving the world a distinct and memorable feel.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.0)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, scents, and water sounds create a vivid, serene atmosphere with good sensory specificity. The recurring images of the temple, pond, and twig spiral do charge the final moments thematically. However, the environment seldom constrains or redirects action; it’s more a beautiful backdrop than an active pressure or resource. Description is strong but used mostly for mood rather than integrated choice-making.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.2)
    The university radio station is an apt and consistently referenced setting, with charts, consoles, static, and hum contributing to a coherent atmosphere. However, the space rarely constrains or complicates action; it feels like a backdrop rather than an active pressure. Sensory detail leans heavily on sound and light but remains somewhat generic (“soft glow of the console,” “cramped radio station”) rather than idiosyncratic. The environment does not significantly charge the final image beyond reiterating its role as “hub of activity.”

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting work is vivid and atmospheric: damp earth, labyrinthine tunnels, the nexus chamber, organ reverberations, and starlight all create a coherent, moody environment. Details are filtered enough through Lyra’s perceptions that they don’t feel like a tourist catalog. However, the environment seldom constrains her options beyond “follow the sound” and open a single door; it’s more backdrop than live pressure. The recurring spaces and tools (tunnels, chamber, crystal) contribute to tone and closure but could do more tactical work.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.5)
    The quarry and mist are consistently evoked and tonally appropriate, giving the piece a coherent, somber atmosphere. Details are largely visual and somewhat repetitive, but they do echo the thematic obscurity of faces and unsolved cases. The setting does not significantly constrain action or generate new options; it’s more backdrop than engine. Still, the mist and quarry frame the final image effectively enough to modestly charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.0)
    The experimental weather station, transparent dome, and storm outside provide a serviceable atmospheric container, and details like the jet stream shift nod toward a larger world. However, the environment seldom constrains action or thought beyond “fragile bubble” imagery; Emilia rarely interacts with the space in tactile, lived ways. The spongey dread and thickening air do support tone but are described rather than evolving through concrete changes in the setting. The copper nail as micro-setting object is evocative but doesn’t quite alter what she can or cannot do.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mountain scenic pullout, fog, scaffold wrap, and collodion flake create a visually coherent, mildly evocative environment. Details like the fog lifting and the scaffold wrap fluttering are integrated into beats, not just listed. However, the setting rarely constrains choice or action; it functions more as backdrop and metaphor than as a pressure source. The recurring glass flake does charge the final image somewhat, but not enough to feel indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    The abandoned circus train is evocative and consistently present, with specific touches like rusting cars, carved wooden bird, graffiti, and makeshift altar that support the mood. Sensory detail leans visual and atmospheric, aligning with the “dusky” tone, though it rarely constrains action or forces particular choices. The setting mirrors Kael’s interior state (abandoned dreams, forgotten routes) in a fairly direct way. Strong atmosphere is achieved, but the environment doesn’t meaningfully shape tactics or cost, which limits upper-tier scores.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.0)
    The observatory with its transparent dome, variable stars, and scent of old books is a pleasant, coherent backdrop that suits the contemplative tone. However, these details rarely constrain choice or action; they mostly decorate rather than shape what Lyra can or must do. The day–night transition and dawn light support the “understanding dawns” motif, but again at a symbolic level more than a tactical one. Overall atmosphere is clear but not especially vivid or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.0)
    The “swirling orchard vortex at the heart of the cursed lake” is vivid and distinctive, and details like spongy ground and watching, twisted trees create a coherent eerie atmosphere. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or alters tactics; the druid mostly just walks forward and observes. Some descriptive phrases repeat without evolving the situation, which reduces the sense of a dynamically changing space. The setting supports tone but does not strongly shape the story’s decisions or final image.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cobalt glade, maze topiary, damp earth, and ancient tree are vividly and consistently rendered, with good sensory layering (smell of wildflowers, tactile bark, glowing scars). The environment strongly supports mood and theme, framing the glade as a liminal, almost sacred site. That said, the setting rarely constrains choice or tactics; it is atmospheric rather than obstructive. The final image of the cobalt glade as a “boundless canvas” is evocative but leans more into abstraction than materially charged specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.2)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid and sensorial—the roots between bones, damp earth, “morbid perfume,” and the half-lit corridors all create a coherent, eerie atmosphere. Setting details are consistently threaded through the action (root-snarled ground where she finds the card, trees leaning in as she casts) and mirror the internal work of burial and transformation. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or alters tactics; it’s richly atmospheric rather than functionally binding, which keeps it below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.2)
    The quarry office trailer, rock dust, and valley below provide a concrete, mildly distinctive backdrop with a few tactile details. The setting’s echoing emptiness reasonably mirrors Jack’s emotional state and the “echo valley” motif. Yet the environment rarely constrains action or meaningfully alters options; it mostly functions as mood décor. The recurring quarry imagery in the ending helps a bit but still stops short of deeply charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.0)
    The Magnetic arbor above the clouds is a promisingly uncanny locale, with mist, drifting clouds, and humming magnetic forces, but the description remains generic and heavily recycled. The environment barely constrains action; it mirrors her insight (“pulsating in harmony with her efforts”) rather than shaping her choices. The seed and arbor do reappear at the end, charging the final image a bit. Still, the setting feels more like a mystical backdrop than a lived, problem-solving space.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tidal atrium is vividly evoked—the salt scent, the lapping waves, the blend of natural and constructed elements—and clearly filters through the librarian’s sensibility. The environment consistently mirrors the theme of fluid identity and time’s dissolution, and the creel as a rustic intrusion into this liminal space is effective. However, the setting almost never constrains or enables specific actions; it’s backdrop and metaphor rather than an active stage affecting choice. Still, the atmosphere is strong enough to feel distinctive and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.3)
    The crystal caves are vividly introduced with “otherworldly silence” and sparkling walls, and the hush of the setting supports the meditative tone. Beyond atmosphere, though, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; Aria could be in almost any mystical space with minimal revision. The caves’ “resonant hush” returns conceptually at the ending but serves more as mood than as a concrete pressure or resource.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    The disused, ivy-covered railway station and nearby river are vivid and consistent, with damp earth, decaying leaves, and the reclaimed structure strongly anchoring atmosphere. Setting details are well integrated into Elara’s contemplative state, especially the station’s transformation into a symbol of rebirth. The accordion and map function as micro-setting objects that recur and color the final image. Still, the environment rarely constrains action or forces choice; it’s evocative backdrop more than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.0)
    The glowing library and mist-shrouded city are vividly and consistently evoked, with tactile details like worn leather tomes and soft luminescence creating a coherent atmosphere. The setting’s tone (mystical, hushed) supports the theme of unspoken words. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or forces tactics; it’s more backdrop than active pressure. Still, recurring images (mist, glow, shelves) do charge the final return into the fog.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting is vivid and sensuous—the velvet observatory, midsummer light, orchids, and automated hum all create a coherent, atmospheric space. Details are consistent and filtered through Elian’s contemplative state, supporting the dreamy, slightly uncanny tone. However, the environment rarely constrains action or choice; it’s more backdrop than engine of pressure. The violin as object approaches micro-setting status, but it still doesn’t meaningfully alter tactics beyond being held and contemplated.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    The skyborne grotto and aurora are vividly rendered—crystalline structures refracting light, the celestial dance, the grotto as a “sentinel of the sky.” These images strongly support the meditative, numinous tone and are consistently filtered through Aria’s aesthetic sensibility. Yet the environment rarely constrains options or forces choices; it is more a lush backdrop than an active pressure. The emerald chip functions as a micro-setting in the final image, charging the ending but not quite elevating environmental stakes to the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.2)
    The “umbral grotto above the clouds” and images like scalloping the clouds and rustling leaves create an appealing, softly surreal atmosphere. Setting is largely decorative: it frames her serenity but rarely constrains action or forces choices. Sensory detail skews visual and abstract (“vineyard hush”) rather than grounded in tactile or specific physical constraints. The hairpin and grotto do charge the final image somewhat, but more as symbols than as lived-in, choice-shaping environments.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    The lighthouse, dawn, breeze, and wind chimes create a consistent, lightly evocative atmosphere, and the recurring environmental details (chimes, height, mist) support the contemplative tone. The shard and chimes charge the final image conceptually, though the setting rarely constrains action or choice—it’s more backdrop than functional space. Sensory detail leans heavily on sight and sound, but is coherent. Stronger integration of the lighthouse’s physicality into the conscience’s work would lift this.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    The floating rock platform, pond, and “sycamore hush” produce a coherent, gentle atmosphere and some vividness (especially the concentric rings). However, the environment rarely constrains action or forces choices; it mostly functions as backdrop and metaphor source. The “magnetic grotto under starlight” is conceptually intriguing but never concretely entered or used on the page. Overall, setting is pleasant, clear, and somewhat memorable, but under-exploited.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.5)
    The canyon of endless echoes, towers of bone, layered dust, and vibrational hum are vivid and sensorially varied, especially when paired with the flock of birds and their shadows. The environment coheres tonally with the themes of resonance and stillness, and the recurring dust and echoes help charge the final image of the skimmer’s enduring presence. However, the setting rarely constrains or redirects action; it is atmospheric rather than operative, providing backdrop rather than forcing choices. Strong world texture, but not yet leveraged for maximal narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    The icebound spire and hidden garden are vividly evoked—“flowers that shone like tiny stars,” “icebound spire above the clouds”—and consistently tonally aligned. The environment feels distinctive and helps frame her isolation and inwardness, though it rarely constrains her choices beyond providing a convenient marvel to discover. Worldbuilding touches like “accommodating impossibilities” are flavorful but not fully exploited in action. The keystone as a luminous focal object nicely charges the key visual moments.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.0)
    The pier, sunken ship, and forgotten library are vividly introduced with salt, decay, creaking hulls, and flickering light, giving a strong sense of place. The contrast between the noisy festival above and the “meteor hush” below supports the tone. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics or creates obstacles; Kael moves through it without resistance. The final image of lanterns as a “celestial map” is evocative but could be more tightly tied to the ship/library specifics to fully charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.0)
    The ambered observatory deck, scents of distillation, and “faint tang of starlight” create a pleasingly cinematic and sensory environment. Setting is consistently present and tonally aligned, making the scene feel located in a specific, if abstract, space. Yet the environment rarely constrains action or forces choices; it is backdrop more than engine. The coins and apparatus approach object-as-setting but stop short of shaping tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ancient observatory at dusk, the worn stone balcony, and the star-filled sky are vividly evoked and consistent with the story’s contemplative mode. The atlas page, sea imagery, and celestial map recur and contribute to atmosphere and the final image of the observatory as “sentinel.” However, the environment seldom constrains choices or tactics; it’s more poetic backdrop than active pressure. Strong sensory specificity lifts this above average, but the setting doesn’t fully charge the closing beat in a way that would push into top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.0)
    The sapphire viaduct, dawn sky, and salt air produce a vivid, coherent atmosphere, and the recurring blue light helps charge the final image. The bell and viaduct are clearly placed in space and visually legible throughout. That said, the environment rarely constrains tactics or choices; it’s an evocative backdrop rather than an active pressure. A stronger interaction between place and process would be needed to reach a truly elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drowned-then-resurfacing town, mud, skeletal buildings, damp earth, and the wind chime create a vivid, eerie atmosphere, and the setting is consistently filtered through the warden’s gaze. Environmental details like the resurfacing streets, child’s toy, and creaking street sign are concrete and evocative. However, the setting rarely constrains choice or alters tactics; it mainly supplies mood rather than pressure. The recurring images (liqueur label, ridgeway, twilight hush) charge the tone but stop short of fully transforming the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard and the kaleidoscopic waterfall are vividly rendered and integrated into action (searching among roots, lighting a burner on-site, mist filling the orchard, the environment brightening as a result). The starlings, trees, and waterfall recur to create a coherent atmosphere of living, responsive nature. While the setting strongly charges the mood and final image, it doesn’t significantly constrain choices or tactics—Elara is never pressured by the environment, only inspired by it. Even so, the specificity and consistency of the world-building are a notable strength at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.1)
    The nocturnal arbor above the clouds is vivid, coherent, and sensorially specific (wooden slats, cloud sea, dawn light), creating a strong atmosphere. The environment is mostly a beautiful backdrop, but it does lightly charge the final image as she leaves the arbor and faces the brightening sky. The parachute buckle as a micro-setting object also ties body and world credibly. However, the setting rarely constrains choices or tactics; it’s evocative rather than functionally integrated, which keeps it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.0)
    The floating rock dojo, levitation hum, and brain in a jar are vivid enough to anchor place and mood, and they recur in the final beats. However, the setting rarely constrains choices or evolves with the action—Kaito largely could be in any quiet room and behave the same. The most effective environmental touch is the dojo as “world unto itself,” mirroring his isolation, but this remains conceptual rather than enacted through concrete interaction with space. The history-in-flux backdrop stays vague and doesn’t deepen situational texture beyond a general sense of flux.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.2)
    The brook, nocturnal haven, and cottage are consistently evoked and create a cohesive, tranquil atmosphere well-suited to reflective mode. Details like moonlight, the sound of water, and dawn light work, though they skew generic and repeat rather than deepening. The environment doesn’t meaningfully constrain choices or tactics; she could have had the same arc at a kitchen table in a city apartment with minor edits. Setting functions nicely as backdrop and tone support, but not as an active pressure or tool.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.5)
    The echo chamber tunnel and hollow household are clear atmospheric anchors that support the ghostly, resonant tone. The leaf blower as a tool within this environment adds some idiosyncratic specificity. However, the space doesn’t much constrain options or tactics; it’s largely a backdrop for reverberant sound rather than an active force in the narrative. Description leans abstract (“cold stone walls,” “shadows reigned supreme”) instead of exploiting more concrete, sensory texture.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.5)
    The frozen garden, mist, and statues are vividly rendered with consistent sensory and tonal control, and they evolve from morbid to luminous as her perception shifts. Details like the “macabre grins” and “soft, lunar glow” are specific and meaningful rather than generic goth décor. The environment functions thematically as a threshold and dreamscape, though it rarely constrains concrete choices or tactics in scene. Strong atmosphere and specificity, but the setting could more actively shape what she can and cannot do.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ember nexus and twilight atmosphere are vividly evoked with strong sensory and visual language (“charred dreams,” “frozen bloom of color”). The setting is consistent and threaded from start to finish, culminating in the twilight deepening around the transformed crozier. However, the environment rarely constrains action or tactics; it is more stage and mood than active pressure. The crozier functions partly as micro-setting, but mostly symbolically rather than as a practical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.8)
    The abandoned radio tower city over a gorge, ozone scent, and moonlit perigee create a distinctive, cohesive atmosphere. Details like “hum of the abandoned radio towers” and “creaking of rusty metal” integrate setting with the act of listening. However, the environment rarely constrains or complicates her actions; it functions more as lyrical backdrop than as an active shaper of choice. The setting is vivid but somewhat static, repeating its mood rather than evolving with the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.0)
    The ferry, hourglass, and especially the spectral grotto under starlight are vividly evoked, with the hum, dripping water, and mineral glints creating a coherent atmosphere. Details are consistently filtered through Elara’s sense of wonder, which supports the tone. However, the environment rarely constrains her choices—nothing in the grotto forces a trade-off; it mainly serves as beautiful backdrop and occult archive. The setting charges the final image but doesn’t quite function as an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    The optical illusion gallery is an evocative, coherent setting with a consistent atmosphere of mirrors, distortions, and fluorescent hum. Details like the “scent of old glass” and “reflection in rippling water” help sustain the mood, though they lean heavily on visual/abstract registers. The setting supports the theme conceptually but rarely constrains concrete choices or tactics; the architect drifts rather than navigates real spatial or social pressures. The sinew thread functions as a charged object, but environmental specificity beyond that is relatively generic.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.8)
    The benthic city, abyssal plain, and stars “like diamonds scattered across the velvet expanse” provide a consistent, if conventional, atmosphere. The weathered boat anchor link and city-as-launchpad imagery hint at symbolic resonance but do not constrain choices or tactics. Much of the setting description repeats ideas of darkness vs. horizon-opening light without adding new, grounded specifics. The world feels sketched and mood-driven rather than lived-in or functionally integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mist-clad atrium, twilight, and the hearing aid’s hum create a coherent, moody atmosphere that supports the supernatural undertone. Setting details are consistent and imaginatively framed, and the mist’s clearing in response to Aria’s words is a nice environmental mirroring of emotional change. However, the atrium doesn’t significantly constrain choices or tactics; it’s more backdrop than active pressure. The repetition of “mist” risks feeling decorative rather than fully exploited as a narrative tool.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.8)
    The undersea facility, anemone-encrusted steel, and humming cables create a distinct, moody environment that fits the premise well. Setting integrates decently with action via the hum of the cables, tidal currents, and pressure shifts, though these pressures rarely force hard tactical changes. Description leans visual and conceptual rather than fully embodied, but it avoids white-room blandness. The final image of looking back at the sea and remembering the “crashing hush” of the cables gives the setting some lingering charge.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    The opal observatory, snow, ink, and porcelain shard create a distinct, coherent atmosphere with good visual specificity. Weather and environment mirror the mood effectively (the deepening snow, then stillness at dawn), even if they rarely constrain concrete choices. The shard and snow are nicely recharged in the final image when the shard falls “like snowflakes.” Overall, the setting feels textured and purposeful, though more as mood scaffold than as an active constraint on action.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.5)
    The canyon of endless echoes, towers of bone, and flock patterns form a vivid, coherent atmosphere with strong visual specificity. The setting is integrated with concept—the canyon as memory conduit, the bone towers as screens for shadow-texture—but it rarely constrains concrete choices, remaining mostly metaphorical. Still, the final image of the canyon reverberating with a “newfound sense of purpose” shows the environment reweighted by events. Visually and conceptually strong, just shy of using environment as a true tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.5)
    The underground garden is evocatively introduced—damp earth, roots, blooming flowers, moss-covered stone—and the cordless phone as anachronistic object-on-altar has strong atmospheric charge. Details are selective rather than exhaustive, and they support a liminal, occult tone. However, the environment rarely constrains Lena’s options or creates practical pressure; it’s more backdrop than active agent. The arrowhead and phone function as charged objects but don’t physically or spatially limit what she can do.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.2)
    The enchanted orchard, sky-bridge, and living statues are clearly established and tonally cohesive, creating a consistent fairy-tale atmosphere. Imagery like “flowers that shimmered like stardust” and the glowing sky-bridge gives a distinct, if generalized, sense of place. However, the environment mostly decorates rather than constrains choices or tactics; Luna’s actions would be similar in almost any magical garden. The locust shell functions more as a stated symbol than as a tool or environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.0)
    The cobalt arcade, drones, and bottled storm are vivid and give a distinct atmosphere. However, the arcade is mostly a framing device; it does not constrain or meaningfully alter his tactics. The most effective setting work comes from the border and hovering drone, which do shape the required stealth. The storm-in-a-bottle charges the imagery but remains more emblematic than environment-like.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned circus train, mist, lantern, halo fragment, and hidden oasis create a vivid, coherent atmosphere with strong visual and auditory texture. Setting details are consistently integrated into mood—the wind bells, the mist, the star-reflecting pool all reinforce the hush and magic. The environment rarely constrains action or forces tactical choices, functioning more as a lyrical backdrop than an active pressure. Still, the place feels specific and memorably strange.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the strongest element: the “scientific poetry library,” soft reading lamps, sandalwood, old paper, and labyrinthine shelves create a textured, specific atmosphere. Details feel filtered through the librarian’s sensibility, emphasizing analog, tactile qualities and the blending of art and science. However, the environment almost never constrains options or behavior; it’s a beautifully painted backdrop rather than an active force in the story. The tattered scarf and lamps charge the ending image somewhat, but not with significant stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    The whispering archipelago, the dock at dawn, and the library are sensorially and atmospherically clear, with recurring touches of light on water and “whispers” grounding the lyricism. Details like the “gentle lapping” and “weathered dock” feel lived-in and support the tone. That said, the environment rarely constrains action or choice; it serves more as a beautiful backdrop than an active pressure or resource. The setting does charge the final images of dawn and shimmering islands, helping the ending resonate visually even if it doesn’t alter options.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is lushly described—“shadowed nexus under starlight,” latticework branches, the gnarled tree—and successfully sustains a magical, nocturnal atmosphere. However, most of these details are decorative; the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics beyond generically guiding the locksmith to a clearing. Sensory focus is heavily visual, with little textural or auditory specificity beyond “hush” and “breeze.” The final image of stars “twinkling in approval” is evocative but thematically on-the-nose rather than freshly charged by prior constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sunken orchard, intact greenhouse, damp earth, decaying fruit, and ring of shipwrecks create a vivid, atmospheric setting with strong sensory detail. These details are filtered through Emilia’s sensibility and echo her preoccupation with the past and lost innovation. However, the environment rarely constrains her choices or tactics; it mainly decorates rather than shapes the action. The final image leans more on internal resolve than on a charged interplay with the physical world.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.5)
    The forgotten library, dust, old wooden shelves, and the empty playground swing together create a strong, coherent atmosphere that fits the melancholic, liminal premise. Sensory detail (dust motes, scent of old books and tea, the creak of the swing) is selective and purposeful, supporting the idea of a secluded, in-between space for exiled souls. The setting mirrors the archivist’s inner work and the theme of forgotten-but-retrievable things, though it rarely constrains concrete choices. It’s vivid and tonally apt, if more mood-setting than tactically active.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting—a verdant parapet beside a roaring waterfall—feels sensorially present, with light, sound, and growth evoked consistently. The waterfall’s evolution from backdrop to “shimmering veil” and “gateway to other worlds” gives the place some functional charge in the ending image. However, the environment rarely constrains action or creates difficulty; it mostly provides lyrical backdrop. The natural details are vivid but somewhat generic, more postcard-beautiful than lived-in or specific.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    The “prism sanctuary under starlight” is vivid and consistently returned to, with the kaleidoscopic light charging the atmosphere and final image. The setting is strongly integrated with mood rather than with concrete constraints on action; nothing in the environment forces a specific choice. Nonetheless, the recurring prisms, starlight, and luminescent orbs give the piece a distinctive, coherent locus. The net and needle as micro-setting elements are tactile enough to prevent white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.0)
    The rain-scoured fresco vault, damp earth, mold, and ancient stones create a coherent, moody atmosphere that suits the piece’s contemplative tone. Setting is consistently present and sensorially grounded enough to avoid white-room syndrome. However, the environment mostly decorates rather than constrains action or choice—the rain and vault don’t materially change what she can or must do—so the world never quite becomes an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    The “forgotten sunken ship library” is vivid and specific: luminescent fish, salt and decay, wreckage and relics all build a strong, consistent atmosphere. Setting details are generally filtered through Eli’s reflective mindset and echo the themes of loss and transience. However, the environment mostly colors mood rather than constraining choices or tactics in a meaningful way. As a result, it’s evocative and publishable-level solid, but not yet fully leveraged as an active narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    The “misty courtyard above clouds,” with wet stone, ozone, and swirling statues, is vivid and sustained, and the storm’s sensory presence (fog, lightning, thunder) effectively underpins the mood. Details like the etched bolt plate and the humming energy are well integrated into the atmosphere rather than feeling like a tour of features. The setting does not significantly constrain choice or tactics, functioning more as a lush backdrop than as a pressure source. Nonetheless, it does charge the final image of a changed courtyard and lingering song.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.5)
    The icebound spire, frost-etched walls, and ethereal chamber are clearly evoked and give the story a distinct, if familiar, fantasy atmosphere. The setting supports tone (isolation versus sanctuary) and thematically mirrors the diary’s mix of beauty and pain. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or creates pressure; it is largely decorative rather than operative. The recurrent ice imagery charges the mood but stops short of deeply shaping action or options.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.8)
    The sky gondola, sea of clouds, storm remnants, and brass telescope create a distinct, coherent atmosphere that suits the contemplative mode. Details like “panoramic windows” and “deep, foreboding grey” clouds anchor the scene, though they skew heavily visual and occasionally generic (“stars twinkling like diamonds”). The environment rarely constrains action or forces choices—it mainly provides a poetic backdrop. Still, the setting is specific enough to be memorable and thematically sympathetic.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tree trunk library is vivid and specific, with golden light, musty parchment, and hollowed wood creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. The setting is more than a backdrop: its impending demolition and role as a constructed “sky inside walls” charge the thematic stakes and the final image. Environmental interaction is mostly contemplative rather than constraining tactics, but the library’s loss is the core external cost. Overall, setting and atmosphere are a major strength, even if they could exert more direct pressure on choices.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    The antique airship, swirling starlings, hopscotch board, and starlight give the piece a distinctive atmosphere and consistent visual palette. Setting details are specific enough to be memorable and are at least loosely filtered through Eli’s work-driven attention (charts, phrasebook, logbook). Yet the environment rarely constrains or redirects action—airship, island, and sky could mostly be swapped without changing tactics, beyond enabling isolation. The final image (airship as a “tiny, isolated community”) gestures toward charged setting but doesn’t quite make the environment integral to the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    The frozen library above the clouds, icy shelves, frost, and moonlike tomes are vivid and coherent, creating a strong, unified atmosphere. Setting is filtered through Kael’s sensibility (indigo eyes, driftwood nostalgia, the allure of gears and mirrors) in a way that supports the tone. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or poses practical challenges; it’s more backdrop than active pressure. The hall of mirrors charges the final image conceptually, but still more as mood than as a functional constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    The orchard planet, butterfly garden, nebula, and floating rock arches are vivid and specific, and they recur in ways that lend the world a coherent atmosphere. The arches and garden provide legible micro-settings for communal reflection and transformation, and the nebula tangibly affects the ecosystem by the end. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics or forces choices; it mostly decorates an already-decided course of action. The final image uses setting motifs effectively but still feels more illustrative than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.0)
    The hidden lighthouse, lantern room, dusk, and glass pane create a distinct, atmospheric container, and the clockwork and puppet head give the space some tactile anchors. The environment supports the hush-filled, reverent tone and isolates the adjuster effectively. That said, the setting mostly functions as mood rather than a constraint on action; weather, architecture, and mechanism don’t actually force or shape choices. Strong atmosphere, but the world could be swapped for another sacred, enclosed space with limited structural damage.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.0)
    The orchard, cottage, cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, and night frost create a cohesive, mildly haunting atmosphere with some sensory detail (dust, old books, golden sunset, frost veil). The labyrinth and birds meaningfully affect outcome by responding to her work, and the final image of frost over a reawakened guide has some charge. However, description leans on familiar phrases and would benefit from more POV-filtered, specific, and tactically constraining detail rather than broad mood.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.0)
    The ravine, braided water, foam, and golden light are consistently evoked and aligned with the contemplative tone, giving a pleasant sense of place. The chrysalis and braided waterways modestly mirror the theme of transformation and connection, and the water’s sound ties to her love of harmony. Still, the setting functions more as a scenic backdrop and metaphorical mirror than as an active constraint on choices or tactics. Greater specificity and integration with action (beyond symbolic reflection) would be needed for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glass orchard library floating on clouds, the refracted light, and the bottle’s shifting glow create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that is consistently filtered through Ember’s attention. Setting motifs (glass, clouds, moonlight) recur and are braided into the final belonging image. However, the environment mostly decorates rather than constrains choices; the library’s physical or social rules never truly pressure her actions. Strong lyric worldbuilding, but not yet using place as an active engine.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    The desert fortress after rain, dunes, tidal pool, and coral pavilion are sensorially vivid and coherent, with a strong atmospheric throughline (wet stone, ozone, cold air around the pavilion). The setting is filtered through Elara’s sensibility, especially her ocean affinity in the desert and her attention to tidal patterns. Still, the environment mostly decorates rather than constrains choices; she encounters little resistance from place or conditions. The repeated image of the damp fortress at start and end nicely charges the final image, but not yet at a transformative level.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.0)
    The clock tower, medieval town, and “borrowed starlight” are vividly evoked and consistent in tone, giving a strong atmospheric frame. However, the setting functions largely as backdrop and metaphor; it rarely constrains choices or alters what Emilia can do. The tower as “witness” at the end is resonant but still more symbolic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.3)
    The moonlit canyon, ruined observatory, and broken mirror create a cohesive, atmospheric setting that suits the story’s mood, and the moonlight’s changing angle is at least gestured toward as time passing. Description is strongly visual and tonally aligned, though other senses and tactile engagement are underused. The setting rarely constrains choices or creates concrete obstacles; it serves more as backdrop and symbol than as an active shaper of action. Still, the observatory ruin and canyon do meaningfully color Elara’s perception and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting is often vivid and sensorial: yellowed parchment crackling, mist, damp stone, and moss all filtered through an archivist’s attention. The “serpentine grotto in the mist-shrouded mountains” and inverted gravity build a distinct, coherent atmosphere that suits the story’s tone. However, the environment rarely constrains action; the grotto’s twists and inversion are described more than they force concrete decisions. World rules (inversion, threshold effects) are consistent but mostly expository rather than dramatized through problem-solving.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.0)
    The siskin alder grove, strings between trees, and the porcelain insulator create a distinct, mildly uncanny atmosphere, and the forest’s subtle responses (“whispered secrets,” trees swaying) support the tone. Setting is consistently present and filtered through the sculptor’s craft. However, the sensory palette leans heavily on visual and conceptual language, with limited tactile or auditory workaround given the silent-world premise. The environment charges the final image but never quite constrains or complicates choices.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.2)
    Twilight, wildflowers, crickets, and the “magnetic nexus” create a consistent, gentle atmosphere with some multisensory detail. However, the nexus remains mostly an abstract “unique energy signature” rather than a physically or rule-specifically realized place. The worry-stone dent is a nice concrete touch but doesn’t meaningfully constrain action. Setting supports mood but rarely shapes choice, so it never fully transcends a soft, postcard-like mysticism.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.0)
    The workshop, stars, sandalwood, jasmine, and fireworks create a lush, sensory-rich atmosphere with consistent tone. Details are clearly filtered through Elara’s heightened, almost mystical perception and reinforce the focus on silence and stillness. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or imposes limits; it decorates rather than pressures action. The final image of stars and lunar glow is resonant but more pretty than structurally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.0)
    The treetop village, canopies, and scent-laden air create a coherent, pleasant atmosphere, and Lyra’s nose gives the setting a specific sensory filter. The forest’s “heartbeat” and “wildflower hush” recur in the climax, tying place to revelation. Yet Elyria itself rarely constrains options or alters tactics; it feels like a lyrical backdrop rather than an active environment. More tactile interaction with structures, heights, or village life could have grounded the mystical register.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    The orchard planet, floating rock arches, inverted gravity, and iridescent pool are vivid and coherent, and they’re meaningfully tied to Lyra’s vocation and actions (flying through arches, landing by the pool). The inversion of gravity and the rock arches create a tactile sense of environment rather than a white-room. World rules are sketched economically and feel internally consistent for this length. Still, the setting could press more directly on choices and danger rather than mostly serving as scenic wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.1)
    The port city and container labyrinth are vividly evoked (“smell of rust and saltwater,” converging steel and shadow), and the environment’s emptiness contributes to atmosphere. The setting is consistently filtered through her investigative lens—containers, debris, wind patterns—giving it occupational plausibility. However, the space rarely constrains her choices or tactics; the labyrinth could mostly be swapped for any desolate industrial zone without breaking the logic. The recurring contrast between darkness inside and sunlight outside nicely charges the final emergence image, but the world remains more moodscape than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ice cavern, crystalline formations, luminescent fungi, and aurora colors are vividly rendered and tonally consistent with the piece’s ethereal mood. Setting details integrate reasonably well with action as crystals hum in response to the song and light appears to thicken around the ritual. However, the environment rarely constrains or complicates choices; it decorates more than it pressures. The final image draws on the fungi’s glow to decent effect but stops short of using setting as an active lever on stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is vividly rendered—Thunder-echo range, sagebrush scent, canyon hush, driftwood markers—and consistently filters through her reflective state. Environmental details like thunder and silence echo the inner theme of turmoil versus stillness, creating a coherent atmosphere. The flute and canyon function as charged objects/places in the final image, giving the ending some spatial and textural weight. That said, the environment rarely constrains her choices; it frames rather than actively pressures the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Topaz workshop, old metal type, and starry sky create a coherent, slightly otherworldly atmosphere. Details like “musty scent of old metal type” and “luminescent orbs” are vivid, though they remain more decorative than functional. The environment barely constrains Echo’s actions, except symbolically via the vanishing stars. Setting supports tone but doesn’t fully integrate with choice or consequence at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway is evocative and consistent, with the aurora, ridgeway, and “fade from memory to myth” creating a strong atmospheric frame. Details are visual and tonal rather than tactile or constraining, but they do filter through Eira’s sensibility and fit the mythic, liminal mood. The setting, however, almost never affects what she can or must do; it’s a stage, not a pressure source. The pendant slightly approaches a “micro-setting” object, but again lacks real constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.0)
    The quartz arbor, mist, frost, and glass are described with vivid, consistent imagery that anchors tone and mood. The setting is strongly atmospheric and filtered through the mystic’s perception, especially in the mist-clearing near the end. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or behavior; it decorates rather than pressures action. This keeps it from reaching the highest tier despite its sensory richness.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.5)
    The orchard and bamboo forest are vividly evoked, with consistent motifs of dappled light, rustling leaves, and undergrowth, creating a stable, meditative atmosphere. The amber bead and puzzle sit convincingly in this space and recur. Yet the environment mostly decorates her mood rather than constraining or enabling choices in a specific way; nearly any secluded natural setting could substitute. The setting does gain some thematic charge as a “threshold,” but it doesn’t fully shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.0)
    The orchard planet, floating rock arches, and mine shafts are vivid and give the piece a distinctive atmosphere beyond generic fantasy-forge tropes. Sensory details like the “sweet scent of blooming orchard trees” and the echoing pickaxes effectively anchor place. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or action; it mostly functions as textured backdrop and metaphor rather than a pressure source. The final image of arches as sentinels nicely ties setting to theme but still feels more symbolic than operational.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.8)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay is vividly evoked at the start—rust, decay, skeletal starships—and the shard functions as a recurring object with atmosphere. However, once she begins world-hopping, the settings blur into generic “succession of worlds” and “kaleidoscope of images” with very little concrete specificity. The environments do not materially constrain her choices or create obstacles; they mainly serve as mood. The return to the repair bay offers a nice circular frame but doesn’t meaningfully reconfigure the setting’s significance beyond gratitude.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lighthouse, lantern room, and rocky shore are vividly rendered and tightly aligned with the melancholic, luminous mood. Details like dusty prisms, the chill evening air, and the glowing cairn feel chosen rather than generic and evolve as the piece progresses. Setting consistently mirrors and amplifies the skipper’s inner state, especially in the final boat departure watched over by the “haunted and beautiful” tower. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but it does clearly charge the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    The emerald lighthouse, starry sky, and glass lantern create a strong, unified atmospheric frame that recurs through the ending image. Description is largely visual but effective, and the lighthouse as sentinel for shadows is thematically apt. Still, the environment almost never constrains or complicates her choices; it’s a beautiful stage rather than an active pressure. Greater use of weather, tower height, or isolation to shape action would raise this.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.3)
    The floating rock tea house above a misty valley is vivid and sensorially pleasing, with lantern light, steam, and drifting altitude creating a strong mood. The environment mirrors Kaito’s contemplative state and supports the “valley-mist wonder” tone. However, the setting is almost entirely atmospheric; it does not materially constrain his choices or tactics beyond providing a pretty backdrop. The blue morpho wing and light interplay are used more actively than the tea house itself.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stormlit tower, damp stone, ozone, and the observatory are vividly evoked, and the moonlight is a strong recurring environmental presence. Setting and atmosphere are consistent and clearly filtered through the story’s mood, if not always deeply through the character’s particular eye. The environment rarely constrains choice or tactics, functioning more as backdrop and tone than as active pressure. Still, the sensory specificity and coherence are above-average and would read comfortably in a literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    The greenhouse in endless night, luminescent fungi, and shimmering plants are distinctly evoked and give the piece a cohesive, atmospheric backdrop. The mica window is especially effective as a charged object that both refracts light and functions as a portal-like focus of energy. Setting, however, mostly frames mood rather than constraining choices; the “alchemical” and “orchard” aspects are gestured at but not deeply dramatized in action. Even so, the sensory specificity and tonal consistency of the environment are a notable strength.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.8)
    The library atmosphere is pleasantly evoked—dusty tomes, lantern glow, musty scent, and dawn light all build a clear, warm cocoon. The setting’s mirroring of Elys’s unobtrusive presence and hiding is thematically apt. Still, the environment rarely constrains action or forces choices; it serves primarily as aesthetic backdrop rather than an active pressure or tool. That limits its impact at a “prestige” level despite its solid vividness.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting is the strongest element: the overgrown palace courtyard, vine-woven tea house, and sensory details (blooming flowers, murmur of conversation) create a distinct atmosphere. These details are consistently filtered through the noticer’s attentiveness and support the meditative tone. However, the environment seldom constrains action or forces choice; it remains a beautiful backdrop rather than an active pressure. The final image does draw on this setting as a site of renewal, which gives it modest closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    The “frozen library above the clouds” and “quartz hush” form a vivid, consistent atmosphere, with nice touches like clouds below whispering a farewell and shelves as “sentinels.” The environment feels coherent and sensorially textured, especially in its visual and tactile coldness. Still, the setting rarely constrains or enables concrete choices; Elara’s actions would be similar in any archive, so the library is more a lyrical backdrop than an active pressure or resource. It does, however, charge the final image and frame the thematic concern with memory and elevation.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.4)
    The pirate market beneath a rotting pier is a vivid, atmospheric premise with effective sensory anchors (smell of saltwater, crowded stalls, dim light). However, after the opening, the environment becomes somewhat static—few later details change options or tactics, and the setting stops evolving with the conflict. The watch fob has some object-charge but the market itself rarely constrains movement or choices. The final image of her disappearing into the light gestures at setting-theme linkage but feels familiar rather than sharply particular.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.0)
    The lavender bluff, aurora, and scented air are vividly evoked with multi-sensory detail and a consistent, dreamy atmosphere. Worldbuilding touches like forests holding elections and people carrying weather are striking, even if they function more as curiosities than hard constraints. The aurora’s intensification and final fading loosely mirror Aria’s inner shift, giving the environment some thematic resonance. Still, the setting rarely shapes tactics or choices in concrete ways; it frames mood more than it pressures action.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.0)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vividly rendered with luminescence and vibrations that “hum in harmony with her heartbeat,” effectively mirroring Elara’s interior state. The setting integrates into action (she adjusts to the light, hears the dripping water, feels the cave’s energy) and charges the final image when the lock takes on a crystalline sheen. However, the environment doesn’t substantially constrain her options or tactics—she could almost as easily have this breakthrough in another evocative place. Sensory detail is strong on the visual and atmospheric but thinner in other modalities.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    The greenhouse city under a toxic sky and the undercroft chamber are vivid and tonally consistent, with strong images like the acidic mist, mutated orchids, and decaying infrastructure. Environmental detail nicely mirrors the thematic decay of memory and connection. However, the setting rarely constrains specific choices or tactics beyond broad mood—Aria doesn’t have to navigate concrete environmental obstacles in a way that alters actions. The final image of misty rain works as atmospheric resonance but could bear more direct, pressured relation to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Whispering Bluff above the clouds, the kinetic sculpture, and the iceberg fragment form a clear, atmospheric setting with consistent mystical logic. Details like metal and crystal responding to wind and light are vivid enough to anchor the lyric tone. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; it’s a backdrop and symbolic stage more than a lived-in space under pressure. The final image is charged by place and object but still feels more decorative than necessity-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.2)
    The glass-domed desert rose farm is a strong conceptual setting, and details like heat, smoke, and the dome amplifying the flames give some atmosphere. However, much of the description is generalized—roses are “beautiful” and patterns are “intricate” without distinctive specifics. The environment rarely constrains tactics beyond generic heat and smoke; Aria’s actions would read similarly in almost any enclosed greenhouse. The setting supports theme but doesn’t fully come alive as a lived-in, pressuring space.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.5)
    The “vibrant courtyard at dawn” is pleasantly sketched with birds, mailman, and hum of activity, but functions mostly as postcard atmosphere. After the opening, setting recedes into generic “courtyard” and “thrift store” without evolving alongside the investigation. The locket as object gets some atmospheric weight at the end, yet the environment never constrains choices or meaningfully shapes tactics. Overall, the world is legible but not deeply inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sunken laboratory, rust, saltwater, and decay create a strong, coherent atmosphere that suits the introspective tone, and the spider’s web provides a vivid recurring image. Sensory detail skews visual and olfactory but is specific enough to avoid white-room syndrome. However, the environment rarely constrains her choices in concrete ways; it functions more as mood and metaphor than as an active pressure. The setting charges the final image (web left behind, light at the door) but could further shape tactics to reach higher tiers.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.3)
    Setting is the story’s main strength: the harbor, salt crystal growing chamber, tunnels, and subterranean crystal are rendered with coherent, luminous detail. The sensory palette (light, water, salt, crystalline reflections) effectively builds a consistent, hushed atmosphere that supports the tone. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or drives tactics; it’s more backdrop than active pressure. The recurring crystals do subtly charge the final image but stop short of becoming a decisive agent in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.7)
    The nocturnal haven by the brook is clearly and consistently rendered, with sensory touches like rustling leaves, brook sounds, and scented flowers that establish a coherent atmosphere. The crane drifting on the brook at the end gives the setting one functional role beyond backdrop. Still, much of the description cycles the same tranquil notes without evolving pressure or specificity, and the environment rarely constrains choice or creates difficulty. The world feels pleasant and static rather than lived-in and shaping the summoner’s tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.2)
    The rooftop garden and meteor shower form a coherent, pleasing backdrop, with a few concrete touches (twinkling city lights, blooming flowers). The environment supports tone and theme (hidden magic, secrets under the mundane) but rarely shapes behavior beyond enabling a tranquil conversation. The antique desk seal functions as a recurring object that lightly charges the final image. Overall, the setting is atmospheric but somewhat generic and not strongly integrated into choice or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.5)
    The “velvet garden at twilight,” whispering flowers, and dawn light create a consistent, mildly evocative atmosphere, and the shell as object recurs into the final image. Still, the setting functions largely as backdrop and metaphor rather than as a constraint or active participant in choice. Sensory detail skews visual and abstract (“velvet,” “ethereal”) without much tactile or situational specificity, and the garden’s rules or properties never matter to what Lyra can or cannot do. The final threshold image works conceptually but lacks the sharply grounded particulars needed at elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.0)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, candles, parchment, and stalactites create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere, with multiple senses engaged (light, scent, touch). The setting is strongly woven into the prose and mirrors the contemplative, revisionist project of the forger. However, it rarely constrains choices or alters tactics; it’s almost entirely textural rather than functional. The recurring sanctuary/aurora imagery does charge the final emptiness of the space, but more as aesthetic coda than structural engine.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    The “serpentine nexus under starlight” and canyon setting create a consistent, dreamy atmosphere, and the recurring shell functions as a micro‑setting object. Yet the environment remains largely abstract—no concrete geography, texture, or constraint that meaningfully alters what Aria can do. Setting serves mood and theme more than embodied choice; it never truly boxes her in or forces a tactical adaptation. This is strong atmosphere but short of top‑tier, choice‑shaping specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glacier shrine, melting ice, candlelight, and snow globe are vividly rendered and consistent, giving a strong sense of cold, glow, and otherworldliness. The setting is more atmospheric than functional: it colors Aria’s perception but rarely constrains or redirects her choices. Still, the shrine and snow globe recur in the final image and help charge the ending as a quiet beacon. This is strong mood work, though not yet using environment as a full dramatic lever.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.3)
    Atmosphere is the story’s strongest asset: the whispering parapet, post-rain mist, wet earth, fireflies, and moonlit water create a vivid, unified nightscape. Details are sensorially specific and consistent with the protagonist’s contemplative focus. However, the setting mostly decorates rather than constrains action or choice; the environment doesn’t truly force or shape decisions. It’s high-quality scene-painting that could become exceptional if the world exerted more narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    The “wasteland orchard” and radioactive dust storms are evocative and give the piece a distinctive backdrop, and the “sickly yellow glow” and “pulsating” stillpoint image land nicely. Yet the environment seldom constrains tactics or meaningfully alters Aria’s options; the storms buffet her but don’t force real adaptation. Much description is reiterated at a similar pitch rather than evolving with the stakes. Strong atmosphere in concept, moderate integration in practice.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.0)
    “Stormlit observatory above the clouds” and “cobalt glass portico” are evocative images that frame the piece and give it a mild atmospheric charge. However, the setting never affects tactics or imposes constraints; the storm, altitude, and glass are purely decorative. Most of the narrative operates at an abstract, disembodied level with minimal sensory specificity beyond these repeated icons. The final image reprises the observatory and portico, but they function more as generic symbols than fully realized, lived-in places.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.5)
    The loft, jars, music box, and dunes are sensorially vivid and consistent, creating a coherent atmosphere of dusty isolation and fragile beauty. Details like captured sounds in glass jars are distinctive and filtered through the poet’s sensibility, and the dawn light evolving across the piece supports the emotional arc. However, the setting mostly supports mood rather than constraining choices—he never faces a decision that the physical environment meaningfully alters. As a result, it’s strong atmosphere rather than fully integrated, choice-shaping worldbuilding.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.0)
    The drift-ice marina, the creaking ice, and the lighthouse are vividly and repeatedly evoked, with an atmospheric, sensory-rich texture that suits the lyric mode. The environment slightly constrains action (the fragile ice, the enclosed cabin), but mostly it feels like backdrop rather than a force that alters options or tactics. Details tend toward reiteration of similar sensations (creaks, hums, ethereal glow) rather than evolving under pressure. Still, the setting is clear, consistent, and tonally aligned with the story’s sonic and “fleshly ethereal” ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct create a consistent, atmospheric setting with clear visual and tactile anchors. Repeated images (the humming viaduct, the silver moon on ice) give the world some texture and mood. However, the environment rarely constrains or complicates her choices; it mainly decorates her resolve. Strong mood work, but not yet deeply enmeshed with action.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.0)
    The subway maintenance tunnel is atmospherically rendered with damp earth, dripping water, graffiti, and rusty pipes, and these details are consistently filtered through Maya’s attention. The recurring water and lantern imagery create a coherent, rain-soaked mood that supports the liberation theme. However, the environment rarely constrains action or choice; she simply walks, notices, reflects, and departs without spatial or practical obstacles. The underground railroad history of the lantern enriches tone but could affect tactics or decisions more directly to reach a higher level.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.0)
    The antique music box repair shop is vividly and consistently rendered—the ticking mechanisms, dusty trinkets, and “clockwork heart” create a coherent atmosphere that suits the story’s preoccupations. Details are filtered reasonably through the chaplain’s perspective, with the heart and music box functioning as emblematic objects. However, the setting rarely constrains choices or tactics; it primarily serves as mood and metaphor rather than an active pressure. The final image with the music box’s melody does help charge the ending, elevating the score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop over an acid sea is vivid and consistently evoked, with strong atmospheric images (noxious clouds, corroding metal skin). Setting is integrated into mood and theme—beauty in decay, mechanical “breathing”—and the recurring objects (arrow tip, kaleidoscope, bell) help texture the world. Still, the environment rarely constrains choice or forces tactics; the acid sea, for instance, never meaningfully pressures Zephyr’s actions.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.5)
    The server room and “labyrinth of servers and dusty hard drives” give a workable, atmospheric anchor, and the idea of the social network archive as a haunted space is thematically apt. However, the setting remains mostly one-note and visual; we get little tactile or procedural specificity in how she navigates or uses this environment in her investigation. The recurring objects (servers, patch, archive) support mood but rarely constrain concrete choices. The final image doesn’t significantly re-charge the physical setting, which limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is the story’s strongest feature: “lighthouse orchard,” “shifting ice floes,” frozen sea, and vintage mirrors create a distinct, cohesive atmosphere. Details are sensibly filtered through the protagonist’s role as guardian of a fragile balance. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or forces tactics; it mostly decorates and echoes interior states. The final image of the landscape “sighing” nicely charges the world with emotional resonance, even if it’s not tied to a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly evoked—the creaking dock, frozen shore, wind, and groaning ice create a tangible, atmospheric setting. Environmental details mirror the protagonist’s emotional state (stillness with underlying movement; destruction and rebuilding) in a mostly effective, if sometimes on-the-nose, way. However, the setting rarely constrains concrete choices or tactics; it’s more metaphorical backdrop than active pressure. The recurring ice and wind images do help charge the final sense of “windborne solace,” giving the ending some environmental resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is consistently vivid: amber pavilion, autumn vineyard, scents of grapes and damp earth, microclimates and topography all contribute to atmosphere. Details are filtered through her vineyard-guardian lens in a reasonably coherent way. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or action; it’s mostly backdrop for meditation rather than an active pressure. The pavilion and vineyard reappear at the end to charge the final image, but that charge is mostly tonal, not situational.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    The murmuring pavilion, dunes, incense, and “kinetic parapet” create a distinct, atmospheric setting with a consistent, meditative tone. Sensory detail around scent and sound is strong and integrated into mood, though the physical logic of a “kinetic parapet beneath the dunes” remains abstract and unused as a constraint. The environment rarely shapes choices or imposes limits; it mostly reflects interior calm. Still, the recurring pavilion/clearing contrast does give the final sanctuary image some charged specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lavender field against rusted factory ruins is vivid and sensorially grounded—scent, sound, light, and the climbing vines all create a strong atmosphere. The contrast between bloom and decay is visually striking and consistent throughout, and the environment is clearly anchored. However, the setting rarely constrains choice or alters tactics; it functions more as a picturesque backdrop and symbol than an active pressure. The final image of vines climbing does charge the closure somewhat, but more as theme than as enacted constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    The library at dawn is vividly evoked through smell, light, and silence, and the “suspended hush” and crystal create a coherent, tactile atmosphere. Setting details are well-filtered through the scholar’s attention—pages, shelves, grimy windows—rather than feeling like a catalog. The transition to the city (“scent of wet earth and new life”) appropriately shifts tone and underscores the movement from isolation to possibility. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain concrete choices, it does meaningfully charge the final image of the glowing crystal.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.0)
    The fog sculpture garden, statues, gravel, and swirling mist create a coherent, moody environment that suits the story’s introspective tone. Details like the worn statue and tendrils of fog wrapping sculptures are specific enough to avoid white-room syndrome. However, the setting rarely constrains choice or alters tactics; it mostly serves as aesthetic backdrop and metaphor rather than an active pressure. The strongest integration is the statue functioning as a focal point for her projection and path-making, but it still feels more symbolic than operative.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.0)
    The “lunar observatory above the clouds” is an evocative premise, but the setting remains hazy and sometimes self-contradictory (“lunar landscape” plus “nearby trees”). Environment rarely constrains tactics or choices; Eli could be almost anywhere quiet with stars without much change to the plot. Details like thin air, altitude, or lunar physics never meaningfully shape events or perception. Atmosphere is present but under-specific and not fully integrated into the character’s actions.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    The “radiant haven above the clouds” with flowers, candlelight, and gentle choirs creates a coherent, if idealized, atmosphere that matches the lyrical, hospice setting. Sensory detail (scent of flowers, creak of floorboards, warmth of candlelight) supports the musical motif and the tone of serenity. The shard of vinyl as a recurring object adds a modest charge to the final image. However, the environment rarely constrains choices; it’s more backdrop than an active shaper of action.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.5)
    The nocturnal observatory, floating isle, and celestial imagery give a distinct sense of place, and the wind-at-the-edge moment near the end is atmospheric and specific. Details are consistent and filtered somewhat through Lyra’s star-obsessed perspective. However, the environment rarely constrains action or choice; it decorates more than pressures. The clockwork key and setting recur in the final image, but they charge mood rather than materially reweight options.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.5)
    The secret garden and hedge maze are evocative and tonally aligned, offering a tranquil, slightly uncanny pocket that suits Emilia’s internal shift. Description leans on broad strokes (“vibrant flowers and lush greenery,” “soothing sounds of nature”) rather than sharp, selective detail filtered through her particular sensibility. The changeling’s tooth functions as a recurring charged object in the setting, especially in the final glowing image. Yet the environment seldom constrains choice or behavior; it’s more backdrop than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    The serpentine grotto, mist, damp stone, and salt tang are vividly and consistently evoked, giving the story a strong, coherent atmosphere. Sensory detail leans visual and tactile with some smell, and the luminescent mist is nicely tied to the polishing work. However, the environment seldom constrains choice or introduces new pressures; it mainly decorates the meditation. Repetitions of “misty veil,” “soft luminescence,” and similar phrases begin to feel static rather than evolving.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    The abandoned data center turned moss garden is vivid and specific—the overgrown servers, moss underfoot, and icicle pattern create a strong, coherent atmosphere. Sensory detail (quiet, soft earth, honeyed hush) is well integrated into Aria’s perception and supports the healing tone. However, the environment rarely constrains or complicates choices; it operates mostly as a soothing backdrop rather than an active shaper of action. The recurring pendant functions as micro-setting at the end, but again charges theme more than decision.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mist, “feral nexus,” and seashell are atmospheric and consistent, and the shell does function as a recurring object charged with some symbolic weight. However, the setting rarely constrains action or creates practical pressure; it’s a mood backdrop, not an active environment. Spatial and temporal anchors are very vague—“feral nexus” is evocative but undefined, and the scene might as well be an abstract void in functional terms. The final image of leaving the nexus with the shell as talisman has some charge but could land harder if the place had clearer rules or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    The verdant arbor at dawn, the dew, insects, and vine tendril all create a coherent, vivid, and sensory environment that suits the gentle, sacred tone. Setting details are tightly linked to the magical mechanics (the arbor as ritual space, the vine attuning to the songs) and the final redefinition of the place as “sacred space” feels earned. The worldbuilding remains intentionally soft-focus but internally consistent. The environment enhances mood more than it constrains choice, which keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.2)
    The withered orchard in a subarctic crater is vivid, atmospheric, and consistently evoked, with tactile details like damp earth, decaying leaves, and trees as “sentinels” helping to sustain a morbid, charged calm. Setting is nicely integrated into tone—the frozen crater and dead orchard mirror the held-breath stillness and the sense of working in a forgotten, liminal place. However, the environment rarely constrains Aria’s options or tactics beyond mood; she could perform this ritual in many lonely spaces with little narrative change. The final “beacon of safekept starlight in the frozen wilderness” does re-charge the setting image, but mostly as a poetic frame rather than as a true pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    The marble cavern, luminescent crystals, and clockwork device are vividly and consistently evoked, with good sensory layering (scent of damp earth, glow on walls, ticking echoing in the cavern). The environment clearly supports the tone and concept of “harvest of echoes,” giving the piece a tangible atmosphere. However, the setting mostly decorates rather than constrains choices; nothing in the cavern meaningfully alters tactics or imposes danger. As a result, it’s strong mood work but stops short of fully charging the final image through environmental necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bronze grotto, luminescent fungi, damp earth, and post-snowmelt world form a consistent, evocative atmosphere that suits the contemplative mode. The setting recurs at the end, re-framed under morning light and later seasons, which gives the place mythic continuity. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or alters tactics; it mostly supports tone rather than acting as an active pressure. This keeps it strong but below the highest band for setting-driven work.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.9)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft, kettle, and ash wood create a coherent, soothing atmosphere and are sensorially present throughout. Setting is tightly focused and filtered through her need for sanctuary, which suits the intimate scale. However, the environment rarely constrains action or forces adaptation; it mostly provides mood. The recurring kettle and loft don’t quite charge the final image enough to push into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.0)
    The “kinetic lagoon above the clouds” and the halted carousel create a distinctive, atmospheric setting repeated and sustained across the piece. The imagery of fractured stillness, mirrored sky-water, and abandoned trinkets coheres tonally and supports the dreamlike regret. Yet the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; the scavenger mostly “moves through” it without having to navigate concrete obstacles or resources. The setting charges mood more than it structurally shapes action, which limits its ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    The abandoned spaceport terminal is visually and tonally sketched with some specificity (crooked signs, dusty surfaces, rusting pipes, luminescent panels), giving a tangible sense of place. The environment enables her engineering solution—ancient pipes and valves become her tools—so it’s not pure backdrop. However, the setting rarely constrains her choices or creates obstacles; the space mostly receives description rather than pushing back. The sextant and maze add atmosphere but don’t materially reshape the physical stakes of the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.0)
    Setting details—the clock tower, wet stones, forecourt, and garden at sunrise—are vivid and sensorially rich, particularly around rain and light. The environment clearly mirrors Elian’s interior calm and awakening, though it mostly decorates rather than constrains choices. Phrases like “crystal whispering forecourt” and “glacial hush” are memorable, if occasionally edging into ornamental purple. The setting’s mood supports the thematic concerns well, even if it doesn’t strongly shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.0)
    The twilight barge canal is sensorially vivid—smell, light, and water texture are well evoked and consistently filtered through Lyra’s reflective mood. The sundial and canal together form a coherent atmospheric frame that supports the threshold/gateway final image. However, the environment doesn’t substantially constrain tactics or force choices; it remains more lyrical backdrop than active pressure. Strong description, modest functional integration.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Setting is the story’s strongest asset: the dock, harbor, fog, snow, and ocean sounds are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through the protagonist’s sensibility. Sensory details (foghorn, smell of salt and seaweed, glass’s texture) build a cohesive atmosphere that supports the contemplative tone. Yet the environment rarely constrains or enables specific choices; it mostly serves as backdrop and mood rather than active pressure. The fulgurite and dock do charge the imagery, but not quite enough to function as decisive constraints at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting—the shadowed autumn garden, damp earth, decaying leaves, lunar glow—is vivid and consistently filtered through the narrator’s melancholy. Environmental details (the deserted town, the garden, the palace carpet) strongly support tone and theme, and the weft thread charges the final image. However, the garden does not much constrain action or choices; it’s more a backdrop than an active pressure. Description occasionally edges toward cataloguing mood rather than integrating with decision.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The suspended palace on stalactites and the mechanical heartbeat create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that frames nearly every moment. Details like drifting through darkness and crystal spires glinting charge the tone and reinforce the theme of wounded beauty. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, it does inflect the final image (heartbeat slowing, world stirring) in a satisfying way. This is the story’s most distinctive strength, though still more decorative than tactically functional.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.5)
    The obsidian lagoon, volcanic beach, black sand, and gentle rain create a vivid, sensory-rich atmosphere that clearly mirrors the themes of damage and healing. Details are generally well chosen and consistent with Aria’s reflective state. However, the environment rarely constrains action or meaningfully shapes choice; it decorates rather than pressures. The closing return to the lagoon does charge the final image somewhat but still feels more scenic than structural.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.5)
    The “city of forgotten fountains” is a strong, atmospheric anchor, with dust, abandoned courtyards, and dry fountains creating a coherent mood. The reblooming fountains at the end nicely charge the final image and echo the premise of forgotten memories returning. Still, much of the setting is generalized ruin rather than tactically used environment; the labyrinthine underbelly and carvings are more decorative than constraining. More concrete, lived-in interaction with the space would lift this significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.0)
    The “nebula garden” is vividly and repeatedly evoked—stars as flowers, tendrils of gas, drifting dust—with clear tonal cohesion. However, the setting mostly frames contemplation rather than constraining options or forcing different choices. The calculating gear and sonar pinging occasionally refract through the environment, but not in a way that changes tactics. Strong atmosphere, limited functional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.5)
    The greenhouse is vivid and sensorially grounded—mist, tropical plants, lunar glow, and headstones all recur and evolve with the light. The butterfly migration and nocturnal transformation of the space strongly charge the final image and tie directly into the theme of grief and persistence. Setting is firmly filtered through her attention to plants, stones, and ghosts rather than reading like a neutral catalog. It doesn’t much constrain choices, but it deeply shapes the story’s mood and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.0)
    The tidal obsidian ridge, sea, and clock tower are vividly evoked with repeated sensory touches (salt, seaweed, waves, dark rock), creating a coherent, moody atmosphere. However, the environment rarely constrains or redirects her choices; it mainly mirrors her internal state. The pendulum and rake function more as symbols than as tools or obstacles. Strong descriptive texture boosts this category despite limited functional integration with the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is the story’s clear strength: the cemetery, cobalt silo, lavender dust, and tapestry are concrete and atmospherically unified. Details feel selected rather than randomly listed, and the space is consistently anchored. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or meaningfully alters tactics—the gardener could almost perform the same ritual in any secluded structure. The strong mood and recurring objects do charge the final image somewhat, but not to a transformative degree.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    The frozen lake and obsidian spire are vivid and consistently threaded—lake as blank page, spire as constraint, cold air and crunching snow grounding the scene. The kingfisher feather quill adds a tactile, specific object that helps anchor the otherwise abstract meditation. However, the environment mostly functions as metaphor rather than as a constraint on choice; the cartographer’s behavior would be the same in almost any quiet, isolated place. Strong atmosphere, but the world doesn’t evolve or push back as the inner work deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ember alcove, mist, dust motes, and glowing radio dial are richly and consistently rendered, giving a strong, unified atmosphere. Environmental details (dust swirling into storyform, the radio glow as beacon) actively charge the final image and reinforce the story’s concept of stories materializing from residue. The setting is more evocative than functional—rarely constraining choices—but it does meaningfully color perception and closure. The world’s rules around dust-magic are lightly sketched yet feel internally consistent within this lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.5)
    The vanishing point gallery, the charcoal portrait, the porcelain mask, and the powder-coated frame offer a distinct visual atmosphere that suits the somber tone. Setting is often evoked in near-identical phrases, which blunts its impact, but the art objects do shape the emotional field. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices; it mainly serves as a contemplative backdrop. Still, the portrait and mask meaningfully charge the final image, giving the setting more than postcard utility.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    The sewer and sunken city ruins are vividly sketched—the rot, waterlogged steel, and “vast, watery grave” create a coherent, somber atmosphere. The cog functions as a micro-setting object, linking Kael tactilely to the drowned world above. However, the environment mostly supplies mood rather than constraining specific choices or tactics, and some descriptive notes are repeated instead of evolving. Strong atmosphere, but not yet using setting as an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    The velvet library, stained glass, autumn leaves, and the zither are vividly visualized and recur to create a consistent, quiet atmosphere. Setting is well integrated with Emilia’s profession and mood, and the leaves’ “agreement” at the end nicely echo the opening image. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or creates friction; it’s more sanctuary than participant in the drama. The heavy reliance on visual and tactile detail over other senses slightly limits depth but doesn’t harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rusted greenhouse and overgrown botanical garden are vividly evoked, with decay and encroaching vines thematically aligned to rebirth. Environmental details (rusted beams, tangled growth, ethereal celestial light) create a strong, coherent atmosphere. However, the setting rarely constrains choice or behavior; it is more a beautiful backdrop and metaphor than an active pressure. The sprouting seed in the greenhouse at the end does charge the final image, strengthening the category.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.3)
    The lightning collection tower, blackout, and “nectar dusk” establish a gentle, slightly fantastical atmosphere, and the humming machinery plus flowers give some sensory depth. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or behavior; it’s more backdrop than active pressure. The beehive is described functionally rather than viscerally. The closing image of the toll keeper under the stars and machinery hum is apt but could be more concretely charged.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.0)
    The quiet bay, perfumery, and twilight streets are clearly and sometimes lyrically rendered (“streetlights flickered to life, daydreaming with a soft, ethereal glow”). Setting is consistent and supports the contemplative, numinous tone. However, most details function atmospherically rather than as constraints on choice or sources of pressure. The environment enhances mood but rarely feels inextricable from the story’s turning points.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    The underwater city garden, coral, anemones, and dim filtered light produce a consistent and evocative atmosphere. The setting is present from first line to last and the garden’s transformation underpins the story’s emotional frame. Still, most details are broad and decorative; the environment seldom constrains action or forces specific choices beyond supplying a pretty backdrop. The ampoule and garden are charged symbolically, but more through exposition than through tactile interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.0)
    The infinite staircase, dim light, and thick air establish a coherent if somewhat generic oppressive atmosphere. Details like narrow windows and serpent-like stretch help, but the environment does not significantly constrain choice beyond a generalized sense of entrapment. The dice function as a micro-setting object with some charge, particularly in the ending image. Overall, the setting supports mood but could be more specific and more causally involved in the narrator’s tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.0)
    The rooftop greenhouse, smog-choked city, and waxing moon are vivid and recur throughout, establishing a coherent, gently oppressive yet sheltered atmosphere. Details like the glass panes, tendrils of plants, and encroaching smog are sensorially concrete and clearly filtered through her nocturnal, contemplative gaze. Yet the environment rarely constrains action or alters options; it’s mostly mood rather than a functional pressure on choice. The moon and greenhouse do charge the final sanctuary image, which lifts the score.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    The grotto city, luminescent fungi, monumental waterfall, and frozen chamber are vividly evoked and consistent, with good sensory layering (mist, damp earth, glow). The environment meaningfully frames the experience—the sealed ice chamber and waterfall bookend the piece and support the refuge/remembering theme. At times it leans toward “museum tour” cataloguing rather than fully lived-in interaction, but spatially it’s clear. The opera glass as recurring object charges the final image, though more as symbol than as constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    The lighthouse, rocky island, wind, and low tide are concrete and repeatedly evoked, creating an atmospheric, slightly gothic frame. Sensory detail (salt, seaweed, musty bowels, flickering candlelight) is reasonably vivid and coherent. However, the environment rarely constrains his tactics or creates obstacles; it functions mostly as mood backdrop. The hunger stone and yoyo are described more as symbolic artifacts than as physically problem-rich tools.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    The abandoned funhouse is grounded with solid, if familiar, sensory details (fog, decrepit façade, musty darkness, reek of decay) and a clear internal geography (poster → corridors → mirror). The environment does shape the story’s path and supplies key objects (poster, dream dictionary, mirror) that feed the horror. However, much of the description leans on genre-default language and doesn’t fully exploit tactile interaction or specific oddities of a carnival funhouse. The setting charges the final image conceptually but could constrain choices more concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.5)
    The orchard on driftwood in the open sea, the blue hour, scents, and sounds are vividly and consistently evoked, with strong sensory layering. The environment feels singular and memorable, and it recurs meaningfully in the final “jewel” image. However, the setting rarely constrains choice or creates pressure; it mostly functions as a beautiful backdrop. That keeps it from reaching the highest band where setting actively shapes stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and distinctive: a city built on gargantuan turtles, worn shells etched with languages, an “oldest quarter” with complex patterns, and the sun beating down to create a washed-out, oppressive atmosphere. Details are filtered through Lyra’s professional eye, which helps specificity (“spiral-shell cartographer,” pattern languages on shells). The watchers on the horizon and the sunwashed streets effectively build a consistent mood. However, the environment rarely constrains concrete choices; the turtle-city could almost be swapped for a static city without altering the plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    The disused station overgrown with ivy is vividly evoked and anchored early, with atmospheric details (ivy as “skeletal fingers,” damp earth, grime and dust motes) that suit the tone. Setting is consistently threaded through the piece and lightly mirrors the thematic arc (ivy pressing in, then “relaxing” once truth is found). However, the environment rarely constrains action or choices; it mainly decorates and symbolically echoes rather than shapes behavior. Strong atmosphere, limited functional integration.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The submerged pavilion, murky water, drawbridge, and shifting light (sunset to stars) create a clear, consistent atmosphere. Environmental details like silt, aquatic life, and stonework are specific enough to be vivid without over-explaining logistics. The setting charges the mood and final image (drawbridge shadow, water, darkness swallowing the surveyor) more than it constrains choices, but it does give the piece a distinct texture. It’s strong, though slightly repetitive and more decorative than operative.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.0)
    The sunken library is atmospherically evoked: “dusty tomes,” “waterlogged repository,” “faint scent of aged paper,” and the “reclaimed stillness” all create a coherent, moody environment. The setting, however, rarely constrains action; the fact that the city is sunken and the library waterlogged has no practical impact on what Elara can or must do. The most functional element is the micro-setting of the ink stamp as tool-object, but even that is more symbolic than constraining. Strong mood, modest integration with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.5)
    The floating island tea garden, drifting basilica, lanterns, and clouds are vividly rendered and consistent, generating a strong, coherent atmosphere. Details like the filigree of lanterns “suspending the very fabric of reality” and crystalline spires of the basilica carry the emotional tone of fragile transcendence. Setting is more backdrop than constraint—environment rarely forces choices—but it does charge the final images of lanterns whispering to the darkness and the basilica beckoning. The specificity and unity of the worldbuilding are publication-caliber even if not yet fully exploited for pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.5)
    The opening wedding wreckage is the most vivid, concrete setting work, with smoke, blood, and rubble giving some texture. The Floating Observatory, despite being conceptually rich, remains a generic research platform with engines and consoles and little tactile specificity or spatial logic that affects choices. The geode functions partly as a micro-setting object, but its physicality is underused beyond “cool, smooth surface” and a vague calming effect. Overall atmosphere leans on repeated abstractions rather than evolving, scene-bound details.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.5)
    The observatory, dusk light, and star-filled sky are vividly and consistently evoked; the atmosphere of “brilliant dimness” is one of the story’s strongest assets. Environmental details (carvings as star maps, faint signals in chambers, hum of ancient machinery) feel coherent and lived-in. The setting does lightly shape action—the carvings literally guide her to the chip—but mostly works as mood rather than hard constraint. Still, the final image of her amid ruins and stars is charged by the setting in a satisfying way.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    Setting is the strongest dimension: the cobalt terrace, forgotten shore, and driftwood carvings are vivid and sensorial (“scent of salt and decay,” skeletal driftwood fingers). These details are thematically loaded, mirroring suppressed histories and the “sieved hush.” However, the environment mostly supplies atmosphere rather than constraining or enabling specific actions. The watch hand and terrace do charge the final image, but they still feel more aesthetic than decisively functional.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.0)
    The parapet, mist, wind, and moon are vividly and repeatedly evoked, giving the story a strong, consistent atmosphere. The recurring image of the storm-worn parapet as neutral, liminal ground between sides and between past/future is clear and thematically apt. However, the environment rarely constrains action or tactics; it is more backdrop and mood than an active force. The antique drawer pull functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image, but again more symbolically than as a real constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.8)
    The coastal kayak launch and sea are sketched clearly enough to orient the reader, and the setting broadly matches the contemplative tone. However, most details (“sea,” “shoreline,” “sun began to set”) are generic, with little sensory specificity or lived-in texture. The most distinctive environmental element—the utility poles—functions more as a thematic motif than as a truly embodied part of the physical world.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    The underground bioluminescent lake is vividly realized, with mist, glow, and rocky walls creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. Details like the creaking dock, pulsing water, and echoing drips give a tactile sense of place and tone consistent with the premise. However, the environment rarely constrains action or forces choices; it mostly decorates Lena’s introspection. The setting contributes mood and symbolism more than concrete narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.5)
    The fairy-tale orchard under permanent moonlight, lantern-like fruits, and nocturnal beasts create a coherent, gently luminous atmosphere. These details are vivid but largely decorative; the environment doesn’t constrain options or force specific tactics beyond providing a generic magical backdrop for the ritual. The spices and beasts participate more directly than the orchard itself, which stays postcard-like. The final moonlit image supports tone but doesn’t significantly reconfigure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.5)
    The midnight glade above the clouds and the sensory details (“damp earth and ozone,” “choking beauty”) create a vivid, consistent atmosphere. Objects—the mist, the card, the cracked saucer—are integrated into setting and return in the final image with some charged resonance. However, the environment rarely constrains behavior or decision; it is stage and mood more than active pressure. The specificity is strong enough for solid publication-level work but not yet fully exploited as a tactical space.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.0)
    The recycled spaceship and storage bay are clearly established and tonally apt, with effective sensory anchors like “aged paper,” “worn metal,” and “faded wires.” The environment supports the ghostly, archival mood and dovetails with the photographs and tears as remnants of humanity. Kwan Yin’s Tear functions as a micro-setting object that charges several images, especially in the final beats. Still, the ship rarely constrains behavior or tactics; it is more an evocative backdrop than an active pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.0)
    The black sand beach, rumbling volcano, and “whispering hush” establish a coherent, moody atmosphere, and these details recur to frame the experience. However, most of the setting remains postcard-like and static; the volcano never constrains action or changes options, and sensory detail skews heavily visual and auditory. The environment reflects theme but rarely affects behavior. As a result, the setting feels evocative but underutilized as a source of pressure or meaning-bearing constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.3)
    The luminous fort, blackout, and cradle of sparks create a coherent, mildly evocative atmosphere, with a nice visual shift from darkness to ethereal light. Yet details remain broad and visual-forward; we rarely feel the space tactically—no corridors, battlements, or physical constraints that shape choices. Objects like the sundial and quill holder are described more as symbols than as lived-in tools. The setting supports tone but does not substantially pressure action.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tidal bluff, aurora, and sea are vividly rendered and recur throughout, shaping a consistent, numinous atmosphere. Setting details are integrated with action (placing rocks on the bluff’s edge under aurora light) rather than dumped. While the environment doesn’t constrain choices much, it does charge the final image of dawn and the vanished herder. The specificity is strong and world rules feel internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stormlit observatory above the clouds is vivid and sensorially clear, with lightning, churning clouds, and wind establishing a strong atmosphere. Weather and environment mirror her interior state effectively, even if the symbolism is a bit on-the-nose. The darkroom timer as a tactile object anchors the space and helps charge the final image. However, the setting rarely constrains her choices; it is scenic and thematic rather than functionally shaping action.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.5)
    The glass atrium, brook, sundial, and light are vividly evoked and contribute to a serene/ceremonial atmosphere that contrasts with the duel. Details like the half-painted sundial and the brook’s sound are purposeful and recur, charging the space with contemplative energy. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or alters tactics; it functions more as aesthetic backdrop than active pressure. The setting’s strongest work is tonal, not structural.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rusted library, moonlight, and cityscape are vivid and recur meaningfully, with the library clearly mirroring the city’s decay and potential for renewal. The environment is integrated into action (steps, hinges, dusty shelves) and tone, and the recurring moonlight/dawn progression charges the final image. However, the setting rarely constrains concrete choices or tactics; it’s more backdrop and symbol than a source of real logistical pressure. Still, for this length, the atmosphere is specific, coherent, and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Imagery is lush and specific: the “tidal arbor above the clouds,” mist, wet stone and ozone, and the grey stillness of the film world create a strong atmosphere. Recurring objects (clock, compasses, reel) are well integrated into the setting and help charge the final return. However, the environment seldom constrains concrete choices—it mostly colors mood rather than altering options. The world’s surreal rules are stable, if more evocative than instrumental.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    The ridge, blooming landscape, and incoming monsoon are sensorially vivid and consistently evoked, giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine. The environment mirrors the thematic concern with renewal and memory, especially in the blooming flowers and purifying rains. However, the setting rarely constrains action or alters tactics; Aria’s choices would be largely the same in any “mystical hilltop before a storm.” Repetition of similar descriptors (“warm sunlight,” “gentle hum of insects,” “vibrant”) also dilutes specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    The breezy islet, post-rain air, and later bonsai garden are consistently evoked with sensory detail (scent of wet earth, salt, trees), creating a stable, tranquil atmosphere. The setting supports the thematic emphasis on healing through nature and gives the final image of the compass in the sea some weight. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or behavior; it’s more a mood-scape than an active pressure. The recurrence of sea, breeze, and garden builds texture but stops short of fully charging the final image with inescapable environmental cost.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting is established ("scent of damp earth," "debris-strewn floor") but relies on generic descriptors that do not constrain the character's choices. The environment serves as a passive backdrop for contemplation rather than an active force exerting pressure on the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting is established with generic descriptors ("inky shadows," "crisp," "ethereal light") that could apply to any canyon scene. While the frost is functional for the plot resolution, the environment does not constrain the character or force trade-offs. The specific "luminous glass" aspect of the character is not utilized to filter sensory details or shape interaction with the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is established but relies on generic descriptors ("lush greenery," "frosted panes") and cliché ("delicate flower in ice"). While the atmosphere is coherent, the environment functions as a static backdrop rather than exerting pressure on the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=2.8)
    Physical logic collapses; the protagonist smells "musty" books and touches "dusty" tomes in a "submerged" library where sound echoes "through the water." The environment is generic ("eerie stillness," "darkened corridors") and lacks specific, grounding sensory details that constrain the character's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=3.1)
    Sensory details are generic and repetitive (overuse of "soft," "warm," and "gentle"), creating a flat atmosphere that does not constrain the characters. The setting acts as a static stage rather than a pressure cooker or resource affecting tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=3.0)

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=3.1)
    Setting details are generic ("sweet scent," "dappled shadows") and fail to constrain the protagonist's choices or ground the abstract concepts in a tangible reality. The "living bridge" aspect is named but never utilized mechanically to affect the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=3.2)
    Descriptions rely on generic adjective-noun pairings ("desolate landscape," "creaky door," "oppressive silence") that fail to evoke a specific, lived-in atmosphere. The setting serves as a passive backdrop rather than a constraint that pressures the character's choices. There is no sensory hierarchy; details feel listed rather than observed through a distinct POV.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting elements ("sunken orchard," "shipwrecks," "ashen forge") feel like a list of disconnected nouns rather than a cohesive environment interacting with the character. While the visual descriptions are colorful, they do not constrain the character's movement or choices, functioning merely as a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=3.6)
    The setting is described with high-level abstractions ("emerald station," "ethereal light") rather than concrete, grounding sensory details. While the lighting is emphasized, it feels like a filter applied to a generic backdrop rather than a specific place that constrains the character's movement or choices. The environment provides no resistance or distinct texture.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the setting is established, details drift into melodramatic abstractions ("morbid perfume," "damp shroud") rather than grounding the scene in sensory immediacy. The logistical incongruity of operating a glass furnace within an abandoned control room lacks necessary explanation or interaction with the environment's constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting consists of generic descriptors ("dim light," "dusty shelves," "twinkled above") that do not constrain the character's choices. The "rusted library" serves as a static backdrop rather than an interactive environment that pressures the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=3.8)
    Atmosphere relies heavily on purple clichés ("creaked and groaned," "dying ember," "swirl like living things") rather than specific, grounded sensory detail. The "ridge fort" serves as a generic container with no spatial constraints or material impact on the scene's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=4.1)
    The visual descriptions ("pale blue glow," "icy stones") are functional but remain decorative, failing to constrain the character's choices or create physical resistance. The setting serves as a static backdrop for contemplation rather than an active pressure cooker for the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting consists of repeated abstract phrases ("crystal whispering forecourt," "wet stone") that fail to ground the scene in sensory reality or constrain the character's actions. The environment feels like a static backdrop rather than a lived-in space; the "city's din" and "whispers" are asserted rather than heard or felt through specific details.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=3.5)
    Setting details remain generic ("towered hedges," "blooming flowers") and fail to ground the unique premise of "measurable luck" in concrete physical reality. The environment provides atmosphere but does not constrain action or force trade-offs, serving only as a backdrop for abstract reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting consists of generic sci-fi tropes ("sterile workstations," "warm orange glow") and lacks specific sensory details that would constrain the protagonist's choices. The "alien landscape" is vaguely described as "desolate" and "fiery," missing the opportunity to make the specific location matter to the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=4.0)
    The spatial logic is incoherent; sitting in a "flooded" orchestra pit implies submersion, yet she plays an instrument. Description relies heavily on generic adjectives ("eerie," "haunting," "sublime") rather than sensory particulars that ground the surrealism.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is functional but generic ("swirling mists," "metal grating"), lacking specific, sensory details that constrain the character. The environment is treated as a backdrop for introspection rather than a source of pressure or tactile interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=3.6)
    The setting consists of generic abandoned-industrial tropes ("scent of decay and rust," "twisted and rusted") lacking specific, sensory texture. While the "beaded valve wheel" is a distinct object, the surrounding environment feels like a "dim light" backdrop rather than a pressure cooker affecting the character's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=2.4)
    The setting consists of generic tropes ("overgrown library," "damp earth") lacking specific, sensory details that would constrain the character's actions. The environment is treated as a backdrop for abstract concepts rather than a physical space, with spatial relationships dissolving into vague "depths" and "corridors."

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=3.1)
    The setting is a generic pastoral backdrop ("hush of dreaming roots," "sage-scented breeze") that never constrains the protagonist's choices or tactics. The description is purple and vague ("ordinary magic," "celestial ballet") rather than specific and grounded. The eclipse functions as atmospheric lighting rather than a pressure cooker for the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting concept is promising but rendered through exhausted abstractions ("testament to the past," "scars of time") rather than specific, grounding sensory details. The "bronze quiet" and "dusty tomes" create a generic atmosphere that lacks texture or distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.4)
    The setting contains basic anchors (lighthouse, satchel, box) but relies on "telling" for atmosphere ("mystical atmosphere," "otherworldly energy") instead of sensory grounding. Specificity is undermined by the rote repetition of the "spycraft microdot film specs" label, which acts as a static totem rather than a textured object within the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=2.4)
    The setting is an abstract "white room" defined by generic tropes ("dimensional anchor," "fabric of reality") rather than sensory specificity. Sensory details are cliché ("sandalwood and myrrh") or symbolic abstractions ("deep, rich blue") that lack tactile grounding. The environment does not constrain the character's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is described with vivid but generic purple prose ("shard of ice," "dancing light") that functions only as a static backdrop. The environment does not constrain the character's choices or exert pressure; the "glass spire" and "frozen lake" are purely ornamental. The sensory details are visual-heavy and lack tactile grounding or interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=3.3)
    The setting is a generic "white room" dressed in vague, high-fantasy adjectives ("ethereal," "luminescence," "ancient") that provide no concrete constraints on the action. While the viaduct anchors the opening, the "labyrinth of self" is entirely abstract, failing to provide a tangible environment for the character to navigate.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting is atmospheric but generic ("earthy scent," "ancient magic") and does not constrain the character's choices. The environment feels disconnected from the protagonist's specific sensory limitations, relying on abstract descriptions rather than tactile interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting relies on generic markers ("gentle rustle," "sweet scent," "twinkle") that fail to ground the unique premise of a "storm recorder" in a specific reality. The atmosphere shifts abruptly from "tranquil" to "ominous" and back to serve the plot beats rather than evolving naturally through perception. The physical space does not constrain the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=3.4)
    While the "greenhouse for extinct plants" is a distinct concept, the execution relies on vague placeholders ("rare flora," "hidden patterns," "blooming flowers") rather than specific sensory detail. The setting acts as a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker that constrains choices.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the "terra-cotta grotto" is established, descriptions rely on abstract adjectives ("ethereal," "ancient") rather than concrete, interactive detail. The setting functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of pressure or tools that constrain the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=4.1)
    While some imagery is vivid ("glass panes glinting like shards of ice"), the setting relies heavily on clichés ("withered fingers," "charred earth"). The spatial logic of shipwrecks ringing a greenhouse in a rainforest acts as surreal decor rather than a grounded environment. The "chronic hush" is contradicted by immediate sensory details (footsteps, crackling fire) before it is supposedly lifted.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is atmospheric but static, functioning as a generic backdrop rather than a constraint that pressures choices. Descriptions are excessively repetitive ("luminescent stones" appears five times), rendering the environment ornamental rather than tangible or specific.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=2.9)
    The setting consists of generic atmospheric clichés ("whispers of the sea," "musty scent") that serve as passive window dressing. The environment never constrains the protagonist's movement or choices, failing to ground the narrative in a specific, tangible reality.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting relies on generic, high-fantasy adjectives ("crystalline," "shimmering," "glimmering") without concrete spatial grounding. The "orchard" feels disembodied, and sensory details are cliché ("sweet scent," "soft glow") rather than specific to the POV or the unique environment.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the "rooftop canal" is a distinct concept, the description relies heavily on travel-brochure clichés ("hidden gem," "soothing melody," "serpentine waterway"). The setting serves as a passive backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=3.4)
    The setting consists of generic fantasy tropes ("luminescent fungi," "ethereal light") that provide a backdrop but do not constrain the protagonist's choices. The environment is described in static blocks rather than interacting with the character's tactics or physical needs.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=4.4)
    Setting details rely on generic atmospheric tropes ("scent of old books," "dust," "faint hum") rather than specific, grounded observation. The "pipe chases" function as a label for a hidden space rather than a physical constraint on movement or discovery. The atmosphere is cohesive but leans heavily into unearned sentimentality ("miniature world of wonder").

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=2.5)
    Setting details are generic ("emerald hue," "lush greenery," "turbulent world") and fail to ground the reader in a specific time or place. The "storm season" acts as a vague backdrop rather than a physical reality that constrains choice or affects the nursery operations.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=3.3)
    The setting relies on generic post-apocalyptic clichés ("crumbling buildings," "perpetual gloom") without specific, sensory grounding. The "water wars" concept serves as background wallpaper rather than a pressure affecting current choices.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=2.8)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy abstractions ("mystical mountains," "serene and enchanting") rather than specific, sensory grounding. The environment is described through adjectives that tell the reader how to feel, rather than concrete details that constrain the character's choices or anchor the reality of the cave.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.0)
    Setting details are functional but generic ("weathered stones," "musty scent"), lacking the specific sensory grounding needed to create atmosphere. The "Ivory Harbor" serves as a backdrop for abstract assertions rather than a constrained environment that pressures the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=2.6)
    The setting relies on generic, high-level descriptors ("otherworldly silence," "ethereal glow," "hidden patterns") that fail to ground the reader in a specific physical space. The "starlit vault" feels like a white room filled with fog, lacking sensory hierarchy or tactile interaction beyond the ticket punch. The environment never pressures the protagonist or forces a tactical change.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting consists of generic fantasy tropes ("shimmering" symbols, "wisps of fog") that do not constrain the protagonist's choices or ground the reader in a specific physical reality. The tower and sea are treated as atmospheric backdrops rather than tangible environments with distinct sensory details. Space and time are blurred by the summary style, preventing immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=2.5)
    The setting is a collection of visual abstractions ("swirling colors," "otherworldly energy") that lacks tactile grounding or specific constraints. The "escondite" functions as a white room with a light show, offering no physical resources or obstacles that shape the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=3.5)
    Setting details are generic placeholders (formaldehyde, cold steel, faint flowers) that fail to constrain action or deepen the mood. The environment functions only as a passive backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting confuses scale—a "forest of bonsai trees" implies contradictory physics (miniature trees in a life-sized forest) that is never resolved or grounded. Sensory details are generic ("chirping birds," "blooming flowers") and lack POV-specific filtering. The fluorescent lamp on a mountaintop lacks a power source or logical grounding, appearing only as a prop.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting consists of generic descriptors ("rusty steel canyons," "weathered containers") without sensory specificity or hierarchy. While the environment is functional, it fails to constrain the character’s choices or provide a tangible, tactile resistance; it serves merely as a metaphorical backdrop for the protagonist's thoughts.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting consists of generic signifiers ("rusting telescopes," "crumbling domes") that provide atmosphere but do not constrain the protagonist's tactics. The spatial transition into the "mystical realm" is abstract and disorienting, lacking the concrete grounding required for a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=1.3)
    Setting details are generic placeholders ("vibrant," "exotic foods," "diverse population") that fail to ground the reader in a specific physical reality. The environment never constrains the character's immediate actions or provides sensory texture beyond abstract adjectives.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=2.0)
    A critical failure in internal logic destroys credibility: the text acknowledges the vacuum ("lack thereof") in one paragraph, then describes petals swaying "in the breeze" in the next. The setting is otherwise generic ("silvery glow," "vast, barren") and lacks the specific sensory friction of a lunar environment.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is painted with generic atmospheric markers ("mist-coated," "swirling") rather than concrete, tactile details specific to a rail depot. The spatial geography is confusing; the auditory proximity of a "ship's maiden voyage" to a "rail depot" is asserted but not grounded in the scene's physical geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=3.4)
    The setting is rendered through stock phrases ("time seemed to stand still," "harsh beauty," "crisp air") rather than specific, sensory grounding. The "rusted outpost" remains a generic backdrop that does not constrain the character's choices or provide unique resources. Atmospheric descriptors are repetitive and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=3.5)
    Setting relies on stock placeholders ("ancient archway," "cobblestones," "ghost town") rather than specific, lived-in sensory details. The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a constraint that pressures the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.0)
    The underwater setting lacks physical logic; references to the "scent of salt" imply air, yet the environment is not clarified as a dry pocket, disorienting the reader. Descriptions rely on generic fantasy tropes ("crumbling stone," "blue light") rather than specific, tactile details that constrain Kael's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the "lattice" and "copperlight" offer isolated visual specificity, the setting largely relies on generic tropes (rusting hinges, salt air, decay). The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure on the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is established with clear but generic fantasy descriptors ("ethereal light," "luminescent orbs") that do not constrain the characters' choices. While the "alchemical orchard" is a functional backdrop, the environment does not exert pressure or shape the tactics used by the alchemist.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=2.7)
    The setting is a confused amalgam of conflicting elements—a "wharf weaver" working in a "red canyon" with "tide pools"—that are never reconciled or explained, creating spatial disorientation. Descriptions remain abstract and atmospheric ("damp earth," "ancient stories") rather than concrete or constraining. The environment does not pressure the character or shape her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.8)
    The concept of a "catacomb orchard" where roots intertwine with bones is evocative, but the execution relies on visual clichés ("dappled shadows," "ancient bones") and abstract spaces ("passageways... seemed to stretch on forever"). The setting functions as a passive backdrop rather than an active constraint or pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=3.0)
    The setting consists of generic signifiers ("soft glow," "neon lights," "warm ambiance") that provide no specific constraints or frictional texture. While the location is clear, the description remains ornamental and does not pressure the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=3.1)
    Descriptors are generic ("stars shone bright," "intricate patterns," "crisp" air) and fail to establish a specific, lived-in reality. The setting serves as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint or resources for the character.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting consists of generic atmospheric tropes ("luminescent fungi," "twisted roots," "damp earth") that lack specific, lived-in texture. While the image of the windowpane suspended in the mangroves is a functional anchor, the description often resorts to list-like sensory inputs that feel obligatory rather than immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is vague and dream-like ("mist-clad atrium") without grounding the medical context—why is a translator being anesthetized next to a table? Sensory details are generic ("soft, gentle light," "fading light") and repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting relies on atmospheric clichés ("gnarled branches," "shrouded," "veil between reality and dreams") rather than specific, tactile interaction that constrains choice. While the "ruined orchard" is consistent, the "knowledge network" is an abstract concept that fails to ground itself in the physical scene. The painting process is described in vague, magical terms ("coax color," "shimmering curtain") rather than concrete tool work.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=3.9)
    While the "sound wave garden" concept is established, the description relies on generic markers ("blooming flowers," "chirping birds") rather than specific, sensory details. The setting functions as a backdrop for the magic rather than a source of constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting is established via generic descriptors ("scent of blooming flowers," "gentle hum") that lack specific texture or interaction. The spatial relationship between the greenhouse and the "community gardens" is muddled—she plants in the greenhouse, but then the community gardens are mentioned as the locus of the patterns. The environment does not constrain Lyra's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the "gargantuan shell" and "bioluminescent fungi" provide a visual anchor, the setting remains a static backdrop that never constrains the character's choices. Sensory details drift into cliché ("dim glow," "vibrant colors") rather than offering specific, tactile interactions that ground the surreal premise.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the location is identified, the description relies on abstract, ornamental adjectives ("delicate," "intricate," "ethereal") rather than concrete, grounding details. The setting feels like a sterile list of fantasy attributes rather than a space that constrains the character.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=3.6)
    The setting relies on high-fantasy commonplaces ("luminescent orbs," "aged parchment") that do not constrain the protagonist's actions or choices. The environment functions as a static backdrop rather than an active force shaping the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=3.2)
    While the location is established, the description relies on generic abstractions ("gentle rhythm," "soft, eerie music") rather than tactile interaction. The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraints or resources that shape the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is functional but relies on generic sensory details ("musty scent," "aged paper," "dusty skylights"). While the "swirl of dust motes" is a central image, the environment operates as a backdrop for reflection rather than a source of constraint or pressure that shapes the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=3.8)
    The "drifting prism terrace" remains an abstract backdrop of "otherworldly glow" and "shattered light" rather than a tactile environment that constrains movement or choice. The inclusion of a wooden bench for grain analysis feels disjointed from the established ethereal aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=2.8)
    The "underwater" aspect is nominal; the setting functions as a generic corridor with bioluminescence, lacking specific sensory constraints related to the location. The full phrase "forgotten underwater city research facility" is repeated four times as padding rather than establishing atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=2.5)
    The setting relies on vague abstractions ("otherworldly energy," "iridescent," "crystalline") rather than concrete, tactile grounding. The "giant geode" functions as a passive, generic fantasy backdrop that exerts no pressure on the character's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting relies on generic descriptors ("flickering torches," "worn stone benches") and clichéd imagery ("stars... twinkled like diamonds"). The environment provides atmosphere but exerts no pressure on the character's choices or tactics. It reads like a painted backdrop rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=2.8)
    The setting relies on high-level clichés ("twilight garden," "canvas of stars," "obsidian grace") rather than sensory particulars that constrain the character. The environment feels decorative and static, failing to exert pressure on the protagonist's choices or tactics.

The environment feels like a painted backdrop rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.1)
    The setting relies on generic "postcard" descriptions ("soothing melody," "ethereal light") that do not constrain the character or shape the action. Sensory details are cliché ("gently lapping waves") and lack specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=2.4)
    The setting is composed of gothic clichés ("ivy-veiled passage," "crumbling plaster") lacking sensory specificity or spatial logic. The environment never constrains the character or forces a choice; it merely serves as a passive backdrop for the cartographer's internal monologue. The "climate shifts" are mentioned but do not impact the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting consists of generic high-fantasy signifiers ("ancient mansion," "echoing terrace") that fail to constrain the character's movement or choices. While visual descriptions are present, they remain abstract ("kaleidoscope of colors") rather than tactile or specific to the character’s immediate physical needs.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=2.8)
    The setting consists of generic placeholders ("ancient terrace," "worn stone") that fail to constrain the character's choices. Sensory details are sparse and cliché ("beat down," "sweet scent of blooming flowers"), serving as static backdrop rather than an active pressure on the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=3.4)
    The setting relies on generic descriptors ("vast," "cracked," "dry," "desolate") rather than specific, sensory grounding. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the protagonist's symbolic actions rather than a source of constraint or tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=3.0)
    The setting is a generic "silver courtyard" lacking distinct sensory details or tactile grounding; it functions more as a video game backdrop than a lived-in space. The phrase "bodily poetic form" is repeated as a descriptor but conveys no clear visual or physical information, adding to the vagueness.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.2)
    The radar dome is established, but descriptions lean on clichés ("ghostly sentinel", "ethereal light") rather than sensory specificity. The setting functions only to comfort the protagonist, providing no friction, constraint, or distinct atmosphere beyond generic silence.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=3.0)
    The setting consists of generic placeholders ("verdant grotto," "moss-covered stone," "soft, ethereal light") that could belong to any fantasy story. There is no specific geography or sensory constraint that forces a choice; the environment is purely ornamental. The lack of concrete details turns the "grotto above the clouds" into a white room with adjectives rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is described with generic atmospheric terms ("swirling curtains," "soft glow") that do not constrain the character or shape her tactics. The environment acts as a passive backdrop or a helpful booster (aurora "pulsing in harmony") rather than a source of friction or grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=2.8)
    The setting relies on generic speculative tropes ("luminescent fungi," "stone table," "vine-draped bunker") that fail to constrain action or provide sensory texture. Descriptions are functional and list-like, lacking the specific detailing that creates atmosphere or influences character tactics. The environment feels like a painted backdrop rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=3.1)
    The setting consists of generic fantasy tropes (&quot;crumbling frescoes,&quot; &quot;dusty relics,&quot; &quot;labyrinthine corridors&quot;) without specific, sensory grounding. The prompt's request for a &quot;reimagined&quot; palace is met with vague descriptions that do not constrain the character's actions or provide unique resources. The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than an active force shaping the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=2.8)
    The setting is a "white room" filled with abstract nouns ("sanctuary," "oblivion," "golden light") rather than concrete sensory details. The concept of a "soundless sanctuary" is introduced but immediately negated by the music without exploring the tension or logic of the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=3.9)
    While atmospheric, the setting is composed of generic descriptors ("desolate," "ethereal," "otherworldly") that fail to ground the reader in a specific place. The "ruined orchard" functions only as a backdrop and fails to provide the necessary tools (heat source, workshop) for the central action of glassmaking. The environment does not constrain the character's choices or offer resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.2)
    The central concept of an orchard within cathedral rafters is imaginative but executed with generic sensory fillers ("soft chirping," "rustle of leaves") rather than tactile specificity. The mechanics of the space are ignored, resulting in a postcard-like backdrop that doesn't constrain action or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=2.4)
    The setting relies on generic descriptors ("shimmering like stardust," "vibrant, swirling patterns") rather than concrete, sensory details that constrain the character. The juxtaposition of the orchard and the bathroom is surreal but lacks tactile grounding or logical consistency within the world. Spatial choreography is vague.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=3.6)
    Descriptions rely on generic adjectives ("impossible geometries," "musty depths") instead of specific, grounding sensory details that would make the space feel real. The setting acts as a passive backdrop rather than a constraint that forces specific tactical choices or physical interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the "abandoned carnival ship" offers promise, the description remains generic ("rusting corridors," "scent of decay") and fails to utilize the specific uncanniness of the setting to pressure the character.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting consists of generic descriptors ("soft luminescence," "rocky crevices," "ancient grotto") that function as a passive backdrop rather than a pressure cooker. The environment does not constrain choice or interact causally with the character's goals.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the concept of the "xenial trellis" and inverted gravity is imaginative, the execution remains abstract and visual rather than visceral. The physical disorientation of gravity reversal is ignored in favor of generic "soft, golden light" and "floating objects," missing the opportunity to use the setting to pressure the protagonist's phobia.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the concept of the "drifting prism terrace" is evocative, the description relies heavily on abstract clichés ("marvel of engineering," "kaleidoscope of pastel colors," "soothing balm") rather than specific, grounding sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the location is established, the description relies heavily on generic abstractions ("otherworldly energy," "mystical experimentation," "ethereal light") rather than concrete sensory details that constrain the character. The setting functions as a passive backdrop that cooperates with the protagonist rather than a source of friction or texture.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting is rendered through generic abstractions (&quot;labyrinth of forgotten stories,&quot; &quot;musty smell&quot;) rather than concrete, sensory particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=2.4)
    The setting is vague, relying on generic modifiers ("misty," "ethereal," "soft") rather than concrete, grounding details. The phrase "ashen skyborne arbor" is repeated three times without gaining specificity, creating a "white room" effect where the physics and constraints of the world are unclear.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is established but generic ("damp earth," "ethereal light," "creaking door"), lacking specific sensory details that constrain the character's choices. The "subterranean" aspect is largely cosmetic and does not pressure the protagonist’s navigation or survival. Phrases like "testament to the passage of time" abstract the atmosphere rather than grounding it in concrete particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=3.8)
    The "rain-washed foundry" provides a consistent atmospheric backdrop, but details remain generic ("wet earth," "molten metal") and repetitive. The setting functions as a passive stage for reflection rather than an active force that constrains the protagonist's choices.

    The setting consists of generic fantasy tropes ("sandalwood and myrrh," "ancient woman") that serve as a passive backdrop rather than a source of friction or constraint. The "between-worlds" location is asserted but lacks specific physical or social rules that impact the character's navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is established but filled with atmospheric clichés ("faded posters," "skeletal fingers") rather than specific, lived-in details. The placement of a horologist's mainspring barrel in a circus ticket office feels contrived and lacks verisimilitude within the story's own logic.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is established with consistent but generic "ethereal" imagery ("swirling sea of clouds," "crystalline structures"). While the "glass orchard" is a compelling concept, the environment does not constrain the operator's choices; it functions as a passive backdrop for the action.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting concepts ("baroque asteroid," "time became visible") are imaginative but remain static backdrops rather than constraints that force choices. The "visible time" element is introduced as a major world rule but functions only as atmospheric lighting ("luminescence," "shimmering aura") without affecting the mechanics of the scene. The storm is mentioned but easily ignored via a quaint ritual, failing to pressure the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting relies on high-fantasy abstractions ("ethereal light," "whispers," "labyrinthine passages") rather than concrete, grounding details that constrain the character.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=2.7)
    Setting descriptions rely on generic, abstract adjectives ("vibrant," "beautiful," "hidden") rather than concrete, grounding particulars. The environment functions as a static backdrop rather than a constraint that shapes the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the zeppelin and lagoon are imaginative concepts, the description relies heavily on generic adjectives ("breathtaking vista," "strange and wondrous," "dim light") rather than specific, grounding sensory details. The physics of "floating" through the library versus walking are slightly muddled, and the setting serves as a backdrop rather than a source of constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=3.2)
    Setting details are generic ("scent of decay," "crumbling structures") and fail to constrain the character's actions. The "paper-lantern cove" provides a title but acts only as a passive backdrop, never shaping the alchemist's tactics or the nature of the magic. Spatial geometry is vague, consisting mostly of the alchemist sitting and looking.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=2.8)
    Setting details are generic and repetitive ("living stone pillars," "temple orchard") without sensory specificity or atmospheric weight. The "architectural secrets" are mentioned but never visualized, leaving the environment abstract and functionless.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=3.4)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy modifiers ("ancient," "ethereal," "vibrant," "mysterious") that fail to create a specific, lived-in reality. A jarring repetition of "surroundings" in the second paragraph breaks immersion. The environment offers no resistance or interaction; it is purely a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=1.9)
    The spatial geography is incoherent; a coach drives on a "jetty" (usually a pier) where a "reef" (underwater) is dying, yet horses graze on vegetation there. Sensory details are generic and repetitious ("blooming flowers" appears three times), failing to ground the reader in a plausible reality.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting consists of generic post-apocalyptic tropes ("twisted metal," "rusting hulks") without specific, grounding sensory details that constrain choice. Descriptions often rely on abstract labels ("tiny miracle," "desert of steel") rather than concrete, textured observation.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=2.9)
    The setting is rendered through high-level abstractions ("vast, empty space") and clichés ("twinkling like diamonds") that fail to ground the reader. The specific constraint of a "time dilation" deck is mentioned as a label but never affects the physics, pacing, or sensory experience of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=2.8)
    The setting is established through generic descriptors ("eerie silence," "old wooden floorboards") rather than specific, sensory engagement. The physical reality of the space is vague—the "nomadic penumbra" is treated as a place but reads like a mixed metaphor, and the chessboard's symbolism is explained rather than embodied in the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=3.6)
    Setting details rely on generic tropes ("ancient tomes", "dancing shadows") and non-sensory abstractions ("tang of mysticism") that fail to ground the scene. The physical space of the "labyrinthine bookstore" is described but never navigated or used to constrain the character's movement.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=2.8)
    Descriptions rely on abstract, atmospheric clichés ("air was heavy," "expectant hush," "otherworldly energy") instead of grounding, concrete detail. The "time-frozen" aspect is mentioned but never utilized as a constraint or mechanic that pressures the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on high-fantasy visual tropes ("bone towers," "pale spire") that remain distant and non-tactile. Key elements like the "symbols" on the spire are mentioned but not described, leaving the reader with generic concepts instead of specific imagery that could constrain choice.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=4.1)
    Setting details are generic ("gears-and-cogs," "rickety workshop") and fail to ground the scene due to the confused spatial layout (underwater vs. above water). The "acid sea" serves as a backdrop but does not specifically pressure the mechanics of the alchemical task beyond a general threat.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=2.3)
    The setting is rendered with generic, non-specific descriptors ("hues of pink and orange," "ancient rocks," "rough sand"). The sensory details are standard clichés that do not constrain the character's choices or reflect a specific psychological filter. The "hidden oasis" lacks concrete, grounding particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting anchors are clear (lighthouse, garden, dawn), but the description relies on clichés ("intoxicating aroma," "golden glow") rather than specific, grounding details. The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than constraining choices or pressuring the protagonist. The "cobalt lighthouse" is repeated as a static image rather than an evolving symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the "patina bronze censer foot" and "hydraulics" offer moments of specificity, the setting remains largely generic ("sprawling landscape," "canvas of shadows," "treacherous terrain"). The environment is described in distant, visual terms rather than through tactile interaction or sensory constraint that forces choices.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting relies on generic adjectives ("battered," "storm-torn," "ravaged") rather than specific sensory details that constrain the character's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting relies on repetitive adjective-noun pairings ("opal dock," "swirling mist") and repeated telling of the atmosphere ("witnessed isolation") rather than concrete interaction. While the location is established, it functions as a painted backdrop rather than a constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=3.5)
    Settings are sketched with generic descriptors ("blooming cavern," "fading light") that lack sensory specificity or grounding. The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a pressure cooker, with no distinct atmosphere beyond a generalized "fairytale" tone.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=3.5)
    Setting details are cliché ("sea of clouds," "shimmering silk") or awkwardly repetitive ("lacy glow," "lacy menace"). The atmosphere is generated by abstract assertions of "otherworldly essence" rather than concrete sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting provides atmospheric wash ("warm orange light," "scent of smoldering coals") but lacks the specificity required to ground the scene. The "ember nexus" serves as a generic light source rather than a distinct environmental constraint or tool. The constant references to golden/orange light create a monochromatic visual palette that feels ornamental rather than integral to the action.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=3.0)
    The setting consists of generic placeholders ("silence of the woods," "mountain ranger cabin") lacking tactile specificity or sensory friction. The environment fails to constrain the character's choices or mirror the internal state; the "landscape of dreams" remains vague and abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=3.4)
    While the "water clock repair shop" is a distinct concept, the execution relies on generic, soothing descriptors ("gentle lapping," "soft ticking") that lack sensory specificity. The presence of "misty morning fog" *inside* the shop creates spatial confusion and feels like an atmospheric cliché rather than a grounded setting detail.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=5.1)

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=3.5)
    While the prompt specifies "hydraulic clocks" (fluid-driven), the text relies on contradictory mechanical tropes like "gears," "springs," "ticking," and "winding keys." Sensory details are generic ("warm orange glow," "soft ticking") and fail to ground the "horizon measurement station" in a specific, tangible reality.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is visually established with some sensory details ("damp soil," "blue-green light"), though the descriptions lean towards generic adjectives ("ethereal," "vibrant"). While the environment provides a backdrop, it does not constrain the protagonist's choices or exert pressure on the narrative action. The setting functions more as a mood board than a physical space with consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting descriptions ("rainwashed," "stone façade," "dim light") are functional but generic, leaning on standard library tropes without specific sensory friction. The "mica pane" is a nice detail but functions more as a prop for staring than a tool that constrains the character's physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=2.5)
    While the "subway utility tunnel" is established, the setting details are generic and confusing (e.g., streetlamps audible from deep underground implies an impossible geography).

Spatial geography is vague, serving only as a backdrop for internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is established with functional descriptors ("ivy tendrils," "makeshift hub"), but lacks sensory specificity or interaction that constraints the character's choices. The atmosphere is told to the reader ("air was thick with tension") rather than evoked through concrete details.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=3.6)
    The setting relies on generic signifiers ("ethereal light," "blooming flowers") rather than specific, tactile details that pressure the character or utilize the "ultrasonic" premise mechanically. Sensory details are listed in exposition ("skin absorbed," "ears... picked up") rather than integrated into urgent action or constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=3.0)
    The setting is established through generic placeholders ("peculiar objects," "exotic nib") rather than specific sensory details that constrain the character. The "gravitational anomaly" serves as an abstract backdrop for atmospheric effects ("air seemed to thicken") but fails to impose physical or tactical limitations on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=2.9)
    The setting relies on generic descriptors ("luminous," "moonlight," "soothing melody") rather than specific, grounded sensory details. The environment feels like a backdrop for a fable rather than a lived-in place that constrains the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=2.3)
    The setting is a collection of generic tropes ("dusty shelves," "labyrinthine corridors") lacking sensory specificity. The presence of "flickering fluorescent lights" in a long-lost desert archive breaks world coherence. Description relies on adjectives ("eerie," "mysterious") rather than concrete details that constrain action.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=3.2)
    Setting details are vague and adjective-heavy ("ethereal," "auric," "profound") rather than concrete or tactile. The environment functions as a passive mood board that cooperates instantly with the protagonist, failing to constrain choice or ground the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting of shipping containers is visually present but functions as a generic backdrop rather than a source of pressure; the protagonist knows "every twist and turn," removing potential navigational conflict. Sensory details rely on clichés ("smell of salt and rust," "glint of metal"), and the geomagnetic storm is mentioned but does not meaningfully constrain the character's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.2)
    While the "cobalt dock" provides a visual anchor, the setting is undermined by spatial confusion (the unexplained window/shutters). The atmosphere relies on the repetitive assertion of "stillwater tension" rather than concrete sensory details that impose constraints on the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.6)
    Settings are established through generic adjectives ("ancient," "otherworldly," "mystical") rather than concrete, sensory details that ground the reader. The "cobalt library" and "magnetic grotto" function as interchangeable backdrops that provide "energy" or "atmosphere" without constraining the character's choices or offering specific physical resistance. The environment feels ethereal and disconnected from a lived reality.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=3.0)
    Setting details are generic ("weathered boats," "ethereal light") and lack sensory specificity. The specific term "sublittoral fringe" is repeated as a label rather than established as a tangible, lived-in environment.

    The setting is established through generic clichés ("rustic charm," "loomed like sentinels," "bygone era") rather than specific, sensory details that constrain the character. The environment functions as a static, painted backdrop that sets a mood but never pressures the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the description is dense with sensory adjectives ("cobalt," "quartz," "frost-encrusted"), the setting behaves like a passive, white-room stage for the character's projection rather than a source of constraint. The environment offers no resistance; it "beckons" and "pulses" to facilitate the plot rather than forcing the character to adapt.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=3.1)
    The setting consists of generic placeholders ("soft clinking," "delicate forms," "gentle breeze") that lack specific, sensory texture. The "phoenix" backdrop is mentioned but does not impact the physics or atmosphere of the courtyard. The descriptions are abstract rather than grounded in the protagonist's specific, supposedly unique perception.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting contains potential ("laboratory of lost sounds," "luminescent orbs") but remains vague and decorative. The environment does not constrain the character's choices or generate friction; it merely provides a backdrop for the "golden" atmosphere. The sensory details ("whirring softly," "warm breeze") are generic and lack the specificity required for immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on generic descriptors ("timeless," "finest materials," "intricate patterns") rather than concrete, sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is atmospheric but generic ("blooming library," "sea of clouds," "luminescent orbs"), functioning as a passive backdrop rather than a pressure cooker. While the imagery is consistent, it does not constrain the character’s actions or force tactics to change.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=3.8)
    Atmosphere is established through repetition rather than specific, sensory grounding. The phrase "misty workshop" and "shimmering stillness" are repeated to the point of dilution, and the setting does not constrain the character's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=3.0)

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the "cryogenic library" concept is present, the setting functions as a static backdrop rather than a constraint that pressures choices. Sensory details drift into cliché ("snow... in sync with her heartbeat") and do not shape the tactical execution of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=3.2)
    While the contrast between the ruins and the greenhouse is established, the sensory details remain generic ("scent of blooming flowers," "gentle hum"). The setting description relies on list-like observations rather than POV-specific interaction that constrains choice. The "airship ballast" is a specific prop, but it feels placed rather than lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting relies on vague, abstract descriptors ("undulating hills," "subtle chaos," "otherworldly energy") rather than concrete sensory details that constrain the character.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=3.0)
    The setting contains a significant logical disconnect: the "scent of linseed oil and turpentine" is incongruous with a "light painting studio," which typically involves photography and LEDs, not oil paints. This suggests a lack of specificity or understanding of the medium. The environment feels generic and does not constrain the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=3.5)
    Setting details are generic ("damp earth," "bioluminescent fungi") and fail to constrain the character's choices. The "post-hibernation" world is a label that doesn't inform the physics or sociology of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=3.5)

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=2.5)
    The setting is a generic backdrop of "mist-shrouded peaks" without tactile specificity. The inclusion of a "scaffold wrap" at a scenic pullout is unanchored and jarring, appearing solely as a plot device. The "pixelated" element clashes with the established wet-plate/fiddler aesthetic without explanation.

The "skyborne grotto" provides atmosphere but no mechanical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=2.8)
    The setting is described with generic adjectives ("lush vegetation," "mystical place") that fail to ground the reader in a specific physical reality. Spatial geometry is confusing—"scallop the clouds" implies extreme height, but the "world below the grotto" is vague. The environment provides no constraints or tools that shape the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is a generic backdrop ("breezy lighthouse," "warm glow") that fails to constrain the action or influence the characters' choices. Sensory details are sparse and cliché ("clinking," "whisper"), lacking the specificity required to ground the metaphorical premise in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=3.9)

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=2.5)
    The setting relies on stock phrases ("eerie shadows," "wooden slats") and contradictory physical rules (dry, dusty books inside a sunken ship with the scent of saltwater). The environment feels like a generic backdrop rather than a specific, lived-in space that constrains the character.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=3.9)
    Descriptions rely heavily on clichés ("twinkled like diamonds," "velvet expanse") and abstract synesthesia ("tang of starlight") that feel decorative rather than grounded. While the "ambered observatory" is established, the setting functions as a static backdrop that never constrains the character's actions or forces a tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting consists of generic, atmospheric adjectives ("ancient," "worn," "warm orange") that set a mood but fail to constrain the character's actions. The environment feels like a passive backdrop rather than a specific physical space with distinct textures or limitations.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=3.6)
    The setting relies on purple, generic descriptors ("kaleidoscope," "sapphire," "ethereal") that lack sensory grit or specific grounding. While the "viaduct" is consistent, the "last fish" detail suggests a specific world that is immediately abandoned for abstract visuals. The environment acts as a static backdrop rather than pressuring the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.0)
    While the concept of a resurfacing reservoir town is evocative, the description relies on generic phrases ("skeletal remains," "damp earth") rather than specific, lived-in details.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=2.9)
    The setting relies on generic gothic descriptors ("cold stone," "desolate," "hollow shell") that lack sensory specificity. The spatial relationship between the tunnel and the household is never established, creating a "floating room" effect.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting consists of generic fantasy tropes ("frozen garden," "mist," "glowing eyes") that serve as backdrop rather than constraint. The imagery relies on "seemed" and "as if" similes rather than concrete sensory details that force the character to adapt. The environment does not fundamentally shape the tactics or the final image beyond providing atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=3.1)
    The setting is defined by abstractions ("reeked of charred dreams") rather than concrete sensory details that ground the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=5.1)
    While the "scent of old glass" provides a solid sensory anchor, the setting is largely described through abstract lists ("swirling vortex," "distorted perspectives") that fail to constrain the protagonist's actions. The environment acts as a passive backdrop for the character's projection rather than a physical space with resistance and rules. Specificity is lost to generalized surrealism.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=2.6)
    The setting presents an unaddressed logical contradiction: a "benthic" (deep-sea) city where stars "twinkle like diamonds" overhead without explanation of a dome or surface feed. Atmospheric descriptors are generic ("dimly lit," "eternal twilight") and fail to constrain the action.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=3.9)
    Descriptors like "mist-clad atrium" and "otherworldly silence" are generic and atmospheric rather than grounding or constraining. The hearing aid is a promising specific prop, but its operation is described in vague, magical terms ("gentle hum") rather than tactile interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=3.6)
    The setting consists of generic descriptors ("monolith," "steel walls," "strange symbols") that fail to create a specific, lived-in atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is functional but relies on fantasy clichés ("wispy figure," "eyes that seemed to see right through her," "labyrinthine network") rather than fresh, specific sensory details. While the "scent of damp earth" provides some grounding, the "laws of physics were bent" description is a generic tell that misses the opportunity to show the environment's strangeness through action.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=2.9)
    Descriptions rely heavily on abstract, high-fantasy clichés ("shimmered like stardust," "scent of blossoming dreams") rather than concrete, sensory grounding. The "sky-bridge" is mentioned as a prop but does not constrain action or establish a tangible physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "cobalt arcade" and storm bottle provide vivid visual anchors, but the setting largely functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of pressure. The "smuggling drone border" is a generic barrier that does not constrain the protagonist's tactics in a specific, unique way.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=3.3)
    Setting details rely heavily on clichés ("watchful gaze of a silent moon," "tales of laughter and joy long past") rather than concrete, lived-in sensory experience. The transition to the "hidden oasis" breaks spatial logic without teaching the reader the rules of this reality, resulting in a generic dreamscape rather than a specific place.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=3.5)
    Sensory details rely heavily on clichés ("scent of old paper," "faint tang of sandalwood," "whispers"). The "scientific poetry" aspect of the library is asserted but not visualized through specific book titles or unique environmental constraints. The setting feels generic rather than particular to the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.1)
    The setting is rendered through vague, romantic abstractions ("soft hush," "gentle lapping") rather than concrete, grounding particulars. The environment provides no physical constraints or specific spatial geometry to pressure the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting relies on high-abstraction descriptors ("shadowed nexus," "cosmic possibility") rather than concrete, sensory-grounded details that constrain the character’s options. The environment feels like a generic "white room" decorated with stock fantasy tropes (gnarled tree, ancient stones) that do not pressure the protagonist or influence the method of resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=4.5)
    The sunken orchard surrounded by shipwrecks offers a striking initial image, but the setting remains static scenery rather than a source of constraint or tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=3.9)
    The setting consists of generic signifiers ("dust motes," "old wooden shelves," "smell of old books") that lack specific, lived-in texture. While the "shadow in glass" is a strong image, the environment fails to constrain the character's actions or force trade-offs. The sensory details are atmospheric but standard.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting uses generic, high-fantasy descriptors ("verdant," "shimmering," "golden," "enchanted") that lack specific sensory grounding. The environment feels like a backdrop rather than a constraint that shapes the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=4.6)
    While the "prism sanctuary" offers some visual cues, the setting feels like a static "white room" filled with generic luminescent keywords. The environment does not pressure the character or constrain choices; the "shattered porcelain" is mentioned once as set dressing but never interacts with the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=3.4)
    The setting logic is contradictory; a "fresco vault" (indoor/enclosed) containing a "henge" lashed by rain (outdoor) confuses the spatial grounding. Sensory details remain generic and fail to constrain action.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=1.5)
    The setting is physically incoherent, described with impossible sensory details like "dusty tomes" and the "scent of salt" in a flooded, sunken environment. This lack of basic physical grounding destroys suspension of disbelief immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is established early but relies heavily on generic, abstract descriptors ("mystical nexus," "ancient architecture," "fabric of reality") rather than concrete, grounding details. While the "misty courtyard" is present, the sensory environment does not constrain the character's actions or force trade-offs. The atmosphere is told ("sweet with the scent") rather than experienced through the protagonist's specific, embodied interaction with the space.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=4.8)
    Atmosphere is established through generic, soft-focus descriptors ("ethereal light," "frost-etched") that act as wallpaper rather than constraining tactics. The setting provides a mood but fails to exert pressure or force specific interactions beyond looking.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=3.7)
    The setting ("sky gondola") is established but lacks tactile specificity, relying on generic visuals ("panoramic windows," "sea of clouds"). The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint or resources that shape Lyra's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting of the tree trunk library is established with clear, albeit standard, sensory details ("dappled shadows," "musty silence"). While the atmosphere is consistent, the description often relies on generic adjectives rather than specific, tactile interactions that would heighten the sense of imminent loss.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.5)
    Setting details are listed ("yellowed charts," "dusty hopscotch board") but remain static and fail to constrain the protagonist's choices. The "dusty" board implies long-term neglect that contradicts the presence of an active crew, breaking verisimilitude. The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than an active force.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is vivid but static, functioning as a backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint. The "driftwood nostalgia" element clashes logically with the "frozen library" environment, disrupting the atmospheric consistency. Details are ornamental ("glittering frost," "crystalline foundations") rather than tactile or pivotal to the action.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.1)
    Setting descriptions are generic ("breathtaking beauty," "lush trees") and fail to constrain action or influence character choices. The environment is treated as a static backdrop for summary exposition rather than a lived-in space with sensory specificity. Key elements like the "rock arches" appear decorative rather than integral.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the "lantern room" and "dusk" are established, the setting dissolves into abstraction ("pane of hush," "web of nested patterns") that obscures physical reality. The sensory details are repetitive and filtered through heavy interpretation rather than concrete grounding. The reliance on the word "hush" (used ~12 times) flattens the atmosphere into a single, monotone note.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=3.4)
    Setting details are generic ("cursed orchard," "stone walls," "thick with dust") and fail to ground the scene in a specific, sensory reality.

The workshop functions merely as a container for abstract feelings rather than a place of labor or tools that constrain action.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy tropes ("mysterious," "otherworldly," "dusty recesses") without the specific sensory grounding required to constrain the character's choices. The "treetop" aspect is cosmetic; the scene mechanics—buying a seed, writing in a journal—could happen anywhere, indicating a failure to integrate the environment into the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting concept is imaginative but rendered through generic descriptors ("glowing, iridescent," "twisting tunnels") that fail to constrain action. The environment functions as a backdrop for a smooth ride rather than a physical space that forces specific tactical adjustments.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is established with generic descriptors ("rust and saltwater," "ghost town") that provide atmosphere but do not constrain the protagonist's tactical choices. The "labyrinth" is a visual backdrop rather than a navigational challenge that forces a shift in approach.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.0)

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on generic, high-level descriptors ("ethereal glow," "vibrant colors") rather than specific, tactile grounding. While the "ridgeway" is the stage, it functions as a passive backdrop that never constrains the character's movement or choices. The "fade from memory to myth" is a label, not a felt reality.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=2.8)
    The juxtaposition of a fantasy "quartz arbor" and a modern "car window" creates a jarring, unexplained disconnect that breaks world logic. Sensory details are generic ("damp earth," "faint light") and ornamental, failing to constrain the character's choices or ground the scene in a specific reality.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.1)

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting consists of generic lighthouse tropes ("darkening sea," "dusty prisms," "spiral staircase") that provide a backdrop but do not constrain the character's tactics. While the spatial geography is legible, the descriptions rely on "noun-adjective" pairings that feel observational rather than lived-in or pressured. The "haunted" atmosphere is asserted through exposition rather than generated through sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is functional but relies on generic descriptors ("slicing through the darkness," "starry sky") that lack sensory specificity. The "world after the last print newspaper" is mentioned as a backdrop but does not exert any pressure on the immediate physical scene or the character's available tools.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting relies on generic, adjectival abstraction ("ethereal glow," "mystical stillness") rather than concrete, constraining details. The "floating" nature of the tea house is decorative and does not influence the character's tactical options or the scene's physics.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is described with generic post-apocalyptic tropes ("radioactive dust," "sickly yellow glow") that do not constrain the character; she navigates the terrain "with ease." The dust storm is mentioned as "howling" but paradoxically allows for the delicate work of piecing together shredded paper in the open. The environment acts as wallpaper rather than a source of pressure or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=2.7)
    Setting details are limited to repetitive labels ("stormlit observatory," "cobalt glass portico") that act as static backdrops rather than constraints. There is no sensory engagement beyond visual abstractions; the environment never pressures a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is described with atmospheric labels ("grimy," "dusty," "feral") but lacks spatial coherence or tactile grounding.

The "lightning collection tower" remains a vague backdrop that never physically constrains the characters or pressures their choices.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.3)
    Setting descriptions rely heavily on clichés ("wisps of winter's chill," "sweet scent," "gentle stir") that lack sensory specificity. The environment is a generic backdrop that offers no resistance or unique texture to ground the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is functional but generic ("coral and anemones"), lacking sensory specificity or unique atmospheric pressure. The "foxglove-stained glass" is an incongruous terrestrial image in an underwater setting that is never integrated or explained.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting is a generic "liminal space" abstraction ("dim light," "shadows," "stone") lacking the tactile specificity needed to ground the surrealism. Sensory details are filtered through clichés ("air thickened," "labyrinth") rather than fresh observation. The environment functions as a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker for choice.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=3.6)
    Descriptions are heavily adjectival and generic ("ethereal glow," "delicate tendrils"), creating a postcard effect rather than a specific, lived-in reality. The setting functions as a passive backdrop; neither the greenhouse nor the smog meaningfully constrains the protagonist's tactical options or physical movements.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting relies on stacking high-level adjectives ("monumental," "ethereal," "exquisite," "intricate") instead of providing specific, sensory details. The environment feels like a generic backdrop rather than a lived-in space that constrains action.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting relies on generic Gothic tropes ("crumbling walls," "musty bowels") without specific, grounding sensory details. A continuity error occurs when "flickering candlelight" appears abruptly after the character enters from a windy exterior without lighting a source. The "hunger stone" and yoyo remain abstract objects without visual specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=3.1)
    The setting relies on generic gothic signifiers ("decrepit facade," "musty darkness," "creaking door") rather than specific, grounded sensory details. The funhouse lacks spatial coherence or unique texture, serving merely as a backdrop for the checklist of interactions.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the core image of the driftwood orchard is imaginative, the description relies heavily on "purple" abstractions ("essence," "tapestry") and clichés ("shining jewel," "diamonds in the sky"). The setting functions as a passive backdrop rather than constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.2)
    The concept of a city on turtles provides a solid backdrop, and the shell patterns are integrated into the action. However, the setting often feels like a static container for the plot rather than a source of pressure or constraint that shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on Gothic clichés ("skeletal fingers," "morbid perfume") that serve as atmospheric wallpaper rather than constraints on action. The personification of the ivy is ornamental and does not pressure the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=2.6)
    Setting descriptions rely on generic placeholders ("aquatic life," "intricate designs") instead of specific, sensory grounding. The spatial logic is confusing; the surveyor "wades" through a "submerged" structure where stones are covered in silt, yet the interaction suggests an open-air environment, creating an incoherent physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=2.2)
    The setting contains mutually exclusive physical details: a "waterlogged repository" filled with "dusty tomes" and the scent of "aged paper." Waterlogging would destroy dust and paper scent, replacing them with mold or rot. The environment is a generic backdrop that does not constrain the character.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is described with a surplus of generic fantasy adjectives ("wispy," "ethereal," "misty") that provide atmosphere but fail to constrain the character's choices. The "glass basilica" and "tea garden" serve as passive backdrops rather than active elements that pressure the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=2.8)
    The setting is vague, characterized by generic descriptors ("shambles," "soft glow," "gentle hum") that fail to ground the reader in a specific reality. The juxtaposition of a wedding wreckage and a "Floating Observatory" is spatially and tonally jarring without adequate connective tissue. The environment does not pressure the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=3.9)
    Descriptions rely on purple prose and clichés ("whispers of centuries," "kaleidoscope of hues," "twinkle like diamonds," "velvet expanse") rather than specific, grounding details. The sensory details feel generic to any ruin setting ("scent of... forgotten knowledge") and do not constrain the character's choices or tactics. The "type foundry" aspect of the chip clashes logically with the "astronomy" setting without explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting ("cobalt terrace") acts as a static, atmospheric backdrop rather than a constraining environment that forces choices. Descriptions lean heavily into purple prose ("mournful sigh," "skeletal fingers") without providing the specific, sensory details necessary to ground the scene in a physical reality. The environment does not interact with the character's professional tools or goals.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting relies on generic, repetitive atmospherics ("mist swirling" is repeated five times) rather than specific, tactile details that constrain action. While the parapet provides a backdrop, it operates as a stage set for a monologue rather than a lived-in environment that pressures the character.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is generic ("golden glow," "sparkled," "blue sea") and lacks sensory texture. The specific elements (compass, utility poles) feel like inserted props rather than organic constraints of the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=3.6)
    While the setting is established, the description relies heavily on generic adjectives ("mist-shrouded," "ethereal," "otherworldly") rather than sensory details that constrain the character's movement or perception. The environment functions as a passive backdrop for internal monologue rather than an active force in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is a generic fantasy backdrop ("tiny lanterns," "rare spices") that fails to constrain action or provide specific sensory texture. The "orchard" serves only as a passive container for the dialogue and ritual, offering no environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=3.1)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy descriptors ("ethereal glow," "misty blanket") that lack sensory specificity or meaningful interaction. While the "onyx-ink" attribute suggests a specific visual aesthetic, it is never utilized or shown affecting the environment or the character's tools. The setting serves as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is a generic sci-fi overlay ("worn metal," "faded wires") that fails to constrain action or influence tactics. Sensory details are present but often cliché ("scent of aged paper"), lacking the specificity to ground the scene in a unique physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.1)
    While the black sand beach and volcano provide a basic backdrop, the setting lacks tactile interaction and specificity; the "whispering hush" is repeated as a label rather than a sensory texture. The environment does not constrain the character or shape her tactics, serving merely as a static stage for the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting relies on generic descriptors ("luminous fort," "ancient stones") and confusing lighting conditions that contradict the plot mechanics. The physical layout of the fort and the "cradle" remains vague and does not constrain the action.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=4.4)
    The setting relies on heavy adjectival description ("aurora-lit," "sacred") and clichés ("scent of salt and ozone") rather than specific, grounding details. While the visual of the bluff is clear, the environment does not constrain the character's actions or force adaptation. The "collapsed star dust" functions as a generic magical prop rather than a tangible object with weight and texture.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is established ("stormlit observatory"), but the descriptions are generic ("clouds below churned," "flashes of lightning"). The environment provides atmospheric wallpaper rather than constraining choice or interaction; the storm operates as a pathetic fallacy rather than a physical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.2)
    Visual descriptions of the atrium and light are clear, though they lean toward the ornamental. The specific prompt objects (sundial, tin) are placed in the scene but feel like stage props rather than lived-in environmental details that pressure the character.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=3.2)
    The setting consists of generic signifiers ("rusty library steps," "dusty tomes," "silver glow") that do not constrain the character or particularize the world. The physical reality of the library is ignored to facilitate the fantasy renovation; it functions as a backdrop rather than a tactile environment.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=3.4)
    While "tidal arbor above the clouds" is an evocative concept, the setting dissolves into generic atmospheric markers ("mist swirled," "wet stone," "shadowy figures"). The environment does not constrain the character's choices or provide specific, tactile tools; it serves merely as a backdrop for the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=2.6)
    The setting consists of generic placeholders ("vibrant landscape," "blooming flowers," "gentle hum") that lack sensory specificity. The "ancient ridge" never constrains the character’s actions or offers a concrete tactical resource. The description is ornamental wallpaper that could be swapped for any fantasy garden without altering the story.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting consists of generic descriptors ("crisp and clean," "gentle waves") that fail to constrain the character's choices or provide sensory grounding. Essential logistical details are absent; Kaito produces lace-making tools (thread, needle, pillow?) out of nowhere on a beach, breaking the physical reality of the scene. The environment is treated as a static backdrop rather than an active force.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.8)
    The greenhouse is evoked with damp-earth smell, grime-filtered light, and sediment layers; these details mirror the “gradual change” theme and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is minimal yet coherent—no impossible moves. Micro-setting (slide, wing dust) functions as charged object, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sentences occasionally catalogue sensory items rather than filter them through urgent action, but environment consistently guides attention.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    Canyon and frost patterns are recurrent, charged micro-settings that constrain her reading of the ledger; final image crystallizes around frost etchings. Sensory economy favors texture over exposition. Spatial grounding stays consistent; starlight → dawn progression is clean. Meets 9+ gate: frost pattern reweights the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)

Automated sunrise spectrum and quivering leaves are tactile, biased through the survivor’s sensory priority. The tuning fork case is micro-setting that constrains their final adjusments—irreplaceable tool within arm’s reach.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    The underwater library is vividly sketched through sensory compression (“silence that swallowed all sound,” “tomes bound in moon-shimmer”) and directly constrains his actions—every shelf he restores is a step toward the beacon he tends. Spatial choreography stays clean; the glowing creatures in the final image nicely reweight the setting as living sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Terra-cotta arbor, lantern light, and distant pot-clang give tactile grounding and mirror communal warmth. However, the setting never constrains movement or resources; sanctions remain abstract, and the ridge offers no tactical limit. Micro-setting (bell, lanterns) is vivid but inert.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    The twilight viaduct in bloom is more than postcard: the wisteria’s glow literally guides Aria’s breathing rhythm and supplies the final benediction image. Micro-setting functioning as tool: the arches frame each inhalation, petals act like “tiny stars” that meter her revelation. Spatial choreography stays clean—rail, pouch, pilgrim distance track across the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.8)
    “Living bridge garden” is evoked with disciplined economy: scent of blooms, dappled light, rustling leaves all filter through Elian’s professional eye for pattern. Spatial choreography is clean—paths twist, clearing waits, halo fragment lies centered—and the garden’s vibrancy subtly mirrors the protagonist’s widening perception. The setting never constrains a tactical choice, so it stops short of 8.8+, but its sensory density supports the accumulative lens and charges the final image of “rewoven reality.”

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dust-faded carnival and yellowed piano keys give quick sensory snapshots, but the environment never constrains tactics—no locked gate, alarm wire, or acoustic hazard shapes the infiltration. The seed vault is described in catalog rows; temperature, scent, or weight of packets could have charged the final image but are absent. Spatial choreography is vague: how close sentries, distance between shelves, exit route unclear. Selective detail favors nostalgia mood over functional pressure, so the setting ornaments rather than steers.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse, shipwreck ribs, and ashen forge form a micro-setting triad that literally colors the synesthetic soundscape; every beat of calibration is filtered through these anchors. The forge’s whispers evolve from ambience to co-conspirator, constraining the final sonic recipe. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no impossible reaches or drifting bodies. Auroras and cellular division supply time-pressure without date-dump exposition. Meets 9+ gate: forge/tool recharges the final image with undeniable conceptual cost, keeping it just shy of 9.0 only because the orchard itself is more postcard than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    “Emerald station” and “captured moonbeams” are vivid, selective anchors that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; the couple, bench, and jar remain trackable.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rusted library under starlight is sketched with selective, atmospheric detail—dust, shelves, dim light—that mirrors interior gloom without stalling motion. Spatial anchors arrive within the first 100 words, satisfying orientation; the stars reappear at exit to frame the arc. The seashell half serves as micro-setting/object, but its hum never constrains a concrete choice or limits movement; it’s mood-only. Setting never exerts pressure (no collapsing shelf, no lock-in), so it supports atmosphere more than tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    Ridge-fort, storm, candle stubs, flaking booklet—each tactile detail is filtered through the oracle’s perceptual bias and returns in the final image where “shadows rearranged” literalize the redrawn map; environment directly supplies the resource (darkness, silence) that enables the closure act.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.3)
    The frozen courtyard at twilight is vividly anchored through sensory selects—icy crunch under mechanical feet, pale blue light, hush of frost—and repeatedly filtered by Zeta’s janitorial priorities, so the setting qualifies as micro-setting that constrains task. Spatial choreography is clean; the violin’s untouched position on the stones tracks consistently. Weather and light evolve with the deepening twilight, mirroring Zeta’s internal shift without overt symbolism. The environment never actively endangers or limits Zeta’s options, so while atmosphere is strong, it does not charge the final image with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.9)
    Crystal forecourt, wet stone, star-reflecting monolith supply tactile, selective detail. Rain-washed city and “resonant hush” create a coherent acoustic envelope.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.0)
    Flooded pit, flickering lanterns, and water-warped paper are lived-in and selective; they guide her discovery method and charge the final image. Micro-setting (the soaked program) constrains her only investigative tool, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    The alpine station is handled as tool, not backdrop: the metal grating underfoot, ozone in nostrils, and humming servers constrain movement and attention. The botanical illustration recurs as micro-setting that charges the final image; its rarity parallels the oracle’s own bloom under adverse conditions. Weather is not scenery—it is the data she vandalizes. Spatial choreography stays clean across deck, interior, logbook wall.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sensory triage favors rust, decay, radio static—selective and POV-colored, not catalogue. Tunnel geometry stays consistent; no floating rooms. Beaded valve wheel serves as micro-setting/object recurrence but never constrains a final choice, blocking 9-band. Idiom is controlled; no anachronism. Strong atmospheric specificity even while plot remains static.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Library-catacomb and obsidian refuge are vividly seeded and return in the final image, giving the setting a charged micro-setting role that satisfies the 9+ gate. Sensory detail is selective—dust, damp earth, candle flicker—filtered through the keeper’s detached gaze, reinforcing tone without catalog bloat. Spatial choreography remains stable as the keeper descends; environment subtly mirrors internal dissolution. One minor loop: “whispers of forgotten lore” / “whispers of the earth” repeats without reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sage Ridge is atmospherically rich—sage scent, cicadas, cooling air—yet it never constrains movement or tactics; the guitar and curl do more micro-setting work. Spatial anchors are clear early; sensory layering supports mood without stall. Environment stays backdrop rather than pressure tool.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.7)
    The silo library is rendered through tactile specificity: “weathered walls bearing scars,” “narrow windows,” “scent of old books and dust.” Micro-setting (tapestry fragment) constrains her attention and re-appears in the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible moves. Selective sensory hierarchy mirrors her historian’s bias: visual threads shimmer, olfactory dust transports. The setting evolves causally: longer shadows mark elapsed time.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.4)
    Visual cliché stack: “beam slicing darkness,” “air thick with otherworldly energy.” Lighthouse geography absent—no stairs, lens room, island footprint. Microdot never handled; wooden box never opened. Setting fails 9+ gate: no object or place constrains choice or charges last image.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dimensional anchor is sketched with sandalwood/myrh scent and thin-reality trope, but the prose keeps the locus tight on the priest’s body and tools, satisfying micro-setting. Blue recurs with accruing symbolic mass, charging the final image. Sensory economy is good—sound and smell dominate, matching the concept. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating bodies or props.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    Glass spire and frozen lake create a coherent micro-setting whose mirrored symmetry literally guides the writer’s gaze and final image; the horizon functions as both place and metaphor without overt symbolism. Sensory detail is selective—pale dawn, crisp air, yellowed map—filtered through the POV’s artistic priorities. Spatial choreography is stable; no geography drift. The spire does not constrain a concrete choice, so the 9+ gate is missed, but the setting charges the closure image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.0)
    The glowing viaduct, rain-mist, and draining luminescence are not backdrop but barometer: each shift in glow tracks the internal power transfer, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is seamless—she stands, gazes, closes eyes, emerges; puddles, clay tablet, and darkness cohere without drift. Selective sensory triage mirrors her priorities: ozone and earth first, tactile tablet next, city-wide vista last. The city never becomes a place we could map, but at this length the viaduct itself functions as the "micro-setting" that constrains her path, fulfilling the requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cavern’s damp-earth scent and worn tool handles are tactile and specific; the drum skin’s vibration under Aria’s fingers supplies micro-setting that mirrors her interior state without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Courtyard is vividly sketched (“sweet scent of blooming flowers,” “long shadows across the stone pavement”) and filtered through a professional weather-watcher’s senses. Sensory hierarchy holds: dusk light narrows to the glint of the tube, then to the paper’s “words danced.” Micro-setting (the tube in her palm) later charges the final image. Spatial anchors are clear by line 6; no orientation penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.0)
    The greenhouse functions as micro-setting: UV-lit extinct petals constrain Elara’s emotional tempo and supply the exact sensory trigger for her grief-release. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—olfactory details dominate, visual patterns arrive only under UV reveal. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. The vial as recurring object charges the final image; its emptied glow is inseparable from the earned poise.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.9)
    The terra-cotta grotto is vividly sensory—rust-red rocks, starlight, rough stone under fingers—and the micro-setting of the rope in pocket returns as the final image, charging closure. Spatial choreography is clear in a single-scene window. Environment does not constrain any tactical choice, so it falls short of the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks” is vivid, idiosyncratic, and returns in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate (environment charges closure). Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: acoustically attuned violinist notes hush, echo, crackle of fire. Spatial choreography is clean—ash ground, glass panes, bonfire circle—tracking bodies without drift. One minor slip: “decaying wood” scent is listed among visual cues rather than filtering through her sound-oriented bias, but this does not dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    Setting is the story’s spine: luminescent stones dictate tempo and palette, their hum a metronome for craft. The grotto’s warmth, honeyed light, and crackle are filtered through a perfumer’s synesthetic attention—scent, color, static electricity—creating a believable sensory workspace. Spatial choreography is minimal yet clean; single figure, bench, box, exit. The final image of stones dimming then flaring back is a textbook setting-as-mirror, recharging the emotional output without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sea-air library is evoked with selective sensory strokes (“musty scent of old books,” “whispers of the sea”) that mirror Lena’s nostalgic mood. The setting never constrains choice—no closing doors, dwindling light, or spatial pressure—so it ornaments rather than catalyzes. Still, the night-breezy stacks function as a micro-cradle for friendship, earning moderate density.</question>
    <question>4</question><grade>6.4</question><comment>Dominant stake—honoring silent contributors—emerges only at midpoint, so early tension is diffuse. Escalation is conversational, never threatening; no resource, reputation, or time cost is risked. The single tightening is the joint decision to act, but it is cushioned by mutual enthusiasm rather than tested by opposition, keeping pressure mild.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.9)
    Crystalline orchard and shimmering crater are anchored early; the obsidian arbor later constrains choice when Kael decides to embed the street-tag symbol into its lattice, so the object charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective—glow, scent, hum—and filtered through Kael’s sculptor-eye. Spatial choreography stays clean as the pair move between trees. The setting subtly mirrors internal state without overt symbolism, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rooftop canal is tactile—water laps stone, towers rise, mist evaporates—yet none of these environmental facts ever constrain Lyra’s spell or movements. Infinity pendant and sketchbook serve as micro-settings that do charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains coherent in a single perched location. Weather and light evolve causally with the giant’s nap, giving the world a pulse without forcing symbolic overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.1)
    Cavern orchard is immediate and sensory-dense; luminescent fungi, mosaic stone, and dripping stalactites filter through the conjurer’s selective attention. The chipped patterns on the stepping stone constrain the ritual mechanics and return in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. One slip: “trees… etched against the moonlit ceiling” momentarily flattens the 3-D cave, but the error is peripheral.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    Library at dawn is atmospherically rich—dust, generator hum, sapphire hush—filtered through the dweller’s tactile routine. The tape fragment serves as micro-setting that triggers memory, but it never constrains a later choice; environment stays backdrop. Strong sensory hierarchy keeps the score high, capped at 8.8 for lack of final constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.1)
    Mossy trellis and rain-drenched leaf are tactile, specific, and POV-filtered ("emerald hue soothed her frazzled nerves"). Micro-setting works: the trellis functions as both sanctuary and mirror, constraining her to slow observation. Sensory economy is good—no checklist of five senses—but spatial choreography is static; we never see her move around or touch the trellis. Weather clichés ("storm season raged") are kept in check by the POV’s professional gaze at plant behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Perpetual gloom, crumbling concrete, salt-stung air, and moonlit amber give tactile specificity without tourist clutter. The tidal island’s wet ruin constrains movement—underground tunnels flood, rain reveals code—so setting actively shapes the search. Micro-setting (half-buried brooch, wet sand, paint-slick fingers) charges the final image when the object is pressed into pigment. A half-point off for one generic “overgrown streets” placeholder that could be any apocalypse.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cave is evoked through selective, sense-driven detail—sound, light, and bodily orientation (“delved deeper,” “feel the presence of magic in every rock”)—and the setting’s acoustics directly motivate Aria’s experiment. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible shifts in bodies or crystals. For 9+ the cave would have to constrain a final tactical choice, but here it merely hosts her expansion; still, the description is integrated, not ornamental, and supports the lyric engine.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ivory harbor’s post-rain stones and musty relic shop supply tactile salt-and-rust atmosphere; spatial anchors arrive early and the valve’s brass texture recurs, but environment never constrains any present-moment action—she simply buys, carries, and displays it—so setting decorates rather than shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mist, starlight, and vault corridors supply lyrical texture and steady atmospheric pressure; the setting’s chill and narrowing passages implicitly mirror Emilia’s rising awe. Sensory selection remains visual-heavy, but the repetitions (“mist swirled… mist deepened… mist-shrouded”) are purposeful rather than static. The phantom punch functions as micro-setting and its metallic weight is tactile, yet it never constrains a tactical choice or recharges the final image. No spatial contradictions or white-room gaps; geography stays legible.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tower’s latticework, sea views, and whale-borne soundscape are selective and filtered through Emilia’s attention; the setting quietly guides her micro-choices (where she stands to listen, when she lifts the pen). Weather and migration timeline stay coherent and supply temporal pressure. The tile itself becomes micro-setting, but its physical constraints (size, weight, temperature) are never allowed to limit her handling, keeping it just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prismatic escondite is vividly sketched—colours that “dance,” air thick with “otherworldly energy”—and the solar storm supplies pressure. Yet the environment never physically constrains Kael; walls don’t tighten, light doesn’t blind, storm doesn’t threaten. The setting charges atmosphere but not tactical choice, so it stops short of gating 9+. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prep-room micro-setting is tactile—"cold steel tables," "faint scent of death"—and constrains the moral climate; the ink pot functions as micro-setting object that literally guides Lena’s reframing. Spatial choreography is clean; father exits/enters without drift. Detail is selective, never touristic; funeral formaldehyde sharpens the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.9)
    The bonsai labyrinth is more than postcard: the fluorescent lamp on a stump refracts light that “illuminates the delicate branches,” constraining where she can sit and chart. Mountaintop silence after the town sleeps supplies the hush that amplifies the hum, directly enabling her method. Spatial choreography stays clean—no impossible moves. Setting evolves with dawn, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    Container labyrinth is vividly sketched—rusted canyons, faded labels, tide-echo—selective sensory detail mirrors survivor’s narrowed attention. The poison-bottle label and tide rhythm recur to charge the final image. Spatial choreography stays coherent; the setting’s scale subtly guides the footstep rhythm. No constraint or prop alters tactics, so the 9+ gate is not met.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.7)
    Observatory and cliff are sketched with atmospheric strokes; wind and rusting telescopes texture the scene. Seashell-as-tool is vivid but functions more as magic talisman than physical constraint. Spatial grounding holds; no choreography errors. Setting never turns to block or narrow her options—backdrop only.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.1)
    Moonlit summit is vividly anchored through camera placement, crater shadows, and low-gravity motion. Light shifts drive shot timing, integrating setting into tactic. Micro-setting object—the grain—charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate. Occasional tourist-catalog phrasing (“vast, barren expanse”) but sensory selection mostly filtered through inspector’s lens.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mist, fountain droplets, and drone iridescence braid into one micro-climate; the rail depot never becomes a postcard because every visual returns as calibration data. The shop’s tactile layout (bench, fountain, hummingbird perch) constrains every reach and twist. Environment is inseparable from the fix—no swap-out possible without breaking the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    The rusted outpost and frozen lake are vividly sensory (“scent of decay and wood smoke,” “golden glow over the frozen lake”) and filter through Emilia’s atlas-editor eye for terrain. Spatial choreography is clean; the environment’s cold, brittle surface literalizes the story’s hush. Yet the setting never actively constrains her choice—she walks onto ice that could have cracked or shifted but doesn’t—so it decorates rather than charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: decay-scent, twilight gradient, cobblestone vibration underfoot. The ebony fork and archway recur as micro-settings that physically channel sound, so environment constrains method. While the town never becomes more than a mood-board, the tight focalization keeps description purposeful and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.9)
    Underwater temple is sketched in salt-drip and crumbling stone; micro-setting of neck-vial becomes the true terrain that guides steps. Sensory triage narrows to scent and faint blue glow—perfect crisis filter. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible moves. Vial-light charging the final image passes 9-gate test yet setting never over-describes.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.9)
    Salty decay, copperlit lattice, and scuffed door give tactile specificity; micro-setting (door skin, hinge rasp) steers attention. Lighthouse-prison concatenation stays more postcard than constraint; it never limits exit or amplifies peril in-scene. Final lattice glow is atmospheric but does not charge the closing image; hence 9+ gate not met.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sensory triage favors scent and luminescence, feeding the lyrical mode; the greenhouse’s night-bloom physiology constrains visibility and steers attention to the bead. Spatial grounding is stable, but the larger orchard layout is only sketched, keeping the setting from charging tactics beyond ambience.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    Red canyon walls, damp-earth scent, and tide-pool cycle anchor time and place. The labyrinth is used as mirror, not constraint—no dead-end or resource scarcity affects tactics. Micro-setting is the fabric itself, which does charge the final image with inner light. Sensory selection stays biased to Aria’s poetic gaze, but spatial choreography is airy—no tactile navigation of tunnels.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    Catacomb orchard is vividly seeded early and lingers as micro-setting: roots snag her boots, bones trip the trowel, canopy dapple alters digging pace. These tactile constraints shape the meditation beats, satisfying the 9+ gate. However, spatial anchoring never clarifies depth or entry exit points; we lose track of where sundial sits relative to the main chamber, preventing a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.7)
    Golden arcade at dawn is vividly filtered through Cipher’s selective eye—neon glow, sidewalk chalk residue, distant clinking glasses—but environment never constrains a single choice; it’s postcard, not crucible. Clipboard and chalk are tactile yet passive; their states don’t alter tactics. Closure image re-weights “golden arcade” as nostalgic icon, giving a modest CR bump, but no prop or micro-setting intervenes in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.7)
    Cobalt walls, eternal candle, and velvet cloth are vividly filtered through the embroiderer’s tactile labor; the season’s crisp air narrows sensory hierarchy. Micro-setting—the needle, flame reflection on cloth—constrains posture and rhythm, charging the final glow. Spatial anchors arrive early and hold; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mangrove maze, fungi glow, damp rot, suspended windowpane—details are selective, sensory, and filtered through Aria’s ritual attentiveness. Spatial choreography is clean; the shard and moonlight are re-anchored each beat. The setting never physically constrains choice (no tide, root-trip, or light-limit alters tactics), so it stays atmospheric rather than instrumental—just shy of the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.5)
    Mist, coral, and cast function as micro-setting that constrains perception and supplies decryption tools. The coral is tactile—turned, clutched, pulsing—charging the final image; atrium geography stays coherent via the operating table and smudged cast within arm’s reach. Selective sensory triage (visual, tactile) mirrors Kael’s professional bias as translator-decoder.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Fog, orchard, and fragment are not backdrop but material: fog swallows sound and distance, forcing Lena to paint with light; fragment’s pigment dictates her palette. Body-as-setting appears when “her fingers traced the intricate patterns,” tactile constraint that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—easel placement, film unroll, pigment diffusion—all tracked without drift. Weather and ruin evolve with the beats, culminating in colors bleeding back into the trees.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    “Sound wave garden” is atmospherically vivid—tuning-fork hum, water against stone, angled mirrors—yet selection stays tourist-level rather than constraining Lena’s moves. Micro-setting objects (hobo nickel, mirrors) participate in action but don’t limit or endanger her; stakes remain internal. Final image recharges the mirrors and mural light, meeting the 9+ gate for environment charging closure, so ceiling reached.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.1)
    Greenhouse functions as micro-setting: trellises and soil texture guide Lyra’s every move and the camera stays tight on seed, soil, pollinator motion. Sensory triage is biased—smell of bloom, insect hum—matching entomologist frame. Spatial choreography is crisp; no impossible positions. Setting never evolves or constrains final choice, so it charges atmosphere but not closure, capping Q3 under its 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.9)
    The shell-fungi-postcard triad is specific, re-used, and charges the final image; the postcard’s colors against fungal glow visually tightens the ending. Spatial choreography is minimal (she never moves), but the micro-setting (notebook, postcard, fungi) constrains the act of singing. Sensory balance is lyric-skewed, yet purposeful; no world-rule inconsistency.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    The opal library, wind chime, and glass orchids are rendered with tactile specificity and filter every beat; the cracked bamboo’s light-constraint directly shapes the final image. Micro-setting (the cracked tube as light-source) charges closure. Spatial choreography is tight; bodies, chimes, and orchids track cleanly. Sensory hierarchy favors sound and filtered luminosity, matching the caretaker’s auditory obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)
    Extinct-language archive is rendered through scent of parchment, flickering orbs, etched alphabets on the well—selective, not catalogue. Micro-setting works: the ink well’s depletion physically constrains the final flourish, charging the closure image. Shadows “holding deeper meaning” flirts with overt symbolism, but it’s brief and earned by the perceptual shift of the POV. Spatial logic clean; no impossible object jumps.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.9)
    Volcanic amphitheater is vivid: “crumbling… expanding and contracting with the gentle rhythm of the earth’s internal pressure” couples tactile motion to stakes. Sensory hierarchy obeys Kaelin’s surveyor eye—chain links, damp moss, dappled shadows—yet the setting never constrains a choice or supplies a tool that alters outcome. Micro-setting (chain, parchment adhesive) is handled repeatedly but remains symbolic backdrop rather than tactical resource. Without environment shaping tactics or charging the final image, 9-band gate fails.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    Attic as micro-setting is tactile—must, coo, skylight shaft—and constrains ritual (dust mapping). Sensory hierarchy stays tight: bibliophile pigeon-trainer notices paper, glue, bird weight. Final image reuses skylight dust to refract memory, satisfying 9+ gate. Mars chip is only glancing visual, never alters space or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prism terrace supplies shifting light and spatial disorientation that constrain movement; however, sensory catalog repeats (“shattered light danced,” “colors bleeding”) without new environmental leverage in the final third, so the setting never charges the actual reunion beat.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.1)
    Micro-setting works: corridor acoustics, faint organism glow, and the feather’s char texture constrain mood and attention. Spatial choreography is clean; distances and light sources track across beats. Weather is irrelevant underwater, but time-of-night cues (“first light of dawn”) evolve consistently. The facility never becomes a tactical obstacle or tool, so while atmosphere is vivid, it stops just short of charging the final image at the 9-gate.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.7)
    The geode’s facets glinting “like a thousand tiny mirrors” is selective, pressure-filtered visual detail that steers her gaze and slows her steps—textbook environment-as-pressure. Body-as-setting is absent, but the crater glass in palm functions as micro-setting: its inner glow charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays crisp; no impossible bird-seed scatter. Sensory economy is strong; only visual is over-indexed—other senses could have sharpened the “otherworldly energy.”

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.3)
    Tidal arcade, torch flicker, salt breeze, and chess-piece micro-setting are vivid, selective, and filtered through a performer's eye. The stars-as-diamonds is familiar, but the recurrent lap of waves provides a rhythmic hinge that mirrors shuffled cards, so environment constrains pacing if not choice. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating benches. Final image of heavier pocketed bishop stars gives a micro-setting charge that lifts the score.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.0)
    The twilight garden is rendered through selective sensory triangulation—night-flower scent, stone temperature, starlight gaps—each filtered through dancer perception and braided into movement. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as Aria circles the stone; moonstone operates as micro-setting that constrains the final pirouette. Weather and world-rules stay implicit but consistent. While the city exile remains a floating off-stage contrast, the immediate environment charges both stakes and final image, satisfying the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pearl Bay at dawn is rendered with selective, POV-filtered sensory strokes; mist, salty air, and color progression ground the beat without cataloging. The prism atrium functions as micro-setting, its facets charging the final “inner light” image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is minimal yet clean—one fisherman, one stone, concentric ripples—so no floating-room syndrome. Weather and light evolve causally with the sun’s rise, mirroring the glazier’s internal quiet rather than forcing tactical change.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.9)
    Moonlit ridge is evoked with selective sensory cues: gravel crunch, silver crescent, cracked porcelain glow; visual dominance fits night hike. Micro-setting (the box) becomes the crucible that constrains final reflection. Spatial choreography stays coherent—box opened while standing alone on path. Environment mirrors interior but avoids heavy-handed symbolism; moonlight simply enables the mirror’s effect. World rules plausible; no occupational detail demanded at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tide-polished grotto is atmospherically rich—watery echoes, filtered light, tactile stone—and the altitude gauge doubles as micro-setting that almost charges the final image. Spatial choreography is stable in a single-scene frame. However, the gauge’s blue pulse is never constrained by physical rules; it glows on cue rather than through Aria’s patterned action, so the environment never truly shapes tactics. Still, sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful, meeting the 9- gate but not the constraint requirement for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    “Ivy-veiled passage” recurs like a pulse, charging both atmosphere and metaphor; its final reprise anchors the closing image. Selective sensory triage—crumbling plaster, cold hearth—guides attention without catalog bloat. Spatial choreography stays clean across corridor, chamber, fireplace moves. At 800 words, no single object actively constrains choice; thus 9+ gate not met.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prism parapet, echoing terrace, spring rain, and dusky sky are selectively re-cued almost every paragraph, creating a tight micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory range is narrow but purposeful—light, color, faint sound—mirroring the painter’s narrowed concentration. Spatial anchors hold; no geography drift. The setting never actively obstructs or enables her; it decorates more than it constrains, keeping the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    The ancient terrace is sketched with selective sensory strokes (warm stone, orange sunset, night-blooming scent) that mirror Elian’s fatigue and hope. Spatial choreography is thin—delegates appear and vanish like ghosts—but the terrace’s atmospheric weight is credibly maintained. The midsummer heat tightens the physical frame, yet no detail of the stone or clipboard alters a tactical choice; setting decorates rather than constrains. Still, the sensory hierarchy stays tied to Elian’s attention, avoiding generic travel-brochure listing.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.1)
    Salt-flat micro-setting directly shapes tactics: cracks = map, cracked earth = audible crunch that times her steps. Sensory selection is urgent—dry earth scent, thunder timbre—filtered through her project-manager gaze. Weather transitions from lull to deluge, guiding the decisive release; environment evolves causally with action. Final image of water lapping newly made shore recharges the opening barren vista, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.7)
    Micro-setting (body and prism) constrains every choice; snow and mirror-facets narrow perception to glints and crunch underfoot. Selective sensory triage—cold light, crystalline sound—mirrors internal thaw. Spatial choreography is clean: she stands, raises eyes, steps away; no floating props. Final image recharges setting: courtyard remains, prism now “dimly lit,” making environment cost legible. Weather cliché risk (“delicate flakes danced”) is offset by immediate POV filter and later tactical use of snow-crunch as departure cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    Radar dome’s “ghostly sentinel” shell and “meteor hush” white-noise are specific, sensory, and re-weighted in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is minimal yet sufficient for one character. Selective attention—she notices flicker, creak, trinket jingle—mirrors her calligrapher’s eye. Setting directly enables her creative turn, so the dome is not backdrop but tool.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto is vividly sensory—moss-covered stone, sweet bloom-scent, insect hum—filtered through Aria’s reverent attention. Spatial anchors hold; body, tool (thread), and recurring object (moth wing) are present. Yet the environment never actively constrains her choices; it’s backdrop, not crucible. Final image of wing-glow is atmospheric but doesn’t alter tactics or charge cost.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.1)
    Icebound sanctum, candle glow, and auroral hiss are filtered through Akira’s tactile attention; the reconfigured rope itself becomes micro-setting that constrains the final pluck. Selective sensory detail mirrors internal thaw, but spatial anchors (ceiling, distance, exits) remain vague, keeping the score just below the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    The vine-draped bunker is sketched with selective sensory hits—ozone, damp earth, luminescent fungi—that filter through Hindsight’s alien perception, giving the setting a micro-setting charge. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the single slow walk to the stone table. Weather is used atmospherically rather than tactically: the storm never blocks escape, damage, or resource, so environment informs mood but not choice. For 600-word scope the density is efficient; the 9+ gate is missed because no environmental detail constrains the final acceptance or reweights the seal.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.1)
    Palace is evoked in lush, echoing phrases; spatial anchors arrive late (~130 w) but serve the twilight payoff. The tile functions as micro-setting, constraining attention and choice; its shimmer is repeatedly filtered through POV priority.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    The music box functions as micro-setting: its broken brass pin is handled twice, constrains Elara’s method (she cannot replay the old tune), and charges the final image when the silent box remains as the community’s new tuning fork. The sanctuary is sketched with minimal strokes—walls, hush, golden light—but every sensory pick is filtered through Elara’s pacifist ear, so “soundless” is never mere adjective, plot-relevant atmosphere. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies shift from rigid to softened in synchrony with the melody’s swell. One of the rare cases where an object-as-setting fully replaces geography without white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    Selective sensory triage keeps the orchard district alive: damp-earth perfume, brass tarnish, frost-shimmer on glass. Space stays coherent; the sextant’s half-buried arc is re-seen in the finished mirror’s curve, a micro-setting triumph. Weather is not postcard but choice-shaping: frost’s shimmer dictates when the dream can be harvested. One slip: “centuries of thick fog” is asserted, never tested against any lived constraint—keeps the score sub-9.

    Cathedral-orchid fusion is vivid—“lush orchard spanning its rafters”—and constrains Elara’s movements (ladders, soil baskets). Spatial anchoring clear by 120 words; micro-setting (ribbon on branch) charges final image. Some floral descriptors verge on brochure (“deeper shade of green”) but overall atmosphere integrates with action.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.1)
    Astral orchard is vividly sketched with stardust blossoms and incense-thick bathroom; sensory selection mirrors curator’s widening perception. Yet setting never constrains action—asteroid gravity, resources, or danger are absent, so environment is decorative, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mountain-sized bookstore is a delicious conceit, but spatial choreography is hand-waved: shelves “twist in impossible geometries” yet never constrain movement or force a specific tactical choice. Sensory detail is vivid but generically gothic (“musty depths,” “scent of old parchment”) rather than filtered through Elara’s linguist bias; no cataloguer’s micro-notice of script, paper weight, or binding type. The “unheard symphony” motif is introduced late and never anchors to an object or body that could charge the final image. Environment stays backdrop; it never turns into an obstacle that exacts a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fog-shrouded carnival ship is evocatively anchored: rusting corridors, rickety rollercoasters, scent of decay. Details are filtered through Lyra’s discoverer lens, guiding her attention to hidden seams. The ship-as-memory-metaphor constrains the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clock-tower gears, dusty tomes, and the ceremonial rope supply tactile micro-setting; the diplomat’s seal glows again at the end, giving the object a charged reprise. Spatial choreography is clean—stairs, corner, lap—but the environment never actively constrains choices (no jammed gear, no falling weight, no height risk). Selective sensory detail (echoing footsteps, ticking) supports atmosphere without stalling momentum, yet the room remains backdrop rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is evoked through selective sensory detail—ice crack symmetries, luminous rock, vibrational timbres—always filtered by the mapkeeper’s professional gaze. The harmonic caves function as both environment and instrument: their resonance shapes her tactics and is re-shaped by her, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible shifts. One missed opportunity: temperature is never felt although ice is omnipresent, a small gap under immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.8)
    Glass pavilion’s vibrations and star-etched walls create a micro-setting that filters every beat; broken prism and frozen orrery are tactile anchors. Thistle scent threaded through action, not backdrop, and charges the final golden bloom. Spatial track clean; no white-room. Setting never forces a hard choice, so it supports but does not constrain—keeps the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stormlit observatory above clouds is vividly anchored and filters every beat; wet stone scent, lightning glare, and crystal facets constrain perception. The crystal forecourt re-appears with reweighted meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating props. Selective sensory economy keeps momentum; weather directly governs visibility and mood, never sliding into postcard cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sensory filtration is excellent—orange fade, kerosene tang, chant rhythm, lantern gleam—each detail filtered through Lyra’s pyrotechnic gaze. The fortress garden is sketched with impressionist economy; spatial ground remains steady. The kerosene rag knot re-appears in memory at the end, but it does not physically constrain tactics or charge the final image, capping short of 9-band utility. Still, the environment directly feeds her creative lens, never dragging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.1)
    Micro-setting prevails: damp stone, salt reek, and star-speckled roof are filtered through the chronicler’s sensory bias. The grotto’s spatial logic stays coherent; bodies never float, props never teleport. Starlight-as-lantern and dripping-water metronome both constrain perception and supply the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Lost top decimal because the couple’s staging is sketched only relative to “across,” leaving distance and exit path under-defined.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    The trellis is not backdrop but instrument: latticework becomes a horizontal womb during inversion, constraining movement and forcing aerial orientation that literalizes Eli’s fear. Cloud-height cold, golden light, and floating soil chunks are filtered through Eli’s selective attention to silence-flavors. The porcelain doll micro-setting meets the 9+ gate by charging the final image. Sensory economy is tight—no tourist catalogue, only dusk-light, creaking vines, and the hush that “thickens”—all guiding the release of the doll.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    The drifting prism terrace is evoked with kaleidoscopic, tactile specificity: facets reflect pastel hues, wooden structures creak, water laps. Sensory hierarchy mirrors the operator’s professional attention to subtle acoustic shifts. The setting never actively blocks or enables a key choice—its role is reflective, not constraining—so it falls just short of the 9+ gate that demands environment shape tactics. Still, the lyric density is disciplined, integrated into motion rather than catalogued.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.9)
    Kaleidoscopic waterfall, iridescent bark, stardust leaves: visual overload, but the orchard does constrain movement—trees part only when the flake activates, so environment shapes tactic once. Spatial choreography is clean; we track her body through veil, flower, wall, stair. The “crumbling spires” opener is generic SF wallpaper, but the orchard’s specificity earns its keep by enabling the stair reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sanctuary’s ashen charcoal palette is not postcard backdrop; its narrowing corridors and flickering flame literally constrain movement and supply the single tool the keeper can use to recharge the threshold. Micro-setting rule satisfied: the small flame-object governs the final beat. Sensory selection is POV-driven—“starlight” is noticed only when it glints off the ring, reflecting mood. Spatial choreography is clean: keeper descends, reaches heart-chamber, returns to entrance without impossible jumps.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bioluminescent farm is more than wallpaper: the soft light refracts through the falling diamonds, charging the final image as required for 9+ gate (a). Selective fungal scent and blue-green glow steer Lyra’s attention and pace. Spatial tracking stays clean; no exotic surplus. One vivid, purposeful environment suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    The sepia reading room is vividly evoked through scent, lantern glow, and tactile paper dust; it functions more as mood board than as constraint. The gramophone crank handle is a micro-setting that finally reappears in the exit image, giving it closure charge, hence the slight boost. Spatial choreography is clean; we never lose track of seat, table, window. Environment never actively limits options, so达不到9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    The greenhouse-night hybrid is sensuously specific (“leaves rustling with otherworldly energy,” “scent of blooming flowers and faint tang of mystical experimentation”) and filters through the knight’s alchemical familiarity. Space is stable; glass walls ripple but geography never blurs. The environment acts—trees lean, branches tangle—supplying the final image; micro-setting (wooden snap) charges the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Foster-care file room is micro-setting-as-pressure: cardboard ridges, must, drifting dust become the only tools for her “unfurling.” Button-as-tool re-weights at closure. Sensory selection is narrow but POV-colored; spatial choreography clean. No environment detail contradicts; no occupational error. Meets 9+ gate: button charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Auric lagoon and starlight are vividly reiterated, creating a consistent lyric palette. Micro-setting (the key, luminescent orbs) is tactile but never constrains choice; the lagoon never physically threatens or enables escape. Final image relies on visual shimmer alone; no environmental pivot charges the exit. Details are atmospheric, not instrumental.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prism atrium, dew, and mist are sensuously layered; light refraction and dew formation track time and supply visual rhythm. The grotto’s crystalline structures act as acoustic amplifier, so setting directly shapes the music’s power—meets 9+ gate for environment that charges the final image. Spatial tracking is clean; saxophonist stays centered, no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    “Ashen skyborne arbor” is anchored by word 10; every later detail (moon-barked trees, leaf-code, drifting clouds) is filtered through the sorter’s selective attention. The moonstone speck functions as micro-setting/object that literally illuminates the final pattern, satisfying the 9+ constraint. Spatial choreography remains stable in a single, floating locale.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Subterranean waterfall, mold-scented tunnels, and leaf-drifts inside a glass ruin are sharply selective and tethered to Elian’s tinkerer eye: grime-clouded panes, rusty frame, swirling decay. The compass rose acts as micro-setting—its glow literally guides hand motion—so environment constrains action. Spatial tracking is clean: sound fades then returns as he exits. While no choice is physically impeded by locale, the greenhouse’s debris becomes the material of invention, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rain-washed foundry is rendered through metallic, earthen, and molten sensory strata that filter Elara’s alchemical bias; the zodiac coin operates as micro-setting and final image, constraining her attention and recharging at closure. Spatial choreography is clean; only the “melancholy mist” drifts toward cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mist, waterfall, harp reverb, and the tooth’s glint are filtered through the collector’s practiced eye; Echo Gorge acts as acoustic amplifier that shapes both tactic (follow the sound) and closure (fading echo). Micro-setting (tooth-in-hand) charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    Ultraviolet forest is atmospherically sharp—trees “twisting and writhing like living things” supplies kinetic alienness. Pewter strap and proprioceptive enhancement create micro-settings that return in memory flashes, but neither object alters real-time tactics; the forest’s glow guides her, yet its rules remain metaphorical rather than choice-constraining. Spatial anchoring inside the clinic is clear; once outside, distances and hazards blur into lyric space.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.9)
    The rooftop market is evoked with sandalwood, myrrh, whispered secrets—selective sensory triangulation that mirrors Lena’s hushed awe. Spatial choreography remains tidy: vendor stall → painting rack → descent. The lens fragment behaves as micro-setting, constraining her grip and focalizing attention; it also charges the final image when it glows. What keeps this from 8.5 is that the environment never pushes back—no crowding, bargaining, or physical obstacle tests her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    The fluorescent “buzz dies” and the skeletal-light image are sharply anchored early; spatial choreography of counter, shelf, and hidden compartment is coherent. Sensory economy favors dust motes and etched metal, but the rest of the circus exterior is only alluded to; ticket stubs and posters stay catalog props without re-use. The mainspring barrel succeeds as micro-setting: handled twice, carried out, humming—meeting the 9+ gate by charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    Glass orchard, viscous whisper-bottle, frost patterns, and cloud sea are shimmeringly specific and refract through every beat. The micro-setting of the library’s glass panes directly shapes the frost prints that catalyze the finale. Spatial choreography is dream-clear; no props teleport. Environment charges the closure image without overt symbolism—an 8-plus showing.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    Baroque asteroid galleries, dust motes, flickering luminescence—selective sensory triangulation keeps momentum. The shard itself becomes micro-setting; its facets dictate analysis tempo and final image. Spatial choreography is clean: knelt retrieval → stow → lab bench → desk. No object teleport or white-room lapse; environment subtly guides choice (lab access, storm blackout). For 9+ it would need to constrain a live tactical choice—here it mostly frames mood.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.9)
    Resonance chamber as micro-setting: vibrating air, luminescent orbs, and the music box itself constrain every motion. Spatial choreography stays crisp; the chamber’s whispers literally tighten the final cadence. Selective sensory detail (midnight light, metal harmonics) anchors POV without catalogue drift.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    The limestone tunnels and glowing fungi are vividly sensory and filtered through the collector’s scent-obsessed POV; petrichor is used as both atmosphere and motivation. Spatial choreography is clean—water laps, compass needle quivers, grotto opening tracks. However, no detail of place later constrains her choice or charges the final image; the lagoon could be any luminous cave. Meets the 9+ gate technically (tool/compass appears in final image) but the setting does not shape tactics, so capped below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Storm-archway and salt-etched stone are vividly tactile and filter through Aria’s sculptor eye. Slide-as-micro-setting qualifies: its glint amid wrack draws her hand, later its glow colors the sculpture’s form. Spatial choreography clean; weather stays causally linked to mood but never blocks or endangers action—pressure remains decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.3)
    The amber pavilion’s ochre floorboards and cathedral’s etched glass operate as micro-settings that constrain palette and epistemology: she must paint what the glass lets her see. Postal faces and moonlit garden imagery supply recurring objects whose tactile wear guides her theory that “flowers bloom at night… because of the intricate web.” Sensory economy favors filtered vision—glinting glass, fading postcard ink—mirroring her cognitive narrowing. Integration charges the final image: the pavilion itself becomes a “sanctuary of quiet contemplation,” proving setting shaped outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.9)
    The zeppelin library and obsidian lagoon are vividly sensed—smell of aged paper, mirror-like water—and the window-framed vista is used to filter Naomi’s attention. Selective detail (raised letters, beach debris patterns) stays inside her perception, avoiding catalog excess. However, no environmental feature ever constrains her movement or limits choice; the lagoon remains metaphoric backdrop rather than tactical object, keeping the score below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    Paper-lantern cove is anchored early, sensuously decayed, and gains micro-setting power when lanterns “grow brighter” in response to thought, turning atmosphere into feedback. Spatial choreography stays light but coherent; the amber bottle’s unmoving presence supplies a concrete pivot. The town is sketched in festival-memory rather than physical detail; still, the cove’s lantern light is used twice to refract interior state, meeting the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orchard-on-skyscraper is more than postcard; the vertical garden’s fragility (lanterns, blooming scent, wax relic) literally constrains the scribe’s exit—no railings, no city ladder, only dawn’s gold glow. Spatial choreography is pristine: phonograph on stone bench, scribe stepping back into shadow, wax left as vessel. Micro-setting (wax shaving) doubles as tool and archive, charging the final image. One tiny slip—no tactile handling of wax until the end—keeps it just under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Starlit glass atrium and thawing frost provide a tactile, shifting micro-setting that mirrors internal thaw; selective sensory detail (glistening panes, soft hum) is filtered through seed-saver priorities. The space stays legible and constrains her ritual—she must wait for melt to perform—earning its keep in the final hush without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Wind, altitude, and cathedral are sketched with crisp specificity; the bell’s repaired crack and the swaying rope return to charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean (“hand hovered above the rope”). Sensory economy favors sound and motion over visual catalog, matching POV priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    Station is sketched with selective sensory detail—hum of computers, soft-bristled broom—filtered through janitor’s quiet attention. Yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting and final image, but it never constrains a choice; it merely glows. Spatial choreography is stable; no world-rule errors. Atmosphere supports stillness motif without overstaying.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stained glass box functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice—its glow and grime charge the moment of opening/closing. Sensory selection stays tight: ash-heavy air, flickering light, the faint hum. Spatial choreography is clean; the box sits on a pedestal, is approached, opened, closed, and its inner light re-enters the final image. Environment mirrors interior decay without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    Emerald silo, cracked clock, urn shard—each re-appears with shifted charge, creating micro-setting as crucible. Descriptions are selective, filtered through the keeper’s numbed awe; sound and touch are lean but present. The capsule’s interior is withheld until the final beat, giving the repair tactile payoff. Spatial choreography is immaculate; objects never drift.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Micro-setting rules: the poet’s cross-legged body, the feather, and the wet sand constrain her in place; the mirrored lagoon surface powers the final image. Selective sensory filtration—salt hush, lapping melody, first light on iridescent barbules—keeps tourist-catalogue at bay. Spatial choreography is flawless: kite’s snap, upward glance, return to feather, footprints left behind. Weather timing (post-dawn burn-off) is consistent and stakes the mood shift.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rain-washed stone, overgrown sculpture path, and the amber pendant supply tactile, POV-filtered detail that subtly guides the skeptic’s attention. The tower’s glowing grain and spring’s reclaiming vines mirror the inner thaw without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography holds as footprints converge toward the entrance. The setting constrains pace—slow, vegetal reclamation—but does not directly shape a final tactical choice, capping it short of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sensory selection is disciplined: twilight scent, birdsong, and the leather satchel filter through the coachman’s attuned perception. The reef-turned-garden is sketched rather than physically mapped, but the seed pod functions as micro-setting that constrains the final action. Spatial choreography is clean; horses, jetty, and soil track without drift. While the environment never actively resists or endangers, the blooming jetty’s fragrance lingers to charge the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Scrapyard Krael is sketched with sensory triangulation: rust hulks, creosote air, gravel crunch underfoot. The tanker-truck shade and phonograph grooves are tactile micro-settings that guide the riddle solve. Environment never blocks or weaponizes choice, so constraint test for 9+ unmet, but specificity remains vivid and POV-filtered throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    The deck is sketched with selective sensory strokes—metallic echo, gilded compass, void stars—that filter through Aria’s stargazer eye. Spatial choreography is minimalist yet coherent: floor, railing, horizon line track cleanly. The compass rose constrains the final gaze direction, charging the closure image; environment thus guides choice. No micro-prop is handled tactilely, but the compass fulfills the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Icebound spire, ozone air, and crystal chamber are vividly tactile; environment is the strongest presence on the page. Spatial choreography is clean—Moonwhisper edges, descends, arrives—though distances remain impressionistic. Crystalline chess-board carved “from the essence of stars” is striking yet abstract; it never physically constrains the swap or limits hand placement. Setting sings, but it sings alone; it doesn’t push back.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.9)
    Whispering-gallery acoustics and creaking boards are filtered through pressure, guiding attention to footstep-spelled words; the chessboard’s pawn-void mirrors the political void, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies track from facing to walking line. Setting never constrains a tactical choice, so 9-band gate fails, but specificity and tonal integration are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.1)
    The bookstore-mountain is vividly realized—“shelves upon shelves…casting long shadows”—and the stone’s shimmer re-appears to charge the final image, meeting 9+ gate. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through seer-perception. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly. Tone sustains mystical antiquity without drifting into tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    The frozen village is rendered through tactile micro-details—wet-earth scent, abandoned shoes mid-stride, the tutor’s knees on cold stone—so the setting doubles as emotional crucible. Spatial choreography is clean: tapestry on cobbles → standing → portal → twisting passages → emergence into bright day; no impossible moves. Platinum labyrinth returns in the final image, now reweighted from mystery to absolution, satisfying the 9+ gate. One nit: “glittering portal” is visual shorthand; still, the mirrored passages serve as recursive setting-as-psyche.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    Bone towers, pale spire, and refracting mist are specific, sensory, and return to reshape the final image; they pass the 9+ gate by charging closure. Canyon echo rules remain consistent, learned through sound and light play rather than exposition. Selective detail favors sound and sight, mirroring the poet’s medium. Spatial choreography is stable; no impossible positions or prop drift.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The acid-sea workshop is sensuously tactile—creaking struts, foaming green below, grime on parchment—yet never constrains a specific tactical choice; the same task could occur on dry land. Micro-setting succeeds: the statue’s pockmarks and the rabbit-foot charm are handled, turned, weighed, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; no continuity drift. Weather and scale remain atmospheric backdrop rather than active obstacle, keeping the score below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    Coastal textures—salt-stiff brush, luminescent moss, worn quay stone—are selective and POV-filtered; the cave oasis functions as a micro-setting that re-weights stakes. Spatial choreography is loose during the “winding path” stumble, but the final canvas detail re-anchors the painter’s body and tool, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory selection is disciplined: scent drives every beat, filtered through Elian’s night-garden devotion. The lighthouse and garden interleave as micro-setting, guiding his steps and metaphors; cobalt light at dawn recharges the opening image. Weather shift (post-heat-wave) is felt as cool skin and altered earth aroma, not weather-report exposition. Spatial choreography is clean: stairs, workbench, pocket, waves track without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    “Starlit signal station” and patina censer foot act as micro-setting: one fixed vantage, one handheld relic that guides palm and memory. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—navigator notices glint on bronze, moonlit topographies—though smell/temperature are missed opportunities. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Environment alters choice only implicitly (open plain halts forward motion); a sharper constraint—rusted track, airless shaft—would push Q3 to 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    The hanging orchard is sketched with sensory economy—“battered and storm-torn,” roots like “tangled undergrowth”—and the glass eye’s aged patina gives a micro-setting anchor that charges the final image. Spatial track stays clean; weather is causally felt in slippery soil and howling wind that mirrors psyche without overt symbol slogans.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mist, salt, dock planks, and lighthouse glass are viscerally filtered through Kael’s mariner senses. The boutonnière acts as micro-setting, its brittle petals grounding the final image. Spatial tracking is clean; the stranger never drifts out of sight-line. Setting does not constrain tactics, so capped below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.7)
    Selective sensory triage mirrors antique-dealer gaze: varnish scent omitted, instead “dusty relics,” “fading light,” ant-file motion, dripping water—economy over catalog. Creek/cavern form micro-setting dyad—rising water sets ticking backdrop, floral cavern supplies map puzzle; both constrain exit timing and spatial choices. Spatial choreography clean: shop→foliage veil→stone map→hidden chamber, distances track without drift. Final image reuses creek reflection as peace mirror—earned environmental echo, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sensory selection is biased to the queen’s awe (ozone, lacy glow) and keeps description woven through movement. Spatial choreography is clear across the ridge ascent; the ember grotto’s pulsing heart successfully charges the final image with menace. However, micro-setting never constrains a tactical choice—she could have stepped into any red-lit cave to receive the same withheld revelation—so the 9+ gate is missed.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sensory triad—ember glow, salt breeze, rustling grass—anchors every beat and filters through the POV’s scientific-romantic gaze. The shell’s spiral is re-examined under shifting light, so the micro-setting (object-as-setting) evolves and charges the closing smile. Spatial choreography is clean; only two bodies share the frame. Meets the 9+ gate: the shell’s changing illumination directly shapes the final perception.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.1)
    Cabin and scroll function as micro-setting; the birch bark’s tactile presence recurs and charges the final image. Sparse sensory range (mostly visual) and generic “woods” keep it from constraining any choice, but the object-as-setting satisfies the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    The shop is not backdrop but instrument: water-lap becomes metronome for altered time-perception, bench clutter doubles as emotional cartography kit. Fog is both weather and cognitive filter—visibility literally governs what she can “map.” Micro-setting triumph: the screw’s gleam in diffused light is the pivot image that charges closure. One minor slip—“assortment of peculiar objects” drifts toward catalogue before retrieval by touch.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    The floating tea-platform is never allowed to constrain tactics—tremors are noticed but don’t alter footing or tea ritual—so the micro-setting ceiling caps at 8.8. Sensory selection is POV-driven (sandalwood, creak, saturated hush) and matches the meditative stake. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no impossible positions. Weather (storms parting for sunset) mirrors internal clearing and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    Archive is evoked through tactile bibliography—embossed rests, yellowed pages—rather than generic dust. Perfume bottle serves as micro-setting that glows and hums, constraining Lyra’s focus and charging the final image. Orchard hush supplies ambient dread, but spatial choreography is kept off-stage, avoiding white-room syndrome. Sensory selection stays biased to Lyra’s synesthetic craft (scent = sound) so detail feels filtered, not catalogued.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.3)
    The temple library is sketched with selective, sensory strokes—“aged parchment,” “shelves like sentinels”—that feed the hush-tone. Spatial anchors stay stable; the dictionary’s tactile presence functions as micro-setting. Environment never actively obstructs or resource Aria; it mirrors mood rather than shaping tactics. Thus the 9+ gate (constraint charging the final image) is missed, but the atmosphere remains coherent and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    Fjord-quiet atmosphere and hydraulic-clock mechanics are rendered through selective sensory detail (soft ticking, orange dawn glow) that mirrors the shepherd’s inward hush. The horizon station functions as micro-setting: its very name promises measurement yet grants no measurable constraint on action; it remains backdrop. No object or environmental detail actively shapes the final tactical stance; the mantle clock key is tactile but never turns a gear that changes outcomes. Still, the texture is consistent and purposeful, sustaining mood without stall.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.1)
    Farm is vivid, selective: “soft glow…blue-green light,” scent of damp earth, footsteps on soil. Spatial choreography is immaculate—rows, tunnels, heart-cluster—mirroring Lena’s gift. Mushroom light actively calms her nerves, charging the final image where boundaries blur. No weather or tool-as-setting constraint, but the bioluminescence functions as both atmosphere and mirror; meets 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.7)
    The rain-slick library and subway car are sketched with selective sensory strokes; the mica pane recurs as micro-setting that charges the final image, clearing the 9+ gate. Weather mattered only atmospherically, never constraining action, so the cap stays 8.8. Spatial tracking is clean; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tunnel, hum, and glass harmonica create a textured soundscape that supports the haunting tone; however, no detail ever constrains a choice or charges the final image. Sensory specificity is vivid but decorative; it never feeds back into character stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Jetty-at-twilight is vividly sensory, filtering flora and waterlight through archivist’s cataloguing gaze. Blooms seem to react to her presence—an effective micro-setting that mirrors interior shift. Spatial anchors hold; weather and distance affect pacing. Yet environment never constrains her literal path or tactics; hence vivid but not choice-shaping, keeping it below 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.1)
    Ivy-choked station is sketched in economical, sensory strokes that mirror decay→growth. Spatial choreography stays clean despite crowd expansion. Micro-setting absent—no tool or body part constrains choice—so 9-band gate fails. Still, the environment actively hosts the action rather than decorating it.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ultrasonic forest is more than backdrop—soundscape directs footsteps and narrows perception to immediacies. Platinum ring re-appears in three tactile beats and charges the final image with blue light; it functions as micro-setting. Spatial choreography is clean: trees lean, air thickens, distances track. Weather and time-of-night evolve with emotional pitch; no static cataloging. The 9+ gate is met: recurring object constrains final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Gravitational anomaly functions as micro-setting: it thickens air, modulates cosmic whispers, and literally lets ink rewrite reality—its rules are learned through Aria’s body and pen, not exposition. Sensory triage is POV-driven; the fountain pen’s materiality (dried, exotic nib) anchors tactile specificity. Final image of anomaly-as-sanctuary recharges the opening “fragile spider-web” line.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.9)
    The luminous harbor is atmospherically vivid—“moonlight,” “lapping waves,” “gleaming lens”—but setting never constrains action or tools; it’s decorative rather than tactical. Micro-setting of the camera succeeds: its vacant film chamber becomes the conceptual pivot that charges the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting. Spatial choreography stays lucid throughout the silent duet.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.1)
    Parchment scent, fluorescent eeriness, and the tapestry’s “subtle smile” are selective, POV-filtered details that constrain perception and echo in the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean; the archive’s corridors guide slow discovery without tourist excess. The environmental cues mirror internal stakes (dust = forgetting; smile = promise) and evolve as Elian’s trail alters the space, satisfying the 9+ gate for charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sound-wave garden is not backdrop; its metallic petals vibrate under Aria’s taps, guiding her tempo and literally amplifying the lagoon’s response. Sensory selection stays narrow—sound and light dominate—mirroring her narrowed attention under treatment. Spatial choreography is clean: she “steps down from the perch” and the garden’s whisper trails her exit, tying the micro-setting to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.8)
    The container maze is vividly sensory—salt-rust smell, flickering lights, looming shadows—and the port infrastructure is sketched with economical specificity. Spatial choreography is clean; compass watch spin and echoing footsteps tether us in space. However, no environmental detail ever constrains her choices or charges the final image; the setting never turns from backdrop to pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cobalt dock, wet planks, ozone, and shutter lattice are sharply sensed and filtered through a single gaze. Micro-setting (mirror surface, lattice shadow) directly charges the final image, meeting the 9- gate test. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no continuity errors. Weather affects light and reflection, but not bodily risk or access—hence not quite indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    “Cobalt library,” “scent of old parchment,” “magnetic grotto” supply vivid, sense-specific anchors early. Spatial tracking stays coherent; weather (mist clearing at dawn) mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism. However, setting never constrains a tactical choice—Elian glides from library to grotto to town without obstacle or resource withheld. Final image of mist as “reminder” is abstract, not environmental leverage, capping utility at atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sublittoral fringe is evoked through salt-stung air, bobbing boats, wooden slats vibrating with whale song; selective sensory economy keeps the lens tightly on Kael’s skin and ears. Spatial choreography is flawless: crate, attic, water entry, luminescent path all track. The environment doesn’t merely decorate; the whale’s sonic pressure literally draws her into the sea, re-weighting the final image. One hairline slip: “lunar light” appears without prior moon mention, but the glow transfers cleanly from scrimshaw to sea, so the charge still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    Farmhouse/wind-farm pairing is specific and evolves: turbines first “loom,” later become “mere silhouettes,” mirroring Echo’s internal diminuendo. Overgrown garden and wildflower forage ground the body in tactile motion; dried bouquet functions as micro-setting that constrains the final placement/scrutiny. Sensory hierarchy obeys Echo’s performer eye—sound of blades, faded petal hue—never tourist catalog. One missed chance: weather/turbine noise could have tightened the final silence even more.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    Selective sensory layering (frost-tinged air, crystalline fragments, quartz hum) is filtered through a poet’s perception and keeps momentum. The colonnade functions as micro-setting that charges the final image; the frozen lake canvas constrains her barefoot stance and becomes the literal surface she must cross. Spatial choreography is clean; weather and light evolve with the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    Selective sensory detail—molten glass clink, metal reed patterns—anchors the micro-setting and filters through the painter’s synesthetic bias. The courtyard functions as both glass and garden, constraining the plant-arrangement communication method that charges the ending image. Spatial choreography stays clean; furnaces, plants, and bodies track without drift. No environment-forced tactical cost, so capped below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Laboratory is evoked through scent, glow, and instrument curves; the carbide-lamp lens recurs as micro-setting that charges the final shelf-glint. Spatial choreography stays coherent; environment guides access to sounds. However, no environmental obstacle or resource alters a high-stakes choice, so the 9+ gate is missed.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.8)
    Timeless observatory functions as micro-setting that supplies both tool (starlight) and metaphoric mirror; spatial choreography is clean (bench, curtains, domed glass). Sensory economy favours scent and sight, filtered through artisanal priorities. The curtains’ liquid ripple is a concrete, physics-bending detail that charges the final image. Setting never stalls momentum; it actively guides the illumination tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft is vividly anchored and filtered through the cartomancer’s ritual attention; sensory detail is selective and POV-colored. The measuring tape functions as micro-setting, handled in multiple beats and coiled in pocket at exit, giving tactile continuity. While the loft never constrains a decisive choice, its atmospheric persistence charges the final image enough for high-band entry. Spatial choreography is clean; no weather clichés intrude.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.0)
    The archive is evocatively sketched—saffron veil, luminescent orbs, bronze prism catching twilight—yet these details decorate rather than constrain choice. Spatial anchors are stable, but the pagoda is the only object handled, and even it remains a prop rather than a tool that alters tactics. Sensory specificity is strong, but no environmental feature limits or costs the historian, so the setting never charges the closure image. Micro-setting succeeds; macro-setting stays picturesque backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    The blooming library is evoked with selective synesthesia (parchment scent, floating shelves, cloud sea) and the river stone micro-setting constrains her grip, anchoring attention. Spatial choreography stays stable; environment mirrors interior states without overt symbol overload. One lapse: “cloud-soft floor” is briefly unclear in materiality, but it never distorts choice. The final image of the glowing library recharges the stake, meeting the 9+ gate for setting-charged closure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Misty workshop and starlight are not postcard backdrop; they seep into Lena’s skin and tools, constraining visibility and pacing her slow reconstruction. The chameleon perch becomes a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—handler’s fingers read humidity, not tourist sky. One minor gap: we never learn enclosure layout enough to track her movement cost, but the mist abstracts space deliberately, so the atmospheric logic holds.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Tower, mist, damp earth, and glowing plants are vividly sketched through Elian’s biased attention; sensory hierarchy favors scent and texture. Spatial choreography is clean—descent, tunnel, chamber—tracking body and tool. The frosted hourglass recurs and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. A half-point dock for occasional perfume-adjacent phrasing (“meteor hush,” “boundless sea”) that edges toward atmospheric filler rather than choice-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    The projection booth is vividly sensory—celluloid scent, dust motes, flickering frames—and every detail is filtered through the gazer’s vocation. Spatial choreography stays coherent as the letters swirl and the gazer stands, sits, exits. The vintage cinema idiom is accurate without exposition dump. What keeps it from the 9-band is that the setting never actively constrains a decision; it’s atmosphere, not pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    Aurora-lit archway and astrolabe supply tactile, luminous specificity; sensory hierarchy skews visual but stays POV-filtered. Micro-setting works: the astrolabe’s “intricate carvings” act as tactile anchor and symbolic key. Environment never actively constrains her physically—no cold, wind, or fatigue—so stakes remain metaphorical. Final image of stardust trail is vivid but doesn’t alter her next move; setting decorates rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    The glowing dune is atmospherically rich—sand that shimmers underfoot, flora that blooms in radioactive color—and every descriptor is filtered through Asa’s freight-guard gaze, never touristic. The chess clock’s frozen hands, half-buried then resurrected, functions as micro-setting that directly charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: ridge-crest kneel, grains brushed away, ticking synced to heartbeat. Environment never constrains a tactical choice, only mirrors mood, so it hovers just below the 8+ gate that demands choice-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    Steel trees, wire canopy, and machine-whir give a vivid, selective sensory palette; sound hierarchy mirrors mental drift. Micro-setting works: the gear’s tactile chill and metallic scent anchor POV. Spatial choreography is thin—no distances, obstacles, or body shifts—but at this length the body-as-setting and gear-as-prop satisfy. Environment never actively constrains choice, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    The veiled ridgeway and shoreline lullaby are evocatively textured, filtering perception through Eira’s staff and stamping ritual. Micro-setting works: the staff’s etched symbols and star stamp act as tactile anchors. Environment steers mood, but never narrows choice or supplies hazard that alters path.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Selective sensory triad—cold cobalt walls, dusty step, falling snow—mirrors interior hush without tourist clutter. Micro-setting: the discoloration on the stair functions as compass; it is traced, not touched, but still guides attention and supplies the story’s only kinetic image. Fortress and snow serve as insulating shell whose price the bellhop must parse; setting subtly enables the final revaluation of silence. Atmospheric economy meets 9+ gate; only the bolt’s physics stay off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Library is evocatively textured—candles, parchment, iron-gall scent—yet remains a backdrop; no shelf, aisle, or book constrains Kael’s choices. The “rune of drift” is named but never localizes into any physical object or spatial limit. Micro-setting (ink pellet, box) is handled twice and visually reappears at the end, earning partial closure charge. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Meets 9+ gate for charged object, but environment itself is decorative rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    The station, drum-skin, and yellowed atlas are tactile, lived-in objects that constrain action: she can’t map without the page, can’t think without the drum. Sensory selection skews visual, but the salt-tang and beep-rhythm anchor the body in place. Spatial choreography is steady; no impossible moves. The reef is kept off-stage, which is economical, yet the micro-setting of desk, logbooks, and drumskin suffices to charge the final image of the missing coastline.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.1)
    Spaceport bay’s rusted hulks, cold metal floor, and grimy windows are tactile and POV-filtered; the bay later flips from graveyard to runway in the closing beat. Mountain stone circle is rendered through vibration rather than postcard visuals. Opera glasses act as micro-setting: their “intricate patterns reflecting…her renewed spirit” charge the final image. One slip—“the air thickened with an almost palpable energy” drifts toward vague intensifier, not sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    Volcanic springs act as micro-setting: steam keeps visibility low, sulfur stings nostrils, hot water forces her to probe gingerly for the glowing orb. The kite tail’s fabric, once decoded, becomes a tool that literally rewrites her tactical path. Sensory selection stays inside POV—she notices quivering leaves, not tourist vistas—and the final image of the orb’s warm light refracts back to the earth-core heat, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sea-cliff arboretum is sensuously particular; wind-warped trees mirror her psyche without overt symbol. The photograph and “pearl of stillness” act as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial coherence holds as she walks the single path to the cliff edge. Environment constrains perception—salt air narrowed to breath, final orange glow—meeting 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Library-lighthouse fusion is vivid, selective, sustained. Dust, leather, beam are filtered through artist’s eye and return in the closure image. Micro-setting (box fibers) functions as setting extension and constrains the manual redesign act. Would need one tactile choice altered by spatial layout to breach 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.0)
    Wind-carved rock, drone shimmer, and eclipse after-light are filtered through Kael’s tracker gaze; every detail is selective, never catalogued. The ridge edge functions as micro-setting that literally frames the final image. Environment constrains no tactical choice here, so the 9+ gate is missed, but sensory economy is exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.9)
    The “echoing library under snow” is more than wallpaper: the hush amplifies her trespass, snowflakes tick like countdowns against glass. The cryogenic pods function as both setting and tool—she handles gel, labels, thaw controls—so environment constrains action. Spatial choreography is flawless; we track her glove, pod, screen in continuous motion. The final image of snow continuing to fall recharges the opening mood, turning white quiet into a veil that now hides digital shrapnel.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.9)
    Glass-dome farm, airship wreck, and pink rose in scrap ballast are tactile, sensory, and return in the final image—satisfying the 9+ gate for micro-setting that constrains choice. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single continuous scene. Light, scent, and heat differentiate beats; the dome’s filtered sun mirrors Aria’s filtered life. Only lapse: “tower’s collapse” remains a hazy off-stage landmark; its rubble never intrudes the dome, so external desolation is asserted, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sound-wave garden is evoked through motion (“whispering grasses,” “ground beneath her feet begin to vibrate”) rather than static postcard. The rail spike and constellations function as micro-setting extensions that mirror internal frequency; they constrain attention rather than space, fitting the lyric mode. Sensory hierarchy stays tight: hum > sight > touch, always filtered through the fisher’s tuning ear. Spatial choreography is intentionally dream-blurred, but bodies/props never drift or contradict.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.0)
    The observatory-above-clouds locale is economically sketched through drifting mist and cool air; altitude stays consistent and cues Adelaide’s仰头 scan. The pen nib functions as micro-setting: its rosewood warmth is tactile and re-appears in the final image, charging closure. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. However, environment never actively constrains her choices (exit is always open), so the 9-band gate is missed.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Laboratory, antique dresser, amber, cord, and meteor hush all constrain choice or charge the final image. The dresser delivers the letters that tilt her stance; the cord literally tethers her to present time; the amber’s insect stirs as reality thins. Sensory economy is strong—sandalwood, myrrh, flicker of candles—filtered through her professional eye for carved stories. Spatial choreography is clean: dresser corner, whirring machinery, wrist-wrapped cord all track.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Whispering grotto is more atmosphere than concrete constraint, yet the tile flake micro-setting charges the ending via warmth talisman. Sensory hierarchy favors sound (whispers, susurrus) over visual, matching POV bias toward listening. Spatial choreography is clean: flake drifts, mist curls, artist remains cross-legged. Setting evolves causally—mist recedes only after mandala completes—so environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.1)
    Ancient plaza, shattered sky, and the tessera itself function as micro-setting that constrains her choice to rename rather than rebuild. Chipped stepping stone is tactile anchor for the retrocognitive beat. Sensory hierarchy服从Aria’s grief-filter: colour fragments blaze against ash. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from rubble heap to stone centre.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orchard-maze imagery is lush, synesthetic and consistently filtered through Echo’s perception; the coin’s glint and shifting trees supply micro-setting pressure. Spatial clarity wavers only once when “paths and trees” rearrange without anchoring Echo’s body relative to the coin.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    The studio is sketched with purposeful economy: linseed oil and turpentine anchor olfactory memory, static shock provides tactile immediacy, and the geode sliver functions as micro-setting that literally refracts the light beams she paints with. Spatial choreography is clean—body traces patterns between light sources—and the environment evolves as the glow intensifies. No extraneous brand lists or tourist catalog. The light-painting tech remains plausible without over-exposition. Strong gate pass: the geode-as-tool directly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cave topology, scent of salt, and bioluminescent blooms are filtered through an explorer’s selective eye; details guide proximity and mood rather than pausing for catalog. The elm fossil acts as micro-setting, handled twice to bridge past/present, qualifying for the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean through narrow squeeze to cavern. Some fungal imagery edges toward prettiness without new pressure, holding the score sub-8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.1)
    Amber warehouse, cliffs, hourglasses, and canyon-echo jar are vividly sensed (scent of aged wood, harp-string hum) and filter through turner’s artisan POV. Micro-setting objects—buttons, jars—constrain the cataloging method and are handled repeatedly, charging the final “beacon of shared wisdom” image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Environment directly shapes the turner’s tactile work, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mist, snow, wet-earth scent, and skeletal branches are filtered through burn-scarred perception; environment is used as micro-setting that guides her search pattern and ultimately unveils the mirror-self. The pillbox acts as portable setting-in-pocket, its engraved surface a tactile constraint each time fingers tighten. Weather never stalls plot; instead the clearing mist literally reveals the final image, fusing atmosphere to closure. One minor over-lingering on “silver hush” repeats four times, keeping it just under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    Fog-bound ferry is economically anchored by sensory selects—dripping canopy, lapping hull, scent of rot—filtered through coachman’s practiced ear. Spatial choreography is immaculate: horses, needle, gutters, shoreline all track without drift. Weather and tool (yarn needle) constrain attention and rhythm, charging the final image. Micro-setting (needle in hand) doubles as emotional barometer, meeting the 9+ gate for environment-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    The oasis is sketched with economical, multi-sensory strokes—cracked earth, old-wax perfume, flattening smoke—each filtering through Akira’s potter-eye for texture. The lantern glass earns micro-setting status: handled twice, its curved light guides the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Harbor moonlight, steel fire-escape lattice, and salt-air oar-sound interweave with tactile action—gardener’s knees against iron, tooth’s ridges in palm. Micro-setting (rosebush, bit-gauge tooth) doubles as constraint: pruning triggers reflection, tooth cues memory; both return in final guardian image. Sensory selection mirrors POV bias—professional gardener notices petal-drop before city noise. No environmental detail stalls momentum; each stroke of light or water advances the accumulating hush.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.1)
    Tidal library, brass sundial, and stone-circle hum are specific, sensory, and return in the final image, charging closure. Micro-setting (sundial’s atomically reflective face) literally mirrors Lyra’s shifting stance, constraining her attention and thus her choice. Spatial choreography is seamless; no geography drift. Atmospheric detail is selective, filtered through her keeper-bias; economy over breadth.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lotus-temple/lily-pond dyad functions as micro-setting: its mirrored surface and tiered petals constrain her to water-edge contemplation and later supply the reflective canvas for the light installation. The thrush-nest twig is handled twice, becoming a portable shard of the habitat she fuses into art. Scent and water-sound narrow to the hush before reveal, charging the final poise. Spatial choreography stays crisp—no impossible drift from bush to plaza.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.7)
    The radio station is rendered through tactile console glow, dial clicks, and the low thrumming hum that vibrates in the body, satisfying the micro-setting gate. Astronomical charts re-appear with reweighted meaning after the signal succeeds, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: Lyra at controls, colleagues behind, static hiss shifting to hum, no impossible positions. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional filter—frequencies first, visual star-field last—so detail is selective rather than catalogic.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory triage favors sound and texture—organ vibration, damp earth, rusted hinges—over visual clutter. Setting guides only one choice: music draws her to door; otherwise tunnels serve as atmospheric wrapper, not tactical constraint. Crystal-as-micro-setting charges final image. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible moves. Starlight pour is lovely but decorative, not choice-altering.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.1)
    Quarry mist and dripping water create tactile micro-setting; ribbon fragment reprises as charged object in final image, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean—single location, bodies track believably. Sensory hierarchy favors visual haze; other senses under-used.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Weather-station dome, copper nail, and yellowed journals anchor every beat; nail’s evolving tactile states charge the final image. Selective sensory triage—humming systems, spongey air—mirrors narrowing attention. Spatial choreography stable in single-room frame. No occupational depth requested; environment felt, not explained.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mountain pullout is sketched in atmospheric strokes—mist, breeze, scaffold-wrap folds—economy that favors mood over map. The wet-plate flake earns micro-setting status: handled, clutched, made to glow, it charges the final image. Spatial choreography is loose (the fiddler simply “packs up” and “walks down”) but never breaks. Sensory hierarchy favors the visual and aural, appropriate to a musician’s gaze, keeping the ground steady for the lyric flight.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Circus train micro-details (lion-den outline, creaking doors, spider silk) are filtered through Kael’s robber-heir gaze and constrain his pacing; money bundle functions as portable setting that charges the final image. Sensory economy is strong—smell of decay, rust grit under fingers—never catalogued. Spatial choreography holds as he moves car to car. Missing 9+ gate because no object/place forces a tactical shift that forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dome, star-chart desk, and telegram create a tight micro-setting that constrains Lyra’s attention and progressively narrows to the single beam of dawn. Sensory selection is biased toward sight and parchment smell, plausible for an astronomer-archivist. The observatory’s transparent roof and archive patterns are re-invoked at the end, giving the setting charge in the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean; no credibility errors, but environment never actively resists her, so stakes remain atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.3)
    Micro-setting succeeds: spongy ground, writhing branches, and pulsating seed create tactile pressure that guides cautious footwork. “Swirling orchard vortex” and “cursed lake” remain atmospheric placeholders—no rule, distance, or resource is extracted from them to shape tactics. Frozen tree-trunk functions as a localized prop that crystallizes the confession concept, satisfying the 9+ gate by charging the final image. Sensory balance favors visual; scent of “blooming flowers and decay” is the single non-visual cue that recurs, giving the grove a memorably contradictory perfume.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.1)
    “Cobalt glade,” “damp earth,” and “blooming wildflowers” are sharply filtered through Aria’s attention, anchoring atmosphere. The topiary’s shifting shadows supply micro-setting pressure that guides her inward. However, the environment never actively resists or limit her—no torn sleeve, no dead-end thorn—so stakes remain atmospheric rather than tactical. Sensory specificity is strong; causal constraint is missing.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    Catacomb orchard is vividly textured—roots “snaked between ancient bones,” air “morbid perfume”—and every descriptor is filtered through the idealist’s macabre hope. Micro-setting of the burned tarot card constrains the midpoint choice and recurs as talisman in closure, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; light from corridors tracks consistently. Economy slips once with “blooming flowers” scent overlay, a sentimental addition that dulls the gothic sting.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    Quarry office trailer, rock-dust smell, and the scrap of grille cloth function as micro-setting: the cloth is handled twice and finally stored, giving the closing beat its tactile echo. Light across the valley mirrors emotional shift without overt symbol. Spatial choreography is clean; no credibility errors. Professional antique detail is light but sufficient for frame.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.1)
    Magnetic arbor and mist are sensuously sketched and return as charged image in the last line; seed-as-micro-setting is tracked by its glow-state. Early spatial anchor delivered; only cap is that the environment never actively constrains her body or tactics—she never trips, drops, or orients by it—so 9-band gate not met.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.3)
    Tidal atrium rendered with sensory economy: salt-lap, wicker-scent, moonlight on water. Environment mirrors internal flux without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography simple—librarian alone—so no tracking issues. The creel and moonlight return in final image, supplying micro-setting constraint for 9-band, but they don’t alter tactics, capping at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    Crystal-cave imagery is vivid and filtered through Aria’s awe; however, the environment never constrains her movement, supplies tools, or charges the final image. Spatial grounding is one-directional (“deeper into the caves”) without tactile interaction beyond walking. Pearl and shell function as micro-settings but remain symbolic props rather than choice-limiting objects.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ivy-strangled platform, flaking timetables, damp-earth smell, and reedy accordion timbre compose a seamless multisensory capsule. Selective detail—patched tape, crumbling mortar, lapping water—mirrors the “mended yet broken” theme without overt symbolism. Environment offers no tactical constraint (no train to catch, no timetable to miss); hence capped at 8.0. Still, the station’s reclamation by vegetation subtly pressures Elara’s decision to relinquish stasis and keep walking.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glowing library is atmospherically rich: parchment-sweet air, soft luminescence, mist that mirrors thought—all filtered through the dreamer’s late-night attention. Sensory selection is biased toward the visual and haptic, but variety is sacrificed (scant sound, smell beyond the opening). Spatial choreography is vague—shelves are “high,” paths “winding,” yet distances remain unmeasured, so the body’s movement never risks collision or fatigue. The watch serves as micro-setting and recurs, but its reflective face is described more than used, preventing it from constraining a final choice and capping entry below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.1)
    Velvet observatory anchors every beat; scent of orchids, automated hum, and twilight color weave through action. Ice-crystal violin is handled twice—held, then clutched—charging the final image. Micro-setting succeeds: the orchid she strokes literally answers back, constraining her telepathic habit and timing her exit.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    The skyborne grotto’s crystal lattice and auroral palette are filtered through Aria’s mortician eye for refracted light, constraining her pattern-finding method and charging the final emerald glow. Selective sensory hierarchy (sight, haptic polish, white-noise memory) keeps description lean; spatial choreography stays clean in a single-scene window. Environment directly shapes the stakes—without the aerial aurora the infusion fails—meeting the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    Grotto and cloud-scalloping supply tactile, filtered detail early; the micro-setting of tree branches later anchors thought. Sensory selection stays light but purposeful, mirroring calm rather than crisis. The environment never actively constrains choice or supplies hazard; it serves as mood wallpaper. Still, spatial logic holds and the recurring “vineyard hush” sonic layer threads atmosphere cleanly to the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lighthouse, breeze, and chimes supply tactile micro-setting and the mirror shard functions as portable setting/object; together they create a consistent atmospheric filter. Spatial choreography is minimal—no body movement beyond ascending/descending stairs—so environment never constrains a choice. Detail is selective and POV-colored, but nothing in the setting actively shapes tactics or charges the final image beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.3)
    Floating platform, sycamore hush, and magnetic grotto are sketched with restrained sensory triangulation; the grotto’s “thin fabric” is the only detail that later charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean—bodies remain stationary, no impossible moves. Environment never actively constrains the lesson (no wind shifts, no rock tilt), so the setting decorates rather than pressures; capped below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    “Towers of bone” and “endless echoes” are vivid, specific anchors that double asmicro-setting objects constraining the skimmer’s stillness; the vibrating stone beneath its base literally guides its immobile navigation method. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—stone, wind, tremor—rather than tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography is static by design, so no drift occurs. The canyon’s sonic and tactile properties charge the final synced pulse, meeting the 9+ gate for environment-shaping closure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.7)
    Spire and garden are vividly sensory—ice-rimed carvings, star-like flowers, keystone glow—yet detail is front-loaded; spatial anchoring is clear by word 80. The setting constrains only via wonder; it never imposes cold, oxygen debt, or social surveillance. Micro-setting (keystone) charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate, but environment remains backdrop rather than tactical obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.1)
    Salt-air, rotting hull, lantern reflections—details are selective and POV-filtered. The sunken-library locale works as an atmospheric engine, but it never constrains action (no drowning risk, no spatial trap). Lantern sea at the end recharges the visual motif; micro-setting (book, key tag) handled in motion. Lacks a 9+ gate because no object or setting feature alters tactics or exacts price.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ambered deck, coins’ metallic scent, and starlight tang are selective and atmospheric. “Ambered” as both visual filter and emotional register cleverly fuses setting with tone. Spatial grounding stays minimal—no body-to-railing or telescope detail—so environment informs mood rather than choice.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ancient observatory at dusk is sketched through selective sensory filters—“warm orange glow… worn stone balcony… scent of old stone”—that mirror the reaper’s fatigue. Spatial anchors remain steady; the balcony, archives, and horizon line track without drift. The atlas page becomes a micro-setting that constrains attention, its serpent illustration steering the crystallization spell. Weather and light evolve causally with the scene’s emotional cadence, charging the final dissipation.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sapphire viaduct, salt air, and dawn hues are selective and POV-colored, not tourist inventory. The bell’s cracked lip and the dropper’s measured cadence function as micro-setting that directly constrains the ritual. Spatial choreography is clean: bell, dropper, mage, and light remain tracked. The final image of deepening sapphire charges the closure without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Reservoir-mud town, creaking sign, child’s toy: selective, tactile, and filtered through warden’s documentary gaze. Sapphire label returns as micro-object that charges the final hush. Spatial logic clean; no geography drift. Meets 9+ gate: label constrains emotional focus and reappears in the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.3)
    Setting is the story’s muscle: kaleidoscopic waterfall, tangled chromatic trees, and crystal-scented air constrain every beat. The orchard’s sensory overload narrows Elara’s attention to starling patterns, making environment the engine of discovery. Spatial choreography stays clean; no floating rooms. Micro-setting (the crystal in her palm) literally charges the final image—its glow re-illuminates the orchard—meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.0)
    “Nocturnal arbor” and “whisper-thin wires” are handled physically—she steps, revises, balances—so the micro-setting constrains every move. Parachute buckle functions as portable setting/object that charges final image. Cloud-sea at dawn supplies tonal contrast that reweights solitude. Sensory economy favors touch & sight filtered through astronomer bias.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    The floating rock dojo is sketched with economy—levitation hum, isolation, shelf with jar—anchoring who/where by sentence three. Sensory fidelity is narrow and POV-true: Kaito notices only what challenges his self-concept. The jar’s recurrence recharges the final image, passing the 9+ gate for micro-setting. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions or white-room gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    The nocturnal brook haven is sketched with selective sensory strokes—moon-dappled floor, water over stones—and these details mirror her shifting attention rather than stall momentum. The seed as micro-setting absorbs light and later absorbs her imagination, constraining her focus and ultimately charging the final desk image. Spatial choreography is minimal but clean; no impossible moves. Environment stays subordinate to interiority, yet its atmospheric pressure sustains the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    The echo chamber tunnel is the real protagonist: its acoustic properties shape every beat, from roar to whisper to laughter. Spatial choreography is clean; the leaf blower’s sound physically macerates silence, making the setting an active antagonist. The pull-cord handle, though small, is tactile and recurs with wear visible, satisfying micro-setting rule.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    Frozen garden, statues, pendant, and fog function as micro-setting: the statues’ shifting expressions and the pendant’s answering pulse tether the metaphysical turn to concrete objects. Sensory detail is selective—smell of decay, lunar glow—filtered through the guardian’s melancholy gaze. Environment never constrains physical choice, but the pendant’s glow charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.9)
    “Ember nexus at twilight” is rendered with sensory economy: sulfur stench, scorched earth, frozen-bloom light. The setting functions micro-scopically—heat shimmer, charred debris—rather than a mapped space, but it constrains action by its very volatility. The crozier fragments serve as proxy setting, their jagged edges guiding the alchemist’s hand movements. No spatial contradictions, and the evolving light cues emotional tempo, so the environment earns its keep in the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    City-over-gorge is vivid in one brushstroke; radio towers supply sonic texture. Yet the towers never constrain movement or supply hazard; they serve as mood furniture. The Hollywood fragment earns micro-setting status by re-appearing at closure, giving it 9-gate credit. Ozone-and-decay is sensory but static; no environmental detail later alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    “Spectral grotto under starlight” is vividly sketched through Elara’s biased, nautical attention—dripping water, mineral glint, ferry-deck echoes—anchoring who/where/when by line 10. Details filter her professional eye and quietly mirror her wonder, but the grotto never constrains a later choice; it’s postcard, not pivot, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.7)
    Gallery anchors every beat; mirrored walls and pulsing thread supply instant sensory filter and micro-setting. Selective detail—“old glass,” “soft hum,” “kaleidoscope turning”—keeps exposition lean and mood forward. The thread as handled prop constrains her final stance, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is lightly tracked; no impossible moves, but no tight body-to-body pressure either.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    “Benthic city,” “abyssal plain,” and silt-sunk anchor create a tactile micro-setting that physically limits movement and echoes the theme of submerged past. Selective sensory focus—twilight indigo, half-buried iron—keeps description lean while the perpetual dusk subtly mirrors Lyra’s solemn marvel. Spatial choreography is clear across the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mist, twilight, and marble atrium are filtered through Aria’s practiced eye; the hearing aid’s static hum replaces visual detail with a tactile, proprioceptive anchor that guides movement. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: only the pulse and the woman’s tears are admitted. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible positions. The final image (mist closing like a veil) recharges the opening mood, satisfying the 9+ gate for micro-setting that constrains the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.1)
    Seafloor facility, anemones, coral, tidal flow—vivid, selective, filtered by Lyra’s caving eye for constricted spaces. “Crashing hush” sonic motif returns to charge the final image. Gold fleck and logbook act as micro-settings that gate progress. No object or body state reconfigures the final beat, so 9-band gate not cleared.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    Opal observatory under fresh snow is micro-set as both sanctuary and lens; snow depth subtly increases alongside ghost definition, mirroring interior focus. Porcelain shard becomes portable micro-setting whose glow charges final image. Spatial choreography is minimal but coherent; weather choice is fresh rather than seasonal cliché. Detail economy is high: every flake and ink swirl is filtered through grief-attuned perception.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is the protagonist. The bone towers, copper veins, and kinetic bird-shadows are not backdrop but the very material the storyteller transliterates into sound; every sensory note is filtered through his perceptual bias toward echo and fracture. Spatial choreography is lyrically coherent—birds cast shadows that “dance across the towers,” tethering flight to geology. The canyon’s acoustic properties directly constrain the tactic of translation, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    The underground garden is vividly rendered through damp-earth scent, moss stone, and spatial descent; details are filtered via Lena’s researcher attention. Micro-setting works: the cordless phone on stone anchors the static-confession beat, constraining her to listen in place. Sensory selection narrows perceptually—static, scent, resonance—mirroring her metamorphose. While environment does not charge the final image, it supplies the mnemonic palate that lets the harmony untamed feel embodied rather than abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orchard is sketched with glittering trees, stardust flowers—visually specific. Living statues supply active pressure and spatial grounding. The sky-bridge and locust shell serve as micro-settings that re-appear in the final glow, earning the 9+ gate. Could constrain choices more, but imagery is selective and thematically coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.8)
    “Cobalt arcade” and “smuggling drone border” are evocative place tags; neon against twilight gives immediate visual texture. Micro-setting works: bottle-as-storm object becomes the tactile pivot. Spatial track stays clean—no impossible drone moves or teleporting props. The world never constrains a later tactic, so it falls short of 9+ gating requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.3)
    Abandoned train and misting hush are atmospherically rich; sensory detail filters through carpenter’s selective attention. Micro-setting (lantern-lit workbench, pool reflection) constrains attention and mirrors internal calm. No environment-derived obstacle or tool failure shapes tactics, so 9+ gate fails. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    Archipelago is evoked through selective synesthetic cues—whisper, hush, lap, shimmer—rather than mapped geography; watercolor palette and camera serve as micro-settings that constrain every action. Light as both medium and environment reweights the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate; even so, broader place mechanics (tides, season, hazard) stay peripheral, capping at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    “Shadowed nexus under starlight” and the gnarled tree create a tactile, filtered geography that guides the locksmith’s gaze and hand. Sensory selection is POV-driven, not touristic. The ribbon and hair function as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture; without them, the last image collapses, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.0)
    The sunken greenhouse–orchard ringed by shipwrecks is not postcard scenery; it dictates movement (knee-deep water, silted hides) and supplies the mushroom that catalyzes the quest. Sensory hierarchy is folklorist-specific: scent of rot first, then visual constellations, then fungal bioluminescence. Spatial choreography remains coherent; no impossible positions. The setting’s decayed fruit–perfume returns in the final “crisp nostalgia,” satisfying the 9+ gate by charging the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dust motes, creaking shelves, and the swinging playground seat outside create a layered auditory/visual web that mirrors the internal hush; the empty swing becomes a micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered (archivist notices faint tea tang, old-book scent) and stays integral to mood. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible object drift. Lacks a 9+ gate because no environmental detail literally constrains the final annotation choice.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sensory detail is vivid—golden light, roaring falls, sweet scent—and filtered through Aria’s rapt attention. The waterfall shifts from backdrop to “shimmering veil,” a micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial grounding is loose (no body position relative to the falls), but at this lyric length the parapet functions as emblematic space. The environment does not constrain action; it mirrors mood, satisfying micro-setting allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prism sanctuary is micro-setting that supplies shifting starlight spectra; these colors literally color her hands and the needle, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean; bodies and orbits track. The net functions as secondary micro-setting whose knots constrain every motion. Sensory selection favors sight, but it’s purposeful and mirrored in internal state. Enough specificity to pass the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    Rain-scoured vault, mold scent, and stone wear are vivid, selective, and filtered through cartographer priorities. The henge and map-tear spot function as micro-setting that guides her attention and frames the closure image. No object or body-part constrains a final choice, so 9-band gate fails. High but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sunken library is not backdrop but epistemic terrain: bioluminescent fish act as desk-lamps, salt rots pages Eli must wade through, pressure dictates slow motion. Micro-setting also applies—the snow-globe’s miniature lighthouse migrates from intact wonder to empty shell, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean: distance from surface, debris underfoot, mirror shard angle all track. One slip: “soft glow” and “dusty tomes” flirt with tourist-catalog diction, but the POV filters them through scientific awe, keeping the hit sub-critical.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mist, wet stone, ozone, and the bolt-plate micro-setting are re-used tactile anchors; the bench surface becomes the working canvas, so environment literally constrains the only possible tactic—charcoal graffiti. Sensory selection narrows to touch and smell under storm urgency, mirroring her narrowing bandwidth between human and code. Final image charges the plate and mural as paired objects now encoded with shared memory, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.1)
    Icebound spire, elevator frost, and scattered-light tool are viscerally selective: frost patterns and etched walls guide Elara’s decryption method and charge the final shrine glow. Spatial choreography is clean—ten-floor ascent, corridor walk, door push—without white-room drift. The goggles function as micro-setting; their gleam reweights meaning at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Gondola, telescope, and sky function as micro-setting; the brass telescope re-appears as the charged final image, constraining Lyra’s stance. Selective sensory detail (“quietly explosive power”) mirrors internal weather without cataloguing. Spatial choreography is clean; no credibility errors. Environment subtly guides her choice to keep watching, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tree-trunk library is not wallpaper: its hollowed shelves, musty air, and filtered light literally shape what can be seen and saved. The coin’s micro-topography functions as portable setting/body hybrid that guides the final brushstrokes, constraining the last possible mark. Spatial choreography holds as the artist steps back, bag slung, machines outside. One slip: “the city’s relentless march” is generic; the rest is specific and tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.7)
    Airship cabin is sketched with tactile relics—hopscotch board, charts, phrasebook—that integrate into Eli’s process; starling murmuration outside supplies atmospheric motion but never constrains action or timing. Sensory range is narrow (mostly visual) and the world rules remain generic steampunk; specificity is adequate but not choice-limiting.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    Frozen library above clouds is vivid and selective: frost-encrusted doors, icy sagging shelves, moon-bright bindings; each detail filters through Kael’s artisan eye. Spatial choreography is clean—one continuous walk to corner → door → hall. The gear décor on the glass door literally bars entry until decoded, so setting constrains choice and charges closure. No sensory overload; every image either world-builds or pressures the next move.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.5)
    Floating rock arches, nebula light, and butterfly petals supply vivid postcards, yet none constrains a settler choice or charges the final image; the garden bell comes closest but is only sounded, not wielded. Spatial grounding stays impressionistic—settlers “beneath” arches, chalk “on” sidewalks—without tactile interaction. The result is decorative specificity that never turns into dramatic leverage.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lighthouse glass operates as micro-setting: its amplifying hush literally warps sound and choice, constraining the adjuster to near-silent gestures. Dusk’s fading light is tracked beat-by-beat, dictating tempo of the final calibration. Pane and puppet return as charged objects, the cracked porcelain re-illuminating the glass flaws in the last image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions as the adjuster circles the lantern room.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sensory selection is tight: dust-smell, stone echo, soft thud of nut. The orchard is sketched through action—overgrown paths, jagged stones—rather than catalog. Mechanical birds supply a succinct speculative texture. No single detail constrains her choice, so the 9+ gate is missed, but atmosphere never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.0)
    Ravine, foam, and chrysalis are rendered with selective sensory strokes that mirror Maria’s scientific gaze. Braided channels metaphor is repeated enough to charge the ending image. Micro-setting qualifies: the chrysalis constrains her metaphorical reading and returns in the final sentence. No spatial drift; setting stays tactiley present without checklist overload.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    Glass orchard library is sensuously tactile—“delicate structures refracting…light,” “glittering crystals”—and directly charges the final image: the living library as the place where stories begin. Cloud-sea and crystal lattice constrain movement and acoustics, explaining the hush that allows her to “hear” the glimmering parole. Selective, POV-filtered detail (bottle’s shifting glow) stays integrated; no exposition dumps. Spatial choreography is immaculate; the bottle, shelf, and cloud horizon remain trackable throughout.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—access to hidden narratives—signals early but stays abstract; pressure is atmospheric (thickening air, slowed clouds) rather than a live option foreclosed. No credible loss or trade-off is risked; the creed is remembered but never truly tested. The sole “tightening” is her decision not to incise, yet this leaves options wider, not narrower. Cost is conceptual, not visceral, so escalation feels gentle rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sandstone, ozone, wet earth, blooming night flowers—selective sensory triangulation keeps the desert breathing. The coral pavilion’s cold glow and the tidal pool star-reflections serve as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: feet sink → pool kneel → pavilion touch. Environment never constrains a tactical choice, so the 9+ gate is missed, but atmosphere is integral to the lyric escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.1)
    Clock tower, silos, and starlight are vividly sensory and filtered through Emilia’s musical ear, creating a consistent atmospheric signature. The micro-setting of the cuckoo weight is returned to at height, but it never constrains action or reweights meaning at closure, keeping the score sub-9. Spatial choreography is clean; we track her climb and stance without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.5)
    Canyon and moonlight are sensuously tracked across the beats; the mirror shard literally refracts the moonlight onto Elara’s hands, charging the final image. Weather and terrain remain static backdrop rather than active constraint—no rockslide, no temperature drop that forces tactics. Micro-setting (the cracked glass as lens) is viscerally handled and ties directly to the closing gleam, satisfying the 9+ gate for “object that charges final image.” Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto’s damp stone, moss scent, and inverted-gravity tug are vivid and selective, filtering through the archivist’s scholarly attention. Threshold effects manifest as “glimpses of hidden patterns,” a useful vagueness that keeps world-rules permeable without breaking. The chamber’s otherworldly tomes finally constrain choice—she must leave when the hour ends—so setting actively shapes the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.1)
    The grove is rendered through living detail—sap-stained fingers, root-level resonance—yet the porcelain insulator is the only object that materially constrains the final choice (it becomes the acoustic kernel). Spatial choreography stays clean across the single continuous scene. Weather and season are elided, but the body/tool micro-setting fulfills the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.1)
    “Magnetic nexus at twilight” supplies charged micro-setting; its energy signature is repeatedly referenced, culminating in the beacon image. Wildflower scent and stone bench are tactile, but remain decorative rather than tactical—no choice is constrained by them. Spatial choreography is minimal yet coherent. The environment’s main work is tonal, not causal, sufficient for lyric short-form.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.9)
    The workshop’s sandalwood, lantern glow, and jasmine scent are filtered through Elara’s synesthetic attention; they act as extensions of her body rather than postcard décor. Micro-setting succeeds: the diary-as-object constrains every beat—its locked state, tactile creak, and eventual glow choreograph the pressure. Starlight and impending fireworks create a living clock that charges the final poise. Spatial tracking is flawless; no prop teleports.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.1)
    Treetop canopy is tactile—bare feet on bark, sap-stained fingers—yet serves mainly as postcard. Micro-setting triumph: seed in palm, wrapping-paper doodles, and final bloom image all constrain choice or charge closure. Sensory hierarchy skewed 80 % scent; visual/tactile under-used at climax. Environment never blocks or enables tactics; thus capped below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    Floating rock arches, gravity-inversion physics, and the iridescent pool create a tactile, non-generic alien orchard. Sensory selection stays filtered through pilot priorities—gravity pull, chlorophyll glow, water-flow cues—so description never becomes catalog. The broken arrow and the pool act as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible ship moves or geography slips.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    Container labyrinth is vividly sensed—rust smell, creaking steel, orange sunset—and filters through investigator’s professional gaze. Spatial choreography clean; wind corridors evolve with container geometry, constraining where she can stand. Micro-setting (patch in gloved hand) stays present but never alters her next move; thus fails 9+ gate. Sunlit exit image is pretty yet doesn’t reconfigure stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ice cavern, crystals, fungi, and aurora bleed are rendered through Elian’s synesthetic filter, turning setting into instrument. The amber sheet’s tactile wear and the sculptor’s poised chisel function as micro-settings that constrain timing. Spatial choreography remains coherent; bodies and distances track. Environment actively modulates the music-silence tension, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sagebrush scent, thunder rumble, and glinting flute metal are selective and POV-filtered; the canyon’s hush becomes a tactile constraint that finally presses on her body. The driftwood markers’ late arrival weakens spatial choreography, but the environment still charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    Workshop is sketched via smell of metal type and “soft glow of luminescent orbs”—tactile and biased to Echo’s lens. Micro-setting rules: the press itself constrains gesture and tension; fragment nestles in a specific slot, not generic. Final image of vanished stars reweights earlier sky-glimpses, satisfying 9+ gate. Missing tool-level accuracy on letterpress mechanics, but irrelevant to stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ridgeway and aurora are rendered with selective, rhythmic detail—“threads of memory and myth”—that charges the final image; the pendant functions as micro-setting whose vibrating state alters social access. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: Eira notices what serves her courier eye. Spatial choreography is airy but coherent; no credibility breaks. Environment does not constrain physical tactics yet reconfigures social possibility, meeting the 9+ gate for charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Quartz arbor, mist, frost on glass, and prism form a micro-setting system that continuously filters perception and steers attention. Sensory selection stays tight: damp earth scent, muted forest hush, prism glint—all serve the hush/veil concept. No spatial contradictions; weather affects visibility and thus interpretive stakes. The frost etchings on the car window are the specific, idiosyncratic anchor that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    Bamboo orchard is filtered through spinner’s wistful attention—rustle = loom click, amber bead = memory capsule—serving accumulative texture. Spatial choreography is stable; no impossible moves. Sensory economy favors scent and filtered light, matching melancholic tone. Setting does not physically constrain tactics; orchard stays backdrop, so gate for 9+ not met.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    Floating rock arches and orchard scent are filtered through the smith’s artisan eye; the silk-as-micro-setting constrains the final forging choice, satisfying the 9+ gate. Mine shafts function as both literal testing ground and metaphorical womb, their darkness heightening tactile perception. Spatial choreography stays coherent—forge window, valley pickaxes, sentinel arches—without white-room drift. Weather is absent but unnecessary; the glowing metal and shifting silk supply the thermal and visual anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rust-stink air, grimy light, and tangled hulks give tactile ruin; the bay later re-appears as charged mirror of her changed gaze. Micro-setting works: the green shard is handled, weighed, re-handled—its glow tracked like a local light-source that alters visibility. Good sensory hierarchy; spatial choreography clean across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lantern room, spiral staircase, and rocky shore are sketched with selective sensory detail; the sea glass functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Weather and spatial choreography remain coherent. Environment does not actively constrain choices—no tide rising, no mechanical failure forcing action—so setting serves atmosphere more than tactical pressure, capping entry to 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.3)
    Micro-setting triumph: the emerald lighthouse interior becomes a vertical crucible—winding stairs, glass beam slicing walls, star-view apex—each stage constrains her lantern angles and bodily posture. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: she notices friction of stone, scent of salt, glare of refracted green light, while the digital world outside is only a flicker—“fleeting digital glimpses.” Weather is not backdrop but collaborator: laughing storm and twinkling stars answer her micro-movements, making atmosphere an active antagonist. Spatial choreography is flawless; lantern, beam, and horizon line track cleanly from base to apex to dawn sky, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The floating tea-house is sketched with spare, sensory strokes; its lantern glow and wooden floor constrain Kaito’s cross-legged stillness and the exact angle of light he needs. Valley-mist and drifting rock remain postcard glimpses, but the wing-as-micro-setting fulfills the 9+ gate: its iridescent surface literally refracts the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless; only the broader world rules (how rocks float, how lanterns stay lit) are withheld, acceptable at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stormlit tower is vividly sketched through sensory selection (damp stone, ozone, wind-driven rain) and filters attention via the worker’s professional gaze. Spatial choreography is loose—how far is the observatory door from the bench?—but not broken. The moon’s silver glow is over-repeated, dulling its final charge. Micro-setting (the sextant’s twisted curves) functions as active object, yet the environment never constrains a choice; the storm merely decorates the ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.7)
    Greenhouse and mica window supply lush sensory detail and refracted light that mirrors mood. However, no environmental feature ever constrains her choices or alters tactics; setting decorates rather than pressures. Final image still benefits from charged specificity of the pulsing window.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Library as “secret society…hidden in plain sight” is vivid, selective, and immediately constrains access; lanterns and musty scent recur to mirror internal shift. The crumpled invitation functions as micro-setting/object that literally changes meaning when handled again at closure. Spatial choreography is stable—chair, shelves, slip of paper—no white-room syndrome. For 9-band it needed to obstruct or enable one concrete tactic; instead it serves mood, not choice.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.5)
    The tea-house-as-micro-setting is vivid, selective, and body-proximal; vines and weathered wood constrain where the noticer can sit and what she touches. Bread functions as recurring object-setting, its vanished-source mystery charging the final conceptual absolution. Specificity is high, but environment never physically tests or blocks her, so setting supports atmosphere more than tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.9)
    “Frozen library above the clouds” is evoked in tactile, crystalline strokes—“quartz hush,” “soft, white peaks”—that mirror the story’s glass-slide motif. Spatial anchoring is swift and sustained; the setting’s cold silence becomes the micro-setting that shapes Elara’s hushed movements. It charges the final image: her disappearance into the same mist that fringes the shelves. No constraint directly alters her tactics, so 9-band gate not met.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    The rotting-pier market is evoked through salt-stink, clinking junk, slit-light geometry; the fob’s glint and the sunrise slats physically charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lavender scent, tin ring, aurora, and bluff edge are vividly filtered through Aria’s science-biased attention, giving the setting a micro-setting charge that doubles as mood.  Spatial choreography is clean: she stands, breathes, walks upslope, reaches out – no impossible positions.  Weather-as-extension-of-person rule is learned through observation, not exposition dump, and it directly motivates her quest.  The final image of lavender-scented darkness reprises the opening scent, supplying a textural bookend that earns its keep under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.8)
    Crystal cave is more than postcard: its luminescence narrows Elara’s palette, its vibrations sync with her heartbeat, guiding stroke tempo. The broken lock’s rust-to-crystal transformation supplies the micro-object that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sight filtered through an artist’s eye—“auroral sorrow” is atmospheric but not clichéd because it is tied to color choice.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.9)
    Greenhouse city, acid mist, orchid vendor, atmospheric processors—details are selective, filtered through Aria’s calligrapher eye. The undercroft’s “scent of decay” mirrors internal rot, but environment never blocks or re-tools her path; it’s atmosphere more than active constraint. Spatial anchors remain coherent across the tunnel descent. Tool/setting fails the 9+ gate because no prop or locale alters her final choice; the chamber is discovered, not negotiated.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.9)
    The bluff above clouds, the kinetic sculpture, and the iceberg fragment form a single charged micro-setting that constrains the final image; their spatial and sensory relations remain coherent. Selective, POV-filtered detail (glistening crystal, rainbow refraction) is woven through action rather than catalogued, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.1)
    Glass dome, roses, smoke, and heat are filtered through Aria’s mechanical perception—precise humidity readings, visual glare—so setting constrains her tactics and mood. The enclosure acts as both pressure-cooker and lens, amplifying the fire she must miniaturize. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. One minor slip: “magnetic north shifts” is stated but never made tactile or consequential to her movements.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.5)
    The courtyard’s “gentle hum” and birds function as postcard backdrop; no spatial constraint or tool alters Emilia’s tactics. The locket acts as micro-setting, but its handling is static—opened once, then shelved—so it never charges the final image under the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.1)
    Salt-and-rust sensory cues are selective; the sunken lab stays a backdrop rather than a constraint, yet the spider-web micro-setting directly charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dock-side harbor, salt-crystal tunnels, and subterranean chamber are sketched with economical, luminescent particulars that refract through the POV’s lantern-trained eye. The crystalline walls act as both setting and micro-setting tool, constraining motion and supplying the final image; this satisfies the 9+ gate even though broader city geography is impressionistic. Sensory hierarchy favors light and salt over sound, mirroring the “gleaming silence” motif without mechanical cycling through all senses.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.1)
    The nocturnal brook haven is vividly rendered through selective sensory filters—scent of blooms, rustle hierarchy, water cadence—each echoing the hush mandate. The crane’s paper fiber and eventual luminescence function as micro-setting, constraining the ritual’s choreography; its final drift charges the closing image. Spatial anchors are stable; no impossible moves. While the world rules remain softly mythic, the environment never pushes back or surprises, so its descriptive richness slightly exceeds its causal influence.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rooftop garden and meteor shower are vividly filtered through the tutor’s biased attention—city hum, flower scent, starlight as pedagogical spotlight. Antique seal functions as micro-setting, handled in multiple beats and charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean; no object drift. Meets 9+ gate: the seal constrains the parting gesture and reweights meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.1)
    “Velvet garden at twilight” is atmospherically vivid and sustained through shifting light. The seashell as micro-setting constrains her hand and attention, charging the final image when it falls silent. Sensory range is narrow (mostly visual and auditory), but selection fits twilight compression. Spatial choreography remains coherent in a single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.0)
    Marble sanctuary, aurora, and dripping stalactites are vivid, selective, and return to charge the final image. The body is micro-setting: thorn-prick blood anchors heritage and risk within the marble frame. Spatial choreography stays clean; candles, desk, key tracked without drift. Environment narrows perception—only parchment scent, rose perfume, candle glow—mirroring the forger’s narrowing focus to the page.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    The serpentine nexus is never mapped, yet its sensory shorthand—“starlight,” “reed-blown melancholy,” “labyrinthine canyons of the soul”—creates a micro-setting inside Aria’s body and shell. Spatial choreography is absent, but the piece teaches an accumulative lyric pattern where external space equals internal resonance; the shell-as-setting constrains her hand and charges the final quiet. For 600–800 words this economy is purposeful; specificity lives in sonic texture rather than geography.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.0)
    Glacial shrine, candle flicker, melting ice scent, and swirling glitter create a tight sensory micro-setting that mirrors internal thaw. Selection favors visual and thermal detail; prose wisely skips tourist catalog. The shrine itself constrains no tactical choice; it is atmosphere, not leverage, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.9)
    Setting is vividly selective: whispering parapet, wet-earth scent, firefly lattice, moon path on water. Each detail is filtered through the philosopher’s attention to subtle maintenance. The bamboo whisk functions as micro-setting/object that constrains her hand and focalizes pattern-hunting. Spatial choreography holds as she moves from parapet to garden to clearing; no floating rooms.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    The wasteland orchard is sketched with vivid, selective strokes: radioactive dust storms, twisted rows, sickly-yellow sunset. Micro-setting (Aria’s scanning gaze, paper under boots) keeps description woven through action. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves. Environment does not yet constrain tactics or tool use, so the 9+ gate is missed, but the atmosphere is cohesive and tonally supportive.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.1)
    The observatory is vividly sketched—stormlight, cobalt glass, cloud sea—yet it never constrains action or charges the final image. Weather is decorative (“tempest raging outside”) rather than tactical; the portico is viewed but never handled, blocking gate 9+. Spatial grounding is adequate, but the setting remains a postcard backdrop rather than a resource that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    Feral loft, dunes, and glass jars supply tactile micro-setting; the music box and jars function as handled tools that steer attention and ultimately charge the closing image. Sensory hierarchy respects poet’s bias—visual dust, auditory captured hum—though scent/temperature could sharpen crisis moment. Spatial choreography stable; no world-rule inconsistency. Environment mirrors inner state without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drift-ice marina is not postcard scenery; the creaking ice underfoot and lighthouse hum constrain every step and tuning decision, culminating in the crystallized sonic match—environment actively shapes tactics and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.7)
    Basalt walls, frozen lake, and humming viaduct are vividly sensed and filtered through the mapper’s cold-attuned attention. Spatial anchors are clear early, but the environment never constrains a tactical choice; the viaduct could be any shiny bridge and the lake any frozen plain. Micro-setting fails the 9+ gate: no tool, body, or recurring object alters the final move.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.8)
    Tunnel micro-setting is vivid and selective: damp-earth reek, flicker on rust, dripping echo. Lantern functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—its glow literally guides the exit beat. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible moves. Weather pivot (drought→rain) externalizes inner thaw without overt symbolism. Professional detail scant but not plot-relevant; meets scope.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    The antique shop is sketched with selective sensory detail—brass glint, grimy windows, soft whir—that filters believably through a clerical eye. The clockwork heart functions as micro-setting, its ticking metering the chaplain’s attention and returning in the final cadence. No object or spatial element actively constrains choice, so the 9+ gate is missed, but atmosphere supports theme without stall.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Acid-sea corrosion, gear grit, and kaleidoscope light shards are vividly filtered through Zephyr’s mechanical gaze, giving the floating workshop a distinctive texture. The environment never physically constrains her movements or tools, so setting stays atmospheric rather than tactical; still, the decay-as-beauty motif charges the final image enough to satisfy the micro-setting gate.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    The server-labyrinth is sketched with chilling economy (“whispers of the past linger in every forgotten password”) and the recurring numbers act as micro-setting, constraining Lena’s attention like trip-wires. The final image of the dark archive shutting down carries the earned chill of a grave being closed, giving the space a totemic charge at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lighthouse orchard above shifting ice is vivid, specific, and filters through her guardian priorities. Apple-tree roots cradling crystal, antique mirrors breathing dust—details are selective, never tourist catalog. Environment guides choice: only mirrored wall reveals fragment map; ice motion supplies final sigh. Micro-setting (crystal in cloak) constrains last beat—its pulse limits stealth. 8.6 not 9+ because ice floes never directly threaten action; they remain atmospheric monitor, not tactical obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.9)
    Drift-ice marina is evoked with vivid, selective sensory hits—creaking dock, stinging air, ice-light reflections that “danced.” Environment acts as tactile crucible: cold narrows perception, forces shared labor, and mirrors internal thaw. Spatial choreography stays clean; no geographic drift. While the parasol is nominally setting, it never constrains action; hence 9+ gate not met, but atmosphere is still immersive and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the vineyard’s topography and microclimates are sketched through the sentinel’s noticing, not catalogued. The amber pavilion and rustling leaves mirror internal state without overt symbolism. Spatial anchors are clear; weather and season affect mood, not tactical choice. The setting enriches atmosphere but never constrains a decision, keeping it just below the 9-line.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sandalwood/myrrh, shifting dunes, and the kinetic parapet supply tactile otherworldliness; the pavilion’s whispered social energy is sketched with economy. Spatial anchors arrive late (~150 words), but the delay is waived because the lyric pattern is consistent. The parapet’s blue pulse charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for micro-setting that constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lavender/rust dichotomy is vividly filtered through Luna’s photographer’s eye: scent, color, rust flakes on lens, bees humming. The factory ruins function as micro-setting: broken windows frame shots, vines snake into foreground, guiding composition choices. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. The setting charges the final image—the empty map case glows against the purple rows—meeting the 9+ gate, but the absence of any tactical constraint (she never needs a vantage, risks a fall, or loses access) keeps it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    Shadowed library at dawn is rendered through selective sensory strokes—dust, parchment odor, glinting crystal—each filtering the scholar’s priorities. The crystal serves as micro-setting that constrains the final choice; its falling “click” reweights the hush. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome. Environment subtly mirrors internal shift without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.7)
    Fog operates as living sculpture—swirling, erasing, revealing—interacting with driftwood markers and gravel sound to create a kinesthetic micro-setting. Sensory hierarchy favors hush, mist-touch, and chalk texture, all filtered through prophet’s slowed perception. Spatial choreography is simple but coherent: prophet places wood, steps back, fog reclaims ground. The garden never complicates tactics beyond mood, preventing entry to 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.1)
    Peak observatory details—“air thin,” “cameras,” “leaf sound”—are vivid but under-deployed; none constrain Eli’s tactical choices or charge the final image. Micro-setting (clock hand) is present yet its physical properties never limit repair options. Environment stays backdrop; no sensory narrowing under tremor stress.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.1)
    The “radiant haven above the clouds” is atmospherically rich—flower scent, candlelight, choir hum—but functions as postcard backdrop rather than constraint; none of these details impede or enable Lena’s tactics. Spatial choreography is minimal (two women beside a bed); no tool or body part is leveraged for choice. The broken vinyl shard is the only micro-setting object that charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate minimum, yet its physical properties (size, sharpness) never matter. Sensory layering is lovely but decorative; environment never threatens or complicates the goodbye, keeping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stone observatory, floating isle, and clockwork key are sketched with economical sensory strokes; the night sky and echoing steps anchor time and mood. No object or setting feature actively constrains a choice or charges the final image, so the 9+ gate fails, but the atmosphere is coherent and selective.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.7)
    Garden and maze are sketched with impressionist color; sensory selection is biased toward Emilia’s wonder, not botanical inventory.  Bench and tooth function as micro-setting, but neither constrains her body or alters tactics—she simply picks up and leaves—so 9+ gate fails.  Spatial choreography clean; no impossible moves.  Weather absent, but stakes are internal; appropriate economy for length.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.3)
    Grotto, mist, damp stone, and salt tang are filtered through the watcher’s gem-polishing attention; the bench’s proximity to the wheel and the glass’s changing facets supply micro-setting that directly shapes action. Spatial choreography is invisible (no body moves more than arms), but the object-as-setting test is met: the sea glass’s evolving surface charges the final beacon image. Sensory economy is strong—only two smells, two sounds, one touch—each reused to signal cadence shifts. No environment-forcing tactical change, so 9+ gate missed.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    The moss garden is vividly filtered through Aria’s need for quiet: “soft earth beneath her feet,” “honeyed hush,” vines on rusting servers. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch and smell, mirroring her inward turn. The server-garden mash-up never constrains a choice, so it enriches atmosphere without becoming tactical; capped below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    The feral nexus and mist function as a liminal micro-setting that licenses blurred reality; its feral quality, however, never constrains movement or tools—the mist clears without cost. The shell fragment is tactile, re-handled, and finally recharged in the last image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory detail is selective—light on the shell’s curve, swirling touch of mist—anchored to the POV’s artist-eye. Spatial choreography is minimal but clean; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Verdant arbor is anchored early, returns as sacred space at end, and the crystal-plus-vine micro-setting physically enables the song—meeting the 9+ gate; selective dew/crystal imagery stays sensuous and woven through action.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    Subarctic crater pins temperature, twilight, and scent to every surface; orchard detritus is handled, not catalogued. The plate as micro-setting constrains the final action—it must be lifted to fading light to complete enchantment—meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean (no impossible moves), though larger geography beyond the crater lip is unmarked and irrelevant. Environment mirrors interior stillness without overt symbolic nudging.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marble, crystal glow, damp-earth stink, and echo decay are filtered through Elian’s locksmith senses—angles, reflections, clicks—turning cavern into a giant lock. Spatial choreography is clean: tunnels → device → reassembly → exit. The final image of ticking synchronizing with his pulse makes the environment constrain future choice: he must return. Micro-setting (the clockwork itself) functions as both tool and territory, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Bronze grotto, starlight, snowmelt, and fungal glow are economically braided through motion, anchoring every beat. The kerosene lamp’s warm circle and the loom’s glimmer function as micro-setting that literally lights the final image, passing the 9+ gate. Soundscape (“soft crunch of gravel,” “shingled hush”) is biased to weaver’s ear, never catalog. Spatial choreography stays clean; no floating white-room moments.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.1)
    Skylight loft, ash blank, and kettle function as micro-setting; each constrains attention and is handled tactilely. Rain diffuses light → soft time; kettle’s boil gives tacit clock; wood grain guides cut direction—details filter through widow’s selective grief-gaze. Vividness is selective, never touristic; smells of tea and sawdust braid. No spatial drift; environment stays coherent across small repetitive motions.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lagoon-mirror and carousel-shadow function as micro-setting that steers attention and ultimately frames the photograph; sensory economy is strong, but the environment never physically constrains movement or alters tactic— it is atmospheric, not instrumental, preventing the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Terminal’s rusting valves and dust motes are filtered through engineer eyes, providing tactile micro-setting that later enables the resurrection act. Spatial choreography stays crisp: she “steps into” halls, “eyes landed on pipes,” no floating bodies. Sensory economy matches stakes—visual, metallic, hiss—without museum tour. Setting constrains the final solution (pipes = infrastructure) so earns 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clock-tower interior, wet courtyard, and dawn sky rendered with selective, POV-filtered detail; scent and light guide attention. Forecourt crystals return in final image and charge closure; micro-setting (pond ripple) acts as mirror shift. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible moves. 9+ gate missed because no environmental detail actually constrains Elian’s physical choice—he always had free exit.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Canal, twilight glow, silt, debris, and moonlit metal are selectively filtered through Lyra’s seeker gaze; each sensory note is tethered to her search action, never stalled for postcard effect. The twilight barge canal evolves from backdrop to threshold, its water-lap rhythm echoing the final unravelling of self-lies—meeting the 9-band gate by charging the closure image. Spatial grounding stays coherent; no impossible shifts. Minor wished-for tactile interaction with the canal water at climax, else near-flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vivid sensory triangulation (salt, snow, wood, glass) runs through every paragraph and filters via collector’s professional eye. Golden dock, coiled rope, and pocketed fulgurite each return as tactile anchors. However, none of these objects constrains her decoding action or charges the final image; they serve mood only. Micro-setting succeeds as texture, fails as tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    Garden is concrete: damp-earth smell, decaying leaves, bench, moonlit shadow geometry. Palace carpet micro-setting works as charged object; its thread physically snaps to spark closure image. Sensory hierarchy suits mourner-observer—visual, olfactory, tactile—but environment never actively blocks or enables a choice; it mirrors mood only. Meets 9+ gate for object charging final image, yet lacks environmental constraint on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.1)
    Visual texture is vivid—“crystal spires glinting,” “shards of stone”—and the egg’s etched surface is a tactile micro-setting that returns in the final glow. Spatial anchors, however, are impressionistic; we never learn how the prince navigates the palace or where the pedestal sits relative to the stalactites, so the environment cannot constrain tactics. Light and darkness are used atmospherically but not functionally—no beat hinges on visibility, height, or vertigo. Strong sensory selection earns a solid mid-band, yet the world remains backdrop rather than obstacle or tool.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.1)
    Obsidian lagoon, volcanic black sand, and coin-on-red-thread are vivid and specific; the lagoon’s mirror-like surface quietly guides the final image. Sensory selection reflects Aria’s bias—she notices texture, color, and healing lore—but the environment never constrains her grafting action or supplies a resource she must relinquish. Spatial choreography is clean; weather migration brings the rain that charges the closing mood, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment charging the image.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.1)
    “City of forgotten fountains” moves from postcard phrase to active micro-setting: dust, dry basins, then flowing water constrain Aria’s pace and supply the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors sound (rustle, creak, gurgle) over visual catalog, matching her listening method. Spatial choreography stays clean through alley–courtyard–door sequence; the black-stone pedestal localises climax. The setting’s state-change directly charges the Conceptual Repricing, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment shaping closure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    The nebula garden is vivid, selective, and continuous: “stars bloomed like flowers,” “drift of cosmic dust,” “tendrils of gas and dust” all filter through a poetic perceptual bias. Sensory economy is good—no checklist of senses—and the garden’s scale and softness directly enable the “quiet sigh” metaphor that closes the piece. Spatial choreography is n/a for a lone walker; no credibility strain. Environment does not constrain tactics, so capped below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.5)
    Greenhouse is evoked through scent, mist, and lunar geometry; headstones and tropical flora intermingle to charge the finale. Spatial anchor holds: chisel, ribbon, and spectral figure remain legible in dusk light. Butterfly density accrues as textural escalation, not backdrop. Micro-setting (ribbon in pocket) constrains the gesture of recitation, passing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.9)
    The tidal obsidian ridge is rendered with salt-swell specificity; the broken rake handle becomes a micro-setting that literally guides her next step and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate; weather and rock constrain gait and mood. The 9+ gate is missed only because the ridge never actively threatens or resource-strips her; it mirrors rather than alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.7)
    Cobalt silo, starlight through slat gaps, lavender sachets, antique dust—details are selective, sensory, and filtered through caretaker habitus. Spatial choreography is clean: gardener moves from cemetery → silo door → interior shelf → tapestry → night exit; no impossible props. Micro-settings (sovereign case, chess clock) double as tactile objects that charge the finale. The cemetery itself stays off-stage after line 1, but the silo succeeds as compressed cosmos, satisfying the 9+ micro-setting gate by constraining every action inside its echo-chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    The frozen lake and obsidian spire are vividly anchored early and return as mirrored pressure; the kingfisher quill supplies micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection stays tight—cold crunch, iridescent flash—filtered through the cartographer’s instrument-focused gaze. Spatial choreography is clean; the environment never constrains a concrete choice, so the setting remains atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.9)
    The ember alcove is sketched with selective sensory economy—glow, mist, dust motes—each filtering through POV priorities. Micro-setting (radio dial, desk surface) functions as tool and lens, constraining attention and later charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drift. For 9+ the dial or desk would need to alter a final tactic; they shimmer but do not force a choice, capping at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.9)
    The gallery is sketched with spare but biased detail—powder on frame, somber wall tones—filtered through Lena’s ritual gaze. Bodies track cleanly; no white-room syndrome. The mask’s porcelain shards function as micro-setting that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    Setting is the sewer’s rot, the sunken city’s “watery grave,” and the micro-setting of the cog—all filtering through Kael’s alienated gaze. Sensory selection favors smell and tactile decay; visual detail is selective (“detritus,” “waterlogged tomb of steel and stone”). The cog functions as micro-setting, handled in two beats and recharged in the final image, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is minimal yet coherent; no impossible moves. City scale is evoked by implication rather than catalog, fitting the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.5)
    Velvet library and autumn leaves are vividly filtered through Emilia’s musical ear; light and dust act as acoustic filters. The zither rosette functions as micro-setting, constraining her metaphorical equation of carving = braiding voices. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drift. Sensory selection stays biased to sound and sight, supporting the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.9)
    The rusted greenhouse is more than postcard: corrosion dictates her need for pruning, broken panes let celestial light pour in, and the vine-tangle resists her shears—environment shapes every move. Sensory triage favors touch and taste (“flavors of joy, sorrow… danced on her palate”) over visual catalog, keeping detail urgent and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is clean—bodies, pot, seed, dish track without drift. The greenhouse’s final reconfiguration into “crucible for transformation” supplies the 9+ gate requirement, capping just below perfection because the celestial light is described rather than felt to burn or blind.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.1)
    “Nectar dusk” and lightning-tower hum give a concise sensory frame; the beehive’s erratic drones add tactile immediacy. Setting never constrains choice—stairs, doors, tools are absent—so the tower functions as postcard backdrop rather than pressure engine. Still, selective detail keeps the world legible and tonally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory selection is biased to Eli’s quiet attention: creamy hue of orris, soft lapping, expectant hush. The bay and house perimeter function as micro-settings that guide her ritual walk; spatial choreography is clean. Weather and season are used as mood mirror, not causal constraint, so the 9+ gate is missed. Still, detail is selective, weighted, and filtered through POV priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    Underwater garden is vividly rendered—coral ballerinas, foxglove-stained glass, filtered light—yet description seldom constrains choice or alters tactics; it’s atmosphere more than pressure. The empty ampoule at the statue’s feet becomes a micro-setting object that charges the final image, nudging the score into the 7-band. Spatial choreography remains stable in a single, slow-motion scene.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rooftop greenhouse under waxing moon is kinesthetic: glass panes, smog that “swallows stars,” saffron quiet. Micro-setting qualifies—the moon-tipped brush and canvas literally constrain her next move. Sensory triage matches urgency: night air narrows to bristle-on-canvas sound at climax. Spatial choreography holds; no geography drift.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful: damp earth, luminescent fungi, emerald lens glint. The grotto’s scale and waterfall mist are sketched economically; spatial choreography stays clean. The bread sculptures function as micro-setting that charges the final image. However, the city never actively constrains Elena’s choices; it remains backdrop, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Salt-tide, dust-shelf, flickering candlelight—sensory hits are selective and POV-filtered. The lighthouse’s cramped spiral and hidden compartment constrain movement and discovery. “Counter-clockwise” mechanic never surfaces as tactile detail, a missed opportunity. Final golden wash is an atmospheric payoff that re-images the bleak opening, earning its keep.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.8)
    Funhouse atmosphere is vivid—decay, cracked mirror, pulsing clasp—yet description seldom constrains action; the clasp glints but is never manipulated. Spatial choreography is clean, but the setting never becomes a tool that alters tactics. The final image needs the mirror/clasp to charge the moment, so the 9+ gate is missed but atmospheric work is solid.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    The driftwood circle, orchard, and open-sea horizon are vividly anchored and filtered through the prophet’s selective attention to sound and scent. Sensory hierarchy supports the musical premise: tactile strike of mallet on branch, salt-air taste, starlight afterglow. Spatial choreography is coherent; the body moves barefoot across creaking wood without drift. While the setting never constrains a choice or charges the final image—limiting entry to the 9-band—the atmosphere is specific, consistent, and economically layered.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Turtle-metropolis is vividly sketched—sun-bleached shell streets, spiral scars, spatial hierarchy of age—and filters through Lyra’s cartographer gaze. Setting guides movement (she walks toward older, more worn shells) and mirrors internal unease without overt symbolism. The “reed whistle” and “pattern language” act as micro-settings that charge the final image; environment constrains access to hidden compartments. No world-rule inconsistency; idiom remains consistent and sensory selection is POV-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.3)
    Ivy, rust, damp earth are vivid and selective; they mirror internal state without overt symbology. Micro-setting works: the letter’s vellum texture functions as tactile arena. Spatial choreography is stable; no impossible moves. Environment, however, never blocks or endangers; it decorates more than it constrains, keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    Submerged pavilion is vividly tactile—silt, orange glow, still water—and the inkwell micro-setting constrains the final gesture of leaving it, qualifying for the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography holds; only the drawbridge shadow feels like a late emblem rather than an active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sunken-library micro-setting is vivid and selective: “dusty tomes and the faint scent of aged paper,” waterlogged bindings creak. The stamp’s physicality—ornate handle, precision tip—constrains the climactic annotation; environment mirrors internal shift from passive reading to active marking. Spatial choreography stays clean; no geography drift. Meets 9+ gate: tool charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Floating tea garden, silk threads, glass basilica—each is sensuously sketched and filtered through Kaito’s artisan eye. Micro-setting (the lantern filigree at the edge) literally supports the final gesture, giving the environment a tactile role. Weather and spatial choreography stay consistent; no white-room syndrome. While world-rules (dream recording, shadow detachment) are mentioned, they remain ornamental rather than choice-constraining, keeping the score just below the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.1)
    Rubble-and-smoke opening is vivid and selective; the geode’s facets reflecting “dying light” anchors the beat. Observatory hum/glow supplies tactile contrast, but spatial choreography inside the station remains white-room. Crystal acts as micro-setting that charges the final image, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.3)
    Ancient observatory at dusk is vividly sketched through sound, dust scent, and star-map carvings that guide action; spatial anchoring is clean. Micro-setting works: the wall star trails directly constrain her search path and charge the final lens flare. Environment never threatens or resource-limits her; it decorates more than it pressures. Still, the specificity of place is story-specific and integrated into goal-directed movement.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Cobalt terrace, dusk light, salt-rot air, and driftwood carvings are vividly filtered through her gloom. Sensory triangulation supports theme of eroded truths. Setting never constrains her physically, but the final lunar glow re-weights the terrace as moral courtroom, achieving Charged Poise. Strong specificity almost compensates for static interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    Mist-laden parapet is vividly filtered through negotiator perception—stones are “wind-scoured,” moonlight “swirling.” Micro-setting (the pull in her palm) constrains her emotional stance and recurs at closure. Sensory selection narrows to touch and sound, matching contemplative tempo. No spatial drift; geography stays consistent across the single static scene.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sensory selection is strong: salt-air specificity, paddle rhythm, golden sunset. Coastal launch geography is stable and economically sketched. Utility poles as micro-setting recur and orient both space and mood. However, the compass shards never acquire tactile handling that would charge the closing image; they stay visual emblem only.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    The underground lake is vividly sketched—glow, mist, dripping heartbeat—supplying an otherworldly micro-setting that charges mood. Spatial choreography stays coherent; the path appears as the mist clears, guiding her next step. However, the environment never actively constrains her movement or alters tactical choices; it’s backdrop, not crucible. Because the setting fails the 9+ gate (no final-image constraint), it caps below 8.8 despite strong atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    Fairy-tale orchard and permanent moonlight are sensuously textured—“trees bore fruits that shone like tiny lanterns”—and the scent of spices is tethered to ritual action, so the micro-setting constrains the conjuring beat. Spatial choreography stays coherent; creatures circle, Lyra chants, Aria reaches, no impossible positions. The environment mirrors interior states without overt symbolism. The orchard never becomes a crucible that forces a trade-off, so it supports but does not charge the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glade above clouds is atmospherically specific—ozone, damp earth, moonlight on mist—and the dolls’ saucer functions as micro-setting that constrains her symbolic reading. Spatial anchoring is stable: cross-legged blanket, cards before her, book beside. Sensory selection stays urgent—scent of ozone, tactile crack, visual flicker of cards—mirroring internal fracture without overt symbolism. Environment does not alter tactics, so 9-band gate not met; cap 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.1)
    The recycled ship is evoked through tactile detail—worn metal, dried tears, needle glint—rather than exposition. Micro-setting (the necklace, the photograph edge) constrains the sewing action and charges the final image. Sensory economy is tight: every visual or haptic note either impedes or enables the stitch. No postcard drift; place is felt through fingertip and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    Black-sand beach, active volcano, bottled glow create vivid sensory triad; volcanic rumble and salt hush thread every paragraph, charging atmosphere. Spatial choreography is light—only Aria and one prop—but environment is continuously filtered through her attention. No object or setting detail constrains a choice, so 9-band gate missed. Still, selective, purpose-driven texture supports lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.2)
    The fort’s twilight blackout is atmospherically vivid—inky darkness, moonlit bronze, echoing corridors—but none of these descriptors constrain choice or charge the final image. The cradle’s glow is a decorative overlay, not a spatial or tactical asset. Spatial choreography is clean; sensory selection is poetic yet generic (“luminous,” “ethereal”). The setting satisfies texture but fails the 9+ gate: no object, weather, or spatial limit alters the sentinel’s tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Salt-ozone-air, aurora palette, and rock-tactile micro-details are selective and filtered through the herder’s gaze. The tidal bluff constrains placement and sight-lines; stardust glint is a charged object. No spatial drift; no static catalogue. Environment is not just backdrop—it supplies the material substrate for the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    The stormlit observatory is evoked with strobing sensory specificity—lightning flashes, wind howling like “a chorus of the damned.” The darkroom timer’s tactile familiarity anchors the micro-setting, constraining her vigil rhythm. Spatial choreography is ghosted but coherent; bodies never collide with the envelope or timer. Environment is mirrored in emotional register, charging the final image of dissipating storm.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.1)
    Glass-atrium/brook frame is economically anchored and filtered through Aurélien’s notice of light, water-sound, and metallic gleam. Spatial choreography is clean—sword arcs, brook outside, sundial on wall—without tourist cataloging. The half-painted sundial functions as micro-setting that constraints argument tactics, qualifying for 9+ gate, but the environment never actively limits choices or inflicts cost, so stays mid-band. Sensory selection skews visual; deeper embodiment (temperature, scent of brook-moss) is missed.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    “Tidal arbor above the clouds” is atmospherically vivid and sustained; mist, ozone, wet stone narrow perception effectively. The setting never physically constrains her choices—she could leave at any moment—so it remains decorative, not tactical. Closure is charged by the clock, not the arbor, blocking the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.2)
    “Ancient ridge in bloom” supplies sensory color (scent, hum, sunlight) yet the geography never constrains movement or tools; the ridge could be any pleasant overlook. Micro-setting is present—seed, soil, droplets—but none alters tactics or charges the final image, so the 9-band gate is missed.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.1)
    The breezy islet after rain is never a postcard: salt scent narrows Kaito’s breath, wet rock determines where he sits to thread lace, tide timetable decides release moment. Compass as micro-setting constrains the final gesture; environment is filtered through bonsai tutor’s attention to miniature form. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (damp earth, grimy panes, debris), and the butterfly wing functions as a micro-setting. Yet the environment doesn’t constrain choice—it’s a passive backdrop for reflection. The final image charges the setting, but no tactical decision stems from spatial or material conditions.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    The canyon setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (frost etching rocks, inky shadows, ethereal dawn light) and functions as micro-setting: its stillness mirrors the protagonist’s craft and mental state. The frost patterns directly echo the ledger’s code, linking environment to plot. Yet the setting never constrains choice—it enables reflection but imposes no tactical pressure or physical limitation that alters outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    The winterglass conservatory functions as micro-setting: frosted panes contrast internal warmth, automated lighting cues emotional shifts, and plants lean in response to music—environment directly charges the closure. Sensory detail is selective (chill on skin, hum of heating) and filtered through the survivor’s trauma. Yet no environmental constraint shapes a pivotal choice; the space enables rather than pressures action.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    The underwater library setting is vividly rendered with purposeful detail—the moon-shimmering tomes, icy currents, eerie silence—and directly shapes the climax by housing the transmitter. The broken lighthouse lens functions as micro-setting, constraining the repair sequence. Sensory hierarchy reflects the undertaker’s profession: focus on stillness, decay, and tactile restoration. Final image charges the setting as sanctuary, fulfilling the 9+ gate despite minor generic phrasing (“musty scent of old books”).

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.9)
    The terra-cotta arbor, lanterns, and night air create a warm, tactile atmosphere that supports theme. Sensory details are selective and consistent with POV, though heavily visual. The setting functions more as backdrop than constraint—it doesn’t pressure choices or alter tactics. The bell qualifies as micro-setting and charges the final image, narrowly satisfying the 9+ gate condition, but the arbor itself remains ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    The twilight viaduct in bloom is vividly specific and sensorially layered, with wisteria acting as both setting and emotional mirror. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment evolves with Aria’s breath and perception. However, the setting never constrains choice—it’s a passive backdrop, not a crucible. Thus, despite lush prose, it fails the 9+ gate requiring environmental pressure on decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.1)
    The “living bridge garden” is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (dappled shadows, rustling leaves, sweet scent), and the halo fragment functions as micro-setting. However, the environment never constrains choice or alters tactics—it remains decorative backdrop. The final image reuses the garden but without transformation that charges Elian’s decision. Strong atmosphere, but setting doesn’t earn 9+ because it doesn’t shape the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.1)
    The carnival prize center and piano offer atmospheric specificity, but setting rarely constrains choice—dust and silence are mood, not mechanism. The arrow and vault appear as props, not environmental pressures. Final fields “lush” reweight hope but lack tactile evolution from earlier desolation, missing the 9+ gate where environment shapes tactics or charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse, shipwrecks, and ashen forge form a mythic micro-setting that actively shapes tone and perception. Crucially, the forge isn’t just backdrop—it whispers secrets and is believed to hold the key to Lyra’s quest, directly charging the final imprint. Sensory specificity (blue murmur of systems, rusty red groan of beams) filters world through synesthetic POV. The aurora’s kaleidoscope evolves with Lyra’s breakthrough, making environment a dynamic participant in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    The emerald station and moonlight create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere with strong sensory layering (golden sunset dissolving, silver lunar glow). However, setting never constrains choice—the bench, train, and flowers exist as backdrop, not pressure. The jar of moonbeams is handled but doesn’t alter spatial dynamics or tactics. Descriptions are lush yet passive, scoring high on texture but missing the 9+ gate of environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.1)
    Atmosphere is vividly rendered—the scent of decay, cracked panes, dust-coated consoles—but setting functions as backdrop, not crucible. The abandoned control room evokes mood yet never pressures Elian’s actions or supplies resources that alter outcome. The glassblowing tools are present but generic; no spatial choreography or environmental constraint shapes the crafting process. Final kaleidoscope effect is decorative, not causally charged.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.4)
    “Rusted library under stars” offers atmospheric contrast but doesn’t constrain choice or alter tactics—the setting is backdrop, not crucible. Sensory detail skews visual (“dim light,” “dusty shelves”) with minimal tactile or auditory immersion despite the whispering shell. The shell and cast are handled, but the environment never impedes or enables action. Vivid but decorative; fails the 9+ gate because setting doesn’t charge the final image beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting functions powerfully as micro-setting: the ridge fort, pebble shore, candles, and storm create a tactile, weather-bound crucible that shapes mood and ritual. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (sandalwood, creaking wood, honey-dripping voice), filtered through the oracle’s attuned perception. Crucially, the environment charges the final image—the receding storm and rearranged shadows reflect the narrative’s effect—but doesn’t constrain choices, limiting it from 9+. No spatial drift or white-room syndrome; atmosphere and action are interwoven.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    The frozen courtyard and twilight glow are vividly rendered and consistently maintained, with sensory detail (crunch of frost, pale blue light) filtered through Zeta’s perception. However, the setting never pressures choice—it’s a passive backdrop, not a micro-setting that constrains action or alters outcomes. The ice violin charges the final image but doesn’t shape decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.7)
    The “crystal whispering forecourt” and rain-washed stones create vivid atmosphere, and sensory details (wet stone scent, echoing footsteps) are selective. However, the setting never constrains choice or alters tactics—it’s backdrop, not micro-setting. The crystal monolith reflects stars but doesn’t pressure the registrar’s final act. Lacks the 9+ gate: environment doesn’t charge the closure beyond decorative resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.1)
    The garden maze is vividly rendered with sensory specificity—the scent of “blooming flowers and gentle withering,” towering hedges, long sunset shadows—and functions as both environment and emotional mirror. However, it never constrains choice or alters tactics; the setting remains decorative rather than instrumental. The marbles serve as micro-setting but don’t interact spatially with the maze to pressure decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.1)
    The xenobiology station, twilight glow, and holographic simulator create vivid, selective sensory detail filtered through Kaelin’s professional focus. The “iridescent mist” and “soft blue light” serve both atmosphere and plot. However, the setting rarely constrains choice—the lab is a neutral stage, not a crucible. The final image is charged by the nexus, but the environment itself doesn’t shape tactics or carry cost.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    The flooded opera house lit by flickering lanterns is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting: water enables the program’s “ghostly images,” directly shaping Rachel’s method. Sensory detail is selective (sound of lapping water, visual of yellowed pages, tactile viola under chin) and filtered through Rachel’s artistic sensibility. The environment constrains no physical choice but charges the final image—the golden glow on water as she exits—making it indispensable to tone and closure. A 9+ score is denied only because the setting doesn’t force a tactical decision with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mountain weather station functions effectively as micro-setting: its isolation, metal grating, mist, and automated hum shape Aria’s solitude and method. The botanical illustration—treated as object-as-setting—constrains her cognition and charges the final image. Sensory detail (ozone, damp earth, echoing footsteps) is selective and POV-filtered. However, the environment never actively pressures a tactical choice; it reflects rather than compels, preventing 9+ eligibility despite vivid specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmosphere is vividly rendered—decay, rust, echoing footsteps—and sensory detail (scent of age, palpable hush) serves mood effectively. However, the setting never constrains choice: the tunnel is backdrop, not crucible. The beaded valve wheel qualifies as micro-setting but isn’t used tactically. Final image doesn’t charge the environment with new meaning; description remains illustrative, not instrumental.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    The overgrown library and catacombs are vividly rendered with multi-sensory specificity (scent of parchment, damp earth, flickering candles). The obsidian refuge functions as micro-setting, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite subterranean descent. However, the environment constrains no actual choice—it reflects mood but doesn’t alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sage Ridge is vividly rendered through scent (sage), sound (cicadas), and tactile detail (denim jacket, guitar), filtered through Aria’s sensory priorities. The setting supports mood but doesn’t constrain action—nowhere does geography or object placement alter tactics. The baby curl and guitar function as micro-settings, yet only the curl reappears with thematic weight. Final lunar glow charges the image but doesn’t reshape options.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    The reclaimed silo library is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail (“scent of old books and dust,” “narrow windows,” “weathered walls”). Atmosphere serves as psychological extension, especially in the “bronze quiet” motif. However, setting never constrains Emilia’s actions or shapes stakes—it’s backdrop, not crucible. The tapestry and diaries are props, not environmental pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lighthouse and tavern are atmospherically rendered but remain postcard backdrops; they exert no spatial or tactical pressure on choices. Sensory detail leans heavily visual (“beam slicing,” “dim light”) without tactile or auditory grounding that would embody POV urgency. Though the wooden box and specs recur, they never constrain action—the setting decorates rather than dictates.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dimensional anchor is vividly rendered through scent (sandalwood, myrrh), sound, and the single blue hue, creating a cohesive sensory field. The loop pedal and palette function as micro-settings that charge the ritual. However, the environment doesn’t constrain choices—it’s a stage, not a participant. The final image of the glowing palette earns resonance, but setting never actively shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is vividly rendered: the glass spire, frozen lake, and mirrored horizon create a cohesive, sensory-rich environment that mirrors the protagonist’s interior symmetry. Details are selective and POV-filtered (“facets reflecting pale dawn light,” “crisp morning air”). Yet the setting never constrains choice—it’s a stage, not a crucible. The spire and lake remain passive backdrops, failing the 9+ gate requiring environmental pressure on tactics or final image.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    The glowing viaduct and rain establish mood effectively, with sensory detail (ozone, wet earth) that grounds the opening. However, the setting never constrains action—it’s backdrop, not crucible. The viaduct’s glow fades symbolically but doesn’t alter tactics or stakes. Final image uses lunar light well, but environment remains decorative, failing the 9+ gate of constraining choice or charging closure with irreplaceable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    The drum maker’s cavern functions as micro-setting: damp earth, worn tools, and the broken needle constrain and charge Aria’s actions. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through her tactile POV—wood grain, vibration, scent—not visual tourism. The environment evolves with seasonal rustle and thickening air, culminating in the cavern as “womb” that nurtures rebirth. Crucially, the setting directly charges the final image: silence isn’t absence but fertile ground, making the space indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.1)
    The courtyard is vividly rendered with sensory detail (scent, sound, light) and functions as emotional refuge, but it never constrains choice or alters tactics—it’s backdrop, not crucible. The pigeon and message tube briefly activate the space, yet the setting remains static, unchanged by the character’s revelation. Final image uses stars and darkness atmospherically, but no environmental element charges the closure with irreplaceable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.4)
    The greenhouse setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (scent, UV-reactive petals, crystal shadows) and filtered through Elara’s perfumer POV. However, it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than an active crucible: no spatial choreography, access constraints, or environmental pressures shape her choices. The extinct plants symbolize memory but don’t supply resources or obstacles that affect outcome. Final image (“crystal shadows”) resonates thematically but doesn’t constrain the closure action.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    The terra-cotta grotto is vividly specific, with sensory detail filtered through the poet’s tactile obsession. Starlight, rust-red rocks, and rough stone ground the scene without tourist cataloging. The setting functions as micro-setting: the stones she patterns directly enable her method and final insight. However, it doesn’t *constrain* choice—she could pattern anywhere—so it falls just short of 9+ gate despite strong atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—its glass echoes, its greenery contrasts desolation. Sensory detail (charred earth, glinting glass, crackling fire) is selective and POV-filtered through the violinist’s acoustic perception. Yet the setting doesn’t constrain choice; she enters freely, observes passively. The bowl and greenhouse together elevate specificity, but spatial choreography of the group around the fire lacks precise grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    The amber grotto is vividly rendered with multisensory specificity—luminescent stones, aged amber scent, soft crackling—and filters perception through the dealer’s professional focus. The setting functions as micro-setting: it enables her concentration and mirrors her emotional output (stones “infused with the emotions she had created”). However, it never constrains a choice or forces a tactical shift, missing the 9+ gate. Still, description is purposeful, integrated into action, and tonally cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.4)
    The “breezy library under stars” is atmospherically rendered but inert—it doesn’t constrain choices or alter tactics. Sensory details (musty books, sea breeze) are pleasant but decorative, not filtered through urgent need. The setting serves as backdrop, not crucible; removing it wouldn’t change the plot. No object or environmental feature pressures the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.1)
    The crystalline orchard and shimmering crater are vividly rendered with sensory specificity and poetic texture, and the environment supports mood effectively. However, the setting never constrains choice or alters tactics—it functions as backdrop, not crucible. No spatial choreography emerges: characters move through a luminous diorama without interaction that affects outcome. The glimmering trees illuminate but do not impede, enable, or demand adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rooftop canal setting is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting: its flow responds to Lyra’s spell, directly shaping the action. Water, spires, and pendant glow are filtered through her professional attention as an illustrator. The environment charges the final image—canal waters flow “with renewed purpose,” towers “reach for the sky”—tying external change to internal revelation. However, the canal never constrains choice; it enables magic without friction, missing a chance for true spatial pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cavern orchard is vividly rendered—luminescent fungi, dripping stalactites, mosaic stepping stones—and functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, with the environment mirroring internal shifts (trees go from still to “looming with quiet promise”). Crucially, the setting constrains no action, but it deeply textures the thematic resonance. The glass eyes left behind tie the space to the conjurer’s quest, fulfilling the 9+ gate via object-as-setting in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    The shadowed library, pipe chases, and emergency lighting create a vivid, tactile micro-setting that filters all action. Sensory specificity—scent of oxidized metal, creaking shelves, sapphire hush—grounds the dweller’s perception. The environment directly enables the core activity (hiding/caching) and charges the final image: patrons sense a hidden world because the setting itself becomes a conduit. No white-room syndrome; spatial logic holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mossy trellis and post-rain atmosphere are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (emerald moss, glistening leaf, soft patter), and the setting reflects Emilia’s inner state without overt symbolism. However, the environment never constrains choice or alters tactics—it functions as backdrop, not crucible. The linden leaf and trellis serve as decorative motifs rather than active forces shaping decisions, preventing 9+ eligibility despite strong descriptive craft.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.4)
    The tidal island is atmospherically rendered but functions as backdrop, not crucible—the setting doesn’t constrain choices or alter tactics. The amber brooch glows “otherworldly” at the end, charging the final image, satisfying the micro-setting gate weakly. However, spatial choreography is vague (“abandoned buildings to hidden tunnels” lacks specificity), and sensory detail skews visual without grounding in tactile or auditory immediacy during high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    The musical crystal cave is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (luminescent glow, earth’s vibrations, overlapping shadows) and functions as more than backdrop—it enables Aria’s attunement. However, it never constrains choice or alters tactics; it passively supports her journey. The setting charges atmosphere but not agency, missing the 9+ gate where environment must shape the final image through constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ivory harbor after rain is vividly evoked with sensory specificity (“musty scent of aged artifacts,” “creaking sign”), and the trumpet valve serves as a micro-setting that charges the ending. However, the environment never constrains choice—installations appear effortlessly, unaffected by weather, space, or community resistance. Descriptions remain atmospheric rather than tactical, failing the 9+ gate despite strong prose texture.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmosphere is vividly rendered—the mist, ethereal glow, whispering alcoves—but setting functions as backdrop, not crucible. The “starlit vault in mist” evokes mood without pressuring choices: corridors twist but pose no navigational consequence; cracks form arrows but require no interpretation or risk. Sensory detail leans heavily visual, missing tactile or auditory specificity that would ground Emilia’s experience. Final image of cleared mist symbolizes change but doesn’t arise from environmental causality.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stargazer’s tower, sea, and migrating whales form a vivid, sensory-rich environment that evolves with Emilia’s perception. Details are filtered through her POV—latticework, morning light, whale songs—and the setting actively shapes tone and thematic weight. Yet the environment never constrains choice or alters tactics; it remains a passive canvas rather than an active force, preventing 9+ eligibility despite strong atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prismatic escondite functions as a potent micro-setting: its colors deepen with energy, visually tracking escalation, and ultimately become the gateway Kael steps into. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—swirling colors, electric tension, hushed thunder—filtered through Kael’s dimensional awareness. The environment actively shapes the climax: the escondite’s properties amplify the magnetic fields, enabling the distortion. Final image ties setting to theme: colors fade as Kael vanishes, charging the closure with visual resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    The funeral home prep room functions as a potent micro-setting: formaldehyde, steel tables, and creaking wood shape atmosphere and subtly constrain action (e.g., waiting in a space of death while planning defiance). The ink pot serves as object-as-setting, charging the final image with thematic weight. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered—Lena notices scent, texture, sound in ways that mirror her internal shift. This integration of environment and object meets the 9+ gate but falls just short due to minimal spatial choreography affecting tactics.

    The bonsai labyrinth, fluorescent lamp, and dawn light are vividly rendered and filtered through the stationer’s perceptual bias, creating a lush, specific atmosphere. The setting functions as micro-setting: the lamp’s hum and the forest’s textures directly shape her method and attention. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it’s a stage, not a participant. Still, sensory detail is purposeful and integrated, avoiding white-room syndrome or generic description.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.1)
    The shipping container labyrinth is vividly rendered and functions as metaphor, but it never constrains choice or alters tactics—the survivor moves freely without spatial pressure. The poison bottle label appears twice but doesn’t interact with environment meaningfully. Sensory detail leans heavily visual; other senses are underused despite port setting’s auditory/tactile potential.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.1)
    The abandoned observatory is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting through the half-finished cello and crumbling domes, which are tactilely engaged. However, the environment doesn’t constrain choice or alter tactics—it’s a backdrop that receives meaning rather than exerting pressure. The seashell and cello charge the final image, but the cliffside location remains ornamental, failing the 9+ gate of constraining a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    The raft city and perpetual carnival are vividly sketched with sensory detail (music, exotic foods, floating structures), establishing a unique micro-setting. However, the environment functions as backdrop, not constraint—it never limits Ava’s actions or supplies tactical resources. The foundation stone chip charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate minimally, but spatial choreography remains abstract (“scattered throughout the city”) without grounded navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.1)
    The moonlit summit is vividly rendered with sensory specificity and consistent lunar logic, and the hourglass grain functions as micro-setting. However, the environment never constrains Elara’s choices—she moves, photographs, and reflects unimpeded by terrain, temperature, or oxygen limits. The setting enhances mood but doesn’t shape tactics or foreclose options, missing the 9+ gate for environmental agency.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mist-coated depot, fountain, and refracted light form a micro-setting that actively shapes Emilia’s method and the drone’s recalibration. Sensory detail is exquisitely filtered through her blind POV—vibrations, hums, water sounds—not visual tourism. The environment constrains and enables: light refraction through droplets directly informs her diagnostic process. Final image of clearing mist ties setting to closure with earned luminosity.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rusted outpost and frozen lake are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (crunch of snow, scent of decay, condensation patterns). However, the setting functions as backdrop, not constraint—it doesn’t shape tactics or foreclose paths. The ice creaks, but no risk materializes; the environment decorates rather than pressures. Strong atmosphere, but fails the 9+ gate: no object or condition alters choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is vividly rendered through sensory specificity (“scent of decay,” “cobblestones worn smooth,” “stars like diamonds”) and filtered through the tuner’s purposeful attention. The ancient archway and cobblestones aren’t just backdrop—they’re active participants that “stir” and “respond,” charging the final image. The ebony tuning fork and footsteps function as micro-settings that constrain method and amplify theme. Atmosphere evolves from “wild hush” to “sound of a town reborn,” tracking the narrative arc without static repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    The underwater temple is vividly rendered with salt, decay, and blue-lit recesses, and the crystal vial functions as a micro-setting that guides action. Spatial choreography holds, and atmosphere supports theme. Yet the environment never actively constrains Kael’s choices—she moves freely through labyrinthine passages without obstruction. The setting enhances mood but doesn’t alter tactics or impose meaningful limits.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.9)
    The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, salt-and-decay air, and copperlight lattice create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere filtered through the boy’s mythic longing. Sensory detail is selective and mood-sustaining, especially the worn door and confessional lattice. However, the setting never constrains a choice or alters tactics—the environment is backdrop, not crucible. Strong specificity earns high marks, but it stops short of 9-band integration with agency.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.9)
    The greenhouse is vividly rendered with luminescent orbs, scent-laden air, and winter-cracked fields, creating a cohesive gothic-alchemical atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and mood-aligned, though it functions decoratively rather than constraining choice. The carved stone bead qualifies as micro-setting but doesn’t alter tactics—it’s taken, not wrested or sacrificed. Final image charges the setting, but environment never pressures decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    The red canyon labyrinth and tide pools are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (damp earth, fading light), and the setting mirrors Aria’s psyche. However, the environment never constrains choice or alters tactics—it’s backdrop, not crucible. The storybook plate functions as micro-setting but doesn’t interact causally with the space. Strong atmosphere, but passive in narrative function.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered with sensory specificity—damp earth, snaking roots, dappled light—and functions as micro-setting that charges the final image.

Yet it doesn’t shape decisions, capping 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    The golden arcade functions effectively as micro-setting, with neon lights, worn bench, and morning patrons grounding Cipher’s solitude. Sensory detail is selective and mood-aligned (warm glow, clinking glasses), filtered through Cipher’s nostalgic POV. The ebony clipboard qualifies as object-as-setting, handled repeatedly and imbued with “otherworldly energy.” Yet it doesn’t constrain choice—Cipher could write anywhere—limiting 9+ eligibility despite vivid texture.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt observatory, autumn air, velvet cloth, and eternal candle create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere filtered through the embroiderer’s perception. The flame functions as micro-setting—it dances with the needle, burns brighter at climax, and casts the final “eerie glow”—charging the ending image. Yet it never constrains a choice; setting remains decorative rather than tactical. Still, sensory detail is selective and purposeful, avoiding white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mangrove labyrinth, luminescent fungi, damp earth, and suspended windowpane form a vivid, tactile micro-setting that filters all perception and action. Crucially, the environment constrains choice: moonlight enables healing, mist obscures paths, and the window’s condensation becomes the medium for revelation. The gargoyle shard and fungal light guide movement, and the final reflection in the cleared pane charges the ending image with irreplaceable specificity. Every sensory detail serves tone and theme without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    The mist-clad atrium and twilight setting are vividly rendered and consistently woven into perception and tone. The brain coral functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate condition—but it doesn’t constrain choice, only reflect mood.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ruined orchard, fog, and decaying earth are vividly rendered and filtered through Lena’s artistic perception. Sensory detail is selective and mood-congruent, especially the “morbid perfume” and swirling fog that mirrors her inner shift. The setting actively shapes the final image—the mural is displayed *here*, meant to be “reclaimed by the fog.” Yet the environment doesn’t constrain a concrete choice; it inspires rather than pressures, limiting full 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    The sound wave garden is not backdrop but active collaborator: tuning forks hum, water laps, mirrors redirect waves, and the air vibrates—all shaping Lena’s tactics. The setting constrains and enables: without reflective surfaces and ambient acoustics, her “bewitching” fails. Crucially, the environment charges the closure—the mural’s aliveness emerges directly from garden mechanics. Sensory detail is selective, purposeful, and filtered through Lena’s artisan POV, avoiding tourist cataloging while maintaining spatial coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.1)
    The greenhouse is vividly rendered with sensory detail and functions as micro-setting, but it never constrains choice or alters tactics—it’s a passive backdrop. The gourd rattle seed and planted patterns are described, yet the environment doesn’t challenge or enable Lyra; it merely accommodates her flawless execution. Strong atmosphere supports theme but lacks causal integration with plot or character decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    The gargantuan shell is vividly rendered as both sanctuary and womb, charged with bioluminescent fungi and off-key winds that respond to the poet’s song. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the poet’s melancholic POV. The setting constrains nothing but profoundly charges the final image: the shell transforms from prison to nurturing space, directly reconfiguring meaning at closure. However, it doesn’t actively pressure choices—more backdrop than crucible—preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    The opal library, glass orchids, and wind chime form a micro-setting that deeply charges the final image: light from the cracked tube animates the orchids, transforming the space into “a realm of wistful beauty.” Every sensory detail—scent of parchment, luminescent orbs, bamboo’s mournful light—is filtered through the caretaker’s reverence and serves thematic resonance. The setting constrains nothing physically, but it emotionally binds the caretaker to her purpose, making the environment itself a co-protagonist. Specificity is exquisite, though it stops just short of 9+ because the setting enables mood more than it forces a consequential choice.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    The extinct language archive functions effectively as micro-setting: luminescent orbs, aged parchment, and spatial shadows create immersive texture. Crucially, the glass ink well—a tool—constrains and charges the final image, glowing as truths emerge and whispering post-completion. Sensory detail is selective (scent of parchment, scratching quill) and filtered through Elara’s professional obsession. The environment evolves subtly with her emotional state, avoiding static description, though it never actively obstructs her work—limiting its role as pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.9)
    The volcanic amphitheater is vividly rendered with sensory specificity—damp earth, creaking stones, dappled sunset—and functions as micro-setting that mirrors Kaelin’s emotional rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    The vintage bookshop attic is vividly specific, grounded in smell (musty paper), light (dusty skylights), and sound (pigeon cooing). Crucially, it functions as micro-setting: the skylight enables the dust-mote ritual that structures Emilia’s equilibrium, directly charging the final image. The mars meteorite chip and workbench anchor spatial choreography without clutter. However, while atmosphere is immersive, it doesn’t actively constrain choices beyond enabling reflection—thus missing the 9+ gate requiring environmental pressure on decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    The drifting prism terrace is vividly rendered with synesthetic detail (light “bleeding like watercolors,” “fractured hush”), and sensory hierarchy reflects the protagonist’s wonder. However, the setting functions as backdrop rather than crucible—it doesn’t constrain movement, alter tactics, or supply resources. The bench’s carvings prompt intuition but don’t shape consequential choices. Final image uses prismatic swirls thematically, but environment never pressures agency.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.7)
    The bioluminescent walls and underwater facility create vivid atmosphere, but the setting never pressures choice or supplies resources—it functions as mood backdrop. The burnt feather and fireflies are described, not interacted with in ways that alter tactics. Final image gains ambiance but not constraint from environment.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    The iridescent cave and crystal geode are vividly specific, with sensory detail filtered through the recollectionist’s perception—light shimmers, walls echo, air thickens. Crucially, the setting constrains action: disappearing paths force reliance on external markers (seeds), and crystals refract light to reveal symbols. The crater glass glows in response to emotional resonance, tying object to environment. Final image of the cave “rejoicing” charges closure through environmental reciprocity.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal arcade, stars, and torchlight create a vivid, atmospheric backdrop with sensory specificity (salt air, flickering light, lapping waves).

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pearl Bay and the prism atrium are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (mist, salt air, diamond-like glints), filtered through the glazier’s perceptual bias. However, setting functions as backdrop, not constraint—it doesn’t pressure choices or alter tactics. The atrium charges the final image but doesn’t *constrain* it; removal wouldn’t break logic. Strong atmosphere, weak dramaturgical integration.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.1)
    The moonlit ridge path is atmospherically rendered with sensory specificity (gravel crunch, silvery glow), and the celestial imagery supports tone. However, the setting never pressures choice—it’s a backdrop, not a constraint. The cracked box functions as micro-setting but doesn’t alter tactics; it’s observed, not used. Vivid description outweighs functional integration, preventing 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    The tide-polished grotto is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (lapping waves, shells, ethereal light), and the balloonist’s gauge functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image.

    The ultraviolet forest is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting, its pulsing light evolving with Elara’s proximity. It charges the final image and subtly guides her choice to enter. However, it doesn’t constrain tactics—Elara walks in unimpeded, and the environment reacts passively. Still, sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, avoiding white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    The alchemist’s market is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (sandalwood, myrrh, rooftop suspension) and functions as micro-setting: it supplies the lens fragment and paintings that catalyze Lena’s shift. The lighthouse shard charges the final image, glowing with “otherworldly light” as her purpose crystallizes. Yet the setting never constrains choice—it enables without resistance, missing opportunity for tactical friction.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned ticket office is rendered with vivid, selective detail—faded posters, skeletal fluorescents, dusty stubs—that filters through Ezra’s observant POV. The mainspring barrel functions as micro-setting, constraining focus and ultimately charging the final image when it “hums” in her toolbox. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment mirrors thematic decay without overt symbolism. The ceiling motif ties setting to character desire, fulfilling the 9+ gate condition via object-as-setting that reweights closure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glass orchard library is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting: its frost patterns directly enable the operator’s method, and its resonance with the clouds charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (crystalline refraction, crunch of frost, viscous liquid) and filtered through the operator’s craft. The environment constrains choice by providing the only medium (morning frost) for the project. Exceptional specificity without white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    The baroque asteroid functions as micro-setting: its galleries, dust, and luminescence shape perception and movement, while the shard emerges from its decay. Sensory detail is selective—facets glinting, footsteps echoing—and filtered through the protagonist’s poetic bias. The setting constrains nothing materially, but it charges the final image: the shard on the desk embodies loss and possibility. A near-miss on the 9+ gate—setting resonates but doesn’t alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    The resonance chamber functions as a potent micro-setting: its vibrating air, luminescent orbs, and thin reality directly enable Erebus’s craft and constrain the repair’s success. The philosopher’s stone chip and music box are tactile, recurring objects that charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered (e.g., “whispers of a thousand midnights”), though overreliance on visual/auditory cues slightly neglects other senses. The setting actively shapes the climax—the chamber’s resonance aligns with the box’s melody—fulfilling the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    The subterranean lagoon is vividly rendered through petrichor, luminescent fungi, and water sounds, all filtered through the collector’s sensory bias. The compass and limestone walls function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment evolves subtly (darkness recedes, fungi glow intensifies). The setting constrains nothing tactically but deeply shapes the thematic and emotional register—sufficient for high marks in a textural design.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    The storm-tossed archway is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (salt-smoothed stones, glint of glass) and filters perception through Aria’s artistic POV. Weather and setting shape mood but do not constrain choice—the archway shelters passively, never forcing a tactical shift. The driftwood and sea provide materials, yet no spatial choreography affects outcome. Strong atmospheric control earns high marks, but the setting doesn’t charge the final image beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    The amber pavilion, autumnal hues, and cathedral window are vividly rendered and evolve tonally alongside Luna’s perception. The postcards function as micro-setting, charging the final image when described as “treasured keepsakes.” Sensory detail favors the visual but aligns with Luna’s artistic POV. Yet the environment never constrains a choice—it reflects rather than pressures, missing the 9+ gate for setting-as-agent.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    The floating library and obsidian lagoon are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (scent of paper, glassy expanse), and the zeppelin setting is unusual. However, the environment never constrains choice or alters tactics—Naomi moves freely, unimpeded. The lagoon functions as backdrop, not micro-setting; it charges atmosphere but not action or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    The paper-lantern cove is vividly rendered with sensory texture (scent of decay, flickering light), and the amber bottle serves as a compelling micro-setting. However, the environment never pressures choice or alters tactics—the lanterns brighten passively, the streets transform magically without resistance. The setting decorates rather than constrains; it evokes mood but doesn’t shape the alchemist’s decisions or impose limits that charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.1)
    The orchard-atop-skyscraper setting is vivid and tonally resonant, with sensory detail (lantern glow, flower scent, city hum) filtered through the scribe’s perception. The wax cylinder functions as micro-setting, charging the final image. Yet the environment doesn’t constrain choices—the scribe moves freely, and the skyscraper’s verticality exerts no tactical pressure. Strong atmosphere, weak causal integration.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.1)
    The icebound atrium under starlight provides vivid, selective sensory detail (“glass panes glistening… like a thousand tiny mirrors”) and grounds early orientation. However, the setting functions as static backdrop—it neither constrains choices nor evolves causally (thawing plants rustle but don’t impede or enable action). The acorn cap acts as micro-setting but isn’t spatially choreographed (e.g., dropped, hidden, weighed). Final image relies on starlight as generic symbol, not charged environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sanctuary’s microclimate isn’t just backdrop—it actively shapes Ember’s method and perception. Wind, silence, and altitude filter every observation, and the cathedral bell becomes a micro-setting that constrains choice: its repaired tone enables new listening. Sensory hierarchy favors sound over sight, aligning with POV priorities. The final image of the bell tolling “like a benediction” charges the environment with thematic weight, satisfying the 9+ gate condition without reaching it due to minor abstraction in closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    The shooting star tracking station is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (dim light, hum of machinery, velvet sky), and the yellow lantern functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image. Details are filtered through the janitor’s reverent POV, avoiding tourist cataloging. However, the setting never pressures choice—it’s a backdrop for reflection, not a crucible that enables or blocks action. Still, the lantern’s golden hue and precarious placement subtly mirror thematic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is vividly rendered with tactile specificity (grime on stained glass, honeycomb fragments) and filtered through the recluse’s mournful perception. The oasis functions as micro-setting: its decay mirrors thematic loss, and the box’s pedestal anchors spatial choreography. However, environment doesn’t constrain choices—the recluse moves freely without obstruction or resource limitation tied to the wasteland.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.1)
    The emerald silo and damaged objects create a vivid, consistent atmosphere, but setting never constrains choice or alters tactics—it’s backdrop, not crucible. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the timekeeper’s melancholy, yet the environment remains inert: the clock doesn’t tick, the urn doesn’t impede, the silo doesn’t echo with consequence. The final image gains mood but not meaning from place.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cobalt lagoon after rain is vividly rendered with sensory specificity—wet sand, mist, iridescent feather—and filters through the poet’s perceptual bias. The setting functions as micro-setting: the feather lands *because* of the stillness, and the lapping water mirrors her rhythm. Yet it never constrains choice or supplies resources; it’s a passive stage, not an active force. Still, the final image of footprints washed by waves charges the closure with impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.1)
    The temple orchard with living stone pillars and copper-wired oaks is vividly rendered through scent, sound, and tactile detail, filtered through the caretaker’s systematic attention. Setting functions as micro-setting: the orchard supplies both materials (oak branches) and purpose (interspecies harmony). However, it never actively constrains choice—no spatial choreography forces a decision. Final image of resonant wire charges closure, but environment doesn’t shape tactics beyond passive backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rainwashed tower and overgrown path provide vivid, sensory-rich atmosphere that mirrors thematic reclamation, and the fly amber functions effectively as micro-setting. Yet the environment never pressures choice—vines don’t impede, weather doesn’t hinder—and the final image isn’t constrained by place. Descriptions are lush but decorative, failing the 9+ gate requiring environmental causality.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is lushly rendered with sensory specificity (scent of flowers, twilight glow, jetty, reef), and the blooming jetty frames the action. Yet environment rarely constrains choice—the seed pods could be scattered anywhere, and the horses graze without spatial logic affecting outcome. The “narrow vastness” is evocative but decorative, not instrumental. Final image gains atmosphere but not tactical or thematic pressure from setting details.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.1)
    The scrapyard wasteland is vividly rendered with sensory specificity—creosote, rust, gravel crunch—and filters through Kael’s bloodhound perception. The setting supplies resources (scrap, phonograph) and mirrors thematic decay. However, it never actively constrains choices: the journey faces no environmental obstacles, and the oasis appears without earned navigation. The tanker truck and dunes anchor space well, but the world remains picturesque backdrop rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    The time dilation observation deck is vividly rendered with metallic echoes, gilded decay, and cosmic scale, creating a haunting atmosphere that mirrors Aria’s dislocation. The compass rose functions as micro-setting, charging the final image when it glows and aligns—but it never constrains a choice or alters tactics, missing the 9+ gate. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, though over-reliant on visual sparkle (“diamonds,” “gilded”).

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.1)
    The icebound spire is vividly rendered with sensory specificity—ozone, singing crystals, swirling mists—and filters through Moonwhisper’s wonder-struck perception. However, the setting never constrains choice; it decorates rather than pressures. The pocket sundial lid functions as micro-setting but doesn’t alter tactics. Final image charges atmosphere but not narrative consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    The whispering gallery is vividly rendered and its acoustics thematically relevant, but it never constrains choice or alters tactics—it’s atmospheric backdrop, not active setting. The chessboard functions as micro-setting and recurs with shifted meaning (from void to opportunity), satisfying partial 9+ criteria. Spatial choreography remains clear despite three characters, though the “pattern of walking” lacks physical plausibility or spatial logic.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.9)
    The labyrinthine mountain bookstore is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (scent of parchment, dancing shadows) and functions as more than backdrop—it frames the quest. However, it never constrains choice or alters tactics; the seer moves through it unimpeded. The setting charges atmosphere but doesn’t pressure decisions, missing the 9+ gate. Still, description is purposeful and woven into perception, avoiding white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “time-frozen village” functions as a potent micro-setting that charges every image—the cobblestones, wet earth, ozone—and culminates in the platinum labyrinth as both physical and psychological space. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (tutor notices frayed borders, not rooftops). Crucially, the setting constrains choice: only in this frozen stillness can he decode the tapestry undisturbed, and the labyrinth’s “otherworldly energy” directly enables his redemption. The final birdsong and rustling leaves reweight the opening hush, fulfilling the 9+ gate—but cost isn’t spatially embodied, holding it just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bone towers, mist, and pale spire form a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that filters every perception. The setting charges the final image: the spire’s symbols emerge only after poetic refraction, making environment integral to revelation. Spatial choreography is stable, and sensory detail (rainbows in mist, echoes) serves theme without stalling momentum. However, the setting never constrains a concrete choice—it reflects but doesn’t pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    The acid sea and floating workshop aren’t mere backdrop—they actively constrain Kaelin’s time (oxygen limit) and amplify peril. The statue, parchments, and charm function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (red-rimmed eyes, stale air, grimy windows) and filtered through urgency. The environment directly pressures tactics and culminates in the closure’s resonant stasis, satisfying the 9+ gate condition despite minor over-reliance on visual cues.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (luminescent moss, worn stone dock, rough sand), and the coastal cave network functions as more than backdrop—it frames the painter’s solitude. However, the environment doesn’t constrain choices or alter tactics; the oasis is passively found, not actively sought under pressure. The seashell and canvas serve as micro-settings but don’t shape decisions beyond symbolic inclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cobalt lighthouse, dawn light, and night-blooming garden create a vivid, sensory-rich atmosphere that supports theme and tone. However, setting functions decoratively—it never constrains choice or alters tactics. The heat wave’s end provides mild temporal grounding but exerts no pressure on decisions. Final image reuses motifs without reweighting them through causal interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting merges external landscape (“canvas of shadows and light”) with internal state through selective, poetic detail, avoiding white-room syndrome. The starlit signal station functions as a micro-setting that anchors the narrative and symbolizes stability amid flux. Crucially, the patina bronze censer foot acts as object-as-setting—it constrains nothing tactically but charges the final image when clutched at dawn, embodying memory and resilience. Sensory detail favors visual lyricism over tactile immediacy, but this serves the accumulative tone without sacrificing coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    The storm-battered orchard is vividly rendered and mirrors the protagonist’s psyche, satisfying atmospheric cohesion. However, it functions only as backdrop—no spatial constraint shapes action (e.g., roots impeding digging, wind obscuring sight). The glass eye emerges from soil but the setting doesn’t enable or resist its discovery. Final image uses weather effectively (“vanished into the rain”), but the environment never actively pressures choice, missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.1)
    The opal dock, mist, and nautical twilight are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (salt, damp earth, swirling fog), and the lighthouse functions as a charged micro-setting that shapes thematic resonance. However, the environment never constrains action or alters tactics—Kael could stand anywhere, and the mist serves mood, not mechanics. The Edelweiss and dock lack causal interaction with choice, limiting 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    The blooming cavern is vividly rendered with sensory detail (scent of flowers, dripping water), and the creek’s fluctuation ties to emotional cadence. However, setting rarely constrains choice: the cavern passively reveals a map; the rising water threatens but doesn’t force a decision. The matrix chip and ants function as micro-settings but don’t alter spatial choreography. Final image uses the creek effectively as reflective peace, satisfying tone over tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vivid sensory language (“cobalt grotto,” “scent of ozone,” “lacy glow”) creates strong atmosphere, but setting functions decoratively, not causally. The cobalt and ember grottos are described, not navigated; they don’t constrain choices or supply resources. No recurring object or environmental detail charges the final image—the “bleeding starlight” is visual motif, not a setting element that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmosphere is vividly rendered—ember nexus, smoldering coals, salt breeze—and sensory detail supports tone. However, setting never constrains choice or alters tactics; it remains decorative backdrop. The nautilus curl and ember nexus function as micro-settings but lack causal interaction with the protagonist’s decisions. Final image reuses glow motif without reweighting stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mountain ranger cabin and birch bark scroll provide tactile specificity, and sensory detail (scratch of pen, woods outside) grounds the scene. However, setting never pressures choice—the cabin is refuge then “launching pad” by declaration, not constraint. The scroll functions as micro-setting but doesn’t alter tactics; it’s a passive surface, not a tool with limitations. Final image of glowing scroll leans symbolic without environmental causality.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.1)
    The water clock shop and morning fog are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (water lapping, diffused light, mist), filtered through Elara’s dulled senses. However, the setting functions as atmospheric backdrop—it never constrains action, alters tactics, or charges the final image beyond mood. The birthing clamp is handled but doesn’t interact with the environment meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating rock tea ceremony platform functions as a potent micro-setting: its instability (“faint tremors”) mirrors thematic tension and subtly pressures Kaito’s focus. The crow quill and sandalwood box are handled with tactile specificity, and the environment evolves—from brewing storms to parted clouds—charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., scent triggering calm), avoiding white-room syndrome. Crucially, the platform constrains choice by isolating Kaito in suspended stillness, enabling the held-breath ritual that unlocks runes.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sheet music archive is vividly rendered with sensory specificity—scent of aged paper, embossed notes, rustling pages—and functions as micro-setting that channels Lyra’s intent. The perfume bottle and orchard serve as charged objects that mirror internal stakes. The archive constrains choice by housing the only possible medium for her apology. Final image of swaying trees reweights the setting with thematic resonance, satisfying the 9+ gate condition.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.1)
    Atmosphere is vividly rendered—the scent of parchment, sentinel shelves, fading light—but setting never constrains choice or alters tactics. The temple library is backdrop, not crucible; the dictionary functions as micro-setting but only in passive observation. Final image gains mood, not meaning, from environment, missing the 9+ gate requiring constraint or charged reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is vividly rendered—the fjord quiet, hydraulic clocks, horizon station—and filtered through the shepherd’s professional attention. However, the environment never constrains choice or alters tactics; it functions as backdrop, not crucible. The mantle clock key and station are described with specificity but don’t pressure decisions. Without causal interaction between setting and action, the 9+ gate (constraint or charged final image) remains unmet.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bioluminescent farm is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (damp soil, blue-green glow), and the setting filters through Lena’s professional attention. However, it remains a passive backdrop—it doesn’t constrain choices, alter tactics, or charge the final image beyond mood. The laser pointer qualifies as micro-setting but isn’t integrated into spatial navigation despite her “gifted” trait.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rainwashed library and candle lantern create mood, but setting rarely pressures choice. The mica pane glints repeatedly, yet never constrains action—it’s decorative, not functional. Sensory detail is selective (musty books, soft glow), but remains atmospheric rather than instrumental. The subway functions as transit, not crucible; neighborhoods lack specificity, reducing the city to a vague backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    The subway utility tunnel and glass harmonica disc create a vivid, immersive atmosphere, with sensory layering (hum, ethereal tones) that mirrors the operator’s emotional state. However, the setting never constrains choice or alters tactics—it functions as backdrop, not crucible. The recurring disc enriches tone but doesn’t charge the final image through causal interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.7)
    The blooming jetty at twilight is vividly rendered with sensory detail (scent, light, waves), and the setting mirrors mood effectively. However, it functions as backdrop, not crucible—it never constrains choice, alters tactics, or evolves in response to action. The flowers “bloom more vibrantly” magically in response to the archivist’s presence, which breaks verisimilitude without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.9)
    The ivy-clad station provides atmospheric texture but doesn’t constrain choices or alter tactics; it’s a backdrop, not a crucible. Sensory detail is selective (ivy as “skeletal fingers”) yet static—no evolution as the crowd gathers. The moon rock could serve as micro-setting, but its physical presence fades after the midpoint, missing a chance to charge the final image through tactile recurrence.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ultrasonic forest is vividly rendered through non-visual senses—resonance, scent, vibration—and directly shapes perception. The platinum ring functions as micro-setting, glowing to guide, and the skin-tattoos absorb environmental language, making body and tool inseparable from place. Sensory hierarchy aligns with the blind POV, avoiding tourist description. Yet the setting never *constrains* a choice—it enables without resistance, missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    The gravitational anomaly functions effectively as micro-setting, charging atmosphere through sensory thickening and responsive spacetime. The fountain pen acts as a tactile anchor that constrains choice (must be unbent to write). Descriptions are selective and POV-filtered (“fragile as a spider’s web”), though the garden’s weeds lack spatial specificity. Final image ties setting to theme, satisfying the 9+ gate condition.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.1)
    The luminous harbor and vintage camera are vividly rendered with sensory specificity, especially moonlight on water and lens. However, setting never constrains choice—the harbor is backdrop, not crucible. The camera appears twice but doesn’t alter tactics; it’s decorative symbolism. Final image charges atmosphere but not narrative stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.1)
    The archive setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail (aged parchment, flickering lights, desert night), and the tapestry fragment functions as a micro-setting. However, the environment doesn’t constrain choices or alter tactics—Elian moves freely, creates unimpeded, and departs without spatial or logistical pressure. The setting serves atmosphere but not causality, failing the 9+ gate of constraining action or charging the final image beyond decorative recurrence.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sound wave garden and auric lagoon are vividly rendered with synesthetic specificity (petal-like resonators, pulsing lights), and sensory detail aligns with Aria’s attunement to vibration. The setting charges the final image—the lagoon’s lingering glow symbolizes fragile connection—but doesn’t constrain choice; Aria could drum anywhere. Still, the garden’s responsiveness elevates it beyond backdrop, functioning as a micro-setting that mirrors internal states without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    The shipping container labyrinth is vividly rendered with salt, rust, flickering lights, and howling wind, creating a tactile, oppressive atmosphere. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment mirrors the protagonist’s isolation and curiosity. Crucially, the setting functions as micro-setting: containers shape acoustics (supporting the whisper motif) and navigation (via maps), directly enabling the core concept. However, it doesn’t *constrain* a pivotal choice—thus missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cobalt dock, rain, and mist create vivid, consistent atmosphere with strong sensory layering (ozone, wet earth, lapping water). However, setting never constrains choice or alters tactics—it’s a backdrop, not a crucible. The dental mirror and shutters are noted but don’t function as micro-settings that pressure decisions. Final image uses sky reflection effectively, but environment doesn’t earn 9+ integration.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt library and magnetic grotto are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (“scent of old parchment,” “pulsed with otherworldly energy”), but neither setting constrains choice or alters tactics. Descriptions remain atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure; Elian moves through spaces without spatial choreography or environmental consequence. Final image isn’t charged by setting—it merely restates mist and starlight without transformation tied to place.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sublittoral fringe is vividly rendered with indigo light, wooden slats, and lunar glow, and the scrimshaw functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. However, the environment doesn’t constrain Kael’s choices—she slips into the water freely, unimpeded by tide, depth, or risk. Sensory detail is lush but ornamental, serving atmosphere over tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    The wind turbines and overgrown farmhouse function as micro-setting that charges the final image—the turbines’ hum contrasts Echo’s silence, framing industrial memory against fragile human ritual. The dried bouquet, mantle, and whittled trinkets form a tactile interior that constrains Echo’s actions and symbolizes transience. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., “faded to a soft, muted hue”), avoiding tourist cataloging. Environment directly shapes tone and thematic weight at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is vividly rendered and filtered through Lyra’s poetic perception—frost, quartz hum, cobalt light all serve atmosphere. The frozen lake as “canvas of white silk” and colonnade as “sentinel” are strong motifs. Yet the environment never constrains choice or alters tactics; it remains a passive stage. For 9+ eligibility, the setting must pressure action, which it does not.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.1)
    The courtyard is vividly rendered with sensory detail—furnaces, glass, breeze—but functions as backdrop, not crucible. The concertina reed and plants appear within it but don’t constrain choices. No spatial choreography emerges; bodies and objects float without tactile interaction. The setting supports tone but doesn’t shape tactics or charge the ending beyond aesthetic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    The “laboratory of lost sounds” is vividly rendered with luminescent orbs, dusty instruments, and golden shadows, creating a cohesive sensory world. The carbide lamp lens functions as micro-setting, briefly constraining attention during cleaning. However, the environment never pressures choice or alters tactics—the lab is a static stage, not an active participant. Strong atmosphere lacks consequential integration.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observatory functions as a potent micro-setting: its domed ceiling, starlight, and sandalwood-myrrh air directly shape mood and action. Crucially, the curtains of intention—anchored in this space—constrain the maker’s method (origami placement) and charge the final image as they ripple and illuminate. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (e.g., “fabric… ripple and flow like a liquid”), filtered through the maker’s grief-turned-hope. The setting evolves causally: stars brighten *in response* to the maker’s work, reinforcing reciprocity between environment and inner state without static repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (rain drumming, ethereal glow, soft blue dawn) and functions as micro-setting. However, it never constrains choice or alters tactics—it’s atmospheric backdrop, not active environment. The measuring tape and onyx ink are noted but don’t interact with space to shape action. Final image of the empty loft “waiting” is evocative but doesn’t reconfigure stakes or charge closure with environmental consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    The archive setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (saffron veil, luminescent orbs, grimy windows) and functions as micro-setting: it constrains access to knowledge and frames the pagoda’s activation at twilight. The bronze prism pagoda itself acts as a charged object-as-setting, its facets reflecting light and perception. Final image ties setting to transformed inner state, satisfying the 9+ gate for environmental charge.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    The blooming library above clouds is vividly specific and tonally cohesive, with luminescent orbs, floating shelves, and cloud-soft floors creating a dreamlike yet consistent micro-setting. Sensory detail (scent of parchment, warm stone) is filtered through POV and supports theme. However, the setting never constrains choice or supplies tactical resources—it’s atmospheric backdrop, not active crucible. Thus, it falls just short of the 9-band gate requiring environmental constraint on decision.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    The misty workshop is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (damp air, scent of earth, starlight) and filters perception through Lena’s professional attention. However, the setting never constrains choice or supplies resources—it functions as atmospheric backdrop, not micro-setting. The chameleon’s branch and tail are handled, but the environment doesn’t pressure decisions. Strong tone control earns high marks, but 9+ gate fails due to lack of tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tower, dawn mist, luminescent flora, and damp earth create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that filters through Elian’s perception. The frosted hourglass and coffee rings function as micro-settings with symbolic texture. However, the environment never constrains choice—the tower is a passive backdrop, not a crucible. Despite lush detail, it doesn’t shape tactics or charge the final image beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.1)
    The projection booth is vividly rendered with tactile specificity (“scent of old celluloid and dust,” “soft hum of the projector”). The film strip functions as micro-setting, charging the final image when returned to the floor. Yet the environment doesn’t constrain choice—the gazer moves freely, and the palace remains ornamental backdrop rather than active pressure. The thunder motif bookends effectively but doesn’t alter tactics.

    The towers of bone, canyon of echoes, and copper-veined protagonist create a vivid, original micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and woven through perception (“shadows danced across the towers… reverberate with the whispers”). The environment doesn’t constrain choice but deeply informs tone and theme, satisfying the micro-setting exception for lyric work.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.1)
    The underground garden is atmospherically rendered with sensory detail (damp earth, moss-covered stone), but it functions as backdrop, not crucible—it neither constrains Lena’s choices nor supplies resources that alter outcome. The flint arrowhead and cordless phone are props, not environmental pressures. No spatial choreography emerges; the setting doesn’t evolve or respond to events.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    The enchanted orchard is vividly rendered with stardust blooms and sky-bridge light, functioning as both setting and micro-setting. The locust shell and violin constrain choice by symbolizing fragility and agency. Spatial choreography is coherent: statues uproot, move toward Luna, dance. Final image charges the setting—the orchard’s stillness now “holds the promise of future music”—fulfilling the 9+ gate for environment shaping closure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.9)
    The cobalt arcade’s neon glow and prize counters establish mood effectively, and the thunderstorm bottle functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent during the border crossing, and twilight’s “brittle hush” mirrors tension. However, the setting never constrains choice—the arcade could be any liminal space, and the drones patrol without environmental interaction. Vivid but ultimately decorative; fails the 9+ gate by lacking tactical influence.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is vividly rendered: rust, lantern light, mist, wind bells, and the abandoned train create a cohesive, atmospheric microcosm. The halo fragment and carousel horse function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear despite dreamlike transitions. However, the setting never constrains choice—it decorates rather than pressures, missing the 9+ gate for environmental agency.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    The scientific poetry library is vividly rendered as a liminal space where art and science entwine, and sensory details (sandalwood, paper scent, reading lamps) are selective and POV-filtered. The tattered silk scarf functions as micro-setting, charging the final image. However, the environment doesn’t constrain choices—it merely frames them. Still, specificity and tone cohere beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.9)
    The whispering archipelago is vividly rendered through selective sensory detail (“gentle lapping,” “weathered dock,” “otherworldly light”) filtered through Elian’s perception. The heirloom palette and camera function as micro-settings that charge the ritual. However, the environment never constrains choice or alters tactics—it decorates rather than pressures. The final image shimmers, but the setting doesn’t shape the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is vividly rendered and filtered through the locksmith’s perception—starlight, ancient stones, gnarled tree—all contribute to a cohesive, mythic atmosphere. The “shadowed nexus under starlight” functions as micro-setting that channels action (guides path, reveals clearing). However, it never constrains choice or alters tactics; the environment is stage dressing rather than active pressure. Final image gains resonance from setting, but no object or terrain feature forces a decision with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sunken orchard, greenhouse, and shipwrecks create a vivid, tactile environment that filters through Emilia’s folklorist gaze (“skeletal remains,” “damp earth and decaying fruit”). Sensory detail is selective and mood-aligned, though the setting functions more as mood backdrop than active constraint—no spatial obstacle alters her choices. Still, the recurring image of shipwrecks as “sentinels” charges the final walk, satisfying micro-setting resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    The forgotten library functions as a potent micro-setting: dust motes, creaking shelves, and the scent of old books aren’t backdrop but active atmosphere that shapes focus and ritual. The playground swing outside charges the final image, contrasting inner stillness with external emptiness. Crucially, the cup and glass constrain the archivist’s actions—they must annotate *through* tea leaves and shadow. This specificity elevates setting beyond mood into tactical terrain.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    Vivid sensory language establishes the waterfall parapet with golden light, birdsong, and mist, creating a lush backdrop. However, the setting never pressures Aria’s choices—it’s a passive stage, not a crucible. The waterfall becomes a “shimmering veil” only after magic succeeds, not as a constraint or resource that shapes action. Descriptions are beautiful but ornamental, failing the 9+ gate of constraining choice or charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prism sanctuary under starlight functions effectively as micro-setting: prismatic walls refract light onto the restorer’s hands, directly charging the needle’s glint and the net’s unwinding. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—luminescent orbs, porcelain fragments, tangled fibers—all serving the restorer’s tactile focus. Yet the environment never constrains choice; it decorates rather than pressures, missing the 9+ gate despite vivid specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rain-scoured fresco vault, henge stones, and damp earth create a cohesive, immersive atmosphere filtered through Elara’s cartographic sensitivity. Sensory detail (mold, drumming rain, creases in maps) serves mood and theme but doesn’t constrain action or alter tactics—Elara could be anywhere. The setting charges the final image (“rain-washed world”) but doesn’t function as micro-setting that forces choice. Vivid yet passive; it decorates rather than pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sunken ship library is vividly rendered through luminescent fish, salt-rot scent, and tactile debris, functioning as a micro-setting that constrains action (wading, picking up objects). The snow globe evolves from trinket to symbol, charging the final image. However, spatial choreography falters slightly—mirror appears without prior setup, and the library’s layout remains impressionistic rather than navigable.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “misty courtyard above clouds” functions as a charged micro-setting: its thin reality enables the ghost in code, and weather directly pressures the balladeer’s act (storm intensifies her strokes). The flower press bolt plate and stone bench are tactile anchors that evolve in meaning. Sensory detail (ozone, wet stone, charcoal scratch) is vivid and filtered through the balladeer’s drifting alertness. Yet the setting never constrains a pivotal choice—it facilitates but doesn’t force action, missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    The icebound spire is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (frost-etched walls, ethereal light, hissing mechanisms) and filters perception through Elara’s inquisitive gaze. The setting shapes mood and metaphor but does not constrain action or alter tactics—she moves freely, unimpeded by the environment. The goggles and diary gain symbolic weight, yet the spire itself remains a backdrop, not an active force.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sky gondola, clouds, and brass telescope create a vivid, immersive atmosphere filtered through Lyra’s meteorological sensibility. Sensory detail is selective and profession-inflected (cloud textures, light on brass), and the setting mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. However, the environment never constrains choice or alters tactics—it’s a backdrop, not a crucible. Thus, it falls short of the 9+ gate requiring environmental agency.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tree trunk library functions as a potent micro-setting: its hollowed sanctity, dappled light, and impending demolition directly charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (musty parchment, golden light, indigo sky), evolving with emotional cadence. The setting constrains choice—nowhere else could this act of preservation occur—and mirrors internal stakes. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    The antique airship, starling murmurations, and hopscotch board create a richly textured micro-setting that feels lived-in and specific. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—yellowed charts, creaking wood, dim cabin light—all filtered through Eli’s attentive POV. However, while evocative, the setting never constrains choice or alters tactics; it functions as backdrop, not crucible. The hopscotch board aids decoding but imposes no real limitation or risk, missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    The frozen library above clouds is vividly rendered with sensory precision (“frost-encrusted doors,” “wood smoke,” “glittering frost”) and filtered through Kael’s professional perception. Setting functions as micro-setting: icy shelves and crystalline foundations shape navigation and mood. Yet it never constrains choice—the environment is ornamental, not instrumental. Final image gains atmospheric charge but doesn’t alter stakes or tactics, missing the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.1)
    Elyria’s orchard beauty and floating rock arches are vividly rendered, but they remain postcard scenery. The butterfly garden and watering bell function as micro-settings, yet only the bell charges the final image. The nebula’s energy alters the landscape, but spatial choreography lacks tactile interaction—settlers “work” off-stage. No environmental detail constrains a pivotal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    The hidden lighthouse at dusk functions effectively as micro-setting, its glass pane amplifying silence and framing the adjuster’s ritual. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric—glass, fading light, humming clockwork—but never stalls momentum. The recurring “pane of hush” blurs environment and emotional state without over-symbolizing. However, the setting doesn’t actively constrain choices; it reflects rather than pressures, missing the 9+ gate requiring environmental causality.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    Setting is vividly rendered—the overgrown orchard, dusty cottage, cliffside labyrinth—and sensory details (smell of decay, golden sunset, ethereal glow) serve atmosphere. However, the environment rarely constrains choice; the nut and blueprint drive action, not terrain. The “graceless beauty” descriptor is evocative but static, not woven into tactical decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.9)
    The braided ravine is vividly rendered and functions as both setting and metaphor, with foam patterns and chrysalis anchoring Maria’s insight. However, the environment never constrains action or forces a tactical shift—it decorates rather than pressures. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (symphonically minded ears), yet fails the 9+ gate: no object or terrain feature alters a decision or charges the ending beyond resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glass orchard library is vividly rendered with refractive light, swirling clouds, and ethereal music, creating a cohesive, immersive micro-setting.

Though beautiful, it doesn’t pressure decisions or alter tactics, missing the 9+ gate despite strong specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    The desert fortress after rain and the coral icebound pavilion create a striking atmospheric duality—earth and ocean, solidity and fragility—that mirrors Elara’s internal work. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (wet stone, blooming flowers, cool sand), though the tidal pool functions more as symbol than constraint. The setting charges the final image but doesn’t actively narrow options during key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    The clock tower and grain elevator are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (aged wood, rusty voice), and “borrowed starlight” creates atmospheric cohesion. However, setting functions as backdrop, not constraint—no spatial choreography affects Emilia’s choices. The cuckoo weight is noticed but never handled; environment doesn’t pressure action, violating the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.1)
    The moonlit canyon and broken periscope mirror are vividly rendered and tonally cohesive, with sensory detail (silvery glow, cracked glass) filtered through Elara’s perception. However, the setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint—the canyon exerts no pressure on choices, and the moonlight serves mood, not mechanics. The mirror qualifies as micro-setting but doesn’t alter tactics beyond being a passive vessel.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    Setting details are vivid and filtered through the archivist’s perception (“damp earth and moss,” “mist-shrouded mountains”), yet the grotto never constrains choice—it’s a passive backdrop. The manuscript and doodle function as micro-settings but don’t alter tactics. Atmosphere supports theme but doesn’t pressure decisions; the environment is evocative but inert in shaping outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    The siskin alder grove is vividly textured with tactile specificity (sap-stained fingers, glazed porcelain), and the porcelain insulator functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the sculptor’s perception. Yet the setting never actively constrains choice—it enables but doesn’t pressure, missing the 9+ gate for environmental agency.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.1)
    The magnetic nexus and twilight setting are vividly described with sensory detail (wildflowers, stars, basalt dent), but function as mood wallpaper, not a micro-setting that pressures choice. The basalt dent recurs but doesn’t constrain action. Setting charges tone but not tactics—misses 9+ gate by lacking causal integration with closure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmosphere is lush and sensory—sandalwood, jasmine, lanterns, stars—but remains decorative. The workshop setting never constrains action or alters tactics; it’s a mood backdrop, not a crucible. While vivid, details serve ambiance over agency, missing the 9+ gate requiring environmental pressure on choice. Still, sensory hierarchy aligns with Elara’s calm state, avoiding white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    The treetop village and floral scents create vivid atmosphere, and sensory detail aligns with Lyra’s olfactory POV. However, the setting never constrains choice or alters tactics—the apothecary, trees, and market serve as backdrop, not crucible. The corpse flower’s environment is generic; no spatial or ecological pressure affects cultivation. Final image (“wildflower hush that echoed through the trees”) resonates lyrically but doesn’t charge closure with environmental consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    The orchard planet with floating rock arches and inverted gravity is vividly rendered and shapes navigation via water flow. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., “tendrils curling like ethereal fingers”).

The glowing pool charges the final image but the environment never imposes real tactical limits.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (rust, saltwater, creaking steel, orange sunset) and filters through the investigator’s professional attention. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the labyrinth constrains movement, creating atmospheric pressure. However, it never actively shapes a tactical choice or alters outcome—it remains backdrop, not crucible—preventing 9+ eligibility despite strong atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ice cavern is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (luminescent fungi, crystalline hum) and filters perception through Elian’s synesthesia. However, setting never constrains choice—it’s a passive stage, not an active force. The amber sheet and aurora are described but don’t alter tactics, missing the 9+ gate despite strong atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Thunder-echo range, sagebrush, canyon hush, and driftwood markers create a vivid, sensory-rich micro-setting that filters through the keeper’s contemplative POV. The gilded reed flute functions as object-as-setting, constraining focus and charging the final image with its “inner light.” Weather and terrain mirror internal states without overt symbolism. Yet the setting never actively pressures choice—no obstacle, resource, or spatial constraint alters her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Topaz workshop, luminescent orbs, and letterpress form a rich micro-setting that charges the final image—the press integrates the Halo fragment, making tools and environment active participants.

Yet the setting never constrains choice; everything needed is always at hand, missing the 9+ gate of tactical limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway is richly sensory and filtered through Eira’s perceptual bias, with selective detail (worn satchel, smooth path) grounding the mythic tone. The pendant functions as micro-setting, its vibrations altering social dynamics. Yet the environment never constrains choice—it enables connection without friction or limitation. For 9+ eligibility, the setting must pressure tactics; here it merely beautifies, capping impact despite lyrical strength.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmosphere is vividly rendered—the quartz arbor, mist, frost-etched glass—but functions as backdrop, not constraint. Sensory detail (damp earth, muted sounds) establishes mood yet never pressures choice or alters tactics. The prism and car window are observed, not interacted with in ways that shape outcome. Setting charges tone but doesn’t tighten options or embody the mystic’s emotional absorption thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.9)
    The forgotten orchard and bamboo forest are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (scent of blooms, dappled light, rustling stalks), and the amber bead functions as micro-setting. However, the environment never constrains choice—it’s a passive backdrop. The puzzle appears on the grass but isn’t sourced from the setting; the forest shifts from “barrier” to “conduit” via assertion, not spatial or tactical interaction. Still, atmosphere is immersive and tonally cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting details are vivid and filtered through the blacksmith’s professional attention: orchard scent contrasts forge heat, floating arches echo transformation, mine shafts serve as testing grounds. The magician’s silk and glowing metal function as micro-settings that constrain choice (deliberate wrapping). Final image charges the setting—the sword’s inner light mirrors the planet’s mystical geology. Yet the orchard planet’s rules remain decorative; no environmental pressure alters tactics during forging.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.1)
    The repair bay is vividly rendered through rust, skeletal starships, and grimy light, and the green glass shard functions as a micro-setting that charges perception.

The final image is charged by atmosphere but not by environmental pressure or spatial consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    The floating rock tea house and valley-mist setting are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (lantern glow, clinking ceramics, steaming tea). However, the environment functions as backdrop, not constraint: it never pressures Kaito’s choices or alters tactics. The blue morpho wing acts as micro-setting but isn’t integrated causally—it refracts light beautifully, yet this action has no stakes beyond visual spectacle. Atmosphere is lush but inert.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.1)
    Setting is vividly rendered—damp stone, ozone, stormlit tower—and filtered through the worker’s perception. The moon functions as micro-setting: its light enables the healing and charges the final image. Yet the environment doesn’t constrain action; rain and wind are backdrop, not pressure. The sextant and hands are better “setting” than the tower itself, limiting spatial choreography’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly rendered with luminescent fungi, shimmering leaves, and mica refraction—sensory detail supports theme and tone. The setting evolves: darkness recedes as the song progresses, tying environment to emotional arc. Yet the greenhouse never constrains choice; it’s a passive stage, not a crucible. The mica window charges the final image but doesn’t limit or enable action beyond serving as a portal.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.3)
    The secret society library is vividly rendered through scent (“old paper”), light (“lanterns”), and tactile detail (“dusty tomes”), all filtered through Elys’s reclusive sensibility. The setting functions as micro-setting: it enables Elys’s method of “staying while leaving” and supplies the pivotal book. However, the environment doesn’t actively constrain choices—Elys moves freely, finds the text effortlessly—so it charges mood more than tactics. The final image (dawn light, musty books) resonates but doesn’t reconfigure spatial stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is vividly rendered—the overgrown palace, vine-woven tea house, and autumnal decay create strong atmosphere—but it remains decorative. The environment doesn’t constrain choices; the noticer moves freely, eats bread, sips tea without spatial or temporal pressure. Sensory detail is lush yet passive, filtered through aesthetic appreciation rather than urgency. The tea house charges mood but not meaning: it could be swapped for any secluded garden without altering the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    The frozen library above the clouds is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (“crisp air,” “ethereal glow”) filtered through Elara’s professional attention.

The magic lantern slide charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate partially, though it doesn’t alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.1)
    Atmosphere is vividly rendered—saltwater, rusting machinery, pier slats—but setting rarely pressures choice. The pirate market functions as backdrop, not crucible; spatial choreography is vague (“edge of the crowd,” “deeper into the market”). The watch fob qualifies as micro-setting but doesn’t constrain action. Sunrise motif is noted but doesn’t alter tactics meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lavender bluff, aurora, and blooming fields create vivid, multi-sensory atmosphere with strong olfactory and visual specificity. The setting functions as micro-setting: lavender scent triggers taste-based sensing, and the bluff’s elevation frames the horizon-gazing. However, environment never constrains choice—Aria moves freely without spatial or tactical consequence. Final image uses setting lyrically but not causally.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vividly rendered with luminescence, hum, and spatial presence, and it actively shapes the climax—the crystals “channel” emotion and respond to creation. Yet it never constrains Elara’s choices; she enters, works freely, and leaves unimpeded. The setting functions as mood amplifier, not crucible, missing the 9+ gate requiring environmental constraint or tactical influence.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is vividly rendered—the acidic mist, decaying infrastructure, orchid vendor—but remains decorative rather than constraining. The greenhouse city establishes mood but doesn’t alter Aria’s tactics or access; she moves unimpeded through tunnels. The toxic sky recurs but exerts no tangible pressure on action. Final image gains resonance from setting, yet environment never forces a live choice.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.1)
    The Whispering Bluff is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (clouds, light, hum), and the kinetic sculpture functions as micro-setting. However, the environment never constrains choice or alters tactics—Aria acts without spatial or atmospheric pressure. The iceberg fragment’s rainbow reflection charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate partially, but setting remains decorative backdrop rather than active participant in conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glass-domed desert rose farm functions effectively as a micro-setting: it confines, amplifies heat, and mirrors Aria’s internal claustrophobia. Sensory detail is selective (scent of blooms, hum of machinery, smoke-thick air) and filtered through her caretaker POV. Crucially, the dome constrains her escape and intensifies the fire, directly shaping her final act of containment—fulfilling the 9+ gate condition even if the score falls just short due to minor abstraction in “magnetic north.”

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.4)
    The “vibrant courtyard at dawn” functions as decorative backdrop, not micro-setting that constrains choice. Sensory details (bird chirps, morning hum) are generic and recycled; the locket and mailbox appear but don’t alter spatial choreography or access. The setting never pressures decisions—Emilia moves freely, gathers intel effortlessly, and returns unchanged. No object or environment forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sunken laboratory is vividly rendered through saltwater decay, rust, and dim light, creating strong atmospheric specificity. However, the setting functions as backdrop rather than crucible—it never constrains Aria’s choices or supplies resources that affect her escape. The spider’s web and window are observed, not interacted with; the environment reflects her thoughts but doesn’t pressure them. For 9+ eligibility, the setting must shape tactics or charge closure, which it does not.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is vividly rendered—the salt crystal chamber, harbor at dusk, subterranean tunnels—and filtered through the lighter’s sensory priorities. The crystalline structures refract light meaningfully, and the lanterns evolve from task to symbol. Crucially, the environment constrains nothing but charges the final image: the pulsing blue crystal becomes the locus of reclaimed past. Sensory detail supports tone without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (brook, rustle, floral scent) and filters through the summoner’s attuned perception. However, it never constrains choice—it’s a passive backdrop, not a crucible. The brook enables the ending gesture but doesn’t pressure tactics earlier. Atmosphere dominates function, missing the 9+ gate requiring environmental constraint on action.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.9)
    The rooftop garden and meteor shower create vivid, sensory-rich atmosphere, but function as backdrop rather than crucible. The antique desk seal qualifies as micro-setting and charges the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate condition partially—but it doesn’t constrain choices during the scene (e.g., no one fumbles it, hides it, or uses it to decode something). Sensory detail is selective and mood-aligned, yet the environment never pressures decisions; the city hums distantly but exerts no influence. The seal’s “otherworldly glow” at the end edges into unearned mysticism without prior physical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.1)
    The “velvet garden at twilight” provides atmospheric cohesion and sensory texture, with flowers and light shifts mirroring Lyra’s emotional state. However, the setting never constrains choice or supplies resources—it’s a backdrop, not a crucible. The seashell functions as micro-setting but isn’t integrated spatially (e.g., no tactile interaction beyond holding). Vivid prose can’t compensate for environmental passivity in a single-scene structure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, stalactites, and candles cohere into a vivid, sensory-rich micro-setting that mirrors the forger’s interiority. Crucially, the environment constrains nothing—it’s a passive backdrop, not an active force. Yet the recurring rose thorn and pearl twilight hue charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate minimally. Descriptions are lush but risk overwriting; still, spatial choreography remains clear and immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.1)
    The “serpentine nexus under starlight” and whispering seashell create a vivid, immersive atmosphere filtered through Aria’s perception. Sensory detail is selective and poetic, though over-reliant on auditory motifs. The shell functions as micro-setting, charging the final image by remaining warm then quiet. However, the environment never constrains choice—it decorates rather than pressures, missing the 9+ gate for setting-as-agent.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glacier shrine and melted snow globe create vivid, selective atmosphere with tactile detail (“frozen floor,” “melting ice,” “glittering particles”). Sensory hierarchy aligns with Aria’s trance-like state, favoring visual and thermal cues. However, setting never constrains choice—the ice shrine is backdrop, not crucible—and the final image lacks environmental pressure shaping outcome, capping Q3 below 9-band despite strong texture.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.1)
    Atmosphere is lush and sensory, with mist, fireflies, wet earth, and moonlight woven cohesively. However, setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint: the whispering parapet and gardens don’t shape decisions or limit options. The bamboo whisk qualifies as micro-setting but doesn’t alter spatial choreography or access. Vivid but decorative—no 9+ gate met.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.9)
    The wasteland orchard is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (radioactive dust storms, sickly yellow sunset), and the setting pressures movement (“buffeted her around”). Yet it functions as backdrop rather than constraint—trees loom ominously but never alter Aria’s path or tactics. The orchard’s paradoxical thriving hints at deeper rules, but those aren’t leveraged to shape choice or charge the final image beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.1)
    The “stormlit observatory above the clouds” and “cobalt glass portico” provide vivid atmospheric anchors, and the setting evolves symbolically—from isolation to beacon. However, the environment never constrains action or alters tactics; it functions as backdrop, not crucible. Sensory detail leans heavily visual, with little tactile or auditory grounding beyond “winds howling.” The setting charges mood but not meaning or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    The feral loft functions as micro-setting: grimy windows, creaking floorboards, and dusty relics ground the poet’s emotional state without overt symbolism. The music box and glass jars are tactile, recurring objects that charge the final image. Light progression from “faint” to “growing” mirrors internal shift, and spatial choreography remains coherent. However, the dunes appear only in the final paragraph as postcard backdrop, missing an opportunity to constrain earlier choices.

    The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (creaking ice, golden sunset, gull cries) that grounds the scene. Details reflect Azure Coat’s professional attention, and the lighthouse functions as both setting and symbol. However, the environment doesn’t constrain choices—it merely provides ambiance, missing the 9+ gate of tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.7)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and rain-glistened viaduct create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere with strong visual and tactile specificity. However, the setting functions as backdrop, not crucible: it never constrains choice, alters tactics, or supplies resources. The ice “stretches like a vast sea” but poses no risk; the sanctuary echoes footsteps but doesn’t shape action. For 9+ eligibility, an environmental element must charge the final image—here, the glow is decorative, not consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    Setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (damp earth, dripping water, graffiti) and filtered through Maya’s professional attention. The lantern qualifies as micro-setting and charges the final image, though it doesn’t constrain tactical choices mid-scene. Weather (“rain-washed world”) contrasts interior gloom effectively, but subway tunnel remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure shaping decisions. Strong tone-setting, but environment doesn’t alter outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    The antique shop is vividly rendered with sensory texture (ticking, whirring, grimy light), and the clockwork heart qualifies as micro-setting. However, the environment never constrains choice or alters tactics—the chaplain could have this realization anywhere. The music box gift is decorative, not instrumental. Atmosphere supports theme but doesn’t charge the final image through causal interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vividly rendered—gears-and-cogs workshop, acid sea, kaleidoscope—and sensory details (corroding metal, swirling clouds) create strong atmosphere. However, the environment never constrains Zephyr’s actions or forces trade-offs; she observes decay with “wonder” but faces no spatial, material, or tactical limitations from the setting. The acid sea functions as backdrop, not crucible, failing the 9+ gate that requires environmental pressure on choice or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive setting is vividly rendered through sensory detail (“dimly lit room,” “dusty hard drives,” “whispers of the past”) and filtered through Lena’s obsessive attention. However, it functions atmospherically rather than functionally—it never constrains her choices or supplies resources that alter outcomes. The recurring numbers and patch are noticed, not interacted with in ways that shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (frost-rimed grass, scent of old wood, pale sky etched like pen and ink).

Yet the environment never constrains choice—ice floes shift passively, trees stand taller only after success—missing the 9+ gate requiring environmental pressure on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.1)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered with tactile specificity—the creaking ice, stinging cold, windborne solace—and filters perception through the protagonist’s dissociation. The parasol tip serves as micro-setting, anchoring memory and fragility. However, the environment doesn’t constrain choices; it remains atmospheric rather than instrumental. Final image reweights the ice as symbol of impermanence, satisfying 9+ gate partially.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmosphere is vividly rendered—the amber pavilion, golden leaves, scent of grapes—but setting rarely constrains choice or charges the final image beyond mood. The vineyard’s topography mirrors theme but doesn’t pressure decisions. Sensory detail is lush yet static, functioning as backdrop rather than active force. The burned letter and bench are handled, but the environment itself doesn’t shape the sentinel’s arc.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sandalwood, myrrh, dunes, and pavilion create a vivid sensory tapestry, and spatial choreography remains coherent. However, setting never constrains choice—the murmuring pavilion fades passively rather than exerting active pressure.

The final image leans on postcard beauty rather than charged reconfiguration tied to character action.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    The library functions as a potent micro-setting: grimy windows, stone floor, chandelier crystal—all constrain perception and action. Sensory detail (scent of parchment, wet earth outside) is selective and POV-filtered. The crystal’s facets glinting in dawn light directly charge the final image. However, the setting doesn’t actively alter tactics—more backdrop than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    The fog sculpture garden functions as both environment and micro-setting: fog obscures and reveals, statues mirror stillness, gravel crunches underfoot—all filtered through the prophet’s perception. Chalk and driftwood constrain her ritualistic method, charging the final arrangement. However, the setting never actively pressures choice beyond mood; it reflects rather than shapes her journey, missing the 9+ gate requiring environmental constraint on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.8)
    The “lunar observatory above the clouds” is evocative but functions as postcard backdrop; it never constrains choice or supplies resources affecting outcome.

The sea glass and polishing wheel are handled, but the environment itself exerts no pressure or opportunity.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned data center turned moss garden is vividly rendered and filters perception through Aria’s trauma and longing. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—the “honeyed hush,” rusting servers veiled in moss—creating a sanctuary that mirrors internal states without overt symbolism. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: the pendant glints in soft light *within* this reclaimed space, tying environment to thematic closure. This qualifies for the 9+ gate, though minor overwriting (“intricate beauty… caught her breath”) slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.8)
    The “feral nexus” and mist establish mood but never constrain action or alter choices—the setting remains decorative backdrop. Sensory detail leans heavily visual (“diffused light,” “swirling patterns”) with minimal tactile or auditory grounding, flattening immersion. The shell fragment acts as micro-setting but only symbolically; it doesn’t physically impede, enable, or evolve in state across beats. Final image (“talisman on desk”) charges theme but not narrative consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.1)
    The verdant arbor is vividly rendered with sensory specificity—dew, hum, golden light—and functions as micro-setting that evolves from backdrop to sacred space. However, it never constrains choice or alters tactics; Elara’s inventions work regardless of environment. The vine tendril charges the final image but doesn’t shape decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    The kinetic lagoon above the clouds is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (“palette of blues and whites,” “staccato beat” of the camera wheel), filtered through the scavenger’s melancholic POV. The setting functions as micro-setting: the halted carousel and mirrored surface directly shape thematic resonance and the scavenger’s actions. The disposable camera wheel constrains choice (only so many shots) and charges the final image. No white-room syndrome; spatial logic holds, though physical interaction with the environment remains light.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.1)
    The abandoned spaceport is vividly rendered with faded signs, rusting pipes, and shifting symbols, filtered through Maya’s engineer gaze. However, the setting functions as backdrop, not constraint—it supplies resources (pipes) without resistance or risk. The carnival’s departure adds temporal texture but exerts no pressure on decisions. Final glow resonates visually but doesn’t arise from environmental causality.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is vividly rendered—the clock tower, rain-glazed courtyard, and pond reflect mood and theme. Sensory detail (petrichor, wet stones, glacial hush) is selective and POV-filtered.

However, the setting never constrains choice or alters tactics; it’s a decorative stage, not an active force. The funhouse’s spatial logic remains vague (labyrinthine corridors, mirrors, posters), creating white-room syndrome beneath the texture. The opera clasp glints but doesn’t function as a micro-setting that pressures action.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating orchard on driftwood is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting: the creaking circle, sea-lapped edges, and blooming flowers directly enable the prophet’s music-making. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—cerulean sky, rustling leaves, salt air—all filtered through her perception. The driftwood constrains her movement and serves as resonant surface, charging the final image of the “tiny, shining jewel” suspended in ocean. Yet the setting doesn’t *foreclose* options or impose tactical limits—it supports but doesn’t pressure her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    The turtle-shell city is vividly rendered with tactile specificity (worn shells, etched patterns), and the setting actively shapes Lyra’s profession and discovery method.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.1)
    The coastal kayak launch is named but not activated as a micro-setting that pressures choice; it’s a backdrop. The astronomical compass and utility poles are recurring objects, but only the compass charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective yet generic (“golden glow,” “sparkled in the fading light”), lacking tactile specificity tied to Jack’s profession or emotional state. The sea shifts from comfort to failure to path forward—but this mirrors theme rather than constraining action.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.9)
    The bioluminescent lake is vividly rendered with sensory specificity—mist, glow, dripping water—and filters through Lena’s jaded wonder. However, the setting functions as backdrop, not constraint: it doesn’t alter tactics, block paths, or supply resources.

    Setting is vividly rendered—tidal bluff, aurora, salt-ozone air—and filters through the herder’s mystical POV. Yet it functions as backdrop, not constraint: no spatial choreography affects rock placement or stardust retrieval. The “borrowed dawn” tone charges the ending visually but doesn’t alter tactics. Lacks the 9+ gate requirement of environment constraining choice.

    The stormlit observatory functions as both macro- and micro-setting: its isolation enables introspection, while the darkroom timer—a tool from her past—charges the final image. Weather actively mirrors internal turmoil, and spatial choreography (edge of observatory, clouds below) remains coherent. Crucially, the setting constrains choice by forcing solitude, making the vigil possible. This integration of environment and object elevates specificity beyond mere backdrop.

    The glass atrium, brook, sundial, and needle card form a cohesive sensory field that supports tone and theme. Light, water, metal, and coded angles recur with purpose, and the setting reflects Aurélien’s interiority without overt symbolism. However, the environment never constrains action—the brook doesn’t affect fencing, the glass doesn’t refract strategy, the sundial’s code is passively “used” without tactile engagement. Vivid but decorative; misses 9+ gate by lacking causal pressure on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rusted library and coffee tin provide atmospheric specificity, and the moon’s arc gives temporal shape. However, setting rarely constrains action—the poet enters freely, works unimpeded, and the environment poses no real obstacle or resource. Descriptions are vivid but decorative; the “canvas” metaphor replaces tactile engagement with abstraction.

    The “tidal arbor above the clouds” is a striking micro-setting that functions as both environment and emotional container, charged with mist, ozone, and wet stone. It constrains no physical choices but deeply shapes tone and perception, filtering reality through melancholy and wonder. The black-and-white film reel and projector act as secondary micro-settings that enable the narrative turn. Final image reweights the arbor as a site of transformation, satisfying the 9+ gate despite lacking tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ancient ridge and blooming flora are vividly rendered and filtered through Aria’s perception, avoiding white-room syndrome. However, setting functions decoratively—it mirrors mood but never constrains choice or supplies resources that affect outcome. The knowledge fruit seed qualifies as micro-setting but doesn’t interact with terrain in a causally significant way.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.1)
    The islet setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail (wet earth, salt, breeze) and supports atmosphere, but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint. No spatial or environmental feature alters Kaito’s tactics—the shore, rock, and sea serve only as passive stages. The compass and lace operate as micro-settings, yet their physical properties don’t shape action (e.g., lace threading isn’t shown as difficult). Final image lacks environmental charge beyond mood reinforcement.
