  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.4)
    The canyon setting and frost mechanics are vividly rendered and integrated into Elara's investigation. The luminous glass shards function as a micro-setting element that constrains tactics (blinding the smugglers). However, spatial choreography during the final confrontation is vague—"they fled or fell"—and the kiln's transformation into an "installation" lacks concrete detail that would charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is present but the canyon itself does not evolve causally with prior events.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.1)
    The winterglass conservatory supplies vivid sensory anchors—"crystalline ferns," "ice orchids pulsing with inner light," "frost-veiled pane"—and the heat-mapping mechanic creates a tactile interaction with the setting. However, spatial choreography during the group scene is vague (atrium layout, lily placement, Kai's proximity), and the conservatory does not meaningfully constrain Elara's choices; it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure source. The micro-setting (tuning fork case) appears but does not alter tactics. The final image recycles earlier description without evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    The underwater library is vividly rendered with bioluminescent anemones, algae-veiled alcoves, coral-encrusted shelves, and enchanted-glass dome holding breathable air. Spatial choreography across the rotunda, shelves, statue, and leviathan fossil remains clear. The "impossible spaces" (vacuum pockets, dry crevices) constrain Elias's method and charge the final lattice convergence, pushing this into the 7+ band. Sensory detail (swelling tomes, pulsing light, muffled wails) modulates with urgency as distress signals intensify.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.2)
    The terra-cotta arbor, its acoustics ("amplified quiet," bell toll), and the ridge's shadows are vividly rendered and recur across beats. The arbor's curved arches and the antique silver bell constrain the community's ritual and charge the final image when Lena rings it. Spatial choreography (ridge, doorsteps, sanction lines) remains clear. However, the setting functions more as atmospheric backdrop than tactical constraint—no on-page moment where the arbor's layout or the ridge's terrain alters a choice under immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    The viaduct's iron arches, blooming wisteria, and misty ravine ground the scene with vivid, selective detail filtered through Elias's spiritually curious lens. The camera obscura functions as micro-setting and tool, constraining the method of healing and charging the projection moment. Spatial choreography is clear (beam, ties, projection screen). The environment does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elias unpacks the obscura unopposed—but the blooming rail ties and foggy lucidity recur in the final image, reweighting the ending without forcing a tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.1)
    The living bridge garden supplies vivid, hyperbolic-geometry-specific detail (saddle-curved paths, heptagonal vine blooms, swaying spans over chasms) and the halo fragment embedded in a pillar at the nexus functions as a spatial anchor that charges the climax. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's designer lens (mossy railings, sap pulses, crushed petals and ozone), and the garden's quaking in sympathy with his reverie integrates setting into emotional state. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Elias navigates it freely without access friction or a tool/boundary that alters his tactics. The micro-setting (body, fragment, vine pillar) appears in the closure beat but does not demonstrably limit or enable the final action; he could perform the same gesture elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.8)
    The carnival setting is vivid—"faded stuffed animals dangled from sagging ceilings," "cotton candy ghosts"—but functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint. The piano bench mechanism and vault entrance are introduced for plot convenience without earlier spatial or access tension. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("scent of mildew and cotton candy ghosts"), though the micro-setting (chains, counter, floorboard) does enable Elara's escape action in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sunken greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks provides a vivid, specific micro-world with sensory layering (bioluminescent fruits, brine-weeping dome, auroral light through water, volcanic pumice forge). The setting constrains Elias's work—he must harvest silences from the wrecks, time his forging to cellular regeneration cycles, and work under auroral light. Spatial choreography remains clear across greenhouse-to-forge-to-wrecks movements. The ashen forge's residual heat and the trembling greenhouse as a wreck shifts both ground action in physical consequence, lifting the setting beyond postcard description to tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    The emerald station is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (jade arches, amber fire, verdant spires). The jar of moonbeams and the portrait constrain one beat each (toppling, beam-dancing), lending modest micro-setting pressure. However, spatial choreography during the theft and escape remains generic; the station functions more as backdrop than as environment that shapes tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.1)
    The control room setting is vividly anchored (cracked observation ports, rusted consoles, meltwater) and the furnace, blowpipe, and marver are handled on the page. However, the environment never constrains a choice or complicates Elias's work—ice melts conveniently, materials are scavenged without friction, and the space enables rather than pressures. Spatial choreography is coherent but the setting functions as backdrop rather than crucible, missing the constraint required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.1)
    The rusted library under stars is vividly sketched ("iron shelves warped by salt air," "constellations piercing the gloom"), and the cliff-edge geography does constrain the final confrontation by making Harlan's thalassophobia tactically relevant. However, spatial choreography collapses in the ending: Elara "lunged not at him, but over the edge" then immediately "swung from a rusted beam" without clear positioning, and the vial's location on the shelf becomes impossible to reach mid-swing. The setting functions as backdrop through most beats rather than shaping choices.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.4)
    The storm and fort are vivid early ("weathered ramparts," "arrow-slit windows"); the spatial choreography (central chamber, alcove) is clear. The flaking booklet and the pauses between gusts serve as micro-setting elements that enable the oracle's lesson. However, the fort's storm-tossed state does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains backdrop. The final image does not tie the setting details to the closure effect, leaving them decorative rather than essential.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    The frozen courtyard at twilight anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph and recurs throughout with purposeful imagery (flagstones, statues, skeletal trees, violet sky). The violin—ice crystal, translucent, sublimating—functions as a micro-setting element that charges the ending when it "grew brittle...cracking softly" and sublimates after fulfilling its purpose. Sensory details (servos whirring, snowflakes dancing, frost-light) are filtered through the robot's POV and the setting constrains the discovery (violin "buried beneath a drift near the central fountain"), meeting the 9+ gate test. Minor penalty: the courtyard's "mundane mysticism" label is told rather than solely shown.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.8)
    The crystal forecourt is lush in mood but remains abstract—no spatial choreography (where Elias's booth sits relative to Mira's path, how large the expanse is) or concrete constraints. The lens and tickets appear as props without altering tactics; Mira pauses, lifts, gasps, but the environment does not pressure her choices. The rain-polished crystals amplify whispers, yet this acoustic detail never limits or enables an action at a key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    The maze is vividly rendered with blooming/withering duality, and the marbles recur with purpose across beats. The fountain and bud constraint shape the ritual climax, and spatial choreography (eastern gate, core, thicket) remains clear. The cracked orb at Elias's neck and the heart marble in the fountain function as micro-setting that charges the final image. However, some details—"sacred circle," "taper from dried leaves"—feel ornamental rather than tactically necessary, and the maze's pressure on choice could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.6)
    The research station cliffs, enclosures, and twilight atmosphere are vivid and consistent. Sensory detail leans heavily visual and some phrases border on ornamental ("velvet shroud," "icy warmth"). The nexus orb is described but not handled across beats; spatial choreography of Elara's movements and the drone repair remains vague. Setting does not constrain the climactic choice—no access, proximity, or tool limitation pressures the lever pull.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.4)
    The flooded opera house and flickering lanterns anchor the setting vividly, and spatial choreography (pit, prompter's box, submerged grates) remains coherent. The lantern serves as a tool that Elias manipulates to accelerate water damage, constraining his choice at the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("water sluicing," "hissing," "groaned"), filtered through urgency. However, the prompter's box and hidden compartment appear late without prior spatial seeding, slightly weakening the sense that environment shaped earlier tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mountain weather station supplies vivid sensory detail—frost-rimed windows, aurora glow, kerosene lamp, barometer ticking—and the botanical illustration becomes a tactile object she physically alters. The smudging action at the desk constrains her ritual and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography (desk, window, lamp) remains coherent throughout, and the setting's isolation amplifies her emotional reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tunnel is vividly anchored (damp gloom, corroded valve, silt, mill-dust phantoms) and the beaded wheel constrains Jax's final choice—he must physically turn it, resisting rust, to release the door. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (drips, truck rumble overhead, chilled smoothness of beads). The wheel's recurring presence (spotted, knelt to trace, gripped, turned) charges the final image and the rosaries woven into spokes supply both texture and plot constraint. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout; the tunnel's claustrophobic frame supports the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory detail is vivid and layered (bioluminescent fungi, vine-choked tomes, obsidian refuge absorbing light), and the overgrown library supplies texture throughout. The underground river and obsidian refuge anchor the final third spatially. However, the environment never constrains a choice: the ground "yields unnaturally" and the stone "parts" without threshold, eliminating friction. The micro-setting (the swan, the alcove, the ledge) is descriptive rather than tactical, preventing entry to the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sage Ridge is anchored early with silvery sagebrush, gnarled roots, and the natural amphitheater, and the eclipse's sensory markers (premature stars, corona glow, birds falling silent) are vivid and purposeful. The locket—a micro-object—constrains Elias's choice to share it during totality, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment/object charge the final image. However, spatial choreography is vague: we don't track how far they've climbed, where the harp sits relative to Lila, or how the roots arch "overhead" on an elevated plateau. The descent afterward feels ornamental rather than causally evolved from the eclipse experience.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.1)
    The silo's tilted axis, leaning bookshelves, and upward-spiraling dust create vivid atmosphere and anchor the conceptual frame. The fireplace chamber and tapestry fragment supply tactile detail. However, the setting remains largely decorative—no spatial constraint shapes Thorne's choices or alters tactics. The final mounting of the tapestry on the central pillar charges the image but arrives as curation rather than consequence. The cap from Q2 orientation debt applies here (7.0 max); score reflects solid atmospheric work without decisive pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lighthouse and tavern are vividly anchored with sensory detail (wind, fog, scarred oak bar, spiral iron stairs, humming gears). The beam's physical function—directing ships, Morse-coding distress—constrains Elias's final orchestration, charging the closure. Micro-setting (the loose floorboard, the lantern room controls) enables the plot turn. However, spatial choreography between tavern and lighthouse blurs during the climax; it's unclear how Elias monitors the spies from above while also manipulating the beam and signaling cutters.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dimensional anchor setting is evocative in atmosphere but remains abstract throughout—"whispering voids," "breathing space"—without spatial choreography or physical anchors that guide action. The loop pedal and palette are handled repeatedly but do not constrain choices in concrete ways (e.g., limited paint, pedal malfunction). Sensory detail skews heavily visual and metaphorical, lacking tactile or embodied grounding that would make the space legible under pressure. The setting does return at closure to charge the final image ("unraveled stillness rewove itself"), meeting the micro-setting test minimally.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    The glass spire and frozen lake are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (transparent walls, mirrored horizon, ice vibrating), and the nautilus shell's tactile presence (pearlescent glow, spiral chambers) constrains Elara's method by serving as her baton. The setting supplies the "mirrored horizon" that enables her conceptual breakthrough. However, spatial choreography falters when ethereal figures materialize on the ice without prior cues, and the spire's interior layout (spiral stairs, cool floor) is sketched but not integrated into her choices. The cap from the Q2 Orientation Test penalty applies here, limiting the score to 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.1)
    The viaduct and rain-suspended droplets anchor the scene vividly early. Spatial choreography remains clear (hovering, descending, pressing tablet to archway). However, the setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint—Elias's gravity defiance removes all environmental pressure, and no physical feature of the viaduct alters his tactics or charges the final image. The glowing stones pulse and flicker but never limit or enable a choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.7)
    The cavern is anchored early with sensory specificity ("shadows pooled," "vibrations humming through stone," "autumn-kissed hills") and recurs across beats (floor quivers, phonograph in a niche, resonant halls). The phonograph base and drum skins provide tactile, constraint-relevant detail that Elara uses to transmit vibration. The setting does not constrain a pivotal choice or visibly alter the outcome, holding it below the 9-band gate, but it charges atmosphere and grounds the action throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    The courtyard functions as a lived-in space (wrought-iron gate, olive tree, workbench, lantern) that both shelters and constrains Elara's choice to work alone. Sensory details (bruised purple sky, gravel paths, golden lantern pools) are filtered through her recorder's attention and modulate with dusk's progression. The setting charges the final image of solitude as bastion, meeting the 9+ gate criterion, though some phrases ("fog-shrouded alleys," "shadowed fringes") trend toward stock atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.1)
    The grotto's "ruddy walls," "labyrinthine curves," and "starlight fracturing through fissures" are vivid and coherent. Spatial choreography is clean: Elias kneels, lays the rope, and the beings coalesce in the chamber's heart. The rope's tactile presence (frayed fibers, warmth from absorbed energy) functions as micro-setting. However, the grotto does not constrain Elias's choice; he could perform the same ritual anywhere the beings appear. The setting charges atmosphere but does not narrow options or supply a resource that alters the outcome, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks functions as a natural auditorium, its "jagged circle" and bioluminescent plankton grounding the ritual space with vivid, selective detail. The "twisted apple trees beneath shattered panes, their branches forever budding without fruit" anchor the theme of incompleteness and are revisited when "a single apple bud trembled," charging the final image. Spatial choreography (piers, wreck-gaps, fire's edge) remains clear, and the setting's acoustics shape Lir's violin work. The greenhouse and wrecks constrain and enable the ritual, satisfying the micro-setting test and elevating the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.2)
    The amber grotto is vividly rendered (honeyed light, resin veins, static charge) and supplies a tool (friction against jagged outcrop) that enables the scent calibration. Spatial choreography is clear (walls, ledge, depths). The grotto constrains one choice (using static to test the petal) but does not charge the final image—Elias steps out carrying the petal, and the setting falls away. Sensory detail is purposeful but not filtered through urgency; crisis does not narrow perception.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    The library setting ("open-air shelves swaying like cargo nets") and pier are vivid and mood-consistent, but they don't constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elias could track Mira anywhere. The locket photo (pier, decades past) charges the final image when Elias presents a new locket photo, creating a purposeful reprise. However, the Orientation Test penalty in Q2 caps this category at 7.0, and sensory detail skews visual without using proximity or access to pressure decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.1)
    The crystalline orchard, shimmering crater, and glimmering obsidian arbor are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory specificity (frost-kissed branches, iridescent mists, volcanic glass facets). Spatial choreography is clear across the search sequence. The arbor functions as a micro-setting that constrains the final action: Elara drapes it with reeds, physically anchoring her communal sculpture. This single constraint-driven choice elevates the score into the 6-band, though the orchard itself remains more backdrop than tactical pressure across the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rooftop canal system is vividly rendered with bioluminescent fish, vine-wrapped otters, and tower geometry. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the sculptures and canals do not constrain Elara's choices in ways that alter her tactics—she poles through obstacles that yield to pendant magic. The coracle and pendant are handled, but the environment itself does not pressure the final image or force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.1)
    Cavern orchard with stalactite drips, mosaic stepping stone, and moonlight are vividly rendered through specific sensory detail. The stone's chipped patterns guide Thorne's physical work (dovetail cuts), constraining his method and shaping the peak beat. However, the setting does not evolve causally after the eyes are embedded; the orchard "stirring faintly" and fruits "glowing brighter" feel decorative rather than a tactical shift that charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    The library's hidden veins, pipe chases, and rusted flanges are vivid and purposeful, grounding Elias's subterranean existence. The sapphire light motif recurs at key beats, and the dusty insulation, compass needle quiver, and blue chalk trail create tactile specificity. The cache nook's moisture-warped metal directly enables the tape discovery, charging the closure when dawn's sapphire strengthens as he emerges—environment constrains and illuminates the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mossy trellis after rain is vividly rendered ("verdant fuzz glistening," "slick frame") and Elias clings to it during the climax, making it a focal constraint. Storm season's rain and lightning supply sensory pressure throughout. Spatial choreography remains clear (greenhouse → trellis). The trellis charges the final image as the site of metamorphosis, lifting the score into mid-6s, though broader nursery detail remains generic and the environment does not force a tactical choice with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tidal island is vividly rendered with war-scarred basalt cliffs, tidal pools, and kelp; these details constrain Elias's movements and charge the closure image (brooch on easel as tides roar). The rain trails function as micro-setting, guiding discovery with purposeful sensory hierarchy. Spatial choreography remains clear across transitions from easel to pool to shack. The island's twice-daily isolation operates as both prison and muse, directly shaping the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.4)
    The musical crystal cave is vividly described (sapphire/emerald hues, chiming footfalls) and anchors orientation early. The cave pearl's discovery provides a micro-setting moment that constrains a choice (Elara recognizes its rarity, lifts it). The overlapping shadows are mentioned but do not alter spatial choreography or pressure tactics in a legible way. Sensory detail is filtered through atmospheric description rather than POV-specific priorities, trending toward postcard rather than lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.1)
    Ivory Harbor after rain is vividly rendered (alabaster docks, mist, salt-crusted shelves). The trumpet valve is handled across multiple beats and charges the climax, qualifying as micro-setting. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Elias gathers relics and uses the valve without spatial or resource friction. Sensory detail (spray, salt, rain patter) recurs but serves atmospheric backdrop rather than altering tactics at a decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    The starlit vault, phantom train, and fortress gates are vividly rendered and constrain Elias's path through access points (spiral stair, bricked archway, colossal gates). Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric—"cracked glass dome admitting pinpricks of starlight," "fog-choked tunnel," "velvet seat that felt like memory." However, spatial choreography is loose: the vault "beneath the old rail yards" becomes a "tunnel" then a "train car" without clear transitions, and the fortress interior is summarized rather than shown. The punch and cracks serve as micro-setting elements that guide choices, lifting the score into mid-6s, but the environment does not charge the final image with undeniable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.1)
    The tower, cliffs, and whale migration establish vivid spatial and temporal anchors. The magic square tile is handled across multiple beats (fisherman deposits it, Elara examines it, aligns it with star charts, places it at platform's heart), and the tile's grid properties constrain the transcription method. However, the tower itself does not force a tactical choice at closure; it remains backdrop rather than active constraint. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (salt air, lantern light, roiling sea).

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "prismatic escondite" is decorative; walls of "refracted light" and "iridescent corridors" offer no spatial grounding or constraint on action. The solar storm and magnetic fields are asserted but never shape a choice or alter tactics. No object, tool, or micro-setting detail charges the final image or forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prep room is vividly rendered: "stainless steel tables slick under harsh fluorescents," "chemical zest like overripe fruit on the edge of rot," bodies in refrigerators. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, filtered through the "deathly vitality" premise. The room constrains the final choice—it abuts the consulate wall, making the breach possible—so micro-setting qualifies. Spatial choreography is clear (central table, door, alley). However, the prep room's tools (scalpels, trocars, embalming fluids) are described but never used; they remain postcard décor. The door's "fortified breach point" and external guard patrols are introduced late (second half), weakening setup.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.1)
    The bonsai labyrinth and mountaintop workshop are vividly established with selective, purposeful detail ("petals, no larger than thumbnails, unfurled in incandescent hues"). Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The fluorescent lamp and notepad anchor the ritual, and the labyrinth recurs at the closure when Thorne places the volume "at the labyrinth's heart, open to the wind." However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it serves as backdrop and thematic mirror rather than a pressure that narrows options. The lamp's hum and the bonsai's sympathetic blooming remain ornamental rather than causal, keeping the score below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.4)
    The shipping-container labyrinth is vividly rendered with recurring sensory detail (rust, salt, fog, tidal mudflats) and the tides function as a recurring environmental constraint that alters access and tactics across beats. The labyrinth itself does not constrain a pivotal choice—it serves as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure source—but the poison label, half-buried in muck at low tide, charges the final image by linking environment to discovery. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The micro-setting (tidal rhythm + found object) elevates the score toward the 7.0 threshold but falls short of indispensability.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.7)
    The observatory's cracked dome, splintered bench, and salt-crusted path are vivid and filtered through Elias's weariness. The painted seashell and half-finished cello are handled across multiple beats, and the shell's paint flakes under vibrating pressure, a micro-detail that charges the moment. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Elias's ritual proceeds without spatial friction or resource limit. The cliff's eternal vigil and sea's approval in the final lines are atmospheric callbacks rather than forces that alter tactics or outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.1)
    The raft city setting is vivid and specific (bioluminescent lanterns, pedal-crew Ferris wheels, stilt-walkers), filtered through the carnival's sensory chaos. The foundation stone chip functions as a recurring tactile anchor that Elara clutches and embeds into paint, constraining one choice (pressing it into the mural). However, spatial choreography during the midnight parade and raft-realignment sequence remains vague—movements are told rather than shown with legible positions. The setting pressures Elara's tactics (using carnival noise as cover) but does not charge the final image, which defaults to abstract celebration.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.1)
    The moonlit summit is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (regolith, shadows, thermal stress) that anchors the isolation. The camera rig, reaction chamber, and grain on black velvet pad are handled concretely and affect action. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting pressures Elias's choices (no rover access, no radio repeater, solar recharge dependency) and the grain's micro-setting on the velvet pad charges the photographic moment, meeting the 9+ gate criterion for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mist-coated depot, rail yard, and harbor ship are vividly anchored with layered sensory detail (fog, clanking chain, glowing lanterns, water basins). Spatial choreography is clear throughout the repair. The water-feature setup constrains the examination method, and the basins return at the patch beat. However, the environment does not force a climactic choice or charge the final image; Elias lingers in the same shop without environmental pressure altering his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.7)
    The rusted outpost and frozen lake are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (corrugated walls groaning, ice cracking faintly). The condensation on glass functions as micro-setting that charges the final convergence discovery. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or shape tactics in a way that alters the outcome—it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ancient archway and cobblestones recur throughout and charge the final image ("steps danced forever"), meeting the micro-setting gate and earning ~5.0 baseline. Sensory detail leans heavily on visual and auditory clichés ("shadows clung like forgotten whispers," "dust across cobblestones") with minimal embodiment or POV filter. Spatial choreography is coherent, but the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics—it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.4)
    The underwater temple is vividly rendered with coral-encrusted arches, bioluminescent polyps, and petrified kelp pedestal, grounding the scene in tactile detail. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (atrium → sanctum → vortex → ascent), and the oxygen gauge functions as a body-constraint that should tighten choice. However, the gauge's urgency is stated repeatedly without altering Lirael's tactics—she proceeds at the same deliberate pace regardless of the alarm, reducing the setting's mechanical pressure to backdrop. The final ascent and surface break are swift, minimizing the cost of the temple's depth and the gauge's earlier warnings.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, copperlight, and confessional lattice are vivid and consistent, and spatial choreography (spiral stair, narrow door, chapel alcove, labyrinth core) tracks cleanly. The lattice functions as micro-setting: it constrains his method (murmuring confessions into it to bind shades) and charges the final image when he replaces it "imperfectly." The copperlight filters through at pivotal beats, modulating tone and anchoring the reposeful atmosphere. Sensory selection leans heavily visual; more tactile or auditory detail during high-pressure turns would deepen immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.8)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse supplies vivid, purposeful detail: twisted trees, venom-apple vine, frost-laced panes, luminous pear. The setting constrains action (he prunes, eats the infused fruit) and the "endless night" frames atmosphere consistently. Spatial choreography holds. However, the setting does not force a choice at closure—it remains backdrop to the transcendence sequence rather than a crucible that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.1)
    The red canyon walls and labyrinth are described vividly ("petroglyphs," "sea brine," "cooling rock") but remain postcard backdrops—Elara never navigates a choice constrained by access, proximity, or spatial logic. The storybook plate and orchid thread appear as portable talismans without altering tactics or shaping a turn. The tide-pool timeframe is declared but never tightens a decision or imposes urgency. Sensory detail is present but not filtered through professional or personal bias; the catalog reads generic rather than character-particular.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered with concrete detail (apple blossoms on bones, roots snaking through ribcages, mossy vines on the mound). Setting details are filtered through Elara's perception and support the tone. The sundial base and tomb constrain her rebuilding project across multiple beats. However, the environment never forces a difficult choice or alters tactics under pressure; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active constraint at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    The golden arcade at dawn is vividly rendered with holographic vines, neo-classical arches, and levitating benches, filtered through Elara's nostalgia-tech lens. The pavement square and brass post chute appear in the action, and the arcade's awakening pulse juxtaposes against her low-tech chalk. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice or alter tactics; it functions as a richly painted backdrop rather than a pressure that shapes the outcome, capping the score below the 9+ threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt observatory and eternal candle anchor setting vividly. Autumn leaves tap-tapping and mist create atmosphere, though sensory detail remains largely visual. The candle's flame constrains one mid-story choice (tilting it closer to reveal phantom stars), meeting the Q3 9+ gate partially. Spatial choreography is minimal—Elara remains at her hoop—so environment pressure is light. The setting charges the final image modestly but does not drive a decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.1)
    The mangrove labyrinth supplies vivid sensory anchors—twisted roots, brackish tides, glass-like leaves—and the setting pressures Elara's path through shifting trails and spirit-thorn injuries. The shard heals her thigh wound, a micro-constraint that ties body to environment. However, spatial choreography at the heart-throne and the condensation windows remains illustrative rather than tactically decisive; the environment stages rather than forces her final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.1)
    The mist-clad atrium at twilight is established early with vivid sensory detail (crashing waves, fading skylights, seeping mist). The brain coral fragment is handled twice and its labyrinthine ridges anchor tactile specificity. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop. The setting charges the final image but does not drive a turn, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ruined orchard and fog create vivid atmosphere, and the fresco fragment functions as a micro-setting object. However, spatial choreography is loose—Elara's position relative to wraiths and trees shifts without clear blocking. The fog "parts" and "thins" without causal grounding in her actions. The fragment does constrain one choice (to lift and display it), lifting the score into mid-band, but the environment itself remains mostly decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sound wave garden supplies vivid sensory texture—"petals vibrating in harmonic patterns," "waveform fern whose leaves quivered"—and the hobo nickel's grooves actively channel reflected sound to enable the bewitchment, satisfying the micro-object-as-setting allowance. Spatial choreography (Elias kneeling, Lena approaching on gravel, the mural's position) remains coherent. However, the garden's mechanics (how sound becomes visible, why time dilates) are asserted rather than learned through action, and the setting does not constrain Elias's choices or impose a trade-off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.4)
    The entomologist's greenhouse supplies vivid sensory detail—"vines throttled trellises, beetles scuttled in fractal herds"—and the gourd seed's seismic Morse constrains one middle beat. Spatial choreography blurs: gardens "across the sprawl," "the sprawl's edge," and indoor/outdoor convergence remain unclear. The body and tool level (scarabs, drones) charge the final third but arrive too late to anchor earlier choices. Orientation debt and vague geography prevent high-band entry despite vivid texture.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.4)
    The gargantuan shell is vividly anchored early with sensory specificity (nacre walls, bioluminescent ink, coral-filtered moonlight, off-key wind) and recurs across beats. Spatial choreography remains coherent (chambers, spiral mouth, spiral's core, living alcove). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Elowen moves freely without environmental friction. The postcard's placement in the alcove charges the final image, lifting the score modestly, but the shell itself remains a descriptive stage rather than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.4)
    The opal library above clouds is signaled early and recurs with vivid, purposeful detail: "rainbows fractured eternally through translucent walls," "iridescent winds howled against the opal panes." The winds and the tube's crack interact causally (winds rush through the fissure to birth sound), and the final line ("Above the clouds, the opal library drifted on") charges the closure image by anchoring Elara's endurance in spatial continuity. Spatial choreography across the four wings is coherent. However, the wings themselves (Wanderlust, Unbridled Laughter, Melancholy, Betrayed Trust) are described in abstract, postcard-like terms—"derelict alcoves," "faded murals," "shadowed alcoves"—without micro-setting details that constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics wing to wing.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.2)
    The archive setting is vivid with "shadows clung to shelves like forgotten syllables" and the glass ink well is described in tactile detail. The pedestal, scroll, and vault anchors are clear. However, the environment does not constrain Elara's choices—access to the artifact and scroll is unimpeded, and spatial choreography (Thorne's position, the pedestal's location) remains vague. The setting illustrates rather than pressures the central action.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    The amphitheater inside the dormant volcano is vividly rendered with sulfurous vapor, fractured stone tiers, and steaming basin. The antique surveyor's chain and its brass runes anchor tactile detail. However, spatial choreography wobbles—Elias moves from rim to rubble to makeshift camp without clear transitions. The environment enables the envelope discovery and informs his final hydraulic design, satisfying the micro-setting constraint test and charging the closure image with "stone lungs" and volcanic conduits.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.8)
    The attic, skylight, and pigeons anchor space adequately. Dust motes under the skylight recur and are mapped, but their role remains descriptive; they do not constrain a tactical choice on the page. The chip is "balanced precariously on a needlepoint" calculated from mappings, yet the mechanics of balance never alter an action or foreclose an option. Sensory detail is present but often ornamental ("feathers blooming soft grays," "motes swirling wildly") rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prism terrace, wooden furniture grain, and logbook weather code ground the piece in tactile specificity and constrain Elowen's method. The grain "curved like flight paths, avoiding invisible storms" uses micro-setting to charge investigation. However, spatial choreography of the drifting terrace and the descent to the maze below remains abstract; no anchor for how she moves between them or what the prisms physically do to enable descent.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.1)
    The underwater facility is described with atmospheric detail ("coral-veiled spires," "holographic star maps flickered"), but spatial choreography remains vague—distances, room transitions, and the path from dome to atrium are never clarified. The setting functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain choices or supply resources that alter tactics. The feather and viewport come closest to micro-setting, yet their physical properties don't meaningfully limit action at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.1)
    The iridescent geode is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (facets pulsing like frozen fireworks, twilight hues) and the crater glass functions as a recurring object across multiple beats. However, the cave remains atmospheric rather than constraining—Elara paces and kneels but spatial choices do not alter tactics or outcomes. The seeds land in the glass cracks and the environment approves ("walls refracting her newfound peace"), but these details support mood more than they pressure decisions, keeping the setting in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal arcade is vividly rendered with sensory specificity—sea spray, cotton candy, boardwalk groaning—and the setting's rhythm (tide surges, crowd thinning) times Jasper's act. The bishop's diagonal roll uses spatial choreography effectively. However, the arcade functions more as atmospheric backdrop than constraint; Jasper's chess-scattering could occur in many venues without altering his tactics. The micro-setting (boardwalk edge, claw machine, string lights) does charge the final image when the bishop glints and bridges the strangers.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.8)
    The twilight garden supplies the moonstone speck and star-canopy for gap observation, anchoring two key beats. Sensory detail is vivid but often ornamental ("dew-kissed moss," "roses paling to silver") and does not constrain Elara's choices. The shift to Kai's balcony in the final third is abrupt, with no spatial transition or lived-in texture. The garden's role is functional but the piece could substitute another locale with minor edits; the stars matter more than the ground.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.1)
    Pearl Bay and the prism atrium are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (pearlescent fog, dew-kissed stones, moisture bending light). The pond and prism atrium constrain his communion method, giving the setting causal relevance. However, spatial choreography is loose (he "descended weathered steps" but exact distances and positions blur), and the setting does not evolve or force tactical adjustments—it remains a static stage for his vision rather than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ridge path, pines, boulder, and moon are vivid and sustained across beats. The cracked porcelain box is handled twice (opened, placed in Lena's palms) and its fissures charge the shared moment, qualifying as micro-setting that constrains intimacy. Sensory detail (gravel crunch, starlight, dusty face) is selective and POV-filtered. The cap at 7.0 (Orientation Test applied in Q2) limits upward movement despite solid spatial choreography and the box's role in the closure gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.1)
    The grotto's tide-polished walls, bioluminescent algae, and shell/pebble inventory are vivid and consistent. Spatial choreography is clear (ledge, floor, ceiling fissure). However, the environment functions as stage rather than constraint: Elara's patterns succeed without material friction—no kelp too brittle, no tide disrupting arrangement, no gap between resources and need. The altitude gauge hums faintly but does not malfunction or impose a trade-off at closure, missing the choice-pressure test for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ivy-veiled passage, humid air, and soot-blackened fireplace are vivid and purposeful. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's cartographic attention ("low, mournful hum," "scent of charred paper"). The passage constrains his movement and the darkroom's "slivers of light piercing cracks" charges the revelation beat. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the transition from passage to alcove to darkroom could be tighter. The climate-shifted verdant ruin anchors tone and thematic guilt effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.1)
    The echoing terrace, prism parapet, and spring setting are vividly described with purposeful sensory detail (rain-slick crystals, refracted rainbows, scent of rain-kissed stone). However, the environment does not constrain Elowen's choices or supply resources that alter her tactics; it serves as backdrop for a ritual that proceeds without spatial friction. Micro-setting test: the parapet's prismatic edge is handled in two beats (tracing, painting) but does not impose cost or change her approach. No 9+ gate satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.1)
    The terrace, midsummer zenith, and celestial bodies anchor setting early and return at closure ("resuming celestial waltz"). The ritual braziers and altar slab constrain the signing sequence, satisfying micro-setting involvement. Sensory detail is vivid but often ornamental ("velvet sky," "scars on porcelain skin") rather than filtered through Elara's professional or emotional priorities. Spatial choreography remains clear across the ascent and assembly.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.2)
    The salt flat is vividly rendered ("crust gleaming like shattered porcelain," "cracks etched deeper by engineered famine") and the crack-map motif is introduced early, but the environment functions primarily as symbolic backdrop rather than constraining Elias's choices. The egg placement in the hollow is the one moment where setting (subterranean seep) enables action, lifting the score modestly. The 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is not met; the storm arrives to charge the image but does not force a tactical shift, capping Q3 at 8.8 and placing it mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.1)
    The silver courtyard and snow provide vivid atmospheric detail early, and the prism sanctuary manifests as a spatial effect tied to the climax. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; snow "halts mid-fall" and the courtyard "trembles," but these reactions do not constrain Elara's tactics or force a choice. The loom's physicality is vague—how threads dangle, what resistance feels like—leaving the climactic action abstract rather than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dome's curved walls and concrete floor anchor space; "meteor hush" and the single lantern create atmosphere. The stick is handled across multiple beats (traced, twirled, held to light, inscribed anew), meeting the micro-setting test. However, the dome does not constrain Elias's choice—he could reach the same resolution in any quiet room. The environment mirrors his serene state rather than pressuring it, keeping the score in the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    Verdant grotto, pink mist, and mossy stone create vivid atmosphere. The moth wing's iridescence and vine texture are specific. However, the environment never constrains a choice—Elara gathers what she needs without scarcity or obstacle, and the grotto's height or wind arrive on cue to serve the plot rather than complicate it. Spatial choreography is clear but the setting remains postcard backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.1)
    The icebound sanctum is vividly anchored (glacial heart, aurora veils, snowmelt ardor), and the rope's silver filaments + perforations constrain her method at the altar. However, the environment does not force a mid-scene choice or limit her movements—it remains a backdrop for her uninterrupted work. Spatial choreography is clear, and the auroral light charges the final image, lifting the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    The vine-draped bunker, bioluminescent fungi, and storm provide vivid sensory anchors that guide Elara's descent and frame the dream sequence. The wafer seal's "translucent as communion" and the pod's automated straps offer tactile specificity. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the bunker's physical constraints do not alter Elara's tactics, and the storm's resolution ("storm fading to dawn's ethereal promise") decorates rather than pressures the final choice. Micro-setting (the pod, the seal) charges individual beats but does not constrain the closure decision.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.8)
    The reimagined Babylonian setting (bioluminescent vines, crystal lattice dome) is vivid and consistent but mostly atmospheric. The mosaic floor and tile are handled concretely, and the observatory dome returns at closure with vines weaving celestial maps—micro-setting charges the final image. However, spatial choreography is vague (Ezar moves "through corridors" and "under the dome" without clear geography), and the setting does not constrain a choice or tactic. The Q3 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is half-met: the charged final image lifts the score, but no mid-scene constraint limits Ezar's options.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.4)
    The soundless sanctuary constrains action (violence "echoed nowhere") and the shifting environment (walls to mist, floors to marble, stars at midday) creates a vivid backdrop. The music box recurs and its broken pin is handled across multiple beats, charging the final image. However, spatial choreography remains vague—Elias and Thorne's relative positions, distances, and movements lack clear blocking. The sanctuary's shifts feel decorative rather than forcing tactical choices in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ruined orchard, thick fog, twilight frost, and twisted apple stumps create a coherent atmosphere that filters through Elias's task-focused perception. Mirrors and the sextant function as micro-setting tools that constrain his method: he positions panes, aligns sights, and the "glass mountains" illusion directly shapes the boundary-erasing ritual. Spatial choreography (clearing, stumps, central mirror) remains legible across moves, and the fog's retreat at the climax ties environment to outcome. Sensory detail—"scent of decayed apples," "frost-laced branches like veins of quartz"—grounds the scene without catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.1)
    The orchard-in-rafters setting is vivid, specific, and pressures the climb (rotted beams, storm loosening stones, dangling bag). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the ascent and the heart-tree repair. The quartz eye and the cathedral's verdant canopy charge the final image, and the storm actively complicates the climactic beat when Lila shoves Elias from a falling beam. Sensory selection is purposeful, filtered through the mender's craft and the magical-realist world.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.8)
    The astral orchard and meteor-glass bathroom offer vivid, speculative anchors. Sensory detail ("iridescent soil," "petals unfurling in ethereal glows") is purposeful and filtered through Elara's curatorial lens. However, the environment remains largely postcard description—neither the orchard's physics nor the bathroom's liminal quality alters Elara's tactical options or constrains her final choice. The pistachio shell cameo appears in the closure paragraph but does not act as a charged physical object that shapes the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.1)
    The labyrinthine bookstore is described in lush terms ("roots of an ancient tree," "vaulted stacks") but never constrains movement or choice—characters teleport between named zones without navigation cost. The botanical diary's luminescent flora appear as visual decoration; when Elara uses them (Echo-Lilies, storm-root, Nocturne Bloom), the mechanics are asserted rather than shown through environmental interaction. Spatial choreography collapses: we don't know distances, what's visible, or how the "core chamber" relates to prior locations. The orientation debt noted in Q2 directly harms this category; cap at 7.0 per the Orientation Test consequence does not apply here because the problem is pervasive decorative treatment, not just late anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    The carnival ship setting supplies vivid, purposeful details (Ferris wheel, funhouse mirrors, ghost train) that anchor the accumulative lens and provide spatial waypoints for each thread. The emerald swatch card appears physically and recurs with evolving function (gift → tool → roots). Fog as a constraint shapes the tone and closure image. No choreography confusion, and the environment charges the final archway moment, lifting this above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.1)
    The clock tower mechanism room is vividly anchored with oiled gears, aged dust, arched windows, and the frozen clock face. The ceremonial rope and its braids constrain the climactic action, and the pedestal's placement charges the discovery beat. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, grounding Elara's actions in tactile engagement (tracing spines, unweaving braids) without catalog drift.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.1)
    The harmonic caves are vividly rendered with frost-veined chambers, ice fractured by invasion, and luminous pulses; sensory detail (visual glow, tactile cracks, auditory roar vs. hush) grounds the setting throughout. The ice sheet and its crack patterns constrain the Mapkeeper's method and charge the final image (cracks into luminous mandalas). However, spatial choreography beyond "deepest chamber" remains vague—no sense of tunnels, distances, or how energy beings' physical presence shapes navigation. The micro-setting (ice + stone) does the heavy lifting, meeting the gate for choice-constraint and closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.8)
    The glass pavilion hums, the shard swallows sound, the prism refracts starlight—each detail constrains Elara's tactics (muting echoes, aligning stars). Spatial choreography is mostly clear (base → spiral core → apex), though "dust-choked dawn" and "storms lashed the tower" feel ornamental rather than shaping choice. The shard in her grip during the climb and the skylight lens at the apex charge the final beat, narrowly meeting the Q3 9+ test for micro-setting constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.1)
    The observatory, fog-bridge, and crystal forecourt are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (rain-slick tiles, obsidian monuments, stormlight). The forecourt's whispers and shadow-lengths shape the Archivist's method, grounding her conjecture ritual in tactile interaction. However, spatial choreography remains vague—distances, monument positions, and the Archivist's path lack concrete blocking. The environment does not constrain a choice or shift under pressure; it serves as stage rather than crucible, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.2)
    The blooming fortress is vividly rendered (luminous flowers, iridescent mosaic tiles) and the fire spinner's knot is handled concretely across multiple beats. The mosaic tiles align under firelight to reveal the design, constraining Elias's choice to replicate that specific pattern. Spatial choreography is clear (circling the base, kneeling amid petals). However, the "hush of a night with no stars" functions primarily as atmospheric declaration; it does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page, and the overcast skies remain backdrop rather than active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto, tidal pools, and starlight are vividly rendered and filtered through Elaron's expertise. The jade cicada's reflection in the pool—warped by ripples, scattering starlight—constrains Elaron's method and charges the vision sequence. Spatial choreography is clear (sitting across, pool's edge, palm) and the setting's ancient, contemplative atmosphere supports the tone. The final image of pools rippling approval feels slightly precious but does not break the coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.7)
    The xenial trellis and inversion gravity are vivid and purposeful, shaping Elara's access to rare sprouts. Sensory detail is selective (gilded petals, honeyed velvet flavor, vines snagging clothes) and filtered through her collector's lens. The body-as-setting (claustrophobia, floating, breath control) constrains her action during the compression moment. Spatial choreography stays coherent despite the gravity flip, meeting the micro-setting standard for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "drifting prism terrace" and gondola setup provide vivid sensory anchors (refracting light, swaying cables, levitation hum), and spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the single scene. However, the storm glass vial—while visually specific—does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; it remains a diagnostic prop. The setting pressures atmosphere more than agency, landing just above functional integration.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.1)
    Vivid catalog (holographic spires, smog-veiled sky, bioluminescent fungal groves, kaleidoscopic waterfall, luminous fruits) but most detail is ornamental postcard work disconnected from choice. The ruby flake's glow peels paint and projects the hologram, satisfying the gate minimally; the orchard provides the pavilion floor trapdoor. Spatial choreography holds across moves. No other object or environmental constraint shapes a tactic or charges the final image; the throne itself is described but does not pressure Elara's approach beyond her internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ashen charcoal sanctuary and starlight frame the scene vividly, and the fading threshold functions as a physical constraint that pulses and thins under pressure. The coal bed at the ending allows the protagonist to heat the ring, directly shaping his choice. Spatial choreography is clear (threshold edge, dust, coal bed), and sensory details (pallid glow, phantom heat, gossamer threshold) modulate with pressure. The micro-setting (coal bed, ring, threshold) charges the final image and constrains the protagonist's tactic, meeting the 9+ test's environment requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.1)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm supplies vivid visual texture ("gills exhaled mist that bent light into prismatic halos"), but spatial choreography is unclear—where is the core chamber relative to the aisles? The farm functions as backdrop rather than constraint; no environmental feature narrows Elias's options or shapes his tactics. The porthole bolt and mycelial contraption are described but not grounded in tactile interaction that would anchor the reader. Sensory detail skews heavily visual; touch, sound, and proprioception are largely absent during the climactic bolt-twist.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sepia reading room is vividly sketched with sensory detail (aged paper, polished oak, golden shadows). The gramophone and crank handle anchor the space and constrain Elias's method of discovery. However, spatial choreography is thin—props appear when needed (the hidden panel behind a bookshelf) without prior establishment. The setting charges the final image (the manor "exhaled its last dynastic breath"), meeting the micro-setting standard, but the lack of evolving spatial detail during the middle beats and the convenient revelation lower the score to mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.1)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly rendered with sensory particulars (dew-slick leaves, etched sigils, gnarled roots), but the environment remains a backdrop rather than a constraint that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is clear (gates, pedestal root, dome), and the fruits' quivering and crystal orbs provide atmospheric texture. However, the setting does not force a choice or shape the closure image—Elowen could perform the same actions in any mystical space. Micro-setting credit is limited because the program and clasp are handled as plot tokens rather than objects whose physical properties constrain his options.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    The file room is vividly anchored with sensory detail: "aged paper and mildew," "scarred oak desk," "sagging shelves like weary sentinels." The dust patterns constrain Eleanor's investigation, guiding her to the false compartment and driving the discovery. The infantryman's button and the hidden seam function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the 1872 post-emancipation atmosphere saturates the piece without becoming a museum tour.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.1)
    The auric lagoon arrives with vivid sensory detail (golden glow, bioluminescent reeds, mineral depths), but it functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint. Spatial choreography is adequate—plaza to alleys to lagoon—though the submerged phone booth's sudden introduction feels convenient rather than planted. The key constrains one choice (unlocking the booth), barely meeting the micro-setting test, but the ending relies on the lagoon's mood rather than its physical properties shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.4)
    The grotto is vividly anchored (luminous ferns, dripping stalactites, prism atrium) and the mist/dewdrops recur to charge atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's nostalgic lens. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; he positions himself, plays, and departs without spatial friction. The final dew-prism refracts a coded glint but does not force a decision. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) is present but ornamental at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly described with selective sensory detail (moss-draped walkways, ash flakes, bioluminescent fungi), and the moonstone cabochon dust speck functions as a micro-setting element that appears in multiple beats. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Lir operates without spatial friction, and the "arbor's fading heart" remains abstract rather than a present obstacle. The final image does not charge setting details with new meaning, so the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges closure) is not met.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    The subterranean waterfall, mist, and fissure choked with vines all constrain movement and charge atmosphere throughout. Spatial choreography remains clear across workshop, ledge, greenhouse, and chamber. The compass rose glowing and aligning with runes on the chest ties setting detail directly to the closure discovery. Sensory details (roar, spray, soot) filter through Elias's focus and shape his route choices, satisfying the micro-setting and constraint tests.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rain-washed foundry anchors setting early with vivid sensory details (rusted crucibles, forge-embers, puddles reflecting moonlight). The anvil and crucible function as micro-setting that supports the ritual beats, and rain modulates from downpour to silver mist at closure. However, spatial choreography remains vague—where Thorne was, how he emerges—and the foundry's layout never constrains a tactic. The final image leans on the foundry as backdrop rather than active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.2)
    Echo Gorge is vividly rendered—sheer walls, mist amplifying whispers, cold stone ledges—and the setting provides both atmosphere and a spatial stage for the pursuit. The crocodile's tooth pendant functions as a micro-setting object, guiding Elara and charging beats when it vibrates and glows. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Elara's path is linear, and the gorge's specifics (ledges, cliffs) serve as backdrop rather than obstacles that force adaptation. The "hidden sunrise" timeframe is poetic but exerts no pressure on decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.1)
    The ultraviolet forest is vividly described with "twisted trees pulsed with violet veins" and "phosphorescent soil," but it remains atmospheric backdrop. The forest "responds" by "flickering patterns" and "hushed, violet light softening," yet these changes do not alter Elara's options or tactics—she braces against a tree, then stands. The strap and her body function as micro-setting elements, but neither constrains a choice that charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.1)
    The high-strung market offers vivid images ("vaporous lanterns," "jars of writhing shadows," "canvases dangling like tapestries of dreamstuff") but remains postcard description—sensory details do not constrain choice or alter tactics. Spatial choreography is vague (Elara "moved stall to stall" without tracking distance, obstacles, or lived-in interaction). The lens fragment interacts with paintings in the climax, providing micro-setting function, but the body and environment do not pressure decisions earlier. Economy is poor: many ornamental details (brass astrolabes, captured dawns) appear once without return or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.1)
    The circus ticket office is vivid and purposeful: boarded window, residual power, warped counter, cracked ceiling mural all ground the action and provide clues (dust eddies, rusted grate, hidden lock). Dust accumulation patterns function as micro-setting, constraining Theo's investigative path and charging the final reveal. The mainspring barrel under the counter and the grate above create spatial choreography that matters. Sensory detail is selective (mildew, distant popcorn dreams, unraveling-wire moan) and filtered through Theo's professional lens, though the circus atmosphere risks postcard charm without enough friction from the ghosts' desperation.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.1)
    The glass orchard library is vivid and surreal ("crystalline branches bore tomes like fruit"), and the setting does constrain the final action—uncorking the vial triggers the library's physical rupture. Spatial choreography is loose (Elias "descends" but distances and transitions are vague), and the clouds function more as backdrop than active pressure. The frost and the vial are micro-setting elements that participate in beats and the ending, lifting the score into the mid-6s despite the lack of occupational or procedural grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.7)
    The baroque asteroid setting is vividly rendered with specific images (gilded spires, rococo vaults, visible time strands). The mirror gallery and temporal storm provide spatial and atmospheric constraints that enable Elias's plan. The mirrors function as both tool and micro-setting, constrained by the covering method. While sensory detail is rich, it occasionally overstays its purpose; the ending returns to setting imagery ("baroque witness") that charges the final frame, lifting integration.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.1)
    The resonance chamber is vividly rendered (crystal walls, amplified sound) and recurs across beats, but it functions primarily as atmosphere rather than constraint—Elias's choices are not shaped by spatial access or environmental pressure. The music box and tools anchor micro-setting effectively in the central beat. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the sensory palette (chimes, vibrations, rust) is consistent and purposeful, lifting the score above mid-band despite limited tactical involvement.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.1)
    The subterranean lagoon and limestone cliffs arrive late (past midpoint) and function as postcard backdrop; "mirror of obsidian," "gothic hush," and bioluminescent algae are visually vivid but do not constrain choice. The moss-crusted hinges are spatial props that Elara pulls without risk or obstacle. The factory setting is a brief opening frame, abandoned without return. Sensory hierarchy is absent—Elara notices petrichor, mineral tears, and metallic tang in catalog fashion regardless of urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    The storm-tossed archway grounds the scene spatially and the cliff environment supplies the driftwood Elara works with. Sensory detail is vivid ("salt spray," "foam-laced debris," "winds turbine-humming") and filtered through Elara's sculptor lens. However, the archway does not constrain a choice or charge the closure image beyond serving as backdrop. The lantern slide's "fractal veins" and the sculpture's mechanics remain vague, reducing specificity when it would matter most.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.1)
    The amber pavilion and cathedral window are described vividly ("glass-domed haven," "towering pane of etched glass") and recur throughout, but neither constrains a choice or charges the final image—disqualifying 9+ per the quick test. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (incense, cool stone, meltwater pattering), yet spatial choreography between pavilion and cathedral remains vague: no transit, distance, or threshold is dramatized. The postcards and glass function as passive exposition vehicles rather than active setting elements that alter tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.2)
    The floating library and obsidian lagoon are vividly sketched ("jagged shores where forgotten tides lapped," "vertebrae strung as a spine"), and the debris as setting-objects constrains the parley choice. However, orientation anchors arrive late and remain incomplete: we never learn the zeppelin's route, the dune-folk geography, or how the library floats. Spatial choreography in the lagoon is coherent, but the score is capped at 7.0 by the Q2 orientation penalty. Sensory detail leans visual; other senses are underutilized in the searing dune heat.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.1)
    Paper-Lantern Cove supplies vivid images—tattered lanterns, dust-choked streets, weathered pier—that anchor the reader spatially. The lanterns recur and transform (paper to silk, self-igniting orbs), achieving a reprise that reweights the setting's symbolic charge at closure. However, the environment remains decorative: no choice hinges on proximity, access, or material constraint. The kelp scaffolds and memory-infused crystal are named but never used to shape tactics or test Elias's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.1)
    The skyscraper orchard is vividly rendered and consistently detailed (gnarled apple trees, mossy undergrowth, dew-kissed rainwater, star-pricked sky), and the setting charges the prophecy ("orchards of steel"). The foghorn's silence frames the temporal window, and the basin of rainwater becomes a functional tool in the immersion ritual. Yet the orchard does not constrain Elias's choices or supply resources that alter his tactics; it remains primarily atmospheric backdrop. The gate at 7.0+ requires the environment to pressure a decision, which does not occur here.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.1)
    The icebound atrium under starlight is vividly anchored: glass dome, frost-laced arches, vines with acorns, prismatic halos, suspended snowflakes. Sensory details are filtered through Elara's seed-saver priorities (packets frozen in pods, heart-tree roots). The oak acorn cap functions as micro-setting constraint: its ridged dome and runes focus starlight into coherence, directly enabling the reopening ritual. The cap's physical properties (opening aligned like a lens, twisted like a valve) shape her method and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for environment/tool constraint on choice and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    The windblown sanctuary above the clouds is vividly rendered with frost-rimed platforms, swaying rope, and gusts carrying ice and ozone; the bell and rope are handled concretely in the climactic beat. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elias's professional attention (barometer, humidity, wind shear). The setting constrains choice (the switch must be mended, the bell's resonance interacts with wind patterns) and charges the final image when the toll harmonizes with microclimate variations. Minor deduction: the sanctuary's spatial layout remains somewhat abstract, and the villages below are distant markers rather than tactile pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.1)
    The station and yellow lantern glass constrain Elias's ritual and anchor the final image, satisfying the micro-setting test. Spatial details—domes, observatory apex, relic shelf—are legible and purposeful. However, the "overlooked era" and "primordial frost" remain vague atmospheric gestures without affecting choice or stakes. The lantern glass charges the closure by being set aside, but the setting itself does not evolve or pressure the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    The scorched wasteland, withered hives, and stained glass box are vivid and purposeful. The glass box constrains the ritual (tilted to fracture sunlight, mended cracks guiding ghost dissolution) and charges the final image (placed atop the tallest hive as covenant guardian). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the recluse's perceptive calm. Spatial choreography of ghosts hovering near hives and weaving through light beams is coherent. The oasis environment enables the closure beat, satisfying the 9+ quick test for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.1)
    The emerald silo's fungal sheen and corrugated walls receive vivid sensory treatment, and the "undercroft" descent supplies spatial progression. However, the silo functions as backdrop rather than constraint—Elias moves through it freely without any environmental choice-point or tactical tradeoff. The capsule's "chronal vapors" and "verdant glows" remain decorative; no tool, object, or spatial feature alters his approach or charges the final image with physical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt lagoon after rain is anchored early with sensory detail (petrichor, damp sands, rising water). The feather and kite serve as micro-setting objects that Elias handles across multiple beats, and the lagoon's water rises to his knees during the retrieval. However, the environment never constrains his choices—materials for repair appear conveniently ("sap from nearby fronds," "shoreline grass")—and spatial choreography remains generic rather than particular to this locale.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.1)
    The temple orchard is sketched with vivid images—"living stone pillars," "quartz veins," "copper coils"—but spatial choreography remains vague (ladder access? shed location? distance between trees?) and the environment never constrains a choice or alters Elias's tactics. Anchors shift without transition: ferry → orchard → shed → branches, with no consistent through-line of where he stands or moves. The setting functions as atmospheric backdrop; when he "sinks against an oak" at the end, the tree is simply there, not a body-scaled obstacle or resource that shaped prior action. Sensory detail trends visual and generic ("sunlight sparking," "quartz glowing warmer") without POV-specific filtering or urgency shifts under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.9)
    Spring rain, bronze light, and the tower's ivy-scoured walls are vividly rendered and recur across beats. The amber object constrains Elara's quest and charges the ending when placed on the plinth. However, the tower interior—"relic chamber, walls inscribed with pre-contact glyphs"—materializes late without prior spatial grounding, and the convergence mechanism (holographic trails, data streams) introduces new setting rules at closure without setup. Micro-setting (body, tool) does not meaningfully constrain a choice before the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.8)
    The blooming jetty, skeletal horses, cracked roads, and battlefield debris provide vivid, purposeful detail filtered through the mission's stakes. Sensory selection is strong: "salt-crusted wood," "eerie bioluminescence," "ink-black sea." The jetty constrains Thorne's action spatially (narrow path, specific spots for scattering), and the environment charges the final image of petals drifting seaward. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout; micro-setting (jetty pilings, heart-trench) guides the scattering action and closure participation lifts the score into the mid-6 band.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.7)
    Scrapyard details (fuselage shack, rad-scorched suns, bone-piles, catwalks over rifts) are vivid and POV-filtered through Elias's bloodhound senses. The wasteland supplies spatial pressure (the rift crossing) but doesn't constrain a mid-trek choice or alter tactics. The phonograph cylinder and leaf are handled across beats, anchoring micro-setting effectively. Sensory hierarchy (nose to decay, wax warmth) reflects Elias's profession and charges the final walk, lifting the score into mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.1)
    The observation deck's temporal dilation is vivid and the setting charges several beats (stars stretched into arcs, the rift revealed through the window). The compass rose and sketchpad function as micro-setting objects that recur and guide action. However, spatial choreography in the final third becomes vague—Elara "approached the window's edge" and "pushed off" without clear mechanics, and the alien soil arrival lacks grounding sensory detail, reading more as concept than place.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.1)
    The icebound spire, bioluminescent veins, and floating Chessboard provide vivid sensory anchors and the sundial's "pinpoint of honest noon-light" offers a tool under warped skies. However, spatial choreography during the swap (pedestal proximity, Arbiter's throne distance, alarm triggers) remains vague, and the environment does not meaningfully constrain Elarion's moves. The setting charges atmosphere but does not force a tactical choice or complicate the final act, keeping it below high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.1)
    The whispering gallery is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (curved dome, marble dust, oculus) and the acoustics—whispers amplifying—constrain Thorne's method. The chessboard, placed at the gallery's heart, anchors the ritual and charges the final image when it absorbs the penumbra. However, the interregnum palace remains atmospheric rather than tactically consequential; the setting pressures tone more than choice. Spatial choreography is clear (circling, pacing arcs), and the oculus supplies a visual anchor for the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.1)
    The labyrinthine bookstore is vividly established with sensory specificity (petrified roots, geothermal warmth, teetering stacks). However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics in a legible way. The feather and stone are handled concretely, but spatial choreography during the alcove scene is impressionistic rather than clear. The bookstore's vastness is asserted more than it pressures the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.4)
    The time-frozen village, cobblestones, stone altar, and tapestry provide vivid, selective detail filtered through Elias's chess-tutor lens. The tapestry's frayed threads and platinum labyrinth imagery are well-integrated and pressure his decoding efforts. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric backdrop; the frozen villagers and unfallen rain do not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome, and the micro-setting (tapestry border) charges the final image more through symbol than spatial or tactile constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "towers of bone," "pale spire," and "marrow pool" are vivid and consistently referenced, establishing a memorable gothic setting. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; no choice or tactic is constrained by proximity, access, or spatial logic (e.g., Elara "slips" freely, youths "follow" without navigating bone architecture). The micro-setting (ribcage arches, vertebrae perch) is decorative rather than tactical. Spatial choreography is vague: the crowd's size, movement, and the chamber's layout remain unclear, and the spire's distance or accessibility is never specified.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.8)
    The acid sea, gears-and-cogs workshop, and underwater setting are vividly rendered with concrete sensory detail (corroded hull, caustic haze, steam vents). Spatial choreography is mostly clear—alchemist swims to statue, traces pockmarks—but the workshop's layout (walkways, chamber, rents) and the statue's accessibility underwater are underdeveloped. The environment pressures the protagonist (acid gnawing, breath held) but does not constrain a key choice; the statue's transformation is magical rather than environmental. Sensory selection reflects urgency (bubbles, stinging depths) but some details (golden veins, kintsugi glow) feel ornamental rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.1)
    The coastal cave network is vividly rendered (dripping stone, quartz veins, skylight shaft, luminous lagoon, fern fronds, wild orchids) and the oasis discovery is spatially coherent. The cave's labyrinthine structure and the wrong turn at the fork provide causal texture that leads to the hidden pocket paradise. The spring water is used as a medium for the final pigment mix, and the pool's mirror-calm surface serves as the projection screen for the holographic memories—both constrain and enable the climactic reveal. Micro-setting (the seashell, the spring, the skylight) charges the final image, pushing this into the 7+ band despite the opening studio and quay functioning primarily as nostalgic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cobalt lighthouse, dawn mist, and night-garden scents provide vivid sensory anchors that reflect Elias's emotional state. The vial and garden constrain his method of beckoning, charging the final reunion image with spatial and olfactory specificity. However, the setting remains largely postcard-descriptive in the middle; the jagged rocks and keeper's quarters are mentioned but don't pressure Elias's choices or alter his tactics beyond providing a location for the garden.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.1)
    The starlit station, rusted antenna, sea, and salvaged driftwood ground the setting vividly. The censer foot in its brazier cradle constrains the final beat and charges the closure image when it pulses and glows. Spatial choreography is clear (tower rising, Elias on the perch, silhouettes on distant shores). Minor gap: occupational detail (hydraulics, coils, solder) is gestured at but not leveraged to complicate a choice or reveal expertise under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.1)
    The hanging orchard, ravine, and storms are vividly rendered and recur throughout. The glass eye as micro-setting object constrains Elias's final choice and charges the ending image ("the relic occluding deeper doubts"). However, spatial choreography during the ritual and descent is vague—no concrete sense of where Elias stands or moves. Setting details ("gnarled trees," "storm-battered walls") are poetic but do not alter tactics or options in a legible way during peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    The opal dock's iridescent surface and mist function as micro-setting throughout, constraining action (Elias kneeling, the boutonnière lodged in a crevice) and charging the final image. Nautical twilight recurs as both timeframe and atmospheric anchor, modulating from opening to close. The lighthouse tower is spatially legible. Sensory detail is purposeful—"mist curling softly persistent," "bruise-purple sky"—filtered through Elias's eccentric, archive-keeper perspective. The Alps appear only in borrowed memory, cleanly differentiated from the dock's present.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.1)
    The blooming cavern is vividly rendered with bioluminescent moss and nectar-scented blooms; sensory detail is selective and tied to midsummer's heat. However, the environment remains largely decorative—Elias moves through it without spatial constraints altering his choices until the rising creek, which appears and recedes without meaningful pressure on his final decision. The matrix chip's warming and glimmering charge the final image, elevating micro-setting function.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.7)
    The cobalt grotto, ember glow, and bleeding starlight pools offer vivid sensory anchors that guide the ascent and frame the climax. Spatial choreography during the climb is clear (ropes, boots, ledge), and the grotto's "lacy menace" modulates atmosphere. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental feature meaningfully constrains a choice or alters tactics. The "crystalline pools" participate in closure by being touched, meeting the micro-setting threshold, but the interaction remains passive description rather than active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.4)
    The ember nexus supplies vivid sensory anchors—"smoldering light," "twilight braids of firelight"—and the pocket-sun and nautilus shell are handled on the page. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the single scene. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; no environmental constraint alters Lirien's tactics or shapes the climax, and the "twilight" threshold is invoked repeatedly without mechanical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.7)
    The cabin, Blackthorn Peak, birch bark, and raven-feather quill anchor the setting with vivid, purposeful detail. The scroll's "papery skin unfurling like a reluctant confession" and the cabin's "skeletal embrace" filter environment through Elara's weary perspective. However, the soaring sequence (cabin roof splintering, crags as "broken teeth") shifts into metaphor-heavy skyscape without clear spatial choreography; the return to "cabin ruins, or were they whole?" introduces ambiguity that does not constrain a choice or charge the closure image with micro-setting consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.1)
    The water-clock shop, morning fog, and the tarnished brass clock supply concrete sensory grounding that filters through Elara's professional attention (tweezers, verdigris, drips syncing with pulse). Spatial choreography is coherent: workbench, access panel, reservoir. The screw's physical presence and the fog's thinning at closure bracket the piece purposefully, charging the final image. Occupational detail (escapement mechanism, forceps-clamp screw threading) feels plausible and advances the mystery without exposition dump.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    The floating platform, its moss-veiled edges and rune-lit underbelly, anchors the scene vividly and the "breath between storms" weather grounds the suspended time frame. The tea ceremony objects (lacquered tray, porcelain teapot, matcha) are handled concretely and the quill dipped into the matcha bowl merges ritual and magic. The platform's trembling and descent bracket the arc, and the spatial isolation (thousand feet above jagged peaks) supports the high-stakes atmosphere. Minor: the storms remain scenic backdrop rather than pressing on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.4)
    The archive is vividly rendered—"yellowed scores," "slivers of dusk," "copper veins exposed by rot"—and the orchard hush frames urgency. However, setting remains largely descriptive; the player piano hums and sparks but doesn't constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics. The perfume bottle's interaction with the archive's "dry paper fueling blue-white veins" charges the final image modestly, lifting the score into mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    The library is vivid in scattered images: "dust motes danced in shafts of ethereal light," "chambers of crystal scrolls, halls of whispering papyrus," "constellations etched the ceiling lived and breathed." These remain postcard-descriptive and do not constrain Elowen's choices—he walks "wanderingly exact" through infinite shelves without spatial friction. The setting accumulates atmosphere but never forces a tactical decision or supplies a resource that alters outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.1)
    The fjord, station tower, chronometer room, and hydraulic clocks create a coherent atmosphere with purposeful detail (mercury-weighted pendulums, brass veins pulsing water, whale-oil lamp). Spatial choreography is clear and the environment constrains Elias's actions (hidden port, glass tubes, observation deck). The mantle clock key as micro-setting object charges the final sequence. However, some descriptions lean ornamental ("horizon bending like scimitars") without shaping choices, and the fjord's role in warping clocks via "tidal anomalies" arrives late without earlier setup.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rainwashed library, midsummer clover scent, and subway tunnels are vividly established and return at key moments, charging the final image with sensory continuity. The candle lantern's mica pane is handled across multiple beats, and the "clover-melancholy" air bookends the piece, reweighting the opening mood. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or force a tactical shift—Elena's decisions would unfold the same way in a different setting. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the micro-setting (lantern, scrawls) adds texture, but the world remains more atmospheric than instrumental.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.1)
    The subway utility tunnel anchors effectively—dripping pipes, rusted bulbs, cable-drum stool—and the glass harmonica disc supplies a recurring sensory motif whose "melodically haunted" tones thread through dialogue beats. The streetlamp hum functions as both atmosphere and temporal frame. Spatial choreography remains coherent (booth, tunnel, ventilation grates) and the damp-iron-earth scent is specific. The environment does not constrain a choice at closure but does charge the final image with the harmonica's "endless loop" and the next ring, which reweights the cycle motif enough to approach the 9-band gate without fully crossing it.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.4)
    The jetty at twilight is vividly rendered with luminous petals, darkening sea, and moon-crested closure. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elara's archival focus (walnut-ink scent, pollen like stardust regrets). The setting participates actively: seawater gathered warm, blooms intensifying to bathe her in light, the sea sighing approval. However, the environment does not meaningfully constrain a choice or alter tactics; it facilitates rather than pressures, and the blooms' mechanics (how they enable the ritual) remain vague.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.1)
    The disused railway station with ivy appears early and returns at closure ("ivy rustled approval"), charging the final image. Spatial choreography (tracks, arches, lantern light, bicycle entry) remains coherent. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure source, capping the score below 7.0 per the quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ultrasonic forest is vividly rendered through Elar's skin-reading (bark pulses, notes as braille, soil mutterings) and the environment supplies the trail he follows. The platinum ring and the crystalline pool constrain navigation and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling, pressing palm, stepping through thicket, arriving at clearing). The timeframe "pause of shifting constellations" remains atmospheric rather than a tactical constraint, and the forest's ultrasonic properties do not narrow a choice—Elar never loses the trail or must choose between paths.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.1)
    The gravitational anomaly is vivid and specific—stones drift upward, shadows cling to ceilings, objects settle into "tentative orbits"—and it constrains Elara's physical reach ("arm feel leaden and featherlight at once"). The setting returns in the final third as it "softens" and "lingers faintly," charging the closure image with the reminder that "some seeds, even wrong ones, bore fruit in revision." However, the anomaly functions primarily as backdrop and metaphor rather than a live tactical pressure that forces mid-story choices; once Elara grasps the pen, the setting becomes passive description.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.1)
    The luminous harbor establishes mood and anchors the opening effectively. The vintage camera frames silence in several beats, functioning as a micro-setting prop that guides Elara's attention. However, the festival edge and moored boats remain postcard details; spatial choreography during the climax (stepping into the festival's heart, camera raised) is vague, and no environmental constraint shapes the outcome. The moonlight recurs but does not evolve or charge the final image with new meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lost civilization archive is vividly rendered with dust, rubble, humid air, and aged wool, and the spatial trail (corridor, mural chamber, pedestal, spiral stairwell, vault) tracks clearly. The vandalized portrait's slashed gashes and the tapestry fragment's metallic threads provide tactile, purposeful detail that drives Elara's choices. The archive's inaccessibility ("off the grid") constrains her isolation and charges the final vault discovery. However, the setting does not impose a meaningful obstacle or resource scarcity that alters tactics at closure; it functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    The sound wave garden is vividly rendered with iridescent petals, echoing grass, and the auric lagoon; sensory details are selective and purposeful. Spatial choreography tracks Elara's perch, the lagoon below, and her descent clearly. The garden's response to drumming—petals unfurling, water stirring—constrains and enables her attempt, charging the final image when it wilts "in respectful defeat." Minor over-reliance on visual shimmer and glow; other senses could sharpen immersion during peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.1)
    The shipping-container labyrinth is vividly rendered with storm-induced static, groaning steel, and auroral smear. Spatial choreography remains coherent across Elias's climb, whisper-navigation, and arrival at the Heart. The geomagnetic storm constrains tactics (compasses spin, electronics fail, sound warps) and charges the whisper-versus-shout test. The zodiac wheel and storm-induced magnetic resonance offer micro-setting that shapes the unlock method, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment constrains choice or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt dock, boathouse shutters, dental mirror, and canal surface are consistently present and sensory detail is vivid. However, the environment does not constrain Elara's choices or alter tactics; the shutters and mirror function as tools for spectacle rather than as pressure points. Spatial choreography remains clear. The micro-setting (shutters, mirror) charges the final image but does not force a trade-off, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt library and magnetic grotto supply vivid anchors and constrain Elias's method (lodestone synchronization), charging the final image with the "amplified quiet" of the town stirring. Spatial choreography is coherent within scenes. However, the town itself remains a placeholder—no street names, no economic texture, no sensory detail that roots the Council's "lockstep" conformity in lived particulars. The grotto's starlight dome and lodestone veins are ornamental when not tied to a visible cost or tactical friction.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sublittoral fringe anchors the story with sensory detail (bioluminescent waves, salt-crusted fish, barnacle-crusted hulls) and the dockside tavern provides a stage for the confrontation. The scrimshaw's physical presence (cool weight, glowing carvings) constrains the climactic action when Elara uses it to cut the mooring rope. However, the Cataclysm rule (violence becomes impossible) doesn't shape tactical choices on the page, and the disappearing island's materialization feels like setting-as-reward rather than environment-as-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    The farmhouse, turbines, scarred table, and bouquet are consistently anchored and filtered through the protagonist's grief-performance frame. The turbine hum functions as micro-setting, modulating from "remade hush" to "dirge" and shaping the performer's soliloquy rhythm. The carved turbine blade and dried flowers constrain the performer's symbolic vocabulary and charge the final talisman. Spatial choreography (kitchen, window, table) remains clear across moves, and sensory selection (shavings, blood, crumbling petals) reflects urgency without catalog sprawl.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and quartz colonnade anchor place vividly with sensory specificity (lantern-moth hush, translucent quartz veined with starlight, steam rising in wisps). The colonnade constrains the crossing attempt—pillars lean inward to form the archway—satisfying the 9+ gate partially. However, spatial choreography blurs: the poet moves from "before them" to "through" to "the far side" without clear distances or thresholds, and the lake's edge appears suddenly after the crossing. Micro-setting (quartz pulse syncing with his pulse) charges one early beat but does not recur at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glassblower's courtyard anchors the piece with vivid, purposeful detail: "twisted glass spires caught the reborn sun in fractured glints," fern fronds by the quenching trough, and the winding stair of fused glass shards all ground the action. Sensory selection reflects Elias's tactile focus ("fingers tracing warped curves") and the reed tongue's vibration charges the climax. The micro-setting (courtyard, spire, workbench) constrains movement and supplies the tools (reed tongue, plant arrangements) that shape Elias's tactics, elevating the environment beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    The laboratory setting is vivid and consistent: vaulted ceilings, suspended gongs, holographic maps, chambers named with purpose. The carbide lens is handled across multiple beats, focusing sound waves and enabling tactical shifts. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Elowen moves freely from chamber to chamber without spatial friction or resource scarcity. The lens charges the final image ("lens in hand") but its unique properties (thick glass, acetylene-etched curve) do not create a visible trade-off or limit her options at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.1)
    The observatory's brass telescopes, orreries, and obsidian domes supply vivid texture, but remain postcard detail—no tool or spatial constraint shapes a choice or alters tactics. The "curtains of intention" are conceptually interesting yet never function as physical obstacles or resources that pressure Elara's actions. The micro-setting (her hands, tools, vellum) appears but doesn't constrain a beat with cost. Sensory selection is omnidirectional catalog rather than urgency-filtered perception.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft is vividly rendered and anchors the opening, and the measuring tape's brass clasp and precise spacing provide tactile micro-setting detail. The loft's alcoves and central table guide spatial choreography cleanly. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; the skylight's rain does not constrain a choice, and the table's clutter supports the demonstration but does not alter Elara's or Theo's options under stress. The post-crash world outside remains abstract—"crumbling warehouse district," "foraging survivors"—without pressing inward to test the protagonists' resources or access.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.6)
    Capping Q3 at 7.0 per the Orientation Test. The archive is described with vivid fragments ("fractured obelisks," "bioluminescent fungi") but these details do not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics. The pagoda's physical properties (bronze, multifaceted, twilight) are ornamental; its "iridescent fire" repels her early attempts without clear spatial or material logic. Sensory selection remains generic tourist-catalog description ("dust motes danced like fleeting regrets") rather than filtered through professional or personal bias. No tool, body state, or environmental feature charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.7)
    The blooming library above clouds is vivid and purposeful, with luminous orbs, crystal panes, and "perpetual mist" creating a coherent ethereal space. The river stone anchors tactile grounding and recurs meaningfully. Spatial choreography is clear (aisles, orb clusters, nexus placement). However, the environment does not constrain a pivotal choice or pressure a tactic; Elara moves freely through the setting without friction, and the "thin, crisp air" and "clouds parting below" remain postcard details rather than forces shaping the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.7)
    The misty workshop under stars is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (dew-kissed fog, iridescent scales catching starlight, velvet canopy). Micro-setting elements—the chameleon's tail tip on the floor, the mossy branch—anchor reflection and recur in the final image. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it serves as atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure. The tail tip functions as talisman and metaphor but does not shape a live decision within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tower setting is anchored early with vivid details (ivy, stone walls, subterranean springs, floor stones) and the hourglass as object constrains her digging action—she uses its base to pry the stone. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elena's scar-seeking lens, and the impossible moonlight at dawn adds atmospheric charge to the discovery. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the tunnel sequence, and the frosted-then-thawing hourglass charges the final image by marking time's resumption.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.4)
    The projection booth is textured with brass gears, cobwebs, dust, stained-glass marquee, and a hidden panel—enough to ground the micro-setting. Spatial detail ("ducts twisting like veins," "tin box wedged in the panel") serves Elara's spatially imaginative trait and enables the discovery. The booth's architecture is explicitly framed as a vessel for emotions, which charges the final projection image. Thunder and velvet seats below add atmosphere. The booth constrains her search and provides the hidden compartment, meeting the micro-setting standard for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.1)
    The aurora-lit archway and astrolabe are vividly rendered with sensory detail (ethereal greens, brass humming, frost-kissed threshold). The archway functions as a threshold and the astrolabe is handled across multiple beats, but neither constrains a choice that alters tactics—Elara's actions (kneeling, adjusting dials) are ritualized rather than problem-solving. The body under stress (aching, exhaustion) is noted but does not reshape her approach, and the final image does not charge these details with new meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glowing dune functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: phosphor thorns house the clock, blooms cradle sparks, veins thread the sand. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("silica veins that throb with hidden fire," "petals parting to reveal sparks"), filtered through the guard's perceptual lens. The dune's glow "fractures sharper" as pressure builds, modulating with the narrative arc. Spatial choreography is coherent across the guard's movements. The final image—blooms glowing on, petals folding soft—charges closure by embodying the cultivated sparks. The dune is indispensable to the story's logic and directly shapes the ending, meeting the high-band test for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    The mechanical rainforest is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail (oakron's breathing scales, ferncoil clicking into a ladder, baobabrons chiming), and the small gear constrains the climax by fitting into Elias's hidden socket. However, the micro-setting is underused tactically; most environmental features serve ornamental world-building rather than forcing on-page choices. The corewheel's physical layout and Elias's climb lack spatial choreography, and the forest's sentience arrives too late to pressure earlier moves.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=5.9)
    The veiled ridgeway and tidal pool setting constrain movement through fog and indirect routes, shaping the journey's tactics. Sensory work—"brambles parting like reluctant curtains," "saltwater spray"—grounds key beats. However, spatial choreography remains vague (how do they reach the promontory? where exactly are the guides standing?), and the setting functions more as symbolic backdrop than tactical pressure that narrows options at closure. The ticket punch's star stamp charges the final pool image, lifting the score past pure postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt fortress, snow, and spiral staircase are vivid and consistent. The "slightest discoloration" cue and the wobbly piano bench constrain Elias's discovery turn. However, the setting largely remains postcard backdrop; the fortress's "chill embrace" and "vaulted ice ceilings" do not pressure choices beyond the initial mood-setting. The neural-link archive access is an unmotivated convenience that bypasses spatial discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.9)
    The temple library is vivid and purposeful: dust motes, vaulted arches, constellations wheeling outside. The eternal font provides water for the ink, and the temporal snare binds Lirion—both constrain his method and charge the stakes. Spatial choreography (hidden pouch, shadowed alcove, towering stacks) remains clear. The "pause of shifting constellations" recurs to frame the timeframe and returns at closure, reweighting the library's role, which lifts this into the 6.5–7.0 neighborhood.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    The monitoring station supplies concrete sensory anchors—rusted railing, solar hum, corroded holodisks, groaning moorings—that filter through Elias's professional and memorial priorities. Spatial choreography is clear across deck, observation level, and workbench. The station's moored-yet-drifting state directly mirrors and pressures Elias's suspended life, meeting the 9+ gate test: environment charges the final image when he steps to the deck "tethered eternally to the sea's slow mending." The post-ban Pacific setting supplies world rules (inertia of sea rise, nascent coral regeneration) that constrain his inquiry and enable the closure insight.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.1)
    The spaceport repair bay is anchored early with vivid, purpose-driven detail ("rusted hulls," "grit-strewn ferrocrete," "fractured dome"). Sensory selection reflects the POV's priorities (stars, relics, the stone circle's chill). However, the setting does not constrain a key choice—Elara moves freely through the bay without spatial or resource friction. The stone circle charges the final image but appears late (past midpoint) and does not shape prior tactics, capping the score below 7.0 per the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.1)
    The volcanic hot springs constrain the ritual (hottest spring, triple-moon alignment) and the geothermal garden supplies both the telepathic plants and the resin-sealed embryo. Sensory detail is selective—steam, sulfur vents, obsidian rocks, scaffolds—and the setting charges the closure image (glowing grove, roaring geysers). However, spatial choreography is vague: we never see Mira move from garden to Primordial Pool, and the workers' lanterns and scaffolds hover as backdrop rather than obstacles. The micro-setting (her body wading into scalding water, clutching amber) does constrain the final beat, lifting the score into the 6-band.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.1)
    The arboretum's glass enclosures, gravel trails, and ferns provide strong spatial grounding, and the lighthouse vents deliver the wind-whine that triggers the freeze—environment directly constrains Elena's body and focus. The fireflies at dusk and the automated lighthouse beam frame the closure image, charging the final beat with atmospheric specificity that ties setting to theme.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lighthouse library is vividly anchored with sensory detail (salt-scented air, bioluminescent fungi, spiral stairs) and the setting constrains Elias's movement through the descent. The walls "closing in" and the storm's claustrophobic pressure are evocative, but the environment never materially alters a choice at a pivotal beat—Elias's path is pre-determined by symbolic necessity rather than spatial constraint. The loom chamber and hidden panels appear late without earlier setup, reducing their causal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.1)
    The wind-carved encampment is evocative in the opening, and the ink patterns on parched ground anchor the inciting action. However, spatial choreography is weak: we never learn tent positions, distances, or how the ink pools relate to Elowen's or Mira's locations. The void and "prismatic shards" remain abstract; no tactile or sensory detail grounds the journey. The encampment does not constrain any choice or charge the final image, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.2)
    The Vault Library setting—ice-glazed shelves, cryo-pods, frost-rimed controls—is vividly rendered and atmospherically dense, but it functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint. The console and pods are present throughout, but no environmental feature narrows Elara's options or complicates her choice at the climax. The snow and echoing chambers recur as mood rather than pressure, and the final image does not depend on a specific physical detail to charge its meaning. Micro-setting (the console, the pods) is handled but does not alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.6)
    The glass dome and rose beds are anchored early and provide spatial coherence. The sandbag scrap and its "QUIET" engraving constrain one choice (mixing residue into soil), lifting the score slightly. However, much of the setting remains postcard-descriptive ("fire-kissed crimson," "scorching sands beyond") without tactical pressure on Elara's moves. The breach and looter approach are noted but not leveraged as spatial puzzles or resource limits during the confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sound wave garden is vividly rendered with transliterating petals, sonic thorns, and convulsing vines. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. The rail spike functions as a tool across beats (forge, piercing waves, hauling). However, setting operates primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain a key choice or charge the final image in a way that would elevate the score into the 9-band. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.1)
    The echoing observatory provides atmospheric detail (dome glass, brass telescope, mist-shrouded roads) and the acoustic properties add sensory texture. However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics; it functions as backdrop rather than pressure. The rosewood pen nib's physical implausibility ("rosewood too soft for nibs, yet...flawlessly") weakens verisimilitude. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sensory details are vivid ("echoes of forgotten whispers clung to the walls like frost," "amber, warm as trapped sunlight") but largely decorative. The laboratory's machines and the antique oak desk appear but don't constrain choices—Elias moves through the space without spatial friction or resource limits. The amber does charge the final image by being tattooed, pushing the score into the mid-5s, but the setting otherwise functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.9)
    The whispering grotto, lilac mist, and acoustic tiles are vividly rendered and spatially coherent throughout. The tile flake and sand mandala function as micro-setting elements that directly enable the closure effect (the hush spreads from the mandala's core). Sensory details are purposeful and filtered through Elara's artist perspective, though the mist and color palette ("lilac," "azure and amethyst") risk decorative repetition. The grotto's acoustic properties constrain tactics (whispers carry, creating unintended exposure) and the setting charges the final image when the group's voices hush and the grotto "holds its breath."

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.4)
    The plaza's "cracked flagstones," "crimson fissures," and the mosaic stepping stone provide vivid anchors. The tessera constrains Elara's method (chipped patterns as retrocognitive keys) and appears in the closure image ("solid underfoot, anchoring the new era"), meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Sensory selection is strong ("cold light like frozen blood," "wind sighed") but some details ("weathered mosaic stepping stone" vs. "minaret mosaic tessera") create minor confusion about object identity. Spatial choreography is clear; survivors' movements track coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.1)
    The mystic orchard and hedge maze are vividly rendered with synesthetic color-sounds, and the tarot coin is handled twice (picked up, pocketed, later flipped). The setting supplies the ghost encounter and the fruits pulse in rhythm, creating atmosphere. However, the environment does not meaningfully constrain Elena's choices—she wanders in, sings, exits—without spatial or resource friction altering her tactics. The maze "seemed shorter" at dawn is told rather than used to pressure a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.4)
    The light painting studio is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (ozone scent, low lights, black cloths swallowing photons) and the muscovite geode sliver's fractal surfaces are handled across multiple beats, constraining the experimental method and charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the exposures. The studio functions as micro-setting that enables the resolution, lifting the score, though occupational detail about long-exposure photography is asserted rather than demonstrated under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.1)
    Cave anchors are vivid early (salt spray, mineral drips, bioluminescent algae), and the fossil's limestone texture provides one micro-setting beat. However, spatial choreography blurs during the float sequence—"hidden fissure," "churning ocean," "submerged ruins" appear without clear position or access logic. The coastal network supplies atmosphere but does not constrain a key choice; Lira floats freely without environmental resistance. Micro-setting (fossil in palm) charges one mid-scene moment but does not return with altered meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    The amber warehouse is vividly anchored early with layered sensory detail (glowing chunks, lantern light "like trapped fireflies," scarred workbench). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the setting supplies the buttons and jar that Elias uses. The cliffs frame the opening and closing, and the warehouse "sighs" as the prophecy loosens, charging the final image. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Elias's cataloging proceeds without spatial obstacle or material limit—so Q3 cannot reach the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.7)
    Zephyr Bluff's mist, crevices, and rook's nest provide atmospheric specificity and the rope ladder descent adds spatial coherence. The snow codes constrain Lena's test and Elias's decode attempt, grounding world-rules in action. However, the bluff functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental feature narrows a choice at the closure beat. The engraved pillbox and wrist rig are handled, but their mechanics remain abstract—"burst signal" and "Cyrillic runes" lack the procedural detail that would make them tools under pressure rather than plot tokens.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.6)
    The fog-bound crossing and gutters' ticking are vivid and recur, but they do not constrain a choice or alter the coachman's tactics. The yarn needle and tapestry function more as thematic objects than as environmental pressure. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, yet the setting remains a backdrop rather than a crucible that shapes the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    The beekeeping oasis is vividly rendered with skeletal hives, sand-choked fountains, and adobe murals that anchor the setting in sensory detail. Spatial choreography remains clear as Kai moves from perimeter to wall to hives. The setting constrains his method (sun patterns guide his tracing) and the clay-shaping draws on oasis materials, lifting this above postcard description. However, the environment does not force a difficult choice or materially alter his departure, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.1)
    The luminous harbor by moonlight supplies vivid sensory anchors (buoys glowing, masts swaying, moonlight fracturing into diamonds) and the skiff provides spatial grounding for the central conversation. However, environment functions mostly as backdrop; the harbor does not constrain Elara's choices or supply resources that alter outcome. The gauge tooth is handled twice (held aloft, pressed into Mira's palm) but its physical properties do not shape tactics beyond symbolic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Tidal Library setting is vivid and distinctive—shelves groaning under mist waves, crystal panes, stone circle with Aelari runes—and the vertical, cloud-borne space is filtered through Elara's urgency. The brass sundial as a recurring object constrains her attempt to bridge past and present, though its "atomically reflective" property remains more asserted than dramatized. The environment supplies the hum and mist that complicate her ritual, but the final ascent ("clouds parted for aerial currents, the Tidal Library ascending higher") modulates atmosphere without altering her tactical options. Sensory detail is dense but sometimes ornamental rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lotus temple and lily pond provide atmospheric specificity but function as postcard backdrop rather than constraint. Spatial choreography breaks: Elara's boat "nudges the installation's base" while "pilgrims gathered at its edge" and Theo "approached through the parted crowd"—positions become impossible to map. The thrush's nest twig spiral receives detailed attention and appears in the climax, narrowly reaching one causal turn. Sensory detail leans heavily visual ("prismatic," "rainbow-hued") with minimal tactile or auditory grounding beyond generic "whispers" and one trilled birdsong.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.1)
    The radio station is anchored early with vivid detail (CRT screens, coffee stains, solder tang), and the transmitter tower recurs as a physical anchor. The charts function as both tool and micro-setting, constraining her method. However, spatial choreography during Harlan's arrival is vague—where are the enforcers positioned, how does she "seize the moment" to lock the console while they're in the room? The university campus and town remain postcard generic; fog and barricades are mentioned but don't pressure her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.1)
    The shadowed nexus under starlight is vividly sketched—cracked vault, elongated shadows, crumbling arches, skeletal organ pipes—anchoring place and tone. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; no spatial feature constrains a choice or alters Elias's tactics. The compass and organ are handled on the page, yet their physical properties (star-metal hum, ivory keys) remain ornamental until the climax, where the compass suddenly gains anchoring power without prior mechanical grounding. Sensory detail is heavily visual with occasional tactile notes (air thick, compass burning hot), but the setting does not charge the final image or force a spatial trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    The quarry setting is vivid and specific ("mist veiled," "jagged rocks," "flooded basin"), and the ribbon fragment constrains the final beat by supplying the key evidence. Sensory detail ("Cold seeping into her bones," "velvet drinking her essence") anchors the atmosphere. The micro-setting (quarry floor grid, moss-buried ribbon) charges the ending sequence when the ribbon is matched to Lance's attic trophy, lifting the score into mid-6s despite some postcard phrasing ("furrowed hush," "mist coiling").

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.1)
    The weather station's fog, buckled dome, and weeping walls establish a vivid, oppressive atmosphere filtered through Elara's librarian lens (charts, archives). "Spongey dread" recurs as both sensory and thematic texture. The copper nail's verdigris glyphs and the crate's false bottom offer tactile micro-setting that charges two beats (discovery, vault unlock), meeting the 9+ gate criterion of constraining choice. However, spatial choreography between archive and command vault is thin, and the "roiling sea below" appears once without integrating into action.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.1)
    The mountain pullout and scaffold wrap are vividly rendered and the wrap's "fluttering cartography" provides a concrete map that shapes the protagonist's next move. Sensory detail is selective and the body (calloused fingers, kneeling, breath catching) grounds key beats. However, the setting functions more as backdrop than constraint—the environment does not narrow options or force a trade-off at closure, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.1)
    The circus train setting is vivid in the opening ("rusted tracks," "faded stripes," "cracked windows") and recurs at closure, but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics in the middle beats. The territorial markers (hoops with LEDs) are described but function as decoration rather than lived-in spatial pressure. The micro-setting allowance is not met: no tool, body, or recurring object forces a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.1)
    Observatory setting (stone walls, brass instruments, cliff-side temple) is vivid and filtered through Thorne's professional lens. The daylily-pressed telegram charges the final image ("fragile beauty mirroring the dawn"), meeting micro-setting allowance. However, environment does not constrain a choice—characters move freely from observatory to temple without spatial friction. Sensory detail is selective (star charts, ink-stained fingers, roseate dawn) but remains descriptive rather than tactically decisive, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.6)
    The vortex setting supplies vivid images—rotating apple trees, frost-kissed soil underwater, ice shard at core—but functions primarily as backdrop. Spatial choreography (kneeling, pressing seed, wading out) remains legible. The seed and ice constrain the central action sequence, and the frozen confession shard provides a goal-object, lifting the setting's role slightly. However, the orchard's "warlike serenity" and the trees' "retaliation with gusts" describe rather than mechanically alter Thorne's tactics; no environmental cost (cold, drowning risk, root entanglement) forces a trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt glade's pulsing blue leaves and the maze topiary clipping provide vivid anchors. The glade's glow intensifies during the ritual, and roots extend toward the clipping, creating a micro-setting that constrains and enables Elara's action. Spatial choreography (lap, palms, root-tendrils) remains clear. The setting charges the final image without becoming mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.4)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly anchored with sensory particulars (phosphorescent fungi, bone-laced walls, loam-strewn corridors, roots coiling). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elara kneels, chants, and completes the ritual without environmental resistance—preventing entry to the 9-band. The burned tarot card and roots function as props rather than environmental pressures that shape outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.4)
    The quarry trailer, dust motes, and blast echoes establish atmosphere and recur purposefully. The scrap itself functions as micro-setting, but spatial choreography grows vague in the second half: "descended toward the foreman's rig," "climbed into his truck" lack grounding in prior layout. Sensory detail (grimy windows, scarred Formica, golden dust) is vivid early but becomes generic in the closing sequence. The quarry's physical constraint does not visibly alter Harl's tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    The magnetic arbor is vividly rendered with iron-rich bark, electromagnetic hum, and levitation physics that create a distinct micro-setting. Spatial choreography is coherent (kneeling in levitated pots, leaning against bark). The setting constrains one choice: planting the seed to stabilize the arbor's descent risk. However, the arbor's mechanics (fields wavering post-spirit) feel more decorative than tactically urgent; Elias never wrestles with resource scarcity or environmental pressure that alters his approach.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal atrium constrains the librarian's work (tides drive rhythms, the forge-pool is the smelting site) and charges the final image with "waves receding, revealing submerged scrolls." Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered: "waves lapping her ankles as books bobbed nearby." The bamboo creel and the central forge-pool are tactile, recurring anchors. Spatial choreography remains clear across the pursuit and smelting beats.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    The crystal caves are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (mineral tang, hush amplifying scrapes, facets refracting light). The setting constrains Elias's movement through the labyrinthine layout and the final act depends on the master crystal node's engineered socket. The seashell and pearl function as micro-setting objects that charge the closure image, though the spatial choreography of the "core chamber" and "apex" remains slightly abstract. Environment constrains one key choice (the crowning), meeting the 9+ quick test threshold but not reaching higher due to the single beat of constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.4)
    The overgrown railway station is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (ivy-cloaked platforms, rusted tracks, dust motes). The accordion and bathroom graffiti function as micro-settings that constrain Elias's exploration. However, spatial choreography becomes vague in the bathroom sequence (wedging boot into sink to view graffiti reads implausible). The station shapes atmosphere but does not constrain a pivotal choice; Elias moves through it without environmental resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.4)
    The glowing library with mist-shrouded shelves and amber-violet stacks establishes vivid sensory atmosphere early. Spatial choreography tracks clearly (pedestal, archway, inner sanctum progression). The watch functions as a micro-setting object that constrains her cipher-solving attempt, and "propagation delays" manifests as both auditory lag and visual flicker, pressuring her decoding method. The setting does not evolve causally after early establishment, and the final sanctum is described but does not impose a new obstacle or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.1)
    The velvet observatory and ice violin are vividly described, but spatial choreography drifts—Elara moves from desk to coffee pot to ivy without clear distances or blocking. The transparent violin's "unmelting under midsummer's gaze due to enchanted provenance" is told rather than tested; its physical properties never constrain a choice. The ivy's spread in the final beats offers a visual anchor that charges the ending image, lifting the score slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.4)
    The skyborne grotto, aurora, and alabaster slab anchor space vividly. Sensory detail leans heavily visual ("emerald chip pulsing," "viridian fire") with minimal tactile or auditory grounding beyond "faint crackles." The chip—handled, pierced, clutched, placed—functions as micro-setting and constrains the infusion action at closure, elevating integration. However, the grotto itself supplies atmosphere more than tactical friction; no spatial feature (vault height, vine-laced walls, void below) alters a choice or shapes the ending image directly.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.7)
    The umbral grotto, ancient vines, and clouds supply consistent atmosphere, and the eldest oak's "scalloping branches" link setting detail to the ritual motif. The vine crevice yields the hairpin, grounding a key turn in spatial particulars. However, the grotto remains largely painterly—"perpetual twilight," "ethereal mists"—without pressuring Elara's choices; she moves through it freely. The rebirth flower's wilted state from past fire does constrain the ending action (she must heal it), lifting the score. Overall, setting charges mood and supplies the hairpin but does not force trade-offs or alter tactics under present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lighthouse, chimes, and dawn are vividly described and anchor the single scene cleanly. However, the environment remains decorative: chimes "speak" but do not constrain Alex's choices—he could reach the same decision in any setting. The hollow mirror shard is handled twice but its "emptiness" functions as symbolic commentary rather than a physical constraint that alters tactics or options.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    The floating basalt platform, luminous moss, and magnetic grotto supply vivid sensory anchors and the pond's mirroring effect charges the trance sequence. However, none of these elements constrains a choice or alters tactics—they remain atmospheric backdrops. The 9+ gate (environment must constrain choice or charge final image) is not met, capping the score at 8.8; orientation debt further lowers it.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    The bone towers, canyon echoes, and layered dust are vivid and consistent, filtering through Thren's reverent perspective ("relics as if they were the canyon's own weathered prayers"). Spatial choreography is clear across the vigil, and the arrowhead's obsidian gleam and pulsing spirals supply tactile detail. The setting constrains Thren's method (harmonic stone skips from tower ledges) and the final image places him "amid the bone towers, dust sifting eternally," but the environment does not force a tactical choice or charge the closure with new friction—it remains backdrop to his patient waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=4.7)
    The icebound spire is vividly evoked with selective sensory detail (frost-etched stairs, winds howling, ozone-tinged air), and the setting's impossibilities (defying gravity, perpetual twilight) are established early. However, the environment does not constrain a tactical choice or charge the final image in a way that alters outcome—Thorne's path up the spire is linear, and the keystone's location in a mist vortex introduces the mist-walking requirement but does not force a tradeoff. Spatial choreography is clear, but the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than an active agent in the closure. Orientation Test penalty waived; the 9+ gate (environment must constrain choice or charge final image) is not met, capping this category at 8.8, though execution does not reach that threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.8)
    Setting details are vivid and atmospheric—the receded tide, the Leviathan's jagged spine, bioluminescent fungi—and the library constrains Elias's search spatially. The key tag glows in proximity to the library, linking object and environment. However, much of the description reads ornamental rather than functional; the sunken ship becomes a postcard backdrop after entry, and the final lantern release occurs without spatial consequence or environmental cost.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ambered observatory deck is vividly rendered with selective detail (brass orrery, amber resin, frozen light) and recurs across beats, creating a coherent micro-setting. The amber material constrains Elara's recording method (she etches onto shards), meeting the 9+ test's requirement that setting shape a choice. However, the spatial choreography remains static—Elara sits, casts coins, listens—without movement or environmental evolution that would charge the final image. Sensory selection leans heavily visual; the contracted universe's tactile or auditory pressure on her body is mostly asserted rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    The observatory setting is vivid and purposeful: cracked marble, domed ceiling amplifying sound, scattered light through the oculus all serve the ritual. The atlas page and plinth function as micro-setting elements that constrain Elowen's actions and charge the final image. Sensory detail (dust motes, prismatic light, crystallized scales) is well-integrated and filtered through the reaper's attention. The environment shapes the naming process and appears in the closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sapphire viaduct's "crystalline arches" and the dripping condensation supply vivid visual anchors, and the drips' accelerating/lagging rhythm constrains Elowen's repair tactic in the middle beat. Dawn's prolonged "lingering light" feels temporally vague, and the sea "far below" lacks concrete spatial reference (height, access, proximity). The bell and tools (phosphorescent oil, Leviathan-bone pendulum) are named but their physical handling—temperature, texture, resistance—remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.1)
    The midnight ridgeway and resurfacing spires provide atmospheric anchors, and the sapphire label functions as a micro-object. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (shack, levee edge, overlook), though the ridgeway's geography remains vague. The label and photographs constrain the trail Elias follows, but the environment itself does not pressure his choices—he could walk this trail anywhere. The final image of spires "like sapphire promises" repeats the hue but does not charge the closure with environmental cost.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.1)
    The orchard is vividly rendered ("luminous orbs," "mossy roots that pulsed like veins") but functions as scenic backdrop—no environmental constraint shapes Elara's choices. The crystal and flame are handled across multiple beats (setup, warming, thawing), and the waterfall frames entry and exit, meeting the micro-setting standard for a functional score. However, the setting does not pressure tactics or charge the final image beyond atmosphere; removing the orchard and substituting any sacred grove would leave the plot intact.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.9)
    The nocturnal arbor is vividly established (branches "twisted like veins," "sky-spanning canopy") and the parachute buckle becomes a tactile anchor. The arbor's height and the abyss below create spatial pressure. However, the setting primarily frames action rather than constraining a choice—Elias could perform the same protocol revision from any observation post. The buckle's dual-release mechanism does charge the revision moment, meeting the micro-setting test minimally.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.1)
    The floating rock dojo, temporal vortices, and central altar are vividly named and carry genre atmosphere. The jar appears in multiple beats (clutched, seized, placed on altar) and the Blade slices illusions, giving tactile presence. However, spatial choreography during the clash remains abstract—no clear distances or body positions—and the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The setting decorates rather than pressures; micro-setting exception not met because the jar and Blade function as plot keys, not lived constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.1)
    The echo chamber tunnel is vividly rendered with bioluminescent fungi, vaulted length, and resonant walls. Spatial choreography is clear (arc of blowers, spectral table at far end), and the acoustics amplify the lullabies, which matters to the method. However, the environment does not constrain Elias's choices or force him to adapt; it merely amplifies his unchallenged ritual. The setting supports atmosphere but does not charge the final image or alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sensory detail is vivid and consistent (rime, frozen soil, mist, thorns). The frozen garden shapes atmosphere effectively and the pendant's warmth provides tactile contrast. However, the setting remains largely postcard-description; no on-page choice is altered by spatial constraint or environmental feature. The pendant's etchings are described as "maps inside my mind's eye" but do not guide a visible tactical decision. The garden "folding into my being" at closure is metaphorical rather than a concrete spatial move that constrains action.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.7)
    The ember nexus is vividly rendered with "frozen blooms of ash and glow" and "frost-laced core," creating a coherent atmosphere. The crozier's physical degradation (shattered crook, scarred shaft) is concrete and tracks across attempts. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the nexus's properties don't constrain Elias's choices or enable the final breakthrough—he could perform these experiments almost anywhere with fire and tools.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.4)
    The suspended radio tower city is vividly rendered with spatial detail (catwalk, swaying bridges, perforated steel, thousand-foot abyss). Sensory selection is strong in the opening and climb sequences ("fraying tethers," "gorge's mists," "moon gripped the metal"). The Hollywood star fragment and shard of hush function as micro-setting that constrains her tuning process, shaping the central choice. However, the gorge's transformation from speaker to amplifier basin is told rather than shown through environmental cues that alter her tactics in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.1)
    The spectral grotto is vividly rendered ("crystalline walls gleamed ethereally, stars piercing through jagged fissures") and provides the stage for the climax, constraining the ferry's passage and offering the starlight Elias aligns with the hourglass patterns. The radio shack and hourglass function as micro-settings that enable key actions. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The grotto does not, however, impose a consequential obstacle or resource scarcity that alters tactics with cost—it serves primarily as atmospheric backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    The optical illusion gallery supplies vivid, purposeful images (staircases into skies, morphing faces, translucent sinew loom) that charge atmosphere and constrain Elias's action at the central exhibit. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through his fever-architect perspective. The sinew threads function as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and charged at closure when their "echo lingered in his palms." However, spatial choreography blurs during the eruption—visitors "emerge from hiding" without prior mention—and the gallery's physical layout remains generic beyond the central loom.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.1)
    Benthic setting provides vivid sensory anchors (bioluminescent glow, pressure seals, phosphorescent fish) and the vaulted chamber is spatially coherent. However, environment remains postcard description; no choice is constrained by depth, pressure, or resource scarcity. The chain link is handled twice (extended to Elara, clutched during simulation) but does not alter access or options—it serves as visual aid rather than constraint. Spatial choreography is clean but the setting does not pressure the instructional exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.1)
    The mist-clad atrium is signaled early and recurs as a tonal anchor, but it does not constrain choice or supply tactical friction. The hearing aid (an object) and the photograph function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image when Clara takes the photo home. Spatial choreography is loose: Elara "moved quietly" to Clara at the balustrade, but distance and blocking remain vague. The setting supports atmosphere but does not narrow options under pressure, capping high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.7)
    The facility is vividly anchored: jagged cave mouth, bioluminescent kelp, drowned antechamber, rusted consoles, tangled fiber optics. Spatial choreography is clear (rappel → squeeze → airlock breach → central lab → nexus chamber → cliff exit). The codex on its pedestal and the cable nexus chamber supply resources that affect outcome, elevating this beyond postcard description. Minor: "gold flecks traced arcane patterns, pulsing in sync with the cables' hidden rhythms" is vivid but not tied to a micro-choice; the environment constrains (narrowing passage, rising tide) but does not alter her tactics—she phases through rather than solving the squeeze or flood via environmental interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.1)
    The opal observatory, snow, frosted glass, and cracked console establish vivid sensory anchors. The porcelain shard is handled across beats (placed at center, scraped to etch patterns, pocketed at end) and the opal refractions charge the final image. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the ink-spilling action and its interaction with the console is somewhat abstract. The setting supplies atmosphere but does not constrain a key choice—Elara's actions would proceed similarly in any abandoned lab.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bone towers, canyon echoes, and tunnel of echoes are vivid and consistent, anchoring every beat. The flawed diamond and the flock's aerial geometries become functional micro-settings that constrain and enable Thorne's final act: he positions the gem at the tunnel mouth, synchronizes his chant to wingbeats, and the birds' shadows modulate reverberations. This charges the closure image—setting details directly shape the resolution. Sensory specificity (grit, silk, frost translated into bass, harmonics, staccato) is purposeful and POV-filtered, though at times the metaphoric density risks ornament over immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.1)
    The underground garden supplies vivid sensory detail—glowing ferns, rime crystals, stalactites—but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The arrowhead and phone are handled, but spatial choreography (how Elara moves between beds, where objects rest) remains vague. The garden's "gravitationally playful" air does not alter tactics or foreclose movement, so the setting remains ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.1)
    The enchanted orchard with living statues is vividly anchored through sensory detail (rusting blossoms, gears in tree trunks, lantern eyes). The sky-bridge as setting enables Elara's position above patrol patterns, and the central tree's base becomes the site of uprooting. However, spatial choreography during the descent and uprooting is compressed; we lose track of statue positions and how Elara evades them. The locust shell is handled on the bridge and at the tree, charging the final image with its crack, which lifts the score into mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt arcade at twilight supplies vivid sensory anchors (neon haze, blue pulse, pinball ghosts) filtered through Elias's lens. The vial's glow and the booth's vent enable drone launches, grounding the method in spatial detail. However, the arcade functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint meaningfully narrows a choice at closure. The bottle charges earlier beats but does not reweight the final image, capping micro-setting credit below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting is vivid and selective: "faded banners fluttered like ghosts," "vines cascaded from cracked skylights," "spring that wept from the undercarriage." The oasis functions as micro-setting that enables the restoration (providing relics and the halo fragment) and the final workshop beat grounds the closure image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (smell of mildew, wind bells' chime). However, spatial choreography within the train's "forked corridor" and "hidden flatbed car" remains vague, and the oasis's physics (a spring in an undercarriage supporting wildflowers) strains plausibility without explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    The scientific poetry library is vividly rendered ("volumes of quantum sonnets and fractal elegies," "worn oak floors," "pseudospherical model from the stacks") and the scarf functions as micro-setting throughout multiple beats. The setting supplies the pseudosphere and texts that Eliza references, lending plausible constraint to her ritual. However, the library does not pressure a key choice—patrons drift obliviously and no resource shortage or spatial obstacle alters her attempt—so the environment remains atmospheric rather than causal. The scarf's warming and the library's "heart pulsed faintly" charge the final image but do not constrain the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lighthouse apex with glass dome, antique camera, and watercolor palette constrain the ritual across three dawns. Sensory details (salt-laced winds, rustling fronds, fogged trays) are vivid but often ornamental, filtering through elevated diction rather than Elara's professional or personal priorities. The palette's wells depleting and the darkroom's archipelago breath do charge the closure image. Spatial choreography (spiral climb, lens and film plane) remains coherent, meeting the micro-setting test for 9+ eligibility, but the whispering archipelago itself functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.1)
    The nexus and starlight recur but remain abstract postcards—"paths from forgotten worlds converged," "cosmic possibility humming"—without constraining a choice or supplying a tactical resource. The anvil and ribbon are named but not handled in ways that alter options; spatial choreography is unclear (where does the woman stand relative to the locksmith, pillar, anvil?). No micro-setting detail (body, tool, small object) charges the final image or forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sunken greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is vividly rendered and constrains Elias's movement (brackish water, silt-choked vines, fractured dome). The broken constellations function as both setting detail and mystical map, directly shaping his detection method. Sensory specificity is strong: "overripe fruit and salt wind," "phosphorescence," "warped glass." The setting charges the final image when the fairy ring's glow fades, functioning as a threshold that closes behind him.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.1)
    The forgotten library setting is atmospheric with effective details (dust motes, cracked spines, creaking floorboards, swing outside). Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. However, the environment never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters tactics; it functions as vivid backdrop rather than pressure element. The glass pane that traps the shadow appears late without prior anchoring, reducing its integration.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.1)
    The verdant parapet, waterfall, and orchards are described with vivid sensory detail ("mossy ledge," "spray danced in sunbeams"), but they function as backdrop rather than constraint—no choice hinges on proximity, access, or environmental friction. The heirloom seed is handled across multiple beats (revealed, glowing, pressed into Elowen's palm, planted), qualifying as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, though the "weaving between worlds" remains abstract and does not impose legible physical or social limits on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prism sanctuary and starlight anchors are vivid and recur purposefully, charging the final dawn image. The tapestry needle and net gain tactile presence through handling ("needle dove deeper," "knots bloated with silenced screams"), and the sanctuary's sensory palette—fractured light, silt, porcelain—remains coherent. However, spatial choreography is vague: the net's location relative to workbench and prisms is unclear, and "hanging crystals" never constrain movement or choice. Sensory detail tilts heavily visual; touch and sound are underused in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rain-scoured fresco vault anchors the opening with vivid sensory detail ("faded saints whose eyes seemed to follow"), and the henge site is grounded with gorse bushes and stone steps. The vault's atmosphere mirrors the chapel's acoustics in a purposeful echo. However, many descriptors are ornamental ("monolithic sentinel sketched with unnerving precision") and do not constrain Elias's choices; the chapel's "dome-vaulted sanctum" and "acoustics designed to amplify breaths" appear only after discovery, too late to shape tactics or complicate access.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sunken library setting is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (bloated books, kelp through portholes, anemone-furred encyclopedias). However, the environment does not constrain Elara's choices or shape her tactics; it remains backdrop. The snow globe's miraculous preservation strains plausibility without explanation. Spatial choreography is loose—Elara's dive sequence, surfacing, and re-descent lack coherent tracking.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.1)
    The misty courtyard above clouds, floating balustrades, and cloud-moss pigments establish a distinct fantastical setting. The flower press bolt plate (brass, Victorian, etched grids) receives tactile detail and hums faintly, grounding the magical moment. Spatial choreography is coherent; Elowen moves from tracing the mural to gathering pigments to pressing the plate. The setting supplies a resource (ochre cloud-moss) that Elowen uses, linking environment to action. However, the courtyard does not constrain her choices or force adaptation; it remains a backdrop rather than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.1)
    The icebound spire, glass elevator, and fractal-lens goggles anchor setting vividly, and the scattered light mechanism is purposeful. However, spatial choreography inside the elevator is minimal—no body or tool constrains Lira's choices. The setting pressures atmosphere more than action; the goggles enable discovery but do not force a tactical dilemma. Floor-by-floor markers track time but remain decorative rather than tightening options.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sky gondola, brass telescope, and atmospheric phenomena are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("dusty starlight," "nacreous clouds shimmered grief"). The gondola's untethered drift and the telescope's repeated handling constrain Elias's observational choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent (wicker frame, lanyard swing, overboard release). Minor reduction: the setting functions primarily as backdrop for interior reflection rather than imposing immediate physical constraint that alters a tactic in real time.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tree trunk library is vividly particularized: "bark-lined shelves," "warped shelves, etched with centuries," "shallow channels into the inner bark." The knothole through which dawn sky enters directly enables the mirror array's function, constraining her work to available light and the tree's geometry. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the crafting sequence. The recurring sensory anchor of "hush" and the demolition crew's encroaching sounds modulate pressure effectively. Minor slip: the "velvet nest" and "optical experiments, silver leaf from restoration kits" feel slightly convenient rather than earned through prior spatial seeding.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.1)
    The antique airship and aft deck provide spatial grounding; the hopscotch board's dusty grid and stranded luminance offer vivid sensory anchors. The phrasebook's dog-eared pages and the board's cryptic symbols supply texture filtered through Elara's professional lens. The starling murmurations function as atmospheric pressure and later as an obstacle the luminance repels, linking environment to the climax. Spatial choreography (deck, board, sails) remains clear throughout, and the glow constrains her final action by enabling the dome defense.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.1)
    The frozen library's ice-encased tomes, auroras through arched panes, and hall of mirrors with "polished silver panes stretching into vertigo-inducing infinity" are vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the descent, and the gears' grooves on the pedestal constrain Elias's final action ("Each gear fit the pedestal's grooves as if predestined"). Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: the "ozone" scent and "spectral motes" sharpen the climax, though a few details ("toppled lectern crusted with rime") lean decorative without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.8)
    The floating arches and bramble-fruited trees are vivid in the opening, but spatial choreography during the climax—hauling the bell "to the grandest arch"—remains vague (how far, who lifts what, where do they stand?). The orchard never constrains a choice; characters move freely without environmental friction. The butterfly garden and sidewalks are named but not used tactilely; no one navigates thorns or misjudges distance. The nebula of respite is atmospheric texture, not a physical constraint that shapes action.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.7)
    The hidden lighthouse, jagged cliffs, and crystal pane anchor the opening vividly, and the pane of hush functions as a micro-setting element that shapes the final act: Elias places the puppet head against it to transmit the lullaby. Dusk's bruised-purple palette and the "velvet void" modulate atmosphere across the piece. Spatial choreography is clear (spiral stairs, oak table, singular pane), though the setting does not constrain a middle choice—it serves primarily as stage and closure device.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, and cursed orchard are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail ("brass feathers clattered," "paths buckled like drunken veins"). The labyrinth's spatial choreography remains coherent across Elias's movements. The nuts and blueprint function as micro-setting elements that constrain his method. However, the setting does not meaningfully narrow his choices at closure—he completes the task as planned without environmental resistance reshaping tactics. The final frost image is atmospheric but decorative rather than a constraint that charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.1)
    The braided ravine supplies vivid micro-setting (pebbles, foam lattices, silt-buried chrysalis) that charges Elias's epiphany. Foam patterns constrain his insight by modeling transient unity, and the chrysalis anchors the final image. However, spatial choreography after the ravine becomes vague (lab, home, ravine again), and the deployed-polymer coda lacks concrete detail. The river's braided paths illuminate theme but do not alter a present choice during the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.1)
    The glass orchard library on a cloud sea is vividly rendered with crystalline boughs, floating shelves, and swirling clouds. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the descent. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the ritual occurs in Elias's nook and could proceed almost unchanged in a conventional library. The clouds and glass do not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome, limiting the setting's causal integration.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.1)
    The desert fortress, rain-slicked walls, and coral icebound pavilion are vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (metallic tang, translucent walls veined with frost, ice gleaming like captured moonlight). The pavilion's icebound coral constrains Elaris's task—he must analyze tidal pool formations, map currents, and heat samples—so the environment shapes his method and charges the closure moment when the pavilion thaws. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (courtyard, stairwell, pavilion floor), though the transition from kneeling by a courtyard puddle to "hours blurred as he shoveled" compresses the labor without grounding us in the physical toll. The micro-setting (tidal pools as neural-path analogs) functions thematically and practically, elevating the score, but the pavilion itself arrives late (past the first third) and its properties are introduced via summary rather than discovered tactilely across multiple beats.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    The astronomical clock tower supplies vivid anchors (brass binoculars, orrery dome, whirring escapements, cuckoo clock weight) and the grain elevators loom as "silent titans," but spatial choreography during the bridge-building montage is vague—ropes "snaked," cables "taut," spans "connected" without close tracking of distances, angles, or Elara's physical position. The cuckoo clock weight returns as "bridge talisman" at closure, charging the final image with purposeful recurrence. Micro-setting (the weight, the pulley rig) constrains the bridge mechanism, lifting the score toward the 7-band threshold, but the silos themselves remain postcard titans rather than lived-in spaces that pressure Elara's choices during the talks.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.1)
    The moonlit canyon supplies vivid sensory anchors and the periscope mirror recurs with shifting meaning, but neither constrains a choice that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent (ledge, crevice, canyon floor), yet the environment remains a stage for internal monologue rather than a pressure that narrows options. Micro-setting (the mirror) charges the ending image but does not force a trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.8)
    The serpentine grotto and gravitational inversion are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (mist coiling, pebbles lifting, walls undulating). However, the environment functions primarily as spectacle; spatial choreography is coherent, but the setting does not meaningfully constrain a choice or charge the final image—Elara's success is unimpeded by the grotto's features. Micro-setting (the central prism, the manuscript) is handled but does not alter tactics or impose cost.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.1)
    The siskin alder grove is vividly anchored with moss-draped trunks, root-tangle, and empty nests; the porcelain insulator's "creamy glaze cracked but iridescent" and the sculpture's stress cracks supply micro-setting that constrains Elowen's method. The grove's spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the final image (siskins alighting, hedgehog quivering) charges the ending. The setting does more than backdrop—it enables the sculpture's discovery and the insulator's fit—meeting the 9+ gate of constraining choice and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.1)
    Nexus details are vivid and purposeful: obsidian monoliths with glowing runes, compasses spinning wild, air thick with magnetic hum. The worry stone functions as micro-setting, handled across beats (thumb tracing dent, warmth pulsing, final pocket) and its dent guides a choice (king alignment). Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling at center, board on ground, stone at heart of squares). However, the magnetic mechanics remain atmospheric rather than constraining—no moment where leyline pull or compass spin alters Elias's physical options or tactics under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.1)
    The workshop setting is vividly rendered with sensory detail ("glow-worm bulbs," "pine and distant gunpowder") but remains postcard description that does not constrain choice or supply resources affecting outcome. The tuner device is described at length yet its physical operation (dials, strings, oscillators) never creates spatial friction or tactical problem. Micro-setting opportunity exists (the clasp, the workbench) but these objects do not pressure Elias's moves; they are stages for his monologue rather than active constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.2)
    The treetop village and tidal rhythms provide vivid anchoring ("platforms heaving like breath," "hammock-homes suspended like wildflower pods"). Sensory detail leans heavily visual and olfactory, appropriate to the POV. The corpse flower's bloom constrains Elara's choice to endure, satisfying the 9+ gate minimally; however, the setting remains largely backdrop rather than shaping tactics at key turns.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.1)
    Floating rock arches, inverted rivers, and hyper-vital moss create vivid, purpose-driven details. The upward-cascading water directly constrains navigation ("surfing the aqueous rush"), and the cavern's translucent roots shape the discovery beat. The final image—artifact planted in withered soil, echoes stirring—charges closure by using the home grove setting to register change. Spatial choreography (glider → arch throat → cavern → descent back through collapsing flows) remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.1)
    The container labyrinth is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (rusted reds, faded blues, wind whispers) that coheres across the piece. Spatial choreography remains clear as Elias moves deeper, climbs stacks, and reaches the crater. The anemometers and survey tools ground the investigative action in concrete equipment. The hazy atmosphere modulates appropriately, tightening at the crater. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop; while visually strong, it does not constrain a pivotal choice or charge the final image in a way that would lift the score into high bands.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    The ice cavern is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (crystalline walls, auroral light, frost pedestal) and modulates with the action (hush "parting like mist," walls "blushing with refracted glows"). The setting charges the final image by embodying the debate between hush and song. However, it does not constrain a tactical choice—Elyra's bell-ringing succeeds without environmental resistance or spatial complication. The micro-setting (amber sheet held aloft to catch auroral rays) briefly shapes method but does not force a trade-off or alter options.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Thunder-echo Range is vividly named and the "canyon hush" / "avalanchingly quiet" motif recurs with purposeful texture. Spatial anchors—dry riverbed, natural amphitheater, ancient runes—ground action and the setting's thinness of veil directly enables the weave. Sensory specificity is selective ("orange across the stone walls," "boots crunched softly") and filtered through urgency. However, the amphitheater's runes and ley lines are mentioned but not felt as constraints; the setting stages rather than pressures the final choice, keeping it shy of the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.4)
    The topaz workshop, star-vanishing sky, and letterpress are vividly rendered with consistent sensory detail ("hummed like a trapped hornet," "turbulent refractions"). The halo fragment constrains the transpose action and charges the climax, satisfying the micro-setting test. However, spatial choreography during the transpose feedback loop is unclear—where Elias and Mira stand, how they handle the fragment and press simultaneously—and the workshop's physical layout does not evolve or resist tactics. The final star's flicker is a strong atmospheric reprise but does not demonstrably alter the protagonist's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.1)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway is vivid and recurs across beats, shaping spatial choreography (the fork, the pause, Lira's descent). Sensory detail is selective—"greens and purples," "rock into ethereal crystal"—and filtered through Kael's wonder-seeking lens. The pendant's interaction with aurora light charges the exchange with Lira, and the ridgeway's mist/wind/stone anchor memory of Thorne, satisfying the 9+ test for environment constraining choice and charging the final image. Micro-setting (pendant, puddle reflection) functions purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    The quartz arbor is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (mist curling through translucent arches, quartz humming, frost patterns as neural maps) and returns across beats to frame discovery. The car window and frost constrain the method of proof, and the prism refracts meaning literally and figuratively. Minor choreography issues (prism "warm in his pocket" after being "held to the frosted pane" suggests unclear sequencing), but the setting charges the final image when "new frost on the window, patterns of his triumph—gold flecks dancing under prism light" closes the loop with cost implied through changed relationship to the arbor.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.1)
    The orchard and bamboo forest are introduced with vivid sensory detail ("emerald stalks clattered," "rotted sweetly"), but spatial choreography is vague—where the loom sits relative to the crate, how far the orchard extends. The puzzle edges and amber bead anchor micro-setting, yet neither constrains a choice; Elara simply strings the edges and embeds the bead without friction. The final image (bead half-buried) attempts to charge closure but lacks prior spatial setup that would make its position meaningful. Orientation debt from Q2 caps this category at 7.0 per the Orientation Test consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.1)
    The orchard planet, levitating arches, and mine shafts are vivid and purposeful, anchoring world-rules (crystals enable flight, destabilization causes rubble). Spatial choreography inside the shaft—echoes, mineral tears, acoustics amplifying silk magic—constrains Elar's method and charges the awakening sequence. The azure-veined stones and forge sparks recur with thematic weight, and the final arch-lift offers a concrete environmental payoff. Scope fits the length; no occupational exposition bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.2)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay anchors atmosphere (rusted hulks, dust motes, emergency lights) and the green shard is handled across beats. Spatial choreography remains legible. However, the bay functions primarily as backdrop; it does not pressure Elara's choices or supply resources that alter outcome—she could weave from any liminal space. The "micro-setting" exception nearly applies (shard as tool), but the shard's mechanics are summarized rather than constraining tactics, capping the score below 7.0 per the gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lantern room is vividly rendered—fog through cracked panes, iron grating, Fresnel lens, spectral moans—and the stone towers on the sill function as micro-setting that anchors the discovery and final action. Spatial choreography (skiff → stairs → lantern room) tracks clearly. However, the haunted atmosphere remains decorative; the "drowned souls" and "grasping fingers" threaten mood but do not constrain Elias's choices or alter his tactics. The sea glass and stacks charge the final image, lifting the score into the mid-6s, but the environment itself does not meet the Q3 9+ gate (constrain choice or charge closure).

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Emerald Lighthouse is anchored with vivid detail (verdant stone, spiral stairs, glass lantern wick as primordial silica), and the setting supplies the central tool (the wick's total internal reflection) that enables the climax. Sensory selection (stars, waves, the hum of the wick) supports tone. However, spatial choreography remains static—Elias ascends once and stays at the lantern—so the environment does not meaningfully constrain movement or force tactical adaptation. The offshore storm and shadow-tendrils are described but do not pressure Elias's choices; they respond to his will without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating rock tea house, valley-mist, sun trails, and blue morpho wing are vivid and purposeful. The wing constrains Elowen's activity (she must position and rotate it to catch the light) and the sun's path structures the scene's temporal progression, grounding action in environment. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her dye-master's eye ("hue shifts," "iridescent," "scales"), though some phrasing ("valley-mist wonder," "whispering winds") trends ornamental. The setting charges the final image by sustaining the atmosphere through closure, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment constraining choice and charging the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.0)
    Capped at 7.0 per the Orientation Test penalty applied in Q2. The tower's labyrinthine corridors, arrow-slit windows, moonlit stone, and storm are vividly rendered and contribute atmosphere; the moon-healed stone is a purposeful constraint that enables Elias's ritual. Sensory detail is dense and mostly filtered through the setting's symbolic weight (moonlight, storm flashes), though spatial choreography of the workbench, corridors, and sextant parts remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.1)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly sketched—crystalline panes, glowing sap, Heart Tree with elixir veins—and the mica window recurs with shifting function (glimpsing true dawns, then clearing at closure). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's focus. However, spatial choreography remains vague (spectral figures "at the edges," no blocking of Elara's kneeling relative to the window or tree), and the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it is backdrop rather than pressure. The mica window charges the final image, elevating the score into the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.1)
    The library's dual nature is established early and the restricted mezzanine provides spatial staging for the climax. However, the "hidden archive pulsing with ethereal light" and brass lanterns remain postcard description without constraining a choice or altering tactics. The crumpled invitation's physical properties (frayed edges, shimmering ink) are ornamental and do not pressure the decision to enter.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.7)
    The overgrown courtyard and tea house constrain Elias's choices (sowing seeds, coaxing vines) and charge the final image of shared gardening. Spatial choreography is clear (gates, pavilion, scarred table) and frost etches a tonal anchor. However, the palace itself remains a postcard backdrop—its decay is described but does not complicate access, supply a resource under pressure, or force a tactical tradeoff in the peak beat. The body and bread as micro-setting qualify, but the courtyard does not escalate conflict beyond atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.4)
    The frozen library setting is vivid ("frost veiled forgotten tomes," "clouds swirling far below") and the quartz/ice motifs recur. The lantern device and crystalline gauge are present but function as props for narrated procedure rather than constraining a tactical choice. The library's groaning and drift toward oblivion create atmospheric pressure but do not force Elias to alter his method or accept a spatial limitation. Sensory detail is selective and evocative, yet the setting remains backdrop rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.4)
    The rotting pier, swaying lanterns, and dripping timbers anchor the pirate market vividly in the opening, and the setting provides social constraint (the truce, the need to scatter by sunrise). Sensory detail is atmospheric but leans generic ("salt, fish guts, tang of illicit brews") rather than character-filtered or action-integrated. The fob and wax cylinder function as micro-objects that charge the final image, but the pier itself doesn't constrain a middle choice—Lila could attempt her sabotage in any crowded illegal venue. Spatial choreography (stalls, piling, dice game) is coherent, and the sunrise deadline is tracked, yet the setting feels more like backdrop than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=5.1)
    Lavender Bluff is anchored vividly with bioluminescent blooms, aurora, and forest election lights. Sensory detail is dense and selective—ozone taste, petrichor, salt-storm herald—and the synesthetic palette is integrated into Elara's POV. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains postcard atmosphere that frames action rather than pressuring it. The tin compass ring spins and points but does not limit options or shape the encounter's outcome, and the convergence mechanics are asserted rather than demonstrated through spatial consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.1)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vividly rendered with "veins of quartz and amethyst" and "auroral glow," and the alcove and mica slab function as micro-setting elements that constrain Elias's approach. The spare tumbler assembly hidden in the wall ties setting to the resolution. The cave's "sorrowful northern lights" charge the final image, though the atmospheric description occasionally stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Greenhouse panes, toxic sky, weeping vines, and zinc fragments constrain Elara's path and charge the final image. The map's "Vault of Echoed Candor" label guides descent, and iridescent leaves in the vault enable mentor-voice replay—micro-setting as plot enabler. Sensory detail (hissing vapor lamp, fogged panes, verdigris glow) filters through Elara's calligrapher eye with purposeful selectivity. Spatial choreography remains coherent across atelier, bazaars, underlevels, and vault.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    The whispering bluff above the clouds is vividly anchored early and the wind recurs as a kinetic force. The iceberg fragment's "veined blue fire" and "glistening" facets provide textural specificity. However, spatial choreography during the pilgrimage and the sculpture's assembly remains vague; the environment does not constrain a single on-page choice. The body and tools (bells, wires) appear but are not leveraged under pressure to alter tactics or charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.7)
    The glass dome, roses with vein-like pulses, and the utility shed are anchored early and constrain Zeta's moves (the dome stabilizers whine, vines lash irrigation lines). The "strangely organic" roses contribute to atmosphere and pressure when they convulse under electromagnetic waves. However, sensory selection remains visual-heavy without the tactile or auditory specificity that would charge the final image; the incinerator pit appears late and functions as a solution rather than a recurring spatial constraint. The dome's fragility shapes stakes but does not visibly alter the final beat beyond ambient description.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.1)
    The courtyard is vividly rendered ("dew-kissed jasmine," "roses unfurling in pinks and golds," "fountain's trickle") and anchors the single-scene action. The locket's "subtle click" and the hidden dial "beneath moss" supply tactile detail. However, the vibrant setting does not constrain Elena's choices—she moves freely from fountain to oak without spatial friction—and the "outside world intrudes" (horns, helicopters) remains auditory decoration rather than a spatial barrier that alters her tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.4)
    The sunken laboratory is described with atmospheric detail (phosphorescent algae, silt, rusted bulkheads) but functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint. Spatial choreography is coherent and the underwater environment adds texture, yet no environmental feature materially narrows Elara's tactical options or charges the final image—she moves through the space freely. The setting meets mid-band functionality but does not elevate to necessity. (Q3 cap at 7.0 applied per Orientation Test penalty in Q2.)

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.1)
    The salt crystal chamber is vividly rendered ("towering salt crystals that pulsed faintly," "light refracted into endless rainbows") and the whale's beached body anchors the opening image. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the transition from chamber to whale's underbelly and back lacks concrete distance or obstacle detail. The chamber constrains Elias by housing the strongest gravity pockets, but no micro-setting element (tool, body, recurring object) directly alters a choice or charges the final image beyond postcard-level atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.1)
    The nocturnal haven and brook are described vividly ("moonlight wove silver threads," "velvet glide") and recur throughout, but remain postcard scenery. The setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; the brook's response is ornamental, not causal. Spatial choreography is clear, sensory detail is purposeful, and the micro-setting (mossy stone, damp earth) is present. The setting does not reach the 9+ gate because it does not constrain a choice or charge the final image with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Victorian's groans, Harlan's cluttered parlor, and the rooftop garden are vivid and purposeful. The meteor shower backdrop and night-blooming jasmine create atmospheric pressure for the confession. However, the antique seal and the buildings' "murmurs" remain largely decorative; the seal's inscriptions are described but never constrain a choice on the page. Spatial choreography is clean (door, parlor, rooftop) and sensory detail is selective, but the setting does not materially shape Elara's interrogation or Harlan's capitulation.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.1)
    The velvet garden is vividly rendered with purposeful diction ("petals unfurled like shadowed cloaks," "midnight moss"), and the fountain functions as a ritual anchor. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop. The seashell and garden do not pressure Elara's movements or narrow her options, keeping the setting below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.1)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, and stalactites are vividly rendered and establish a coherent atmosphere. However, setting remains postcard-descriptive; the cavern does not constrain Elias's choices or supply a resource that alters his tactics. The heritage rose thorn is handled as a tool, but the sanctuary itself functions as backdrop rather than pressure. Spatial choreography is minimal (kneeling, inscribing on the floor) and does not shift options or charge the closure image beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.6)
    The "serpentine nexus under starlight" is poetic but never grounds spatial choreography—bodies, distances, and exits remain vague throughout. Sensory detail (reed-blown winds, iridescent veins) decorates without constraining choice. The seashell's physical handling is minimal; it "whispers" on cue but never becomes a tactical object. No environmental feature narrows Elyra's options or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glacier-ice shrine with candle flames and silver refraction is vivid and purposeful. The melted snow globe's viscous pool serves as the ritual's focal object, constraining Elara's method (she peers into it, places it at the altar). Spatial choreography is clear: shrine, altar, globe at heart, ice walls. The shrine's cold and candle-light charge the tone and frame the ritual, meeting the micro-setting test by shaping the final image ("candle drips," "borrowed starlight's gentle fade").

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.7)
    Setting details (parapet, mossy balustrade, lagoon, moon paths) are vivid and purposeful. The bamboo whisk functions as a micro-setting tool in two beats (tea-whisking, net-teasing), constraining one choice. Sensory selection is rich but occasionally drifts toward catalog ("glistening mist," "humid air," "rain-scented"). Spatial choreography is clean across the descent and return. The moon path guides movement but does not impose a hard constraint or charge the final image with irreversible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    The orchard's circular boundary and the homestead debris constrain Elias's search, and the flawed diamond's pulsing blue glow charges the final act. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (fogged mask, rad-suit readings, apple skin under light). Spatial choreography remains clear across dune, threshold, homestead, and floorboard. Minor slip: "dust bunnies" amid post-liquidation rubble reads as anachronistic filler rather than world-specific debris.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.1)
    The stormlit observatory and cobalt glass portico anchor setting vividly and recur across beats, charging the final image when "cobalt portico gleam[s] like a promise kept." Storm details (lightning, thunder, clouds) modulate with pressure, narrowing Elias's focus during radio work and expanding during followers' arrival. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the observatory's isolation pressures Elias's choices. However, the portico functions more as symbolic recurrence than a constraint that alters tactics; its presence enriches atmosphere but does not directly foreclose options or enable a turn.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.2)
    The feral loft beneath dunes is vivid and anchored early with selective sensory detail (salt-crusted shutters, marram grass, splintered crate). The music box and jars function as micro-setting objects that charge the protagonist's work, and the coastal fringe provides spatial coherence. However, the loft itself does not constrain a pivotal choice—Elias moves freely in and out, and the environment supplies resources (shipwrecked jars, beeswax) without friction. For 9+ the setting must pressure a decision or charge the final image; here it remains atmospheric backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.8)
    The drift-ice marina and lighthouse are vividly rendered with sensory detail (groaning floes, salt-crusted windows, prismatic halos). Spatial choreography is clear across moves. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a tactical resource that alters the outcome; the console and resonator appear when needed without prior spatial grounding. The golden sunset functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a tightening clock. Micro-setting (body, tool) is present but ornamental; the key's "fleshly click" and the resonator's hum are textural rather than choice-shaping.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.1)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly rendered with purposeful detail (rain-slicked coils, whale-oil lamps, ice firm enough to cross). Spatial choreography across the lake and up the pylon remains clear. The moon's alignment and the viaduct's post-rain vulnerability function as environmental constraints that enable Elara's timing, charging the final sequence. The setting presses tactics and supplies the closure image, meeting the 9+ quick test in function if not in full irreplaceability.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.1)
    The subway maintenance tunnel is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail: slick algae on ladder rungs, loose grate, sodden yellow tape, graffiti overlaying century-old chisel marks. Sensory hierarchy is strong—emergency lights, water dripping, train rumble—and the setting constrains choice (Elara must steady herself against a beam during the quake). The lantern as micro-setting object charges the final image when she emerges swinging it. However, occupational verisimilitude stumbles: a transit-authority death investigator working alone in a flooded tunnel without safety backup or communication protocol reads implausible, and the underground-railroad artifact's exact placement (glinting under silt at the fatal position) strains credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    The repair shop is vividly rendered (dust motes, dangling keys, mullioned windows) and the clockwork heart constrains Harrow's work, directly shaping the pivotal repair beat. The storm exterior mirrors interior pressure and the final light-break charges the closure moment. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The workbench and tools function as micro-setting that enables the turn, meeting the 9+ gate requirement and lifting the score solidly into the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.1)
    The acid sea and brass workshop supply vivid texture—"corrosive waves," "whirring differentials," "gears gossiping steam"—but remain postcard description. The kaleidoscope appears twice (transliteration, turret observation) yet its mechanics never constrain a tactical choice or alter Elara's options. The workshop's lifting at the end is unmotivated by prior spatial rules, and the sea's threat never forces a decision about altitude, corrosion, or resource limits.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Social Nexus Archive as digital mausoleum is evocative, and the cubicle's "sterile hum" grounds early beats. The mission patch's "gold-threaded rocket insignia" and "high-res scan" add tactile specificity. The archive's "underlayers" and "corporate purgatory" constrain Elara's access, shaping the lie beat, but the final image does not charge the setting element—logged-out screen and "night" are generic. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lighthouse orchard and vintage store offer vivid atmospheric details (gnarled trees, fogged mirrors, aged brass scent), but spatial choreography is unclear—how Thorne moves from orchard to store base, where the table sits relative to the mirrors, and how the ice floes "below" relate to the orchard "above" remain abstract. The mirrors function as thematic devices (glimpses of hidden truths) but do not constrain a tactical choice; they deliver exposition (wraith's loneliness, dryad's terror) rather than forcing Thorne to navigate the room or manipulate objects under pressure. The orchard's frost-kissed fruit at the end is postcard description, not a resource or constraint that altered outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.1)
    The drift-ice marina is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail: "ships locked in floes that clinked like fragile chimes," "ice-rimed docks," "pressure ridges," "aurora veils." The parasol tip appears in multiple beats (grounding her, then snapping free), and its brass finial and frayed lace threads concretely anchor her internal state. The setting pressures choices—thin ice, treacherous bays, the trawl net—and the final image places her at the dock's end with the "ice symphony" as lullaby, charging the closure with environmental texture. Spatial choreography is clear throughout: tent → marina → skiff → dock's end.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    The amber pavilion, skeletal vines, lantern glow, and mulled wine anchor the scene with sensory detail filtered through Elena's urgency. The burned letter fragment functions as a micro-object that constrains the conversation and charges the final exchange. Spatial choreography is clean (threshold, bench, Theo's vest pocket). The setting pressures Elena's choice by offering refuge and a parallel story, lifting the score above mere postcard description, though the autumn imagery ("swirling amber leaves," "honeyed light") leans decorative in the opening and middle without fresh specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.2)
    Capped at 7.0 per Orientation Test. "Whisperfield calm," "murmuring pavilion," and "kinetic parapet" are evocative labels but remain abstract; no concrete sensory anchors (temperature, scale, light source, proximity) ground the reader. The parapet's "golden veins and tremors" appear late and are observed, not used. Dunes and drapes recur as mood markers without constraining movement or choice. Micro-setting allowance not met: no tool, body constraint, or object alters a tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lavender field and rusted factory are anchored early with vivid sensory detail ("purple blooms," "skeletal iron beams," "vines climbing"). However, the setting remains ornamental; no on-page choice hinges on proximity, access, or environmental constraint. The vines' repeated climbing functions as atmospheric decoration rather than a resource or obstacle that alters Elara's tactics or the townspeople's participation. The micro-setting (map case, salvaged crate) is described but not used to pressure a decision.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.1)
    The library at dawn is vividly rendered (dust-moted aisles, vaulted chamber, pallid rays) and the crystal's physical presence (cool facets, heavier than memory) is tactile. The setting does not meaningfully constrain Elowen's choices—she moves freely, the crystal is available, the lectern awaits. The chandelier shard functions more as symbolic object than spatial pressure. No environmental friction shapes the testimony act itself.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    The fog sculpture garden is vividly rendered with selective, POV-filtered detail (VCR giant with tape spools for eyes, cassette shells spilling like petals). Driftwood markers and chalk runes function as micro-setting elements that guide Elias's navigation and anchor the ritual. The "colossal sculpture of warped vinyl and bone-like spars" at the center directly enables the climax by producing the sound he seeks, passing the constraint test for the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lunar setting supplies concrete constraints: micrometeorite-scarred lenses, regolith, hydroponic trays, vacuum proximity. The bonsai leaf and its fall provide the micro-setting object that charges the final solution. Sensory details (humming chronometers, papery sigh, dust sifting) are vivid and selective, filtered through Elias's craft focus. However, spatial choreography during the quake (viewport buckling, panels groaning, foundations shaking) remains somewhat generic rather than precisely tracking Elias's movement and choices in relation to equipment and danger, and the setting's role in constraining his repair choices is functional but not deeply integrated into escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.1)
    The mountain aerie—glass walls, thin air, clouds below—is vividly established and frames the "radiant haven" tone throughout. Specific sensory details (wildflower vial, "crisp, alive perfume," "rainbows danced on its edges") are purposeful and filtered through the hospice setting. However, the environment remains backdrop; no spatial constraint shapes a choice (Lena's arrival is unhindered, the vinyl shard is simply held, not sought or obstructed). The body and recurring object (vinyl) do not constrain tactics, only anchor memory. The setting's elevation and light charge the atmosphere but do not alter the outcome, capping the score in the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.4)
    The observatory, floating isle, and pedestal are anchored early and supply concrete resources (star-ink, rune-lock, brass telescopes). The nocturnal setting and crystal spires create coherent atmosphere. Spatial choreography is clear across beats. The pedestal and key constrain one choice (aligning the key), lifting the score into the mid-6s, but the environment does not pressure the climax or charge the final image beyond serving as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=5.1)
    The hedge maze and secret garden are vividly described with sensory detail (honeysuckle, dew, marble benches). However, they function as backdrop rather than constraint: Elara navigates without friction, the maze never blocks her, and the garden does not alter her choices. The tooth is unearthed without spatial challenge. Spatial choreography is clear, but the micro-setting does not pressure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.4)
    The serpentine grotto is vividly rendered with sensory detail (mist, salt-kissed sea glass, damp stone) and recurs across beats. The setting constrains Elara's method (abrasive sands from the grotto floor, seawater as wheel) and charges the final image (grotto pulsing with shared wonder). Spatial choreography is clear, and the mist functions as atmosphere. However, the grotto does not pressure a pivotal choice—it enables rather than opposes—and the ending's "grotto's edge" is more symbolic backdrop than active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.4)
    The moss garden setting is vivid and consistently rendered (rusted racks, cracked skylights, ferns on mainframes), and the amber pendant functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final exchange. The drip pattern and icicles provide spatial texture, though they serve plot convenience more than constraining choice. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's contemplative stance. The setting does not visibly narrow or open tactical options during the confrontation; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure, capping the score below the 7.0 threshold despite strong descriptive work.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.8)
    The feral nexus and swirling mist anchor spatial orientation and recur throughout, and the seashell fragment constrains his ritual actions across multiple beats. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric postcard; fog and ancient oaks do not force tactical choices or supply resources that alter outcome. The micro-setting (body, seashell) achieves some constraint but does not charge the final image decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.1)
    The verdant arbor at dawn is vividly rendered with twisting branches, woven platform, and heartwood; the harvest moon's amber glow defies the sun and charges the alignment. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop. The platform's height, the vine's origin in the heartwood, and the arbor's roots are described but do not constrain Elowen's choices or complicate her remedy. The golden stories "float down" to the villagers without spatial friction or environmental resistance, reducing the arbor to scenic rather than functional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.1)
    The withered orchard, frozen air, and auroras create a vivid sensory frame filtered through Lir's alchemical focus. The storybook plate, discarded materials (bones, wire, tin), and flash paper are handled concretely and constrain his method. The setting directly enables the closure: without the orchard's detritus and the frozen stillness, the map cannot be made. Spatial choreography (kneeling, arranging patterns across the crater floor, climbing toward dawn) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.1)
    The marble cavern is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (quartz veins, phosphorescent fungi, polished walls amplifying sound) and its acoustic properties shape Elias's method across multiple beats. The setting enables the reverse-engineering through reflection angles and echo behavior, constraining his approach. However, the cavern does not force a decisive trade-off or charge the final image with new constraint; it remains a stage rather than an active pressure on the closure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    The bronze grotto, starlight, and kerosene burner anchor the single scene and constrain the weave ritual through proximity and light mechanics. Sensory detail is vivid but often ornamental—"shingled hush," "meltwater pooling"—without altering Elara's tactical options. The burner's orientation does charge the climax, lifting the score above mid-band, though the spatial choreography of "essence toward the altar" while "smeared across patterns" remains unclear.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The loft is vividly rendered (rust-hued skylight, rain pattering, scarred oak table, faded big cat posters) and the ash wood blank materially constrains her action—she must shape it while the kettle boils, using Theo's tools. The rain and amber light recur purposefully, charging the final closure image with atmospheric coherence. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (wood dust "sifting like fine sand," steam "threading upward"). The micro-setting (table, tools, blank) anchors every beat and the kettle functions as a ticking clock, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint and closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=5.4)
    The kinetic lagoon and carousel are vividly sketched ("viscous waters," "brass-rimmed platforms"), but they function primarily as backdrop rather than constraining choice. The disposable camera wheel is handled multiple times and its plastic texture is noted, yet it never limits Elias's options or alters his tactics—it simply collects stories. The final image ("wheel discarded at last, spun lazily on a lily pad") charges the ending modestly, lifting the score into mid-band, but the environment itself does not pressure the negotiation or descent.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    The abandoned terminal is vividly rendered through cracked ferrocrete, dormant panels, and rusted pipes. Elara's engineering POV filters sensory detail purposefully: she notices "stress fractures that whispered of unmet promises" and conduits "snaking like veins." The sextant's use to align with Polaris through a cracked dome integrates environment into action. Spatial choreography across sublevel generators and access tunnels remains coherent, though some descriptor choices ("stoic wonder at the stars") tilt abstract rather than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "soundless sanctuary," "crystal whispering forecourt," and rain-slick mosaic ground the piece in vivid, selective sensory detail filtered through Elias's introverted attention. The music box and crystals are handled tactilely across beats, and the forecourt's acoustic properties constrain his experience and enable the melody's return. The setting charges the final image (petrichor "wove into his every breath forevermore"), narrowly meeting the 9+ quick test's requirement that environment or object charge closure, but the sanctuary itself remains more backdrop than active constraint on choice, capping the score just below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.1)
    The twilight barge canal supplies atmospheric description ("mist clung," "velvet indigo," "overhung willows") but does not constrain a single choice or tactic on the page. The mudflats, wreckage, and eddying currents are narrated passively; Elias gauges and probes without friction from the environment. The sundial's shadow and the wreck's inscription function as plot tokens rather than environment-driven pressures. Spatial choreography remains vague—barge position, pole mechanics, water depth are asserted generically, never grounding the reader in lived-in particulars that alter action.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.1)
    The golden dock under snow and fog is rendered vividly with sensory specificity ("planks...glowing faintly under snow's mantle," "fog beading his whiskers"). The fulgurite glass functions as a micro-setting element that enables the decoding action. However, the environment remains largely atmospheric backdrop; the dock's physical properties do not constrain Elias's choices or complicate his task in a way that charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.2)
    The garden setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (damp soil, fading jasmine, crimson leaves). However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image in a way that alters outcome. The thread functions more as a symbolic talisman than a tool that shapes tactics. Spatial choreography remains clear, and the autumn tone is consistent, but the setting does not meet the 9+ gate requiring environment or object to constrain choice or charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.8)
    The suspended palace and bioluminescent fungi anchor space vividly, and the mechanical world below supplies consistent sensory texture. The egg's opalescent shell and the chick's patchy feathers are specific, but neither the palace nor the cradle constrains Elarion's assembly choice; the setting frames rather than pressures the action. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the stalactites' groan at closure charges the final image, lifting the score within the mid-band despite the orientation delay cap at 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.1)
    The obsidian lagoon, kelp, volcanic black sand, and dune scars anchor the setting vividly and filter through Lira's firefighter attention ("subtlest shift in wind or warmth"). The black sand and rootstock are handled on the page, and the lagoon's "kelp-drift peace" charges the final image. However, no environmental feature constrains a choice or alters her tactics during the graft—she moves through the procedure without spatial or material friction. The setting functions as backdrop and thematic mirror rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.4)
    The city of forgotten fountains is vividly rendered with "marble basins cracked under veils of moss," "cobblestone streets," and "mosaic of faded tiles depicting celestial voyages." These details create atmosphere and guide Elara's path through the network of fountains. However, the environment does not meaningfully constrain her choices—she follows breadcrumbs without spatial friction or resource limits. The fountains charge the final image (waters reborn) but do not impose tactical costs during the journey, keeping the setting functional rather than indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.7)
    The nebula garden is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (ionized gas, bioluminescent veins, petal-throne) and the gear functions as a micro-setting object that shapes the final choice. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout transit and at the core. However, the setting operates more as backdrop than constraint; the garden's beauty and danger are declared ("troubling serenity," "tranquil peril") rather than testing Elowen's tactics in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.1)
    The greenhouse is vividly rendered with fractured glass, overgrown arches, humid air, and specific micro-settings (central fountain, shadowed alcove) that anchor the family history and retracing action. The butterfly migration functions as both atmosphere and temporal pressure, with "thundering calm" and "iridescent river" creating a charged sensory environment. The ribbon and greenhouse together constrain Elias's movement across the weeks, and the storm midway through sustains internal calm against external chaos, supporting the thematic work. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.4)
    The tidal obsidian ridge is rendered with vivid, purpose-driven detail—waves "shattering into froth," "jagged spine," slick black stone—that grounds the ascent and reflects Elias's internal state. The tower's dim chamber and the pendulum's hypnotic arc provide tactile atmosphere. However, the setting does not constrain a key choice or charge the closure image beyond serving as backdrop; the climactic visions occur in mental space, and the ridge's shift from "foe" to "ally" is declared rather than demonstrated through environmental interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.1)
    The cobalt silo and cemetery setting anchor who/where/when early and supply atmospheric detail ("velveteen gloom," "dust-moted starlight"). However, the environment remains decorative: the silo's shelves, cracks, and tools do not constrain Elias's decoding action or alter his choices. The chess clock and tapestry border function as props without spatial pressure. Micro-setting (the body, the border itself) charges the final image weakly—Elias "tenderly refold[s]" the border, but this gesture does not crystallize a cost or reconfigure meaning under situational or accumulative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.4)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vividly rendered with sensory detail (volcanic glass, auroras, groaning ice). The spire's interior—oaken desk, chalk-covered walls, arrow-slits—provides spatial grounding, and the astrolabe-lantern and kingfisher quill anchor the setting with purpose. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; Elias's work proceeds unimpeded by spatial or material limits. The enforcer horns create atmospheric pressure but do not alter his tactics or the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ember alcove, mist, and radio dial glow create atmosphere, but remain largely postcard descriptions without constraining Elara's choices. The dust swirling in response to the broadcast is vivid yet ornamental—it illustrates theme rather than forcing tactical shifts. Spatial choreography (alcove, desk, radio) is coherent but generic; no tool or micro-setting element charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    The gallery's vanishing points, tapered walls, and dim glow anchor the mirage-of-safety concept in spatial terms. The rocking chair is handled across multiple beats (its creak, faltering rhythm, final stop) and constrains the timing of the ritual. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "scent of scorched paper mingling with aged wood polish," "motes spiraling into the vanishing point." The environment charges the final scatter action, making it indispensable to the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    The sunken city, sewer conduit, and sedimentary layers supply vivid, purpose-driven detail (bioluminescent fungi, slime-slick walls, three strata of excavation). The cog's brass tooth and the chronometer frame function as micro-setting that constrains the excavation sequence and charges the final image. Spatial choreography within the sewer is coherent. Orientation debt (applied in Q2) caps this category at 7.0 per the Orientation Test, preventing higher scoring despite strong atmosphere and the 9+ quick test being nearly satisfied (the cog and layers do constrain his choices and appear in the closure).

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.1)
    The velvet library and autumn setting are vividly rendered with selective detail (rain-streaked panes, plush shadows, crimson dusk). The zither and its rosette constrain the teaching method and appear in multiple beats. However, the environment does not pressure a choice at closure; the final image ("The velvet library sighed in contentment") is decorative rather than a constraint that shapes the ending. Spatial choreography (choir encircling Elara) is coherent but the room remains static across the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.0)
    The greenhouse is anchored early with vivid detail (corroded panes, twisted vines, shattered frames) and recurs functionally: Elias must prune overgrowth to plant, the celestial light converges on the seed spot, and by dawn the shoot emerges. Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling, digging, covering), and the rusted shears are a micro-tool that enables the action. The alignment's hum and iridescent leaves charge the final image. The environment constrains the central action (must clear space) and supplies the mystical resource (cosmic resonance), meeting the 9+ gate narrowly.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lightning collection tower, drone beehive core, and nectar dusk imagery create a vivid, specific world. Spatial choreography is clear (booth, line, spiral stairs, tower apex), and the "lacquer box...black sheen mirroring the dying light" and matchbox function as micro-setting objects that constrain Elias's tactic. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through urgency (sweat, grease-streaked overalls, amber light on Mira's face). The tower's hexagonal core and bio-engineered drones are integrated into the conflict, and the setting charges the final image of wonder restored.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    The bay, spring cherry blossoms, and streetlights daydreaming establish a lyric atmosphere, and the orris-root shard functions as a tactile anchor. However, the setting does not constrain Elias's choices—objects appear conveniently, the cottage ritual proceeds without spatial friction, and the bungalow garden yields the locket without obstacle. Sensory detail is vivid but ornamental, not purposefully integrated into pressure or the final image, capping the score below 7.0 despite strong textural work.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    The underwater garden setting is vivid and consistently anchored: bioluminescent anemones, coral-crusted arches, kelp without current, bubble-veils from fountains. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered through Elara's discovery state. The foxglove-stained ampoule and Thalor's moss-webbed hand offer tactile specificity. The garden's "animate lifeless" paradox charges the final image when kelp waves and anemones brighten in approval, meaningfully linking environment to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.1)
    The infinite staircase is vividly established and returns at closure (steps blur into "golden mean helix," stairs "reform seamlessly"). The chipped die functions as a micro-setting element, handled across multiple beats and charged with meaning (the chip from a prior fall). Sensory selection is purposeful during the proof-sketching beat ("air humming with symbols"). However, the setting does not constrain a pivotal choice—Elias's actions (sketching, rolling dice, hurling them) occur within the staircase but are not altered by its spatial properties, keeping the score in mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rooftop greenhouse supplies ferns, orchids, and smog-fogged panes that frame Elias's world and constrain his art to plant-derived inks. The moon-tipped brush drinks light and ignites daydreams, a tactile object that charges the climax. Saffron ink, rice paper, and the greenhouse as womb anchor the final image. The smog-choked city below provides contrast and the tenement windows become responsive setting elements. Spatial choreography is clear (panes facing the city, sprawling glyphs, Elias curled among pots).

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.1)
    The grotto city behind Veilfall is vividly rendered with bioluminescent fungi, ice fissures, and rosewater-perfumed air, and the waterfall's ice shattering drives the evacuation choice. Spatial choreography remains clear across the museum halls, hearth, and secret vents. The lens (emerald-tinted opera glass) is handled twice and the bread-baking anchors tactile detail, together charging the final third, though the opera house destination arrives late without prior spatial grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lighthouse, hunger stone, and low tide are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail. The hunger stone constrains Elias's choice to descend and powers the reversal mechanism, meeting the 9+ gate for setting involvement. However, spatial choreography during the climax—"lighthouse clock," "lantern room," "great lens"—compresses without clarifying how the yoyo interacts with these elements. The tidal timeframe is more lyric texture than a legible constraint on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.1)
    The funhouse setting supplies vivid sensory detail (moldy cotton candy, warped mirrors, mercury tears) and recurs across beats. Spatial choreography remains clear. However, the environment does not constrain Elara's choices—she moves freely through chambers without the funhouse layout forcing trade-offs. The mirrors and booth function as backdrop rather than tactical pressure points, keeping this in the functional mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.4)
    The driftwood orchard and xylophone-from-debris are vivid micro-settings that enable tactics (lashing debris into keys, roots gripping tighter). Sensory details are filtered through Elowen's professional bias (cloud vortices, fractal eddies, salt-rimed tattoos). The blue hour and sea anchor the atmosphere, and the setting constrains choice when the final beam threatens capsize. However, spatial choreography blurs during the crescendo—where exactly is Elowen standing when he leaps to the circle's edge, and how does the dome of sound form?

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    The turtle-shell city is vividly rendered with specific detail (spiral grooves "deep as her arm," phosphorescent brine, bridges swaying). The shell's physical crack constrains the climax and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate's micro-setting test. Spatial choreography (workshop atop central shell, climb to scarred rim) remains clear throughout. Sensory detail occasionally tilts decorative ("sunlight poured...like molten gold") but mostly serves pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.9)
    The ivy-choked station, rusted locker, and bare rosebush provide vivid, purposeful detail that mirrors thematic decay and supports atmosphere. The illuminated letter's microscript and ledgers are handled concretely. However, spatial choreography remains generic (platform, waiting room, tunnel) without tactical constraint; Elias moves freely without the environment narrowing options or complicating his retrieval, keeping setting from charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    The submerged pavilion is vividly rendered with specific tactile and visual detail ("filigreed arches," "kelp," "moonlit ripples"), and water depth rises to constrain Elias's physical actions (pinned leg, wrestling stones). The antique inkwell recurs with purpose, shifting from tool to heirloom to empty vessel. However, the setting does not charge the final image—Elias's shore-walk epilogue abstracts the pavilion into legend rather than grounding closure in its particulars—and occupational detail (surveyor, mortar, grout) remains generic without professional texture that would distinguish his expertise under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sunken library is vividly rendered (sodden shelves, moss-slick floor, phosphorescent ink), and the blackout removes sight to force touch-based problem-solving in the stamp beat. Spatial choreography is clear through narrow corridors to the vault. However, the environment becomes static postcard after mid-story; water's "distant murmur" and "reclaimed stillness" repeat without altering tactics in the vault sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.7)
    Tea garden, glass basilica, floating isle thermal updrafts, and bonsai camellias are vivid and atmosphere-rich. The "paradoxical helix" staircase offers a concrete spatial metaphor that mirrors Elar's internal state. The basilica's "refractive splendor" and "prismatic grief" lodge in memory. However, these elements function primarily as backdrop; the environment doesn't constrain a choice or supply a tactical resource—Elar's path (polish gems, drink tea, ascend, fold cranes) would play out similarly in a different enchanted locale. The body and gem-lantern anchor micro-setting, yet their role is illustrative rather than restrictive. Solid sensory work, but the 9+ gate (environment/tool/object constrains choice or charges final image) is only partially met—cranes scatter "through glass vents," a detail that enriches but doesn't pivot the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating observatory is anchored early with vivid detail (anti-grav coils, recycled air, grated floors, panoramic crater view). The geode crystal—cool, yielding, phasing—functions as micro-setting and constrains the hunt action in the null-grav spindle. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (sparks, thrumming air, shimmer). The setting directly enables the closure beat when she presses the crystal into the pool at the spindle, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.2)
    The observatory's "cracked dome," "brass instruments," and "cobwebbed gears" establish a vivid, decayed setting that grounds the action. The type foundry chip and drone swarm function as setting-embedded tools that enable the climax. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Elara retrieves the chip without obstacle, and the drones succeed immediately. The ending's "brilliant dimness" recurs but remains atmospheric rather than tactically charged.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.9)
    The cobalt terrace, forgotten shore, and driftwood carvings are vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography is clean (terrace → steps → shore → driftwood pile → back to terrace). The watch hand and carved family crest function as micro-setting objects that anchor Elias's guilt and charge the final image. Sensory detail (brine, decay, cool stone, tarnished metal) is selective and POV-filtered. The driftwood carvings constrain the method (sifting) and the watch hand charges closure by evoking his mother's death, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3. Minor issue: "jagged rocks strewn with driftwood like the bones of drowned ships" leans ornamental and could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.1)
    The storm-worn parapet and mist are vividly rendered and sustain atmosphere throughout. Spatial choreography is clear (opposite battlements, Elara stepping closer, prisoners behind). However, the setting remains largely decorative; wind and stone do not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The antique drawer pull appears but its physical handling is minimal. Sensory detail is present but does not narrow options at the closure beat, keeping the score mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.4)
    The coastal launch, utility poles, and kayak are concretely rendered and constrain his navigation method. Sensory detail is vivid: "salt-laced wind," "bruised oranges," "icy water flooding his lap." The poles serve as a recurring constraint that shapes his route and the final star-alignment moment, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is generally clear (launch to swell to inlet), though the exact distance and duration blur in "hours blurred in the gloaming." The kayak and compass are handled across multiple beats, and the eighteenth pole's crown aligning with the star provides a purposeful environmental anchor for the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.8)
    The underground bioluminescent lake is vividly described ("azure," "phosphorescent algae," "delicate robust currents"), and the newspapers/subway grates provide concrete anchors. However, the lake functions as a backdrop for epiphany rather than constraining choice—Jax and Elara arrive, the illusions appear, and empathy kindles without the environment altering their tactics. Spatial choreography in the tunnels is vague ("twisted," "hours blurred"), and the cavern's properties (algae, currents) are ornamental rather than load-bearing at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.1)
    The orchard supplies vivid images—"silver leaves," "phoenix tree," "dew-kissed roots"—but remains postcard description. No environmental constraint shapes Elara's choices; she gathers spices "from hidden nooks" without obstacle. The permanent moonlight and fairy-tale frame are atmospheric but do not pressure tactics or alter the outcome. The fortune cookie's placement "amid dew-kissed roots" is the closest to micro-setting, yet it serves plot convenience rather than lived interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.7)
    The midnight glade is vividly rendered ("obsidian branches," "dew-slick moss," "starry moss that pulsed with ethereal light") and the cloudbound setting frames the stakes thematically. The saucer crack and tablecloth function as micro-setting elements that organize the ritual and charge the closure image. However, the glade itself remains largely atmospheric backdrop; it does not constrain Lirien's choices or supply resources that alter her tactics—she could perform the same ritual elsewhere with minor adjustments.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.1)
    The recycled spaceship is signaled early ("patched from melted-down battlecruisers," "faded photographs scavenged from derelict stations") and provides atmosphere, but it never constrains a choice or alters tactics. The heart-chamber and rift-console are postcard backdrops for ritual action. The photographs function as thematic props—shimmer activates the portal, tear-shimmers provide "spectral ink"—yet remain static description; no spatial choreography shifts under pressure, and the ship's corridors and panels do not shape outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.7)
    Black sand, bioluminescent plankton, and the volcano's crimson glow create vivid sensory anchors filtered through Elias's purposeful journey. The beach setting constrains the final beat (villagers converge, bugs swirl upward), meeting the minimal 9+ gate requirement. However, much description remains postcard-like ("vivid obsidian sands gleamed under starfire") without tactical pressure, and the satchel—key to the climax—is handled generically ("satchel open") rather than with embodied detail. Spatial choreography of the villagers' emergence and the bugs' flight is coherent but leans toward spectacle over choice-shaping constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.6)
    The luminous fort's phosphor veins and twilight blackout frame the action, but spatial choreography grows vague—Elara moves from battlements to eastern garden to grand vault to parapet without clear distances or barriers that constrain tactics. The half-painted sundial's angles and the quill holder's prongs offer micro-setting specificity, yet their mechanics (how grooves decode via "refracted shadow-play") remain abstract. The blackout functions as enabler rather than obstacle, and the environment's glow "teases back to life in patches" without altering Elara's choices in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tidal bluff, frictionless stone, and aurora function as active constraints: Kael must work "with the tide lowest and friction's absence purest," and the dust won't settle easily without friction. The basalt, eel ink, and star-dust slurry are handled tactilely across multiple beats. The aurora intensifies in response to the rock placement, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the spiral-building sequence, and the setting's physics (post-friction world) constrain Kael's gathering and placement methods with consistent specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.2)
    The stormlit observatory is vividly described with selective sensory detail (ozone, wind through cracked panes, lightning etching cloud-mountains), and the darkroom timer and telescope ground the space in tangible objects. However, the environment remains largely atmospheric backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics in any beat. Spatial choreography is clear (apex, wooden table, spiral stairs), but the setting functions as postcard description rather than a pressure that shapes Elias's options or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glass atrium, brook, and sundial are vividly described and anchor spatial choreography. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it remains scenic backdrop. The sundial's angles are decoded off-stage in summary, so the mechanical specificity never pressures Elias's tactics. Sensory detail is vivid but ornamental, not integrated into goal-directed action.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.6)
    The rusted library, stars through holes, and scavenged materials supply vivid sensory anchors and recurring images. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint shapes a key choice (e.g., guards' patrol patterns, tool scarcity forcing a trade-off). The body and micro-objects (coffee tin, seeds, rebar) are handled across beats but do not charge the final image with a new constraint. Spatial choreography remains stable and the tone-setting detail is purposeful, lifting the score into mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.1)
    The Tidal Arbor and cloudsea are vivid and specific: "bark-woven platforms," "prism-leaves," "tidal surges… spraying foam that shimmered like lost stars." Spatial choreography across the climb is coherent, with Elias wedging the reel to reflect moonlight and using crevices as handholds. The refuge glade—"flowers pulsing in sync with imagined rhythms"—charges the final image with sensory detail. However, the setting does not constrain a meaningful choice at closure; the arbor's obstacles complicate the journey but do not force Elias to trade or sacrifice anything when he arrives. The 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is met only partially via the final image, capping the score at mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ridge and dream-library are vividly described with sensory specificity (petrichor, humming orchids, glowing archives). The knowledge fruit seed and arbor are handled across beats. However, the environment does not constrain a choice at closure—Elara's descent and the villagers' awakening are consequence, not spatial struggle. The monsoon clock is announced but never tightens decision windows on the page. Micro-setting (the arbor, the seed) charges the middle but not the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "breezy islet after rain" and mist-shrouded garden supply atmosphere but do not constrain a single choice—Elara moves freely, Hiroshi's grove is backdrop. The compass embedded in heartwood and the antique lace are handled, meeting micro-setting criteria minimally, but neither object blocks or enables a tactic under pressure. Spatial choreography is coherent (shore → garden → bonsai center → departure) yet postcard-descriptive. The cerulean sky reprise at closure charges the final image slightly, lifting the score within band despite the Q3 cap at 7.0 from orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vividly specific with sensory details (e.g., "velvet shroud" of wings, "icy warmth" of nexus) that charge the final image. The research station and winged specimens constrain choices, and the nexus as a micro-setting object is indispensable to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    The flooded opera house and lanterns are vividly sensory and purposefully filter through Elias's expertise, constraining choices like accessing the prompter's box. The setting charges the final image of disruption and legacy, with micro-setting elements (e.g., violin, grate) altering tactics and deepening atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sage Ridge and the eclipse environment constrain choices and charge the final image, with sensory details like "sage leaves brushing her knees" woven into action. The setting acts as a micro-setting that alters tactics, supporting the 9+ test by pressuring the shared moment.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.2)
    The silo library setting constrains choices (e.g., tilted shelves affecting movement) and charges the final image with the displaced axis thrumming beneath the tapestry. Sensory details are vivid and purposeful, filtered through Thorne's perception, with economy and coherence. The environment actively shapes tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting is vividly rendered with sensory details like the howling wind and piercing beam, selectively filtered through Elias's POV. The lighthouse functions as micro-setting, constraining choices by directing maritime fates and charging the final image as his eternal stage. Specificity is purposeful, from the scarred oak bar to the rocky shoals, avoiding generic placeholders.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)

== Grader: GPT-5.1 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.0)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse and post-flood landscape are vividly rendered with purposeful, sensory detail (twisted metal, sodden earth, clouded mirrors) that mirrors the themes of decay and refinement. Setting is not static; it supplies tools (mirrors, debris) and becomes both lab and metaphorical crucible for her transformation. Environmental evolution (mirrors clearing, vines skeletal yet sprouting) culminates in a charged final image. Minor deduction stems from occasional over-explicit symbolism rather than letting the setting fully carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    The canyon, stars, frost, kiln, and glasswork are vivid and consistently filtered through Elara’s artisan sensibility, with the frost literally functioning as a map and investigative tool. Environment constrains tactics (microclimates, ledges, morning frost) and charges the final image of a canyon-spanning glass installation. Sensory detail is strongest in the visual/thermal register but is selective and purposeful rather than touristic. The world rules around luminous glass and toxic charcoal stay consistent and enrich both atmosphere and plot.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    The winterglass conservatory is vividly rendered and its specific properties (thermal responsiveness, resonance) are not just pretty but mechanistic drivers of plot and theme. Details like “crystalline ferns” and the “massive glacial lily” are sensorially rich and then become tactically relevant when the pane cracks and the lily teeters. The world rule of The Hush is economically integrated through the environment rather than exposition alone. The final image of winterglass etched with eternal heat maps charges the setting with lasting consequence and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.8)
    The underwater library is vivid, specific, and felt at every step—algae-veiled alcoves, impossible dry folds, the air bubble under the cracked dome. Environment and objects actively constrain and enable choices: the ancient wards create “impossible spaces” that make his tactic possible, and the dome’s apex becomes the literal and symbolic site of his transformation. Details remain tightly filtered through function and mood rather than turning into a static tour. This is publication-ready atmospheric work that could only be set here.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    The terra-cotta arbor, ridge, moonlight, and olive-scented wind create a vivid, specific atmosphere that suits the quiet, clandestine tone. The antique silver bell and the arbor’s acoustics are nicely integrated into action (signaling returns, amplifying Mira’s words, charging the final images). However, the setting rarely constrains tactics in a way that alters decisions; it’s more symbolic container than active obstacle/resource. World details around the sanctions are sketched just enough to be plausible but stay generalized.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    The twilight viaduct, fog, and wisteria are vividly rendered and threaded throughout, giving the story a strong atmospheric spine. Setting details (the abandoned height over a ravine, the drifting petals, the mist) are consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility and mirror the liminal, half-remembered spiritual stakes. The micro-setting of the camera obscura box and the pinholed gem effectively functions as a charged environment where the decisive action plays out. The viaduct itself is more mood-frame than constraint on choice, which keeps this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.3)
    The living bridge garden is vivid and specific—hyperbolic hedges, saddle-curved paths, vine-spans over chasms—with sensory texture that matches the concept. The environment does more than decorate: it quakes in sympathy with Elias’s inner state and with the fragment’s power, and steadies at the end, charging the closure image. However, the garden rarely constrains concrete tactical choices; it is more a resonant stage than an active obstacle or tool. That keeps the setting just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    The abandoned prize redemption center is vivid and specific—the “faded stuffed animals,” “mildew and cotton candy ghosts,” and the sagging shelves create a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting constrains tactics in concrete ways: chains fixed to the counter, a loose floorboard, a toppled shelf of heavy prizes, and the hidden hatch all matter to action. Worldbuilding with the Wall, drylands, and inner preserves integrates smoothly without stalling momentum. A bit more non-visual sensory variation under peak stress could deepen immediacy, but the environment distinctly shapes choices.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and specific: a sunken orchard greenhouse, bioluminescent apples, volcanic pumice forge, shipwreck ring, and auroral light all feel organic and coherent. Environmental elements directly matter to action—the wrecks supply “absences,” the aurora times the forge, and the orchard provides sap for the device. The final image (“greenhouse fruits pulsing approval”) recharges the setting symbolically. The only reason this doesn’t edge higher is that the environment constrains his tactics less than it atmospherically amplifies them.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    The emerald station under sunset and moonlight is vividly rendered, with color and light doing heavy atmospheric lifting and aligning tightly with the premise. World rules (alchemical emeralds as celestial conduits) are folded into action rather than expository aside and directly support the jar/portrait mechanics. Setting and objects (station, emeralds, jar) charge the final image and shape what’s possible—her entire revelation depends on this environment’s properties. A slight risk of over-saturation in light/emerald descriptors appears, but clarity and purpose are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    The thawing control room, meltwater, rusted consoles, and furnace form a rich, coherent environment that mirrors and supports the “thawing heart” motif. Glassblowing tools and the control consoles are used tactically (kiln, glory hole, consoles as display pedestals) rather than as mere backdrop. Weather and melting ice subtly shape atmosphere and opportunity, even if they don’t sharply constrain choice. This is an immersive, well-integrated setting just shy of using constraint to its fullest potential.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “rusted library under stars” on a cliff is vividly rendered—collapsed roof, warped iron shelves, salt air, sea roar—and clearly anchored. The environment meaningfully constrains action: the cliff edge, rusted beams, and shelf (“lion’s tome”) directly shape Elara’s tactics (swinging, dropping the cast, confronting Harlan over the void). The sea as both literal danger and locus of Harlan’s phobia charges the final confrontation. Detail is sometimes lush to the edge of purple but remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting work is rich and specific: storm-tossed ridge fort, pebble shores, marbled stone, and the lone star all feel textured and coherent. Environmental details actively feed the method—wind through mortar, pauses between waves, stones settling—so the world is not mere backdrop but the medium of divination. Weather and architecture plausibly constrain what can be heard and done, charging the “ambered hush” as a functional space, not just an image. At times the density of description edges toward excess, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    The frozen courtyard at twilight is vividly and economically rendered—statues, skeletal trees, flagstones, and snow all feel specific and atmospheric. The environment is not just backdrop: it produces the buried violin, affects his sensory inputs, and frames the “eternal winter” that mirrors temporal looping. The final image of sweeping in the same courtyard, now reweighted by accrued insight, is strongly charged by the setting. A bit more tactile interaction under pressure could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “crystal whispering forecourt after rain” is vivid and consistently returned to through mirrored surfaces, amplified whispers, and the final soft song. The environment meaningfully supports the premise: it enables Elias’s eavesdropping, provides a projection surface for the lens, and thematically echoes reflection and transparency. While the setting is more atmospheric than constraining in terms of physical choices, it does charge the final image and is clearly not interchangeable with a generic location. Some description edges toward lushness-for-its-own-sake, but it remains legible and purposeful overall.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    The garden maze, its bruised-dusk sky, the fountain core, and the cracked marbles create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels lived-in and specific. Environmental details (blooming vs. withering sections, auditors moving through lush and dead ends) mirror and pressure the stakes around demolition. The fountain, heart marble, and paths directly charge the final image and the rules of the world feel internally consistent. Occasionally the descriptive density edges toward ornamental, but overall the setting is a major strength that supports theme and plot.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    The xenobiology research station on Elysara Prime is vivid, with the cliffs, enclosures, and winged behemoths all contributing to a specific, atmospheric environment. Details like recycled starlight in her tools and the hush of resting wings feel filtered through Elara’s professional lens, grounding the speculative premise. The nexus’s “icy warmth” and fogging of viewports charge the central setting object and feed directly into the final image. The station could constrain choices more explicitly, but it nonetheless shapes the logic and feel of the story in a sustained way.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    The flooded opera house, half-submerged stage, and flickering lanterns are vividly rendered and recur as functional elements rather than mere backdrop. Environment constrains and enables action (flood allows access to grates, lantern chain can be slashed, structural cracking from water pressure), so setting meaningfully shapes tactics. Sensory range leans visual and auditory (water’s lap, hush, lantern glow) with less tactile or olfactory texture than elite work might offer. Still, the opera house as decaying, haunted body for the story works strongly.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    The mountain weather station and aurora are vividly rendered, with strong integration of tools and environment (barometer, anemometer, kerosene lamp, frost-rimed windows). The setting consistently mirrors and charges the emotional state—the “knife-edge peak,” “auroral sorrow,” and howling winds all echo Elara’s precarious ethics and grief. The final images (station creaking, winds howling a dirge) clearly participate in the closing reconfiguration. It stops short of a 9-band only because the environment rarely constrains concrete options; it frames and intensifies rather than forcing specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tunnel, mill ruins, and valve wheel are vividly evoked and tightly bound to the stakes; the rosary-woven wheel both constrains action (he must strain to turn it) and charges the final image (beads in pocket). Sound (drips, trucks overhead, radio static) and texture (rust, silt, worn beads) are used purposefully rather than decoratively. The environment actively shapes what’s possible—this has to be a hidden industrial underbelly for the guilt and “ghost shift” to make sense. The world feels specific and coherent without over-explaining its industrial mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    The overgrown library, catacomb strata, subterranean river, and obsidian refuge are vividly and specifically rendered, with details like “bioluminescent fungi” and “petrified scrolls and ossified ink” filtering clearly through the keeper’s sensibility. Environment meaningfully shapes action: the soft earth, roots, and layered catacombs enable the burrowing; the refuge’s light-absorbing stone and mending hush define the outcome and final image. The recurring contrast between verdant decay and polished obsidian charges the thematic arc of entropy versus regenerative stillness. A touch more constraint—setting forcing a hard choice—would push this toward top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sage Ridge, the sagebrush, and the “dreaming roots” are vivid, concrete, and consistently integrated into the emotional atmosphere. The setting constrains and charges choices—the isolation, the natural amphitheater, and the eclipse’s eerie light all justify why this is the place and moment he chooses for breakthrough. Environmental details (roots like “forgotten spells,” sage “whispering secrets”) mirror the characters’ interior states without becoming confusing. The final image of Lila tracing the roots and descending from the ridge with the locket effectively binds place, object, and emotional change.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    The reclaimed missile silo library is richly imagined—the “bronze quiet,” leaning shelves, and gravity-warped dust motes produce a vivid, specific atmosphere. The displaced axis and thrumming foundations integrate setting with world rules and theme, especially when the tapestry fragment is mounted on the central pillar. The environment subtly shapes what’s possible (sealed chamber, warped vault, fireplace) even if it doesn’t force acute tactical choices. The final image of the tilted library as his “compass” meaningfully charges the setting at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lighthouse, rocky island, fog, and tavern are vividly evoked and integrated into action—the beam, shoals, and late-night isolation all shape tactics in the trap. Weather and sea are more than backdrop; the fog and rocks are literal weapons once Elias “transposes” the beam. Some details veer toward decorative (“well-worn fog cloak”) rather than pressure-driven, but they still support tone. Spatial and temporal orientation are clear, and the environment constrains what is possible at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dimensional anchor is vividly and consistently rendered (“time folded without creasing,” “space breathed without expanding”) and its physical core directly shapes action as a surface for sigils and locus of possession. Environmental details like whispering voids and silences “decorating like frost on glass” are not postcard description—they modulate tactics and pressure. The recurring objects (loop pedal, palette, core) function as micro-setting anchors that charge the final image of rewoven stillness. World rules stay internally consistent and are shown through Elias’s ritual rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glass spire and frozen lake are vividly rendered and recur as active participants: the ice vibrates, the mirrored horizon ignites, the spire hums and later stands as sentinel. Setting is tightly braided with the premise of temporal reflection and symphonic memory, and environmental responses (ice etching with spiral scores) charge the final image. Details are rich yet focused—no white-room moments—and they’re consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The environment subtly constrains action (she must go onto the ice at dawn) without ever feeling like a mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and consistent: the glowing viaduct, suspended raindrops, and storm-dimmed valley create a strong atmospheric frame. Environment meaningfully shapes events: raindrops become portals, the viaduct channels power into the tablet, and the rain-slick fall is the primal trauma he must revisit. Details are mostly well-integrated into action rather than museum-like, and the frozen-time weather motif returns powerfully when time resumes. At times the description edges toward overload, risking decorative density over pressure-driven specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cavern, drums, stone, and seasonal rustle are vividly realized and deeply interwoven with deafness and vibration, not mere backdrop. The phonograph and drums function as tools that literally route sound into touch, directly constraining how characters can experience “music.” Environmental specifics (autumn-kissed hills, pooled shadows, resonant stone) are filtered through Elara’s sensory priorities and thematically mirror her inner quiet. The final image returns to the cavern and seasons, making the setting integral to the closure rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    The courtyard at dusk, with its stone walls, olive tree, and lantern-lit workbench, is vivid and tonally aligned, and the larger world of quarantine zones and bio-storms is sketched with efficient specificity. Weather and environment (bruised sky, winds veering toward barriers) meaningfully echo the conceptual stakes and Elara’s vocation. However, the setting doesn’t strongly constrain concrete choices; it functions more as atmospheric frame and symbolic bastion than as a tactical pressure. Still, the final image of the courtyard as “bastion” and the pigeon’s distant coo give the environment a satisfying, charged reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    The greenhouse, UV lanterns, crystal shadows, and extinct flora are richly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensory bias, especially smell and light. The environment meaningfully constrains and enables action (need for UV, revived nightshade possible only here, humid and dangerous scent-laden air). Recurring objects (greenhouse, dome, lantern, vial) charge the final images and mirror his inner metamorphosis. At times the density of decorative modifiers verges on luxuriant for the pressure level but does not undercut clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.5)
    The terra-cotta grotto under fractured, star-veiled skies is vivid and sensorially specific, and details like bioluminescent script and trembling walls enrich the atmosphere. The setting supports the liminal, ritual quality of the encounter and charges images like the rope against the ruddy dust. However, the grotto and sky mostly frame rather than constrain choice; Elias’s options would be similar in many other “sacred cave” settings. Strong mood work, but the environment stops short of truly pressuring tactics or the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks” is vivid, specific, and consistently used: the hulls function as a natural auditorium, the half-flooding and twisted apple trees echo the theme of unfinished growth, and the bioluminescent water charges the central ritual. Environmental details are cleanly integrated with action and sound—echoes off rusted ribs, glass tinkling when the hush cracks. The final image of a single trembling apple bud and the greenhouse’s “sigh” clearly reweights the setting at closure. The world rules for this altered coastline and greenhouse are stable enough not to distract.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    The amber grotto is vividly rendered and integrated—the resin veins, static charge, and honeyed dusk light all feel specific and sensorially dense. Crucially, the grotto’s static properties are not mere backdrop; they’re the mechanism by which Elias calibrates and channels emotion, and the final “static hum” charges the closing image. The setting’s tone (warm, enclosing, faintly clinical) mirrors the thematic “affectionate detachment” without becoming heavy-handed. World rules remain consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.0)
    The seaside town, docks, and open-air “breezy library” under stars are vividly sketched and recur in the opening and ending, giving the piece a pleasant atmospheric frame. Details like swaying shelves and lantern-lit paths feel specific and tonal rather than generic. Still, the environment rarely constrains or enables action; the same plot could largely unfold in any cozy venue. The setting charges the final image aesthetically, but not in a way that meaningfully tightens stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.0)
    The crystalline orchard, crater, and obsidian arbor are vividly rendered and give the piece a strong, consistent atmosphere. Details like frost-kissed branches, translucent trunks, and volcanic glass facets feel specific and integrated rather than touristic. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it does meaningfully charge the final image of the arbor holding the reed sculpture as a monument to connection. The world’s rules are implied but stable, and the setting’s tone meshes tightly with the emotional register.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rooftop canal world is vividly imagined—bioluminescent water, vine-wrapped otters, towers like “ancient teeth”—and always filtered through Elara’s observational, naturalist lens. The environment actively shapes action: travel must follow canals, the sculptures literally block the path, and the giant’s valley-bound body defines both weather and clock. World rules (time-sculpting, echo-birthing basin, borrowed minutes) stay internally consistent and are learned through movement rather than exposition dumps. The setting is richly specific and functionally integrated, though some description edges toward luxuriant for the pressure level.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cavern orchard is vivid and specific—stalactite drips nourishing trees, luminescent fruit used as a heat source, fissured rock filtering moonlight. Setting is consistently filtered through Thorne’s focus on magic and math, and it actively participates in the climax (the stone hums, roots stir, fruits glow brighter), charging the final image. The mosaic stone in particular functions as a micro-setting/tool that directly shapes his tactics and his realization. It stops slightly short of the absolute top tier because the environment, while beautifully drawn, exerts more atmospheric than constraining pressure on his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    The shadowed library, crawl spaces, and pipe chases are vividly rendered and filtered through Elias’s familiarity, giving the environment real texture and function. Setting actively shapes action: his knowledge of the underfloor labyrinth enables the cache and discovery of the tape; the outage and dawn light modulate what’s possible and charge the final image. Sensory detail (dust motes, cobalt gleams, ferric tang) feels purposeful rather than touristic. At times the color motif (“sapphire,” “cobalt”) verges on insistent, but it remains thematically coherent rather than distracting.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.5)
    The nursery, storm season, and especially the mossy trellis are vividly rendered and recur as meaningful anchors, not just décor; the weather palpably interacts with the transformation (rain, lightning, wind against leaves). The trellis and wet earth concretely shape the outcome by providing the structure he clings to and ultimately entwines with. Sensory detail skews visual and atmospheric but is strong enough to sustain a clear mood. While the valley and wider world remain somewhat generic, the local setting serves the piece’s needs well.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tidal island is vividly and economically realized: bombardment scars, fissured aquifers, tidal pools, kelp lines, and rain-carved rivulets all feel lived-in and causally consistent. Weather and tides actively shape what can happen (the exposed pool, the island’s isolation, the urgency before tides reclaim it). The brooch as object-as-setting charges both the altar scene and the easel in the final image. A touch less adjectival density would sharpen, but the environment clearly constrains choice and powers atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.1)
    The musical crystal cave is richly imagined and tightly integrated, with the chimes, glow, and pearl all participating in the core premise and climax. Environmental detail (notes with each footfall, shadows overlapping, crystals singing) supports tone and the “unseen forces” concept rather than reading as a static backdrop. The cave directly affects plot via the pearl and the awakening forces, though physical constraints (terrain, risk, paths) don’t much alter tactics. Description edges toward lush, but it retains clarity and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ivory Harbor after rain, the alabaster docks, salt-crusted archive tower, and persistent ocean spray create a vivid, coherent atmosphere. Setting is not just backdrop: the spray triggers Elias’s visions, the harbor’s crowd dynamics shape his choice to act, and the final image of the harbor “breathing whole” charges the closure. Details generally feel filtered through Elias’s archivist sensibility rather than tourist listing. A few descriptions verge on ornamental, but they rarely stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is richly evoked—undercroft, cracked glass dome, mist, spectral train, iron fortress—and consistently filtered through Elias’s cartographic eye. Environmental features (cracks as arrows, the undercroft, the spectral tracks) directly guide choices and movement rather than serving as mere backdrop. The recurring mist/starlight and the physical presence of the punch effectively charge the final images. Description flirts with lushness but remains purposeful and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stargazer’s open tower, cliffside storm, and whale migration are vividly rendered and strongly atmospheric, with details filtered through Elara’s vocation and temperament. The tower functions as more than backdrop; it is a deliberate refuge she curates, and the closing image of the glowing tile at its heart charges the environment with new meaning. Weather and sea sounds echo internal and thematic currents without feeling merely decorative. The setting could more directly constrain physical choices, but at this length its conceptual pressure suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prismatic escondite, solar storm, and magnetic fields are vividly rendered and integrated into the mechanics of the plot, not just as backdrop. Sensory specificity—“bruised violets and searing crimsons,” “veins of liquid iron”—builds a coherent, charged atmosphere that matches the story’s scale. Environment constrains options: the storm and crystal lattices are the only viable conduits for mutiny. The final destruction/reformation of the escondite and solar storm’s fade charge the ending image rather than feeling ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prep room is vividly, specifically rendered—industrial refrigerators, carboys, tools—and its atmosphere of “deathly vitality” is strongly tied to tone. Setting is not just backdrop: it houses Victor’s body, the hidden ink pot, and the door that abuts the consulate wall, directly constraining and enabling Eli’s choices. Environmental details are filtered through Eli’s purpose (searching the suit, timing footsteps by the door) rather than feeling like a tour. The world rules around the consulate and breach are sketched efficiently and remain consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bonsai labyrinth, mountaintop, frost-shrouded town, and branch-and-rice-paper pavilion are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Thorne’s sensibility as a stationer obsessed with texture and light. Setting details aren’t postcard-only: the labyrinth becomes the site of the book’s placement and the bonsai’s blooming response charges the ending image. The fluorescent lamp, workshop bench, gold leaf, and papery materials function as a micro-setting that directly enables his time-refraction. World rules (frost, hum, refractions) remain stable and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    The port’s container labyrinth, fog, and shifting tides are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through the protagonist’s perception. Environment isn’t just backdrop: low tide opening paths and exposing the breached hull directly enables the climactic discovery of the label, and high tide forces vertical retreats that change what voices they can access. The recurring imagery of rust, metal, fog, and tide undergirds the theme of erosion and erasure without feeling labored. A small step from elite level would be an extra, concrete moment where physical danger from the setting more overtly constrains their tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cliffside observatory and sea are vividly rendered and tonally aligned with Elias’s mood, and the shell and half-finished cello function as charged micro-settings. Environmental details like “salt-crusted stones,” “cracked dome,” and “dust motes” are filtered through his sensibility rather than tourist listing. The observatory shapes the scene by isolating him and amplifying sound, and the final glance back at the cliff’s “eternal vigil” nicely recharges the initial setting image. A touch more concrete interaction with the space under pressure (e.g., wind, physical precariousness) could further bind setting to choice.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    The raft-city carnival is vivid and specific—driftwood platforms, pedal-powered Ferris wheels, bioluminescent lanterns—and details are clearly filtered through someone who knows the place intimately. Setting and world rules (floating rafts, deeds, marinas) directly shape tactics: graffiti on masts, raft re-lashing to block barges, and the sea as both constraint and ally. The foundation stone chip functions effectively as a micro-setting object, charging Elara’s choices and the final image. At times the carnival imagery risks becoming a colorful backdrop rather than an active pressure, but it generally integrates well with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lunar summit and crater are vividly evoked—“ghostly silver,” jagged heights no rover can climb, Earth hanging “blue and indifferent”—and all of this is tightly filtered through Elias’s professional gaze. Setting is not just backdrop: vacuum, cold, topography, and lack of radio repeater all drive his need for improvised chemical signaling and the choice to wait for dawn. The micro-setting of the grain on black velvet under first light is a strong, charged final image. There is mild overreliance on similar tonal adjectives (“melancholy,” “ghostly,” “dawning hush”), which slightly flattens atmospheric range.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mist-coated rail depot, harbor, and repair shop are vivid and specific, with weather, tools, and light all woven into action rather than catalogued. The water basins and lanterns are particularly strong as micro-setting elements that directly shape the diagnostic method and the look of the scene (“prismatic rainbows shimmered on the basins’ surfaces”). Environmental details consistently mirror the tone of calm under pressure without feeling like generic atmosphere. The setting also underpins stakes (foggy voyage, need for scouting) and charges the final image of the drone vanishing into mist.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rusted outpost and frozen lake are vividly realized, with tactile specifics like corrugated walls, snow load, and cracking ice that reinforce tone and theme. The environment constrains tactics (skirting lake cracks, ascending the glacier) and charges images such as the lake fading to a “silver scar.” Recurring water states (ice, steam, condensation, rivers) are integrated rather than decorative, mirroring the conceptual convergence. The setting feels lived-in and purposeful without devolving into a static postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ghost town, archway, and cobblestones are vividly evoked with consistent atmosphere; details like “dust across cobblestones” and “mortar knitting like healed flesh” are specific and imagistic. Setting is well integrated into action—the rhythm literally travels through stones, walls, and roofs—so the environment participates in the event, not just decorates it. World rules (magic via rhythm) are stable enough within the piece’s lyric mode. Some phrases (“wild hush”) are repeated a bit too often, but they sustain tone more than they stall.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    The underwater temple is vividly realized—coral-encrusted arches, bioluminescent polyps, petrified kelp—and the pressure of depth and limited oxygen is baked into the environment. Setting details are well-filtered through Lirael’s mission-driven gaze rather than feeling like a tour. The temple and its “heart” directly constrain her choices and charge the final image of ascent with the orb. A bit more tactile interaction with obstacles in the space (narrow passages, visibility, physical hazards) would further integrate setting and action.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lighthouse prison on a jagged reef under “copperlight” is vivid, specific, and tonally unified, with the spiral stair, chapel alcove, and labyrinthine bowels all coherently mapped. Setting is strongly filtered through Elias’s perception, with the reef and collapsing cells tying directly into the father’s backstory and the theme of ignored warnings. The lattice and door act as micro-settings that meaningfully structure his movement. The main constraint is that, while atmosphere is rich, the environment rarely constrains choice under pressure; it’s more stage than active adversary.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    The alchemical greenhouse and “winter-cracked fields” are vivid, specific, and recur in ways that shape tone and meaning rather than feeling like postcards. The environment meaningfully charges the plot—the poisonous, glowing fruits are how her essence enters him, and the final image of the orchard blooming unnaturally in endless night crystallizes the transformed stakes. Weather and isolation subtly pressure his solitude and dependency on this space. A bit less incantatory repetition and a touch more tactile interaction with tools/plants under stress could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    The red canyon labyrinth, tide pools, petroglyphs, and ruined wharf are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The environment is not just backdrop: the canyon walls become the literal fabric she sews, and the final tapestry-map reconfigures the physical space into a haven. Sensory detail (crimson walls, sea brine, glowing glyphs) is selective and purposeful, supporting the mythic, elegiac tone. While the setting does not heavily constrain tactical choices, it charges the final image and is integral to the story’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “catacomb orchard” is vivid and distinctive, with bones, roots, blossoms, and the tomb all integrated into Elara’s perceptions and actions. Environmental details (roots snaking between bones, tugging at ankles, cradling the sundial) meaningfully shape mood and subtly constrain movement. The sundial’s placement in this space, and the final image of it gleaming amid bones and roots, charges the setting with thematic weight. A bit more non-visual sensory texture could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)
    The golden arcade, holographic vines, vendor pods, and brass post chute are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elara’s nostalgic, analog-biased gaze. Setting and objects (chalk, chute, clipboard, wax seal) actively shape tactics: analog choices exist precisely because of the pervasive digital surveillance. The environment’s futurism versus her low-tech methods also charges the final beat, making the act of mailing feel like a defiant ritual. A slight excess of descriptive density in places is the only thing holding this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt observatory, autumn weather, and eternal candle are richly realized and tightly woven into action and mood. The candle in particular functions as a quasi-tool, constraining her method (synchronizing stitches) and charging the final image as witness. Environmental details like leaves tapping the glass and cobalt light aren't mere décor; they echo the story’s secrecy and isolation. The setting doesn't quite force a concrete tactical dilemma, but it does meaningfully shape the texture and method of her work.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mangrove labyrinth, singing spirits, glass-like leaves, and condensation-windows are vividly rendered and tightly interwoven with the magic system and emotional stakes. Setting is not mere backdrop: the shifting paths, spirit-thorns, and window-leaves directly frame her attempts to reach Thorne and mediate the messages. The shard, moonlight, and environment converge at key beats (healing her wound, powering the ritual, cooling at the end) to charge the final image. At times the density of metaphor edges toward decorative rather than pressure-driven, but it rarely harms clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the “mist-clad atrium,” “mined shores,” and reef bombings all color the emotional field without feeling like a tour. The brain coral, the cast, and the hospital environment function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image rather than mere backdrop. Weather and light—twilight, mist—echo the liminal emotional state in a way that feels earned. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, it consistently shapes mood and symbolism up to the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ruined orchard and thick fog are vividly and consistently rendered, with concrete images like “gnarled apple trees” and “mossy roots” grounding the lyricism. The environment meaningfully interacts with the premise—the fog becomes a surface for her light murals, and the orchard’s subtle stirring at the end charges the final image. At times the atmospheric description trends toward reiteration (fog, mist, haze cycling without new function), which slightly blunts its impact. Overall, though, the setting is a real asset, not a generic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sound wave garden is vividly realized and integrated into action—the waveform flora, resonant gravel, and murals are not just backdrop but tools in the bewitchment. The environment’s rules (sound as tangible, sculptural) stay consistent and directly enable Elias’s method via the fern and reflected note. The hobo nickel and mural function as micro-settings that charge the final image (nickel humming, murals brighter for the exchange). Description occasionally verges on ornamental, but it mostly feels purposeful and POV-inflected.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is richly specific and integrated: community garden plots, the insect-laden greenhouse, and surveillance drones all directly shape tactics and imagery. The entomologist’s greenhouse in particular constrains action and enables the climax: scarabs warp the plant, beetles cloak the space, vines and insects repel the Bureau. Details are filtered through the premise (taxed thoughts, “digital pollen trails,” “Euclidean tax ledgers”) rather than generic futurism. The final image of the greenhouse “alive with defiance’s hum” strongly charges the setting as the story’s conceptual heart.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gargantuan shell and reef environment are vividly, consistently rendered and deeply fused with mood (“reef-shadows,” off-key wind, nacreous chambers). Setting meaningfully constrains and charges choices: the shell is both prison and resonant instrument for the lullabies and the resting place of the postcard. The galaxy postcard as micro-setting/object is also integrated into the spatial logic and final image. This could edge higher only if physical constraints of the shell more directly shaped tactical options in the rite.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    The opal library above the clouds, the museum of extinct feelings, and the glass orchids create a highly specific, atmospheric setting that’s consistently filtered through Elara’s attention to fragile, crystalline life. Environmental details (iridescent winds, opal panes, derelict alcoves) are integrated into action; the winds and height literally affect the tube and stakes at the climax. World rules are implied rather than explained, but remain stable and legible. The only check on a higher score is occasional description-for-its-own-sake density that feels more ornamental than pressure-linked.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    The extinct language archive is vividly rendered (“shadows clung to shelves like forgotten syllables”) and consistently filters through Elara’s professional eye, giving the space a lived-in, conceptual specificity. The glass ink well and snarled Vorathil scroll function as micro-settings/tools that constrain action and make the method of resolution plausible. Environmental details (spectral murmurs, potential guardian wraiths) bolster atmosphere even if they never fully act, and the dawn light at the end helps charge the closing beat. A bit of descriptive density borders on ornamental, but it rarely muddies spatial or situational clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dormant-volcano amphitheater is vividly rendered—breathing vents, sulfurous vapors, crumbling tiers—and its physical properties materially shape both the engineering solution (using vents as “stone lungs”) and the sacred stakes. Sensory detail is rich and mostly purposeful, with steam, light, and fissures tied to his work and realizations rather than feeling like a tourist catalog. The recurring breathing motif subtly mirrors the living-elder conception of the mountain and culminates in the closing sigh. A slight excess of repeated descriptors (dappled, breathed) keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    The attic with pigeons, wicker cages, yellowed pages, and a cracked skylight is vivid and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility; dust motes and light are not just decorative but integral to his method. The environment constrains and shapes action: the skylight’s angle dictates when he can map motes and balance the chip, and the attic’s seclusion allows both his secrecy and later shared vigils. The recurring objects—the meteorite, cages, paper trails, motes—return in the final images to charge Elias’s death and Lila’s continuation. A slight tendency toward lush description saturation keeps this just short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    The drifting prism terrace, corn sea, and storm-drinking tree grain form a vivid, coherent environment that’s deeply tied to the story’s operations. The setting isn’t just decorative: aligning prisms, reading grain, and descending toward the corn maze are all tactic-shaping uses of space and objects. The final images—the terrace fading, corn’s embrace, thresholds blooming—are charged by earlier environmental details. World rules (fractured prisms, refractions, storm-coded wood) stay internally consistent within the lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.3)
    The underwater research facility is vivid and specific—fractured pressure domes, coral-veiled spires, bioluminescent seams—and it meaningfully frames their isolation and dependence on artificial life support. The observatory and viewport, plus the seasonal “fireflies,” directly shape the final image and Elara’s tactics (waiting at that lens, using the environment as her sky). The burnt feather and fireflies are well-integrated environmental motifs that charge the ending. At times the density of imagery edges toward decorative excess, but clarity is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    The iridescent cave and giant crystal geode are sensuously rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s perception, giving the piece a strong, unified atmosphere. The crater glass, quartz ledge, and refracting walls are not just décor; they frame her work and charge the final image of “cheerful gloom” refracted into rainbows. The environment doesn’t sharply constrain physical choices, but it heavily conditions the emotional and symbolic field, which suits this lyric mode. Description leans lush but generally stays purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tidal arcade is vividly evoked—sea spray, neon, rigged machines, the groaning boardwalk—and these aren’t just postcards; the tide and wind literally move the bishop and shape Jasper’s tactics. The recurring boardwalk and stars charge the final sense of a subtly transformed, still-wild place. Details are consistently filtered through Jasper’s analytic, performance-minded gaze, keeping the texture purposeful rather than catalog-like. The setting’s constraints and energies clearly inflect the story’s central action and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)
    The twilight garden, stars, moonstone, and later the balcony/city lights are richly rendered and purpose-driven, with the environment literally constraining Elara through the roots and enabling her method via the visible constellations. Details like dew-kissed moss, violet haze, and roses paling to silver feel specific rather than generic and consistently filtered through her dancer’s sensibility. The garden and stars recur in the final image as charged echoes of her exile, now recontextualized by shared mortal warmth. At times, the density of description edges toward ornamental, but it rarely undercuts clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pearl Bay, the fog, the prism atrium, and the pond are vividly and specifically rendered, with strong sensory and visual texture (“pearlescent fog,” “spectral rainbows that danced across dew-kissed stones”). Setting is not mere backdrop: the light, mist, and glass materially enable his method of divination and charge the final image of ordinary light reckoning with the night. World rules (light, mist, water as mediums of insight) stay consistent and feel lived-in. A slight excess of descriptive density flirts with overrichness, but clarity is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    The moonlit ridge, pines, and distant burning valley are sensuously rendered and tonally apt, with the path and stars mirroring the liminal, reflective state of the scene. The cracked porcelain box functions as a micro-setting, physically handled and thematically charged, especially when passed to Lena. However, the environment mostly frames mood rather than constraining concrete choices; the ridge doesn’t significantly alter tactics beyond offering solitude and a symbolic “bridge between their wounds.” Still, specificity and integration with theme are strong for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tide-polished grotto, bioluminescent algae, shells, pebbles, and kelp are vividly rendered and tightly integrated into the magic system: they’re not scenery but the literal components of Elara’s method. The environment’s reflective walls, tide fissure, and washed-up relics all participate in the ritual and final imagery. While the grotto doesn’t sharply constrain choices in a survival sense, it strongly charges the atmosphere and final image of “tide-polished heart of worlds.” The specificity and consistency of this setting substantially elevate the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ruined, overgrown manor and “ivy-veiled passage” are vivid and consistent with the climate-shifted world; details like humid air, charred paper, and the bruised green sky do real atmospheric work. Setting is filtered through Elias’s acoustic bias (walls humming, dreaming, sighing), which roots description in character. Environment modestly constrains action (the ivy, the dark interior, the alcove, the hidden stone) and charges the final image of sketching under the altered sky. The only thing keeping this below the very top band is that environmental constraint remains soft—he never must choose tactically because of the world, only thematically in response to it.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific—“echoing terrace,” “prism parapet after rain,” and the city below are sensorially rich and consistently exploited. The environment isn’t just backdrop: the parapet’s prisms are her palette, the terrace’s echoes and height help transmit song and mirages, and the spring dusk and coming bells frame the ritual window. These details recur and are charged in the final image (“prism parapet’s lingering glow”), so they carry more than decorative weight. The world rules around mirage, reflections, and sound remain internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    The terrace, midsummer light, and celestial alignment are vividly rendered and recur with evolving charge—the stones that “bind oaths with starfire,” the trembling terrace, and the halted celestial dance all feed the ending. Setting is tightly integrated with action: the altar, braziers, and terrace aren’t postcard background but the apparatus and constraint of the ritual. The final image—stars resuming their waltz over “the flawed beauty of mended fractures”—clearly depends on this environment and its cosmology. Occasional lushness borders on decorative, but overall the specificity is purposeful and thematically tuned.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    The salt flat, cracked riverbeds, and thunder-laden sky are vividly rendered, with details like “crust gleaming like shattered porcelain” and “parched riverbed scars twisting across the flat” doing sustained heavy lifting. Environment is not merely decorative: the drought-born cracks form the literal map, the hollow offers seepage for the egg, and the storm’s onset transforms the setting into an active participant in closure (“waters seeking the map’s heart”). The huia’s former riparian habitat and the bone-white wasteland are thematically linked in a way that charges the final image. Description very slightly edges toward luxuriant repetition, but nearly every detail serves atmosphere and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    The silver courtyard under snow, the rune-etched benches, the loom of decrees, and the prismatic starlight create a vivid, coherent atmosphere. Setting is tightly woven into the action—the loom and snowlight literally enable the sanctuary and echo-work, rather than serving as mere backdrop. The environment mirrors the theme of conformity versus fracture without resorting to clumsy symbolism. It stops short of being fully constraining (Elara’s tactics don’t hinge on spatial or physical limits), which keeps it below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.0)
    The decommissioned radar dome and “meteor hush” give the story a vivid, unusual atmosphere, and the dome-as-forgotten-eye metaphor ties well to introspection. Environmental details (curve, concrete floor, apex, lantern) are selective and support mood rather than cluttering. The setting doesn’t significantly constrain his options—he could make the same decision in many quiet places—but it does charge the final image as he exits. The campfire stick functions as a micro-setting object with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “verdant grotto above the clouds,” with its moss-draped boulders, pink mists, and wind exposure, is not just pretty—it supplies vines, pedestal stones, altitude, and gusts that both enable and destroy the signal structures. Sensory specificity is rich and coherent, and the environment’s height and isolation mirror the theme of marginal, near-invisible histories. The wind’s role in loosening the knots and collapsing the tower at the climax ties setting directly into the story’s core cost. This is a strong example of setting charging both tactic and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    The icebound sanctum, aurora, and glacial architecture are vivid and specific, and they actively matter: the aurora is the energy source, the ice both preserves and threatens, the sanctum is a purpose-built ritual machine. Details like snowmelt and “warming stone that hadn't yielded in millennia” nicely mirror Elara’s emotional thaw. The environment constrains and enables the method rather than serving as mere backdrop. A touch less descriptive redundancy would push this into truly top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rewilded forest and vine-draped bunker are vivid, tactile, and tonally aligned with the story’s “ethereal grit” aesthetic, with strong image systems (vines, fungi, storm, sigils) threaded throughout. Setting is not mere backdrop: the bunker and pod concretely supply the means of contact with the directive, and the storm mirrors and times the internal climax. Environmental response at the end (vines parting, wildflowers along her trail) charges the final image with thematic weight. At times, density of description edges toward decorative, but it rarely harms clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.0)
    The reimagined Babylonian palace, bioluminescent vines, crystal-lattice dome, and magic square mosaic create a vivid, unified atmosphere closely filtered through an astronomer’s gaze. Setting details (tile, vines, dome) recur and charge the final image, with the palace becoming an active conduit. At times the descriptive density (“dusky,” “reimagined,” “bioluminescent”) verges on ornamental rather than constraint-driven, but coherence and specificity remain strong. The environment does influence meaning if not tightly constraining tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    The soundless sanctuary with shifting walls, floors, pillars, and star-tilted sky is vivid and tonally coherent, and the silence materially shapes tactics—violence “echoes nowhere,” pushing Elias to nonviolent, vibrational methods instead of direct confrontation. The music box functions as a tool-object embedded in this environment, its faint vibrations substituting for sound in a place where sound cannot carry. Environmental changes mirror internal states (reality warping more wildly as memories deepen, then stabilizing with Thorne’s release) without feeling like mere symbolism. The one limitation is that some images are gestural (e.g., vines, honey-thick air) rather than concretely used in choice-making.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ruined, fog-drowned orchard is vividly and consistently realized, with sensory detail across smell (decayed apples), touch (frost, mud), and sight (glass mountains, starlight) woven into action. Setting is strongly filtered through Elias’s craft and goal—mirrors, frost, fog, and branches all become tools or constraints in the ritual. The sextant and mirrors function as micro-setting objects that directly shape what he can do and charge the final image of a guarded, recaptured world. The environment feels indispensable to the story’s logic and mood rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    The orchard-in-the-rafters cathedral is vivid, specific, and consistently used: ropes, beams, sap-dripping fruit, and the storm-battered roof all shape movement and danger. The environment directly constrains action (climbing, almost-falls, falling beam) and charges the heart-tree apex and final fruit-glow image. World rules around quartz eyes and vows are shown rather than over-explained, maintaining a coherent, lived-in fantastical space. The setting’s organic imagery mirrors the relational regrowth without feeling purely ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    The astral orchard on a lonely asteroid and the meteor-glass bathroom are vivid, specific, and tonally integrated, with nice tactile touches (iridescent soil, porcelain sinks echoing with “cosmic drips”). Setting is strongly filtered through the surreal premise and supports the liminal/threshold theme. However, the environment rarely constrains options or tactics; it mainly supplies atmospheric metaphor rather than concrete pressures, so it charges the images more than the decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mountain-spanning bookstore, Verdant Stacks, Fractured Folios, and Whispering Warrens are vivid and specific, with magical flora and soundscapes that enrich atmosphere. Setting occasionally constrains tactics (moonlight runes against Echo-Lilies, sonic cages in the Warrens), giving the world more than postcard texture. The environment is strongly imagined but could bear more direct pressure—being “trapped in endless aisles” is told rather than an on-page threat. Overall, the world-building feels cohesive and tonally aligned with the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.3)
    The abandoned carnival ship in a foggy bay is richly evoked—the Ferris wheel, funhouse, carousel, ghost train, and big top all feel specific and contribute to atmosphere. Setting is not merely backdrop: the ropes strung across the ship, the attractions’ spatial layout, and the fog’s enclosing effect directly govern how Elara performs the ritual and signal the ship’s “trapped” condition. The final image of the ship fading back into fog after they enter the garden nicely recharges the opening. At times description tilts toward lyrical catalog rather than immediate constraint, keeping this just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    The clock tower mechanism room is vividly realized—the oiled gears, dust, frozen clock face, and ceremonial rope all feel specific and inhabited by Elara’s professional gaze. Crucially, the setting isn’t postcard dressing: the impossible time and the tower’s mechanism generate the door and supply the rope that enables the resolution, and the final image of the tower “chiming true once more” charges the ending. World rules about time, ritual, and architecture stay internally consistent and are learned through Elara’s action rather than infodump. A slight excess of atmospheric descriptors in the first third is the only real drag.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.3)
    The harmonic caves, frost-veined chamber, and ripple-marked ice are vivid, sensorial, and tightly fused to the protagonist’s vocation and tactics. Setting consistently shapes choices: she reads cracks as maps, uses the chamber’s ice as her interface, and the caves’ harmonic lattice defines what’s at stake. The echo chamber stone and bloom of hush both feel like natural outgrowths of this environment rather than bolted-on fantasy props. This is near top-tier scene-setting, slightly shy of 9-band only because the environment constrains less than it enables.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glass humming pavilion, etched walls, and storm-lashed tower are richly evoked and tightly integrated with action (star charts on glass floors, the skylight lens, the hum modulated by the shard of hush). Setting is never a postcard; it constrains tactics (she must climb the spiral core, use the skylight, live with the omnipresent hum) and charges the final image of the rekindled beacon. World rules—solar winds in glass, retrocognitive fragments, the post-collapse scape—remain internally consistent and are learned through use. This is near-elite scene-building, only shy of perfection because a few atmospheric details feel more ornamental than pressure-bearing.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is richly imagined: stormlit observatory, solidified fog-bridge, crystal forecourt, obsidian monuments, and whispering tiles all feel specific and sensorial. Details are consistently filtered through her role and stakes (tiles whisper memories, shadow lengths encode dilution vs. fidelity). Environment meaningfully shapes action—the fog-bridge enables and then limits the excursion, and rain’s residue amplifies whispers at the crucial middle beat. It stops short of 9+ because the landscape rarely constrains choices under acute pressure; it is gorgeous more than it is coercive.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is a major strength: the blooming fortress, luminous vines, iridescent mosaic, and starless sky are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Elias’s pyrotechnic sensibility. Environmental specifics matter—without the fortress walls and mosaic, there is no note to decode, and the starless night makes the false stars conceptually potent. The vines and blooms also respond to events (pulsing, nodding, blooming fiercer), tying atmosphere to stakes and closure. A slight bias toward visual imagery over other senses is present but does not materially weaken the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    The grotto, tidal pools, and unblinking stars are vividly and economically drawn, and they’re not just backdrop: the pools’ reflections and fragmentary “miniature cosmos” concretely enable Elaron’s tangential method. The environment directly shapes the central act (using skewed reflections) and charges the final image of pools “rippling approval under the stars.” Setting details remain consistent and thematically aligned (mirroring, refraction, shells, nacre) without feeling like a static postcard. The only limit is that the physical constraints of the grotto don’t materially alter options beyond mood and method, keeping this just shy of exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    The xenial trellis above the clouds and the hourly gravity inversion are vividly imagined and tightly integrated into action (waiting for inversion, accessing underside sprouts, vines mimicking bunker walls). Environmental details are filtered through Elara’s biases—openness vs enclosure—so worldbuilding never feels generic or touristic. The setting directly constrains choices and emotional beats (the hour limit, the claustrophobic snare in the vines) and charges the final image of descent. World rules (silence as sprout/essence, gravity’s rhythm) are consistent and learned through her tactics rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    The drifting prism terrace, gondolas, and refracting panes create a vivid, coherent environment that suffuses the story’s mood and feels specific to this world. Setting details—prisms, levitation engines, silken cables—are integrated with action and theme rather than dumped, and the micro-setting of gondola and storm glass serves as an atmospheric crucible. While the environment mostly supports tone rather than constraining choices in a tight, tactical way, the world rules stay consistent and the terrace’s perpetual drift underlines the “in transit” motif. The recurring play of light and hush also charges the final image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.3)
    The world-building is vivid and specific: holographic spires, undergrid tunnels, kaleidoscopic waterfall, hidden orchard with luminous fruit, and crystalline stairway all feel textured and memorable. Setting is not mere backdrop—it supplies key constraints and resources (the waterfall as concealment and barrier, the orchard as preserved past, the pavilion hiding the stairway). Details are well-filtered through Elara’s nostalgia and professional lens as a lore keeper, supporting both tone and theme. At times the imagery verges on over-rich, but clarity and spatial logic are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight” is vivid and consistent, and details like the smoldering coals and thinning threshold are integrated into action rather than sitting as backdrop. The environment meaningfully shapes the climax by enabling him to heat the ring, tying setting to choice. Atmosphere is strong and coherent, though the imagery leans on a relatively narrow band of ashen/starlight descriptors that could use a touch more sensory variation. Still, the closing image of the hush and starlight carries genuine weight.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm and “shadowseam” atmosphere are vividly and consistently rendered, with details like humid depths, mycelial networks, and prismatic halos integrated into action. The environment meaningfully enables the plot (farm core, pressure chamber, spore network for distributing diamonds). At times the descriptive density edges toward over-ornamentation, but spatial and conceptual rules remain legible. The recurring glow, spores, and cavern core help charge the final images rather than functioning as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sepia reading room, golden shadows, gramophone, and hearth are richly evoked and consistently filtered through Elias’s contemplative gaze. Setting elements aren’t just decorative: the room’s acoustics and physical layout (bookshelf, concealed panel, hearth) directly shape discovery and resolution. Sensory detail is dense but mostly purposeful, with the gramophone and shadows charging the final image. The lavish description skirts purple at times but never fully loses clarity or spatial logic.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly and consistently rendered—rusted gates, sigil-etched dome, dew as portals, fruits reacting to his words—and clearly integrated with the magic system. Environmental details evolve with the action (walls warping, trees twisting, fruits splitting into vapor and orbs), lending the atmosphere an active role in the climax. The setting also supports theme by fusing puppetry, alchemy, and possibility. However, the density of imagery occasionally tilts toward ornamental excess rather than strictly pressure-driven detail, which holds it just below elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Freedmen’s Bureau archive is vividly rendered—“aged paper and mildew,” “sagging shelves…like weary sentinels”—and firmly anchors time and place. Environmental details are filtered through Eleanor’s archivist sensibility, giving the room and its objects (dust, boxes, button) both tactile presence and thematic charge. The setting directly enables the central discovery through the dust patterns, though it seldom constrains her choices beyond that. Overall, the atmosphere is strong, specific, and coherent with the story’s aims.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific: rain-slick plaza, puddle reflections as map, the auric lagoon with bioluminescent reeds, and the half-submerged phone booth all create a strong, atmospheric world. These environmental elements are not mere backdrop; the puddle reflections and lagoon directly shape Elias’s route and the discovery of the cache. Sensory detail is largely visual and sonic but well-integrated with action and mood. The worldbuilding around StellarCom and revised histories is suggestive and consistent, though occasionally sketched in broad dystopian strokes rather than anchored in unique, lived-in particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    The radiant grotto, mist, prisms, and dewdrops are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the action—light and water refract sound, dewdrops vibrate to the prophecy, and later “wash away ethereal script.” The atrium’s geometry and optical properties matter to how his music and silence function, and the final dew-prism glint meaningfully charges the last image. Sensory detail is rich and consistent, if occasionally verging on saturation. The environment shapes mood and ritual more than hard physical constraint, but it still deeply charges the story’s core moves.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “ashen skyborne arbor” is vivid, peculiar, and consistently evoked through moss, ash, floating boughs, and seed-work, giving the piece a strong atmospheric identity. Details are filtered through Lir’s occupational lens (seeds, monuments, leaves-as-messages), which grounds the lyricism. The setting does shape the conceptual stakes (fading arbor, ash depths) but less often constrains tactically what can or cannot be done in a given moment. Even so, world rules feel coherent and the environment charges the premise and final image in a memorable way.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: mist, roar, quartz tools, vines, neglected greenhouse, and ash-covered geothermal remnants all feel textured and lived-in. Environment reliably shapes options—waterfall hides the ledge, vines enable climbing, swirling leaves impede vision, soot and ashes conceal the chest. Details are filtered through Elias’s craft-minded perspective, with tools and mechanisms featured over generic scenery. The final image of the subterranean waterfall as “timeless witness” nicely charges the setting with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rain-washed foundry, forge-heart, anvil, and cracked crucible are vivid, specific, and consistently threaded through action rather than static description. Tools and objects (foundry, crucible, coin) function as a micro-setting that directly participates in the ritual and final image. Weather and space shape mood more than tactics, but the environment does constrain the scene into an isolated, echoing workshop where this act can occur. The consistent mirroring of internal states through environmental detail feels controlled rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Echo Gorge is vividly rendered with mist, echoes, and vertical geography that actively shape the action (amplified confessions, distant cliff, slick rocks). The tooth and harp function as tools embedded in the environment, and the gorge’s acoustics are integral to Elara’s method and the soul’s distress. The final image of the gorge whispering farewell closes the loop and charges the setting with memory and thematic weight. A slight overreliance on similar “luminous ache” imagery keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ultraviolet forest is vividly rendered and tightly linked to Elara’s altered perception, with the glowing roots and canopy patterns mirroring neural and mathematical structures. Environmental details are consistently filtered through her enhanced proprioception and UV sensitivity, avoiding white-room syndrome entirely. The forest meaningfully charges the final image—“Rooted yet free”—and the idea of the world “computing her release.” However, the setting mostly mirrors and frames rather than constrains her tactical options, so its influence is thematic rather than fully operative.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    The alchemist’s market above the rooftops is vividly and specifically rendered—“vaporous lanterns,” “jeweled spiderwebs,” aerial walkways—and the paintings, stalls, and mist are tightly woven into the action. The lighthouse fragment functions as a recurring object-as-setting that charges the final image when its projections flood the market. World rules feel internally consistent, learned through her use of the lens rather than exposition dumps. Overall, atmosphere is rich and purposeful, supporting both tone and theme without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.3)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly evoked (mildew, “distant popcorn dreams,” peeling clown mural) and tightly bound to the history of the ghosts and the mechanism in the ceiling. Setting details are not decorative; dust patterns, the grate, the mural, and the physical confines of the office all direct Theo’s attention and tactics. The horological debris and circus emblems further integrate environment with plot and theme. The space feels coherent and specific without over-description, supporting tone and action throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glass orchard library and sea of clouds are vividly rendered and recur as active constraints: a floating, crystalline architecture that can list, shatter, and fall, making the rupture’s consequences concrete. Details like “crystalline branches,” “glass fruits,” and frost-filigreed leaves are strongly filtered through Elias’s sensibility. The environment tangibly participates in the climax as shelves tilt and panes rain into the clouds, charging the final image. Description is dense but purposeful, rarely feeling like a static postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    The baroque asteroid, visible time-rivers, and mirror gallery are vividly and consistently realized, with detail tightly filtered through Elias’s melancholic, aesthetic gaze. Environment matters: the temporal storm and mirror lore literally shape his method of ingress and the manner of the shard’s destruction, charging the final image of “shards in glass” thematically and physically. World rules around visible time and reflective surfaces stay coherent and are learned through action rather than infodump. The density of ornament skirts excess but remains purposeful more often than not.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    The resonance chamber, crystal walls, soul-spring, and crystal flower are vivid and specific, and they’re consistently filtered through Elias’s tinkering perspective. Crucially, environment and tools (resonance spider silk, vibrating walls, covenant-etched brass) constrain what he can do and directly charge the final image of the music box singing dawn back into the world. World rules (rust as truth enforcement, the flower’s reaction) are clear and stable. Occasional density verges on ornamental, but setting mostly works both as atmosphere and as functional machinery.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting work is vivid and sensorially rich: rusting vats, limestone fissures, mineral “tears,” bioluminescent algae, and the lagoon’s metallic tang all feel concrete and filtered through Elara’s scent-obsessed lens. Environment and recurring objects (compass, hinges, petrichor vials) meaningfully charge the final images and her vocation. The subterranean geography is coherent enough to stage the journey and climax, and the weather/storm scents frame her transitions nicely. At times, density of atmosphere risks redundancy, but it still strongly supports tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    The coastal cliff, storm-tossed archway, and driftwood are vividly rendered and tightly woven into action and theme: the arch mirrors her sculpture, offers shelter, and becomes the nexus/portal. Weather and sea clearly shape her options, from the GPS failure to needing physical cover and raw materials. Recurring images (turbine-hum, foam, driftwood, lantern light) build a strong atmosphere that supports the lyrical mode. Occasionally, the density of description verges on ornamental, but clarity and functional integration mostly hold.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is a major strength: the amber pavilion and the cathedral interior are richly rendered and tightly filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The autumnal light, snowmelt, and stained glass aren’t just decoration—they mirror and charge her internal process and the final realization. Environmental details (amber glow, ink-black sky, meltwater, etched glass) recur and evolve, culminating in a final image where pavilion and window fuse thematically. The only restraint on a higher score is that the environment shapes mood and meaning more than concrete tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.3)
    The environments—the floating library, fractured earth, dune seas, and obsidian lagoon—are vivid, specific, and thematically integrated, with strong sensory choices like “sands parted like reluctant flesh” and “obsidian lagoon” anchoring atmosphere. The world’s rules (zeppelin overlords, sacred lagoon as resistance heart) feel internally consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition dumps. The settings more strongly charge meaning and mood than they constrain choices tactically, but they do color what’s possible (e.g., aerial bombardment, secret basin gatherings) and charge the final image of the zeppelin’s shadow. A touch less ornamental metaphor and a bit more concrete constraint in key decisions would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and specific—“tattered paper lanterns,” “kelp-woven scaffolds,” “memory-infused crystal” all feel particular to this place and filtered through the premise. The harbor’s physical transformation underpins the story’s central turn from void to living town. That said, the environment rarely constrains Elias’s choices; it’s more a canvas for his will than an active pressure. Even so, atmosphere and worldbuilding are strong enough to carry this category into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    The orchard atop the skyscraper, the basin of rainwater, and the city below are vividly rendered and filtered through Elias’s sensibility, creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. The environment is not just decorative: the “orchards of steel” in the prophecy and the final image of city lights as “trapped emotions” clearly reweight the setting. Physical interaction with the space (dew-kissed water, mossy undergrowth, ancient trees) grounds the otherwise abstract premise. A minor tightening of descriptive density in one or two spots would keep atmosphere from edging toward ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    The icebound atrium under starlight is vivid and specific, with glass dome, frost-laced arches, and preserved seeds all integrated into action. Setting actively matters: starlight is focused through the dome into the acorn cap, ice preserves seeds and then thaws as a sign of success, and the oak heart-tree and its relic cap directly constrain tactics. World rules around order vs. entropy are mostly learned through what she does, not exposition dumps, maintaining coherence. A slight excess of abstract cosmological language (“disorder molecules”) is the only thing keeping this just below the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    The windblown sanctuary above clouds, frost-rimed platform, and bell at the aerie’s heart create a vivid, coherent environment that feels lived-in. Weather and altitude matter to action (climbing daily, wind tugging cloak, sound carrying down to villages). The bell rope, switch, and instruments function as tools within that space, not just decor. The final image of the sanctuary whispering on above the clouds demonstrates the setting’s role in charging the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.3)
    The asteroid-bound shooting star station and observatory dome are strongly evoked, with tactile details like “domes etched with primordial frost” and “cosmic lint” grounding the cosmic lyricism. The yellow lantern glass and dome together form a convincing micro-setting that shapes action, especially as the glass is positioned at the apex and becomes the medium for transformation. The environment consistently mirrors and supports Elias’s interior state of solitary stillness. It stops just short of constraining concrete options, but it richly charges the mood and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: scorched wasteland, dead hives, irrigation channels, and the oasis are not just backdrop but the core stakes of the covenant and its renewal. The stained glass box, hives, and light through glass charge the final images and concretely embody the world’s rules. Environmental details (parched channels weeping dew, withered hives quivering) evolve in step with the ritual, tying atmosphere directly to consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    The emerald silo, fungal iridescence, and grain-dusted depths create a vivid, coherent micro-world that feels lived-in and strange. Setting details are integrated with action—the descent, the undercroft, the capsule’s warped air—and the silo itself becomes a beacon at the end. The world rules around the Shift (numbers, clocks, calendars) are consistent and filtered through Elias’s professional bias as a timekeeper. The environment directly charges the final image (the emerald silo as nexus for time-weavers), satisfying the object-as-setting criterion for high-band scores.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lagoon after rain, with its cobalt water, petrichor, and shifting light, is vivid and persistent, and environmental specifics (wind, damp sand, water that soddens the kite, grass and sap for mending) directly shape action. The recurring objects—the kite and feather—are tightly bound to the setting and charge the final image. Sensory detail is rich and coherently filtered through a contemplative, aestheticizing gaze. There is some density bordering on excess, but it remains controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    The temple orchard with living stone pillars, quartz veins, and copper-laced oaks is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through a caretaker’s professional gaze. Environmental elements (pillars, roots, quartz, copper) are not just scenery but the mechanism of the remodel and the medium for interspecies communication, directly charging the final humming lattice image. Details like shipwreck copper and fossilized wires in pillar fissures deepen the world’s logic without bogging it down. The setting could constrain choice even more sharply under stress, but what’s on the page is rich and integral.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is rich, specific, and consistently filtered through Elara: “bronze quiet spring,” rainwashed stones, overgrown sculpture path, and the tower’s humming glyphs all reinforce tone and theme. Environmental details aren’t postcard-only; the sculpture path and footprints are the literal route of the pilgrimage, and the tower becomes an almost sentient witness in the final image. The fly amber functions as a micro-setting object whose properties directly constrain events. Weather and season subtly shape mood and pace rather than remaining generic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the dead reef, exposed battlefields, and the blooming jetty with bioluminescent flowers all feel textured and coherent. Environment constrains and enables action: the reef’s collapse exposes the field, subterranean springs feed the flowers, and specific soil fault lines guide where he can meaningfully sow. The recurring jetty and battlefield imagery directly charge the final image of green reclamation, satisfying the “setting as pressure” test. Occasionally the description edges toward lush excess, but clarity and atmospheric control remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    The scrapyard settlement and cracked wasteland are vividly, consistently rendered, with details like catwalks over rifts and fuselage shacks integrated into action rather than feeling like backdrop. Environmental constraints (abyssal rifts, rad-scorched desolation) both justify separation and shape the journey and reunion imagery. The recurring leaf functions almost as micro-setting, charging the final image. A touch more tactile interaction with the hostile environment during the trek could push this to a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.8)
    The time dilation observation deck and temporally stretched starfield are vividly evoked—trailing stars, echoed silence, microgravity hum—and filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Setting meaningfully shapes events: the dilation field both masks and reveals the rift, and the window/viewport functions as the physical threshold she must cross. The recurring compass rose operates as a micro-setting/tool that charges several moments, especially the rift’s discovery and the leap. Some sensory variety beyond sight and vague “hum” would deepen immersion further, but what’s here is purposeful and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    The icebound spire, backward stars, bioluminescent ice, and floating Chessboard are vividly specific and integrated into action rather than feeling like a static backdrop. Environmental features constrain choices (climbing sheer ice, enchanted frost, the pedestal and pieces) and thematically echo cosmic imbalance. The pocket sundial as a micro-setting object that captures “true noon” nicely charges both tactics and final resonance. Some description edges toward ornate for the length, but overall atmosphere and worldbuilding are strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    The whispering gallery and palace are vividly realized and deeply integrated: acoustics, dome, oculus, and marble dust all matter to how the ritual works and how the penumbra is trapped. The pawnless chessboard, oculus light, and empty halls recur in ways that charge the final image rather than feel like set-dressing. World rules (poisoned winds, sabotaged spires, luminous absence) are consistent enough to support the surrealism. The environment actively shapes the scene’s tactics and resonance, not just its mood.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mountain-spanning bookstore is vivid and specific (“shelves twisted like petrified roots,” geothermal core, upper shelves with oblivious buyers), and the setting clearly shapes Elara’s journey inward toward the “core” where the final glyph waits. The environment is not just backdrop: the labyrinth form rhymes with her inner search and becomes literally redefined as “home” at the end, charging the final image. The lost valley glimpses as stone-induced overlays further entwine setting with theme. A slight excess of atmospheric description in places risks softening the sense of concrete spatial stakes but does not harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: “cobblestones slick with unfallen rain,” frozen villagers, and the hall with its platinum labyrinth tapestry all feel tactile and mood-charged. Environment and object function as micro-setting constraints—time-freeze and hush create a liminal window, while the tapestry is a literal space he navigates mentally. The recurring pawn as handled object and the platinum labyrinth strongly charge the final image (pawn promotion; mental traversal). A slight excess of ornate modifiers occasionally verges on touristic description but rarely stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bone canyon, endless echoes, marrow pools, and the pale spire are richly and consistently rendered, and they all feel specific to this story’s logic. Environment meaningfully shapes action: echoes carry poetry as subversive contagion, bone towers provide alcoves and chambers, and the spire’s light/mist literally and thematically frames the rebellion. The final image—bone towers as sentinels of a new “symphony of doubt”—recharges earlier description with thematic weight. A slight risk of over-description exists, but it mostly stays purposeful and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop on an acid sea is vivid, tactile, and constantly relevant: corrosion, flooding, and failing machinery all shape what’s possible. The statue, key charm, and crystal core function as charged objects that constrain action and heavily charge the final image. World rules (acid, steam, kintsugi-like magic) feel internally consistent and are learned through his struggle rather than exposition. Occasional density of metaphor skirts excess, but the setting is a genuine strength that meaningfully presses on the story.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is vivid, tactile, and thematically tied: the quay, cave network, and hidden oasis all mirror states of memory, erosion, and suspended time. The environment constrains and shapes action—the cave network allows for the wrong turn, the oasis spring is used as paint medium, and the lagoon becomes projection screen and reliquary for the shell. Sensory detail is rich without losing spatial clarity, and the final image of the shell left by the pool is charged by everything we’ve learned about the place. A touch less scenic ornament in earlier paragraphs might sharpen urgency, but atmosphere is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cobalt lighthouse, jagged rocks, mist, and hidden night garden are sensorially rich and tightly woven into action, not just painted as backdrop. The environment meaningfully shapes tactics—the height and exposure to dawn winds allow the scented “vibrations of intent” to travel, and the lighthouse’s beam igniting at the end charges the final image. Weather and time (heat wave breaking into cool mist) mirror the emotional shift without feeling like crude symbolism. A slight surplus of lush detail occasionally edges toward decorative, but overall the setting is vivid, specific, and thematically integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    The signal station, black sea, moonlight, and salvaged machinery create a textured, coherent environment that’s used rather than merely admired. Setting details directly shape tactics—he scavenges from the wrecked hydraulics, uses driftwood ribs, climbs the tower, and positions the censer as a brazier at the summit. The recurring censer foot functions as a charged object-as-setting, literally mounted in the environment and driving the final image. This atmosphere is rich and purposeful, though occasionally it edges toward lushness that nearly outpaces immediate urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    The hanging orchard in a storm-battered ravine is vivid and specific, with storms, suspended aeries, and truffle-rich chaotic soil establishing a charged, atmospheric micro-world. Environmental details are not just decorative: rainwater is used for sterilization, the precarious branches host the community, and the storms mirror and pressure the fragile social fabric. The professional detail around foraging and sensors further grounds the setting in Elias’s perception. While the orchard doesn’t tightly constrain the key moral choice, it meaningfully charges the imagery and tone of the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting work is vivid and purposeful: the opal dock, mist, bruise-purple sky, and lighthouse interior all feel tactile and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility. Environment actively shapes events—the mist hides the body and swallows the splash, the dock catches and preserves the boutonnière, and the tower’s isolation amplifies his investigation. Recurring environmental elements (dock, mist, light) return at the ending to charge the final image of Elias standing sentinel under a newly reweighted understanding. A slight tendency toward decorative metaphor density keeps this just shy of the very top band, but the world feels fully coherent and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is richly imagined and specific, from the “cluttered” map shop to the geothermal “blooming cavern” with bioluminescent moss and midsummer flora. Environmental elements meaningfully shape choice: the seasonal bloom window motivates his timing, the physical fissures and roots constrain his path, and the rising creek pressures his pace. Details are filtered through his cartographer’s eye (contours, anomalies, logs), giving the world a lived, profession-shaped texture. The only drawback is occasional descriptive density that feels more like ornament than pressure, but it rarely stalls clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is a major strength: the ridge, clouds, cobalt grotto, ember-veined walls, and starlit pools are sensuously and consistently rendered. Environmental danger (the heights, the grotto’s “lacy menace” and noose-like threads) and magical architecture (bleeding starlight into pools) actively shape what’s possible and how the climax unfolds. The high-altitude isolation and suspended cavern above clouds charge the final image of a queen returning changed while the grotto “watches silently.” A bit of metaphor density edges toward over-ornamentation, but spatial and atmospheric anchors remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “ember nexus at twilight,” pocket-sun, and abyssal nautilus shell create a vivid, consistent micro-cosmos with strong sensory and conceptual specificity. Setting functions as more than backdrop: the nexus amplifies presence, twilight frames liminality, and the shell and pocket-sun are tools that actively shape the ritual and final image. Details are filtered through Lirien’s alchemical sensibility, keeping the world cohesive rather than touristic. The atmosphere is lush and immersive, though at times the density of imagery risks edging into sameness rather than evolving pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cabin, Blackthorn Peak, and the mountain atmosphere are rendered with strong, selective detail (“creaky bunk,” “broken teeth in the moon's indifferent grin”) that filter clearly through Elara’s sensibility. The birch bark scroll functions as a charged object that travels from cabin to sky and back, anchoring the dreamwork to a tactile medium and charging the final image. Setting evolves with action—the roof splintering, the cabin shrinking to a matchstick, the ambiguous “ruins, or were they whole?”—to mirror and complicate her temporal confusion. While the “mountain ranger” specificity doesn’t strongly constrain choices, the wild, isolated environment is integral to tone and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the fog, the small shop, the brass clepsydra, and even condensation on Elara’s spectacles all filter through her sensory limitations and craft, grounding atmosphere in character. The water clock functions as both tool and micro-setting, its physical innards enabling the discovery of the screw and the imaginative reconstruction of Miriam’s crisis. Weather and environment matter thematically and structurally (the foggy morning mirroring Miriam’s fog-shrouded dawn and lifting at the end). Detail density is high but generally well-chosen, with only minor flirtations with over-description.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating rock tea platform, matcha ritual, and surrounding storm-wall atmosphere are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elara’s focus and fear. The environment meaningfully shapes options: the literal breath between storms and the suspended platform’s runes constrain time and action, and the storm’s restart at exhale charges the final cadence. Tools and micro-setting details (brazier, teapot, moss edges, underbelly runes) are integrated into both magic and mood rather than feeling touristic. This is publishable-level atmosphere with only minor risk of sensory overload.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sheet music archive, the decaying conservatory wing, and the threatened orchard are rendered with rich, specific detail that feels lived-in and tonally coherent. Setting is not mere backdrop: dry paper fuels the ghostly currents, the player piano’s exposed copper carries the magic, and the orchard’s impending felling charges both Theo’s appearance and the final image. The environment consistently mirrors and pressures the emotional stakes. A slight reduction in descriptive density might sharpen rather than blur some images, but the integration of setting with theme and action is outstanding.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ancient temple library is vividly and repeatedly rendered—spiral staircase, crystal scroll chambers, whispering papyrus, star-mapped marble—and it meaningfully frames his movement and the spiral motif. Setting is well integrated with action (journeying outward through aisles as he goes inward), though it rarely constrains choice in a concrete way. The spatial logic is consistent and easy to visualize. The final image of the library as “timeless anchor” reweights the earlier atmosphere effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    The fjord station, hydraulic clocks, and stone tower are vivid and integral; the “fjord quiet,” cliff, cisterns, and water-driven mechanisms infuse nearly every beat. Setting directly shapes the premise (fjord meltwater warping the clocks) and the stakes (horizons for ships, distorted by subtle currents). Environmental details are filtered through Elias’s professional eye, giving the world a lived-in, technical feel without infodump. The final image of him on the observation deck in that same hush is meaningfully charged by all that came before.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vivid, sensorially rich, and tightly filtered through Mira’s technical and aesthetic gaze. Crucially, the environment is not just pretty: spores physically alter the laser’s path and conceptually model permeability and “letting go,” so the setting constrains and inspires her breakthrough. Details like the “permeable veil,” “caps pulsing soft blues and greens,” and birdsong as a temporal boundary charge both the middle experiment and the final emergence. A touch more evolution of the space under pressure could push this toward truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is vivid and thematically integrated: rain, stone facade, crushed clover, and the “midsummer library” create an atmosphere that mirrors her clover-tinged grief. The subway, tunnels, and abandoned station are concrete and functional, not touristic, and the lantern as a handled object charges both traversal and the final image. The hidden wing and secret archive plausibly extend the library’s geography into metaphor without losing spatial coherence. Environment and recurring objects meaningfully color and constrain her journey, especially the subterranean search contrasted with the washed, open dusk.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    The subway utility tunnel and sealed-off booth are vividly rendered—“dripping pipes,” “perpetual damp,” streetlamp hums bleeding through concrete—and they tonally reinforce his role as an exile under the city. The glass harmonica, lamps, and tunnel become a cohesive micro-world rather than a generic backdrop. The environment does constrain who he is and what kind of connections he can form, even if it doesn’t dictate moment-to-moment tactics in the conflict. The final image of him polishing the disc as the streetlamps hum again is charged by all the prior atmospheric groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    The blooming jetty at twilight, spectral flowers, seawater, walnut husks, and moonrise are vividly rendered and tightly integrated into the ritual’s mechanics. Setting is not mere backdrop: the flowers awaken only at this liminal time, their petals store echoes of past moments, and the jetty’s environment literally supplies the ingredients and the stakes for the steep. The environment also charges the closing image (flowers dimming, sea sighing, locket warm), reweighting the space as a living archive rather than a postcard vista. A slight excess of lush description risks redundancy, but it remains purposeful rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.2)
    The disused, ivy-overgrown station is vivid and consistently present—the bicycle through the “ivy curtain,” tracks hosting barters, dawn light piercing arches, ivy “rustling approval.” Setting and object-world (cats, lantern light, ghost-train rumor) create a strong, coherent atmosphere that matches the story’s slightly fey social experiment. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain tactics, it clearly shapes the community’s form (anarchic gatherings on abandoned tracks) and charges the final image. Detail is selective and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ultrasonic forest is vividly and inventively rendered, with non-visual sensory detail (vibrations, languages through touch, ultrasonic notes) strongly filtered through Elar’s perception. The environment meaningfully shapes his movement via the dowsed harmonies and braille-like musical notes, and culminates in the crystalline pool at the stillpoint. The ring and forest together function as a micro-setting system that guides, rather than merely decorates, the experience. While the forest does not impose harsh physical constraints, its rules remain consistent and thematically apt.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    The gravitational anomaly, floating gardens, and drifting hardware are vivid and consistently filtered through Elara’s technical and emotional lens. The environment constrains movement (objects drifting, deceptive gravity) and responds causally to her edits, so setting is not mere backdrop but an active barometer of change. The pen, gardens, and anomaly together function as a micro-setting that strongly charges the final image of a lingering, tamed disturbance. A slight overabundance of ornamental cosmic metaphors keeps it shy of the very top band, but the atmosphere is distinctive and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.0)
    The luminous harbor and moonlight are vividly drawn and recur in ways that matter—waves as source of rhythm, quiet corners as mapped silences, final harmony grounded in that environment. The contrast between harbor stillness and festival noise gives the setting real atmospheric and thematic weight rather than postcard description. The camera and the harbor together charge the ending image of a “harmonious quiet” that feels earned. A touch more tactile interaction with the physical space under crowd pressure could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archive is vividly evoked—dust-choked chambers, murals, rubble, humid stairwell, scent of aged wool—and tightly entwined with the puzzle mechanics. Environmental features meaningfully guide action (the figurine’s arrow, mural cracks, hidden panel, vault) rather than serving as static backdrop. Sensory detail leans visual but occasional tactile/olfactory notes keep it from feeling like a “tour.” While some phrases are generic (“vast chambers”), overall specificity and integration with plot and emotion are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “sound wave garden,” echoing grass, auric lagoon, and petals that bloom with memories are vivid, specific, and consistently integrated into action rather than feeling like backdrop. Environmental rules (vibrations altering petals, water as a medium for entanglement reversal and transit) are stable enough to be intuitively grasped and they materially shape tactics. The setting also mirrors the emotional tenor—auroral sorrow and harmonic chaos—without slipping into overt allegory. A bit more tactile or non-visual grounding under peak stress could deepen immersion, but as-is this is strong, distinctive world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    The container labyrinth and storm are rendered with strong, selective specificity—“steel canyon,” groaning stacks, auroral sky, spinning compasses—and they meaningfully constrain options (no GPS, distorted shouts, whispers hugging walls). Details filter through Elias’s workmanlike, pattern-focused attention (origami folds, crane marks, walk signatures), which keeps the world from feeling like a tourist catalog. The Heart container and zodiac wheel are concrete enough that the climactic unlocking reads as a physical action in a charged micro-setting. A small drawback is that the port-city context beyond the maze remains more atmospheric haze than lived civic environment.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “cobalt dock after rain,” puddles mirroring stars, boathouse, shutters, and canal surface are all vividly rendered and deeply integrated into the central action. The environment is not backdrop; it’s the literal canvas and mechanism for Elara’s weaving and the transformation of Umbra. Weather and water conditions (slick planks, reflective puddles, still canal) materially shape the imagery and the magic, and the final image of puddles holding perfect stellar reflections powerfully charges closure. This is high-level atmosphere and micro-setting work.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cobalt library, mist, magnetic grotto, and glass dome give the piece a strong, cohesive atmosphere; details like lodestone veins tugging metal pieces and lampposts bending faintly toward the rook feel specific and alive. Setting isn’t mere backdrop—it enables the synchronizing mechanism and charges the final image of quiet, magnetized change. At times the imagery verges on lush for its own sake, but it largely remains purposeful and filtered through Elias’s chess- and thought-focused worldview. The environment meaningfully colors and slightly constrains tactics, though it could pinch choices even more sharply to push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    The maritime setting is vivid and sensorially rich—“sublittoral fringe,” bioluminescent waves, barnacled hulls—all filtered through Elara’s dock-worker life. Environment and objects matter tactically: docks vs open water, mooring rope, skiff, and glowing scrimshaw all shape what they can do. The whale’s call and the shimmering island strongly charge the final movement. At times description edges toward lushness for its own sake, but it mostly reinforces atmosphere and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    The farmhouse under giant turbines is vivid and specific, with the “remade hush” of their drone strongly inflecting atmosphere and echoing the protagonist’s inner numbness. Environmental details (shadows across the porch, groaning blades, distant mirror farmhouse) are well-filtered through mood rather than touristic. The turbines and kitchen table form an effective micro-setting that charges the final image of her talisman in the drone-filled dark. If the physical environment constrained her choices more concretely rather than primarily symbolically, this could reach a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integral: the cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and humming quartz colonnade do real narrative work rather than functioning as backdrop. Environmental details evolve with the action—the quartz changes state, the lake cracks and thaws, steam rises—so the world’s response tracks the ritual. The closing image of the lake as a mirror and the softened hum of the colonnade shows the environment reconfigured by the poet’s choices. This degree of integration and atmosphere is close to publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glassblower’s courtyard, twisted spires, furnace, and plant beds are vivid, specific, and consistently integrated into action (the spire as stair, the plants as language, the quenching trough as Mira’s resting place). The environment actively constrains and enables choices; Elias’s climb on fused shards and his reliance on courtyard flora are good examples. The phoenix’s perch and its ember-breath visually charge the final awakening image. Description flirts with density but remains purposeful and strongly atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    The laboratory of lost sounds is vividly realized through specific, recurring elements: vaulted ceilings, prismatic bells, resonant chambers, the Resonance Orb, Nexus Spire, etc. Details are consistently filtered through Elowen’s sonic priorities, and the environment is not just backdrop but mechanism for transformation. The carbide lens and the architecture of chambers genuinely constrain and enable her actions and discoveries, and the setting directly charges the final image. A small deduction comes from occasional density of description that flirts with over-opulence but rarely stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    The observatory is vividly particular—obsidian domes, brass telescopes, whispering orreries, and the curtains of intention all feel integral rather than decorative. Environmental features directly shape tactics (lantern to light curtains, coordinates on cranes placed on instruments), so setting is not just backdrop. The tonal atmosphere (timeless, humming, half-faded stars) strongly mirrors Elara’s internal state. At times the density of imagery edges toward lushness for the scene’s pace, but clarity holds.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft, the onyx ink, the obsidian, and the measuring tape all create a vivid, coherent micro-setting that is tightly interwoven with the action. Details like the rain, the crumbling warehouse district, and the shadowed alcoves reinforce tone and Elara’s seclusion without feeling like a static “tour.” The space and tools are actively used—cards laid out, tape stretched, ink shimmering—to make choices legible and charge the final image of the loft holding its breath. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, but it clearly shapes mood and the ritualistic logic of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archive and pagoda are richly, specifically rendered (bioluminescent fungi, fractured obelisks, bronze facets) and always filtered through Elara’s obsessions. Setting constrains action: the archive’s scale and her historian role set up her attachment to pattern, while the pagoda’s rules force her into “steadily unpredictable” behavior. The final image—pagoda refracting “one last rainbow of lost worlds” as she emerges transformed—charges the environment with thematic weight. A slight excess of descriptive density risks momentary overload but does not confuse spatially.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “blooming library above the clouds” is vivid and consistently rendered—crystal panes, luminous orbs, thin air, petals of memory—and the river stone functions as a micro-setting object that meaningfully constrains choices. The environment supports theme and tone (lofty, ethereal, fragile) and charges the final image of Elara’s altered state and the cracked stone. While the library doesn’t physically obstruct or redirect tactics, its altitude, dream-orb architecture, and atmospheric dusk all infuse the action with specificity and consequence. Description remains purposeful rather than touristic, firmly avoiding white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    The misty, star-lit workshop and specific fauna/objects (benches, feathers, jars, mossy branch) are vivid and consistently filtered through Elara’s gaze. Setting and atmosphere mirror her emotional state without feeling like a bare symbol—fog, starlight, and mist echo uncertainty and fragile renewal. The recurring tail tip and chameleon within this space anchor the final image and closure effectively. Environment doesn’t strongly constrain her options, but it does meaningfully charge the tone and thematic imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    The tower, dawn light, and “meteor hush” form a strong, coherent atmosphere that’s threaded through the story and re-evoked at the end. Objects-as-setting—the hourglass, ivy, coffee cup, floor stone—are used in tactile ways that affect action (prying up the stone, guiding tunneling, charging the final image). The environment feels lived-in and thematically aligned with quiet, subterranean revelation. It stops short of absolute top tier because the physical constraints of the tower and earth never seriously impede her or force alternative tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Orpheum’s projection booth is richly realized—gears, cobwebs, stained glass, thunder—and consistently filtered through Elara’s spatial and psychic sensibility. Crucially, the setting constrains action: the hidden panel, ducts, and take-up reel location directly enable the core discovery. The booth-as-architecture becomes thematically charged at the end as the true “storage” of unused love, satisfying the object-as-setting gate. A slight excess of descriptive flourish in places is the only thing keeping this from an elite-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    The aurora-lit archway, frozen tundra, and astrolabe create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that anchors the lyricism. Setting details are selectively chosen and in character—auroras as “silent symphonies,” ice as a pedestal—and they evolve with the action rather than sitting as backdrop. The archway and auroras meaningfully constrain choice (this is the only place the ritual works) and return in the charged final image. Occasional descriptive redundancy and emphasis on visual over other senses keep it slightly short of peak.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    The glowing dune, blooms, silica veins, and post-burn world are vividly and consistently rendered, with strong sensory and imagistic specificity. The setting isn’t just backdrop: the dune “responds,” blooms open to cradle sparks, and the final image of petals closing around the clock charges the ending. World rules around the archive and dunes remain abstract but internally consistent for this lyric frame. It’s atmospheric and thematically aligned, even if concrete physical constraints on choice are soft.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mechanical rainforest is richly imagined and specific—oakron, baobabron, willowire, maplesprocket, corewheel—and those details are consistently filtered through Elias’s awakened perception. Environment is not postcard: it actively shapes options (ferncoil bridging the chasm, wind-songs acting as information channels, the corewheel physically climbed and unraveled). The recurring forest machinery charges the final image as the rainforest “sighs in approval,” tying his inner change to a living world-logic. A slight risk of over-naming is present, but most coined flora earn their keep by contributing to mood and method.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    The coastal ridgeway, fog, sea, and tidal pool are vivid and recurrent, and the “veiled” and “seafoam” imagery sustains a coherent atmosphere. The setting does shape the narrative somewhat—the ridgeway as liminal space, the overlook and secluded pool as the only place courage can be found. However, many details remain at a generalized, lyrical level rather than tactically specific, and the environment rarely constrains concrete choices beyond “keep going through fog and brambles.” The final image of the star-ignited pool is strong and charged by place.

    The cobalt fortress under snow is vivid and specific (“blue spires piercing an endless white shroud”), and details like the spiral staircase, iced slits, and antique piano are integrated into action rather than postcard description. The environment materially shapes events: isolation under snow makes the fortress a morally charged refuge, and the dusty staircase physically hides the bolt that triggers the turn. Snow and cold also echo the numbness/regeneration motif, tying body and place. The setting therefore both grounds the piece and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ancient, time-suspended temple library is vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the premise: Lirion’s inability to leave and the drifting constellations justify his indirect, textual method of influence. Details like iron gall ink, vellum, and towering shelves feel specific and lived-in, and they matter to tactics rather than being mere ornament. The paused-then-resuming stars subtly mirror the stasis and later release of truth into the world, charging the final image of constellations resuming their dance. Environment clearly constrains choices and inflects the ending, meeting the high-band test for setting.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    The sea level monitoring station, buoy field, and bleached reefs are vividly realized and filtered through a specialist’s eye, with economical but concrete details (rusted railing, solar panels humming, corroded holodisks). The environment constrains what’s possible—isolated, dependent on salvaged tech, surrounded by the very ocean he’s studying—and the moored-drifting physical state mirrors his psychological state. The atlas page and holographic map function as micro-settings that evolve meaningfully. A slightly broader sensory range beyond sight and sound could deepen atmosphere further, but what’s here is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.3)
    The spaceport repair bay and stone circle are vividly rendered and tightly integrated into action—the ferrocrete under her bare feet, rusted shuttles, fractured dome, and humming monoliths all matter to how she perceives and acts. Setting supports tone (ruin + latent power) and directly shapes the climax, since the circle’s placement in this forgotten bay enables secret activation away from the Corporate Veil. Details are filtered through Elara’s stargazer bias and the twilight sky, charging the final image of her walking out with the bay “thundering” behind her. A slight surplus of descriptive flourish keeps it just shy of top-tier economy.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    The volcanic hot springs, obsidian, steam, scaffolding, and triple moons create a strong, specific atmosphere that feels integral rather than decorative. Setting directly shapes tactics (telepathy via mutagenic vapors, need for the hottest spring, geothermal energy channeled by roots) and charges the final image of a glowing grove in the Caldera. Details are consistently filtered through Mira’s relationship to the land and plants. A touch of over-ornamentation in phrasing keeps it shy of top-tier, but the environment is genuinely embedded in the story’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    The arboretum-on-cliff and abandoned lighthouse are vivid, specific, and tightly integrated with mood and event—the wind through rusted vents directly triggers the central traumatic episode. Plant details (hybrid roses, ferns, orchids) are used economically to mirror resilience and grafting scars without feeling like a mere tour. The cliffside environment and sea weather feel lived-in and shape perception and metaphor rather than sitting as backdrop. The setting also charges the final image as the lighthouse beam sweeps and life persists in this liminal place.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lighthouse library, storm, spiral stairs, bioluminescent fungi, and subterranean loom create a rich, distinctive atmosphere that strongly echoes Elias’s fractured psyche. Setting details are sensorial and purposeful—the storm and “walls closing in” mirror his inner constriction, while the underbelly chamber externalizes descent into darkness. The environment directly provides the tools and thresholds (hidden panels, passage, loom) that allow the plot to progress. It rarely constrains him or forces tactical adaptation, which keeps this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.0)
    The wind-carved encampment, eclipse light, and living ink patterns are vividly realized and strongly filter through Elowen’s perception. The environment does more than decorate—the ink patterns and void-space are literal mechanisms of travel and temporal distortion, and the wind’s hush frames the opening and closing. However, the encampment itself rarely constrains tactics beyond mood; some description edges toward ornamental lavishness rather than pressure. Still, the sensory specificity and consistent atmospheric tone are a significant strength.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Vault Library under snow is vividly realized—ice-glazed shelves, entombed pods, the “dizzying quiet”—and consistently filters perception. The environment isn’t just backdrop: the isolation, cold, and buried setting reinforce the secrecy and make her act plausible and thematically charged. Weather and architecture (“storm-lashed spires” above, the weight of snow pressing echoes down) meaningfully charge the final image of a revolution murmuring under ice. While the setting rarely produces direct physical constraints, it shapes mood and possibility so thoroughly that the story would collapse without it.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    The desert rose farm under a glass dome is vividly rendered, with strong, consistent sensory detail (light through glass, fire-crimson petals, scorching sands). Setting is not merely decorative: the dome breach motivates the inciting problem, and the roses themselves are the mechanism of defense. Recurring objects (roses, dagger, scrap) charge the final image and thematically mirror continuity vs. ruin. At times the descriptive density edges toward excess, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sound wave garden, sleepwalking constellations, and rail spike create a vivid, coherent environment whose rules (emotion → waves, waves → hooks, silence as lure) are dramatized rather than explained. The setting directly constrains tactics: he must pierce waves without shattering lattices, read emotional ripples, and time his cast to celestial pattern-breaks. Sensory detail is lush and specific, almost entirely in service of atmosphere and stakes rather than static description. The final images (garden blooming richer, rail spike at his belt, restless constellations) show the environment reweighted by his act, charging the legend that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.5)
    The echoing observatory above the clouds and the wheeling stars create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that mirrors the “orbits of regret” motif without feeling like a mere backdrop. Details like the whispering glass, brass telescope, and clouds below as “unspoken scandals dispersing” are texturally strong and POV-filtered. The rosewood pen nib functions as a micro-setting object with charged recurrence that meaningfully loads the final image. The environment shapes tone more than concrete options, but it does credibly house the buried data and private confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    The laboratory of lost sounds, meteor hush, oak desk, and sonic-archaeology machines are vivid, specific, and tonally unified. Setting is not mere wallpaper: the lab’s device and the time-folding environment are required for both the haunting and its resolution. The amber functions as a charged recurring object that ties place, time, and theme together and reappears in the final image. A minor limit is that the lab itself doesn’t significantly constrain tactics beyond providing the one miraculous device; there’s little environmental resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    The grotto, lilac mist, and whispering tiles create a distinctive, sensorially vivid environment that feels integrated with the action rather than decorative. Acoustics and mist actively shape events by amplifying confessions and then enabling the emergent hush and projected visions. Details like damp sand, ancient tiles, and the mandala’s color palette are filtered through Elara’s artistic eye, supporting tone and theme. The setting could exert a bit more concrete constraint on physical choices, but as a microcosm for emotional acoustics it’s strong.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting—ancient plaza, shattered/mending sky, cracked flagstones, and the minaret mosaic—is vivid, specific, and tonally unified. Crucially, the environment isn’t just a backdrop: the tessera and stepping stone are the mechanism of change, and the sky’s fissures dim in direct response to the emotional shift, charging the final image. Sensory focus stays largely visual and metaphor-heavy, but the chosen images feel integrated with character and theme rather than touristic. A bit more tactile or situational constraint from the plaza itself (beyond mood) could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    The hedge maze and concealed mystic orchard are vividly rendered and deeply filtered through Elena’s synesthesia, giving the setting strong atmospheric specificity. The stage, fruit, and maze all participate in the emotional arc: the secret garden frames the encounter, the stage is the crucible, and the orchard’s pulsing fruits and rustling hedges “approve” and charge the climax. The recurring return to the maze/orchard in the closing lines gives the environment a continuing, almost talismanic role. It stops just short of constraining concrete choices but clearly charges the final image and the story’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    The light painting studio and the muscovite sliver are vivid, specific, and consistently returned to, with tactile and visual detail (“ozone scent,” “spectral cascades”) that feel lived-in. The environment isn’t just pretty: it enables the long-exposure experiments and the gallery/therapy aftermath. The geode and light rig clearly charge the final image, functioning as micro-setting objects that frame the thematic resolution. A bit more sense of the broader world outside the studio might deepen contrast, but for this length the focus works.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    The coastal cave network, bioluminescent algae, salt spray, and fissure to the ocean are vivid and consistently integrated into action (her floating toward the fissure, the waves “applauding,” final release into the tide). The fossil functions as a charged micro-setting/object that meaningfully shapes what’s possible and charges the final image. Sensory detail is strong and specific without losing spatial clarity. World rules around psychic residues and submerged ruins are legible and stable even in a surreal frame.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    The amber warehouse, cliffs, and canyon are vividly rendered with strong, coherent imagery (“earth’s forgotten bones,” “amber walls shimmering as if exhaling long-held breath”), and they support the mythic tone. Setting details are filtered through Elias’s ritualistic work—hourglasses, jars, buttons—which keeps the world from feeling like a tourist catalogue. The environment charges the final image conceptually (below/above, buried/unearthed), though it rarely constrains tactical choices in a concrete way. That slight lack of functional pressure keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zephyr Bluff, the mist, snow, and rook’s nest are vividly realized and tightly integrated with action—codes scratched in crusted snow, a hidden rope ladder, and the hollow beneath the bluff all matter to what characters can do. The weather and topography justify secrecy and the need for subtle signaling, and they recur meaningfully in the closing image as he scratches new codes "for the next tilt." The pillbox functions as a micro-setting object whose engraved runes literally align with the snow glyphs, charging both the cipher and the final handoff. A slight tendency toward repeated "silver hush/mist" imagery edges toward overuse but doesn’t break clarity or function.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.5)
    The fog-bound river crossing, gutters, ferry, and hill are richly evoked and consistently filtered through the coachman’s sensory focus, creating a strong, somber atmosphere. The environment does do some work—fog, ticking gutters, and river pulse all mirror his interior process and give him the temporal container to complete the mending. However, the setting rarely constrains his choices in a concrete way; it mostly supports tone and theme rather than tactical decision. Still, the recurring details (fog, gutters, river) clearly charge the final image of “coach wheels kissed solid earth.”

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    The oasis is vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action: skeletal hives, sand-choked fountains, acacia shadows, and chimney smoke all directly inform tactics (sun-pattern following, the smoke as temporal marker). The beekeeping remnants and wasteland pressure thematically mirror endurance and kindness, charging the final image of an oasis that “phototropically bent toward kindness.” Setting is not mere backdrop; it’s the mechanism of revelation and the story’s emotional ground. A slight excess of descriptive richness in places is the only reason this doesn’t push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    The fire escape, harbor, and skiff are vividly rendered and filtered through Elara’s sensibility (“moonlight silvered the waves like spilled mercury,” buoys like “fallen stars”). The harbor setting tangibly shapes the action—meeting Mira, rowing out, the night as listener—and the locksmith’s tooth functions as a charged micro-object that carries into the final image. At times the descriptive texture approaches saturation, but it generally supports mood and theme rather than stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Tidal Library above clouds, the mist-tides, stone circle, and brass sundial are vivid, coherent, and threaded throughout the action. Setting is not mere backdrop: the tides, height, and humming stones are repeatedly engaged as lived environment and ritual apparatus. However, the environment rarely constrains options or imposes concrete risk; it mainly amplifies mood and theme. Still, the atmospheric specificity is strong and the recurring objects charge the final images effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lotus temple, massive lily pond, and post-rain atmosphere are vividly rendered and integrated into action (rowboat approach, offerings at the waterborne spiral, public gathering at the temple steps). Setting details recur and evolve—the installation rising from the pond, twilight prisming the water, lily pads “nodding”—creating a strong, cohesive mood. The thrush’s nest twig spiral and the waterborne artwork charge the final images rather than sitting as static décor. While the environment only lightly constrains choice, it meaningfully inflects tone and the communal nature of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    The university radio station and its equipment are vividly rendered—CRT screens, solder tang in the air, the tower like “a needle in flesh”—and clearly filtered through Elara’s technical and emotional priorities. Setting is not decorative: the transmitter array is the only plausible tool for her interference, and the crowds and tower outside create a sense of siege. The final image of the station tower as “sentinel” charges the environment with thematic meaning and ties back to the opening. A slight excess of atmospheric phrasing keeps this just shy of the very top band, but the integration is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    The shadowed nexus, cracked vault, starlight, and buried organ are rendered with vivid, selective detail that matches the piece’s lyrical aims. Setting and objects (narrowing throats of stone, organ pipes, compass, starlight seams) directly constrain choices and shape tactics—his claustrophobia spikes as spaces close, the organ’s sound changes the environment, and the seam is a specific spatial target. World rules (spaces can mutiny; star-metal can anchor them) are consistent within the story’s logic and shown through action rather than exposition. Occasionally description tips toward decorative rather than pressure-linked, but the environment still meaningfully charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    The quarry and mist are vivid from the opening and recur with concrete impact: they explain the body’s concealment, the ribbon’s survival, and the need for divers. Environmental details (“slick stone floor,” “flooded basin,” “mist coiling like unanswered questions”) are filtered through Elara’s task-focused attention and thematic concerns. The setting also charges the final image—Elara at the “misted edge” as remains surface—though it could constrain tactical choices more directly in the present-tense investigation. Overall, atmosphere and specificity significantly bolster mood and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is richly realized: fog, condensation, squelching floors, and the “spongey dread” of Elysium create a tactile, oppressive environment that mirrors and pressures the action. Weather and isolation are not mere backdrop; the marooning and battered dome shape what’s possible and frame the stakes of Thorne’s maps. The copper nail and map cases function as micro-setting objects that constrain options and directly enable the climactic unlock. The final image of fog pressing closer while she works over her charts is atmospherically strong and thematically charged.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mountain pullout, jagged peaks, scaffold, and plastic wrap are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through the narrator’s sensibility as a performer and observer. Setting is not decorative: the pullout’s gravel yields the glass shard, the scaffold wrap literally becomes a map, and the bench and overlook frame his musical recounting. Weather and wind (updraft, fluttering sheets) actively shape the key discovery beat. A slight excess of descriptive flourishes verges on scenic saturation, but the environment clearly charges the final image and choices.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    The abandoned circus train is vividly and consistently rendered—“forgotten beasts,” peeling posters, dusk light, and weather all contribute to a lived, atmospheric space. Crucially, the setting and its circus hoops/territorial markers constrain choices and tactics in the Raoul scenes and charge the final image. Environmental details evolve with the plot (solar panels, LEDs, storm, dimmed lights) rather than sitting as static decoration. A slight tendency to re-gesture similar dusk/bruise imagery keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.5)
    The observatory on Ebon Peak, the cliffside temple, and the dawn-lit instruments are vividly rendered and tonally integrated with the cosmic/lyric mood. Details like the “daylily-pressed telegram” and “gilding the brass instruments in roseate hues” feel specific and purposeful. However, the environment rarely constrains options or alters tactics; it’s evocative backdrop more than active pressure. Setting earns its keep through atmosphere and thematic mirroring rather than through concrete influence on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    The swirling orchard vortex, underwater-yet-not, is vividly and consistently rendered; details like frost-kissed soil, rotating trees, and runes reinforce both atmosphere and stakes. Environment constrains options (the vortex’s pull, the roots, the ice shard’s placement) and provides the means of resolution via the soil and roots for the seed. The tone of “warlike serenity” is deeply embedded in the landscape. At times the density of imagery borders on excess but does not break clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cobalt glade, root-anchoring, and glowing foliage create a distinctive, lived-in fantastical environment that shapes what Elara can do (she cannot leave; she must work through roots and dream-link). The maze topiary and the nexus imagery extend the setting in a thematically coherent way, keeping dream and plant motifs tightly braided. World rules about dream/soil binding and the covenant are consistent enough for this length, learned largely through visionary action rather than exposition dumps. The setting also charges the final image—the glade’s blue glow as “a beacon against encroaching night”—though it could exert a bit more concrete tactical pressure during the nexus conflict itself.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “catacomb orchard” with roots snaking through bones and phosphorescent fungi is strikingly specific and consistently filtered through Elara’s ritual focus. Setting is not mere backdrop: roots cradle the skull, channel her incantations, bind the card, and pulse with new life at the end, directly constraining and enabling her actions. Environmental changes (roots groaning, shadows deepening, glow pulsing like a heartbeat) track the ritual’s escalation and charge the final image. The world rules stay coherent for this dark-fantasy register, and detail density feels purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    The quarry trailer and pit are vividly drawn, with dust, blasts, and industrial textures mirroring his internal “echo” motif. Professional detail (thread counts, cloth composition) is filtered through his appraiser’s eye, making the environment feel lived-in and specific. The setting also lightly pressures the story—the quarry is both literal excavation and metaphorical digging through his past—but it rarely constrains concrete options beyond mood. Still, the final image of driving out of Echo Valley ties place and arc effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    The magnetic arbor above endless clouds is vivid, specific, and integrated: iron-rich bark, humming fields, shuddering during thunderstorms, levitated pots, and current-conducting dew all matter to what’s possible. The environment directly shapes stakes (risk of descent) and solution (the seed’s growth stabilizing the fields), and the final images of canopy, clouds, and climbing vine are charged. Details are selective rather than touristic, filtered through Elias’s scholarly, analogical gaze. A touch more tactile, non-visual grounding under peak pressure could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tidal atrium, wintersun, glass domes, and tidal forge are vivid and specific, with details like “books bobbed nearby” and “submerged scrolls” integrating setting into action. Environment and objects (tides, forge, creel) constrain what can happen and charge the final images, not just decorate them. The world’s rules (moon pulses, calendar cataclysm) are consistent and fed through concrete images rather than expository dumps. A slightly broader sensory range beyond the visual would push this even higher, but as is it’s publishably strong.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    The crystal caves and hybrid bunker interior are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s task and state, with the crystals’ hum, veins, and facets not just decorative but active in the final transformation. The environment constrains and enables the core action: the master crystal node, crystal “veins,” and conductive lattice make the pearl’s radiance and echoing confessions plausible within the story’s logic. The recurring hush and light patterns in the cave directly charge the final image of softened walls and transmitted hopes. A slight tendency toward lushness aside, setting is a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    The disused, ivy-eaten station and the moss-choked bathroom are vividly rendered, with specific, tactile details (cracked platforms, strangled tracks, mildewed tiles) that clearly anchor place. Setting meaningfully mirrors and refracts Elias’s inner state and functions as a crucible: the building both preserves the communal “maps” and forces physical risk (the cracked sink, window perch) for insight. The accordion and the graffiti wall act as micro-settings/objects that charge the final image and reconfigure meaning. A slight tendency toward overt symbolism (“as if it mirrored his soul”) keeps this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.3)
    The glowing, mist-shrouded library is vividly realized—fog, luminescent shelves, runes, and floating script all feel specific and cohesive. Crucially, the environment is not just backdrop: the mists’ “propagation delays” become the mechanism for deciphering the watch, so setting helps shape tactics. Sensory detail is strongly visual but still purposeful and filtered through her awed, cautious perspective. It’s lush but generally controlled, supporting tone and premise without collapsing into pure ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.3)
    The velvet observatory, plants, coffee, and ice violin form a richly textured, coherent environment that is constantly in play rather than decorative. Setting details—ivy pulsing against crimson walls, dawn glow nearing, midsummer air versus unmelting ice—mirror internal states and directly affect options (plants as conduits for propagation, solstice timing). World rules around prophetic objects and plant resonance are learned organically through action and perception, not dump. The density approaches maximal for this length but remains purposeful and spatially legible.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    The skyborne grotto and aurora are vividly imagined and specific, with details like “rivers of light,” “suspended amid eternal clouds,” and vine-laced walls creating a strong atmospheric container. Crucially, the environment is not mere backdrop: auroral patterns and ambient static directly shape the extraction method and make “finding patterns in static” legible. The emerald chip at the grotto’s nexus as an “eternal ward” charges the final image with spatial and conceptual weight. A touch more non-visual sensory grounding could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “umbral grotto above the clouds” and “vineyard hush” are vivid, specific, and consistently threaded through action and interiority. Environmental features (ancient oak, grotto heart, mists, rebirth flower) are not mere backdrop; they shape what Elara can do (climb, discover the pin, perform the rite). The cyclical, shadowed garden atmosphere mirrors the rebirth theme without being purely symbolic furniture. Setting stops just short of constraining a difficult choice but strongly charges the final image of eternal turning.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lighthouse, beach, dawn light, and wind chimes are vividly and consistently evoked, with strong sensory texture (salt-streaked panes, specific chime materials) that suits the meditative mood. Setting is not merely decorative: the chimes actively mediate choice, the cloak and lantern room frame the ritual, and the descent back to the ashen campfire concretizes the inner shift. The environment could constrain options a bit more—Alex never struggles with the physical space or weather, which remain mostly atmospheric. Still, the charged use of recurring objects (chimes, cloak, shard) strongly supports the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vividly imagined and sensorially rich: floating basalt slab, luminous moss, magnetic grotto, and the pond-as-sky mirror all cohere into a strong, specific atmosphere. Environmental elements meaningfully charge the concept: the pond and ripples become the delivery mechanism of the secret, and the distant grotto stands as a real spatial locus for future risk. The world’s magical rules (floating rock, magnetic veins, trance visions) feel consistent within their own logic. At times the density of image flirts with decorative excess, but it never collapses basic clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    The canyon of bone towers and endless echoes is vividly rendered and tightly interwoven with the mechanics of Thren’s craft (harmonic stone-skipping, echo-resonance, bird flocks). Environmental features—dust, wind, bone ledges, echoes—directly enable and constrain tactics; without them, the appraisal method and final image would collapse. The closing image of his still body among bone towers with dust sifting down feels fully charged by earlier setting work. This is publishable-level atmosphere; it narrowly misses 9+ only because the environment influences method more than forcing a new late-stage choice.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.3)
    The icebound spire above cloud seas is vivid, tactile, and consistently filtered through Thorne’s gaze—“brilliant dimness,” rime, ozone, and weight-bearing mists all work in concert with mood and theme. Setting meaningfully constrains action: Artificer weaves fail in the chill, altitude demands mist walking, and the keystone’s anchoring of impossible physics defines what is and isn’t possible. The environment also charges the ending image of him pausing at the spire’s lip, looking down at the glowing oceans. A slight reduction in lush description or an added concrete interaction with danger in the setting (e.g., a slip, a near fall) would further align atmosphere with stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is a major strength: the meteor hush, lantern-lit sea, exposed Leviathan, and bioluminescent library are vivid and sensorially rich. Details like lanterns illuminating portholes and fungi pulsing like heartbeats feel purposeful and filtered through Elias’s state. The environment does shape possibilities (the receded tide reveals the wreck; the underwater library’s preservation underpins the plot), though it rarely constrains him with genuine danger. With a bit more tactile resistance or consequence from the environment, this could reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ambered observatory, fossil-like in a shrunken universe, is vivid and consistently returned to through amber walls, resin-crusted receiver, and shard-writing. Setting details like the foreign-coin collection, brass orrery, and contracted cosmos are specific and thematically aligned with time, memory, and reversal. The environment subtly constrains the action—this is a relic-deck with old tools and a beacon—and the final image (“amber deck pulsing with newborn purpose”) is charged by all the prior description. Occasionally the density of cosmic imagery flirts with overload, but orientation and tone remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory, oculus, scattered light, and wax cylinders are vividly realized and strongly filtered through Elowen’s perceptions. Setting is not mere backdrop: the acoustics amplify the “echoes,” and the oculus’s fractured light is literally the mechanism for crystallization and the charged final image. Tools and environment (telescope, plinth, atlas, light) constrain how the ritual unfolds and what’s possible. A slight excess of decorative description edges toward lushness for the word count, but the specificity and integration remain high.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sapphire viaduct, dripping “tears” as a cosmic metronome, and the cracked bell are vivid, specific, and tightly integrated with the mechanics of the magic. Environmental details constrain tactics: Elowen literally uses drip rates and the viaduct’s condensate as his repair method, and the normalized dripping pattern is the closure signal. The setting’s visual and sonic atmosphere (“faulty lantern” stars, viscous hum, dawn light) consistently supports tone and theme. A touch less descriptive redundancy in the viaduct/bell imagery would move this toward the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Midnight Ridgeway, reservoir, receding waterline, and resurfacing town are vivid and consistently evoked, with strong image systems (mirror, hush, sapphire) that suit the mood. The setting meaningfully shapes the premise—the drought and vantage point make the ghost-town and its artifacts accessible—and the ridgeway’s watchful elevation charges the final gaze downward. Some descriptions tend toward lyrical abstraction rather than tactile specificity at peak beats, but spatial and atmospheric anchors remain clear. The environment and recurring objects (ridgeway, water, label) together help charge the final image, not just decorate it.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.0)
    The hidden orchard behind the kaleidoscopic waterfall is vivid, specific, and multi-sensory, with rainbows, luminous fruit, moss, and scented vapor woven into action rather than static description. The environment is not ornamental: the waterfall’s prism interacts with the birds and steam; the grove’s seclusion and magic are necessary conditions for the rite. The final image—waterfall as guardian, fruits pulsing brighter—clearly recharges the setting with the story’s thematic resolution. A slight excess of descriptive density in places is the only thing keeping this from an even higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    The nocturnal arbor above the clouds, with branches like veins and lower boughs as launch points, is vivid and specific, and it frames the entire job ecology (watcher vs jumpers vs groundlings). Setting interacts with plot via cloud shear, rogue updrafts, and vortices that Elias must read and counter. Objects-as-setting (scope, harness, parachute buckle) are well integrated into both tension and closure. It stops just short of top-tier because the environment constrains choices more atmospherically than tactically, with limited concrete on-page navigation or physical risk to Elias himself.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    The floating rock dojo amid temporal vortices is vivid and specific, with details like “colossal slab of obsidian,” anti-grav hum, wards, and central altar woven through action. The environment occasionally constrains or shapes beats—wards repelling Elara, the Blade resonating with the dojo, the altar required for the rite—rather than feeling like a white-room backdrop. Temporal storms mostly function as visual stakes rather than concrete obstacles, but they help charge the climax when “anchors strained” and Elara flees into the chaos. Overall, setting and object-as-setting (Blade, altar, jar) are well-integrated with the story’s tone and symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmospheric work is strong: “storm-born silence,” willows over a murmuring brook, and the contrast between venue and nocturnal haven give the piece a textured sense of place. Setting details are filtered through Elias’s puzzle-oriented mindset (the moon as UV, the brook as mental “flow”), tying environment to concept. The brookside location does modestly affect action (planting the seed, locating the buried drive), though mostly symbolically rather than as a hard constraint. Overall, it’s vivid and purposeful, if occasionally leaning toward lushness over functional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    The echo chamber tunnel, bioluminescent fungi, rusted blowers, and spectral kitchen table are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through the ritual’s needs. The environment is not decorative: the echoing acoustics and stone walls are explicitly what hold and then release the “unspoken” griefs, and the tunnel’s hush and resonance shape tactics and outcome. The final image of restored hush in the same charged space reweights the setting rather than abandoning it. A touch more sensory variety beyond sound and sight could further deepen embodiment, but what’s here is strong and integral.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    The frozen garden and mist are vividly rendered and thematically aligned with limbo and “foggy lucidity,” with strong, specific images (crystalline petals, iced vines, drips from thorn-tips). Setting is not just backdrop: the cold, mist, and thorns are repeatedly interiorized, and the ice literally melts to show glimpses of the library, so the environment participates in the turning point. The pendant and the boundary of light function as charged micro-setting objects that shape the final image. A bit of descriptive density could be trimmed, but the setting’s integration with theme and action is high.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ember nexus is vivid, specific, and omnipresent, with sensory details (“frozen blooms of ash and glow,” “iced embers”) that shape both mood and method. It functions as more than backdrop: its embers and blooms are tools in his alchemy, and its thaw at the end concretely manifests the internal and thematic shift. The recurrence of frost/bloom/ember imagery effectively charges the final transformation into “eternal spring.” At times the density of description edges toward ornamental, but it rarely impedes clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integral: the suspended radio tower city, Echo Gorge as a “speaker,” and the creaking cables all directly inform stakes and outcome. Physical environment and cosmic conditions (perigee, mists, cliff crystals) don’t just decorate; they define the problem and the solution. The tools (dish, harness, bridges) are used in a tactile, goal-directed way that feels lived-in. A slight excess of atmospheric description edges toward indulgence, but it remains mostly purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ferry, misty bay, and especially the spectral grotto under starlight are vividly realized and tied to the core events (vanishing ferry, overlapping passengers, radio patterns echoing the stars). Details like crystalline walls, jagged fissures, and luminous rocks feel specific and integrated rather than postcard-like. The environment constrains and shapes the solution: the star patterns in the grotto mirror the hourglass, enabling the radio tactic. A slight excess of ornament and metaphor density prevents this from feeling utterly effortless.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    The optical illusion gallery is vivid and tonally unified: pulsing walls, morphing murals, and the sinew loom together create a strong, specific atmosphere. Setting and object details are purpose-driven rather than touristic—the loom, murals, and illusions reacting to the eruption all shape and mirror the internal stakes. The environment charges the final image (the gallery fading, its calm “thicker now,” the sinew echo in his palms) in a way that reweights what came before. It could press his choices more overtly, but as a lyric-leaning piece the integration is still strong.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.5)
    The benthic city, abyssal vents, phosphorescent fish, and pressure-sealed chamber are vivid and specific, and details like “living constellations” tie environment directly to the navigation motif. Setting is consistently filtered through the scene’s purpose (instruction in starlight navigation) rather than as a static backdrop. The chain link functions partly as a micro-setting/tool that charges the final image. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices in the scene, it deeply colors tone and concept in a way that feels integral.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.3)
    The mist-clad atrium, twilight, and sanatorium are vividly and consistently evoked, with the space functioning as a charged site of both past and potential death. The setting genuinely constrains and deepens the conflict: Clara chooses this exact spot to echo her mother’s death, and the atmosphere (mist, stone, balustrade) shapes the mood and choices. The hearing aid as a small, tactile object-setting is integrated into action and the final image. At times the descriptive language verges on ornamental repetition rather than fresh specificity, which keeps this just below elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific: the jagged cave mouth, slack water, bioluminescent kelp, drowned antechamber, and cable nexus all feel tactile and spatially coherent. Environmental constraints—the narrowing passage, rising tide, submerged access, and rock walls—directly shape what Elara can do and when she must leave. Recurring images like the “crashing hush” of waves and the gold-flecked codex margins tie atmosphere to theme and closure. The piece avoids white-room syndrome entirely, though a few descriptive beats verge on repetition rather than fresh angle.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    The opal observatory under snow is sensuously rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s perception, with nice textural touches (opal veins, snow-muffled world, ink as nebulae). The setting tone supports the theme of “midnight solace” and isolation very effectively. The porcelain shard functions as a micro-setting object that meaningfully charges the final image. However, the physical environment rarely constrains options or tactics beyond mood; it’s more atmospheric than functionally pressing.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    The canyon of endless echoes, bone towers, and tunnel are richly specific and integral: they aren’t just backdrop but the mechanism by which language becomes soundscape. World rules around echoes and bone acoustics stay consistent and culminate in a final image (future wanderers entering the tunnel) that is charged by all prior setting work. Sensory detail emphasizes texture in a way that mirrors the lost language’s theme without tipping into schematic symbolism. A touch less descriptive redundancy could push this even higher, but the environment meaningfully constrains and enables choices.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    The herbalist’s underground garden is vividly and consistently rendered—bioluminescent herbs, frost, quartz-veined soil, and stalactites all contribute to a strong, otherworldly atmosphere. Setting details are filtered through Elara’s focus (cryptid research, herbal lore, frostbitten mood) and recur meaningfully at the climax as gravity shifts and the garden brightens in response to her inner change. The arrowhead and the garden’s altered gravity function as quasi-tools and environmental constraints in the final image, charging the transformation. Some description is more decorative than functional, but overall the environment feels specific and lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and thematically consonant: rusting blossoms, gears in tree trunks, lantern-eyed statues, and the sky-bridge all feel coherent and sensorially rich. Environmental rules (mechanical patrols, sensors tuned for clamor, gears fused into xylem) are consistent and learned through action. The orchard and statues do shape tactics somewhat (soft playing, high vantage), though often they remain more aesthetic than constraining. This is strong, publishable-level atmosphere, just shy of the top band because the world could pressure choices more concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Cobalt Arcade is vividly realized—“cobalt lights flickering like veins under bruised skin,” neutral-zone geography, the blue-lit booth, and ghostly pinball machines all create a strong, specific atmosphere. Setting is tightly filtered through Elias’s professional and emotional priorities (slots as “unmet eyes,” voids as data), and the recurring bottle of thunderstorm functions as a micro-setting/tool that constrains action and charges the final image. The rules of this slightly speculative world (border, patrols, drones, Healing Expanse) are conveyed through action rather than dumpy exposition. While the arcade doesn’t sharply alter tactics beyond providing a discreet vent and a liminal space, it feels integral to tone and thematic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    The abandoned circus train and its impossible inner oasis are vividly, specifically rendered—vines, cracked skylights, mildew, “faded popcorn dreams”—and consistently filtered through Elias’s carver’s eye and silence-ethos. The environment meaningfully supplies resources (relic animals, the spring, the flatbed cradle) and atmosphere that mirror the theme of forgotten wonder revived. The setting also charges recurring objects like the wind bells and halo fragment, especially in the final images. It stops shy of a 9-band because it shapes mood and discovery more than it constrains or complicates choices at peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    The scientific poetry library is vividly and specifically rendered, with details like “quantum sonnets,” “fractal elegies,” and the pseudospherical model giving the setting a distinctive texture. The scarf as recurring object and the pseudosphere as tool both shape her tactics and charge the central image of hyperbolic story-space. The environment coheres with tone and theme (analog vs digital, math vs poetry) and feels genuinely lived-in for this character. It could nudge even higher if the library’s physical constraints (closed stacks, surveillance, spatial layout) more directly pressured her choices in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    The whispering archipelago, lighthouse, and glass-domed apex are vivid, sensorial, and tightly woven into Elara’s task rather than feeling like backdrop. Tools and environment (antique camera, palette, dawn light, winds and whispers) constrain her options and directly shape her method and closure image. The final beam sweeping outward and the subtle glows in the library clearly show setting charging the last beats. A touch less atmospheric redundancy in adjectives could sharpen impact, but the world feels distinct and lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.0)
    The “shadowed nexus under starlight” is vividly and consistently evoked, with starfire, constellated pillars, and the first star’s alignment providing a distinct atmosphere. Setting details like the rune alignment and starfire flame do participate in the ritual, giving the environment slight functional weight beyond backdrop. However, much of the description leans on repeated abstractions (“cosmic hush,” “possibility”) rather than concrete, lived-in specifics. The nexus charges tone more than it constrains choices, which keeps this strong but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse, ringed by shipwrecks and flooded with brackish water, is vivid and specific, with sensory details (silt-choked vines, cracked dome, phosphorescent fungi) that feel lived-in. Crucially, the setting is not postcard-background: the glass dome’s fractures enable the “broken constellations” method, and the flood/shipwreck history entwines with Elias’s lost storm-night. Environment and recurring objects (ring, dome, water) all help charge the final images. A slightly tighter selection of images in a couple of spots could heighten impact further, but atmosphere and function are strongly integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    The library, cracked window, and drifting playground swing create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that threads through the piece and returns at the end to charge the final image. Setting details are consistently filtered through Elara’s work—shards, glass, scrolls, tea leaves—so environment and tools feel integral rather than decorative. The shadow caught in the pane and the swing’s hush both mirror the exile/return motif effectively. Still, the library rarely constrains tactics in a concrete way; the space is richly evoked but could do a bit more causal work.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    The waterfall, parapet, and orchards are sensuously drawn and woven into action via the essence-gathering ritual, giving the environment more than postcard status. The sensory palette (mist, moss, buds, color) coheres with the story’s concern for wonder and vibrancy. That said, the setting rarely constrains choice or imposes risk; it mainly provides lyrical texture and raw material. The final image of Lirien on the “verdant perch” nodding valleyward reprises the setting effectively but without a new charge of danger or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prism sanctuary under starlight is vivid, specific, and integrated—the prisms’ pulsing colors mirror and warn of the emotional and spiritual turbulence, and the buried net in the silted floor concretely anchors the conflict. Environmental details are filtered through Lirien’s work (workbench, shards, silt, needle) rather than reading like a tour. The setting meaningfully charges the final image of the sanctuary “breathing anew” under fading starlight. It could go even higher if the physical constraints of the sanctuary more directly altered tactics beyond mood and access to the net.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rain-scoured vault, fresco saints, henge, and underground chapel are vivid, textured, and filtered through Elias’s professional eye. Environmental echoes (rain-scoured frescoes above, fresco remnants below; rain outside both vault and henge) nicely mirror the thematic concern with erosion and time. The setting occasionally borders on luxuriant description, but it rarely stalls momentum and consistently supports tone. While the environment does not heavily constrain tactics, it charges the final image of him back in the vault, re-framing the map as rain softens outside.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sunken library, the canyoned wreck of Earhart’s plane, and the underwater textures (bloomed books, anemone-furred encyclopedias, kelp through portholes) are vivid and strongly filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The snow globe functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image and anchors the abstract physics/entanglement language. Environmental rules feel consistent enough for a slightly heightened realism, and the mood is deeply supported by setting detail. The environment doesn’t tightly constrain tactics, but it meaningfully frames and energizes the thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “misty courtyard above the clouds,” floating balustrades, and graffiti-vines are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elowen’s sensibility. The environment and tools (courtyard walls, cloud-moss pigments, the plate) are used in action rather than as mere backdrop, and the storm’s suspended moment nicely matches the poised emotional state. World rules (cloud realm, ghost-in-graffiti, tinkering) feel internally consistent at this length. The setting mostly shapes mood and available tools rather than constraining choices, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    The icebound spire, glass elevator, frost-laced clouds, and “captive auroras” create a strong, coherent atmosphere that’s distinctive and texturally rich. Setting details are integrated into action and theme via the storm-crashed airships and the vertiginous height that underlines Elowen’s fall and Lira’s ascent. The environment and tools (elevator, goggles, ice-filtered light) charge the discovery but rarely constrain active choices beyond providing a fixed ten-floor window. Description verges on lush but remains mostly purposeful and character-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sky gondola, stratospheric silence, and emotionally legible cloud types create a vivid, specific atmosphere that’s integral to character and theme. Environmental details (dusty starlight, crystalline haze, voids between clouds) are consistently filtered through Elias’s professional and emotional lens, never feeling like neutral postcard description. The gondola’s untethered state and the brass telescope’s tactile presence meaningfully charge the final image of an “eternal observatory.” A slight excess of decorative meteorological-poetic detail in the middle dilutes urgency but doesn’t harm clarity or the setting’s functional role.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tree-trunk library is vividly and economically rendered—bark-lined shelves, knotholes admitting slivers of dawn, warped wood etched by time—and these details matter mechanically (she carves channels in the bark; the knothole supplies sky light). The environment and tools (guild mirrors, silver leaf) visibly shape her tactics and make the mirror array plausible within the story’s logic. Demolition as environmental pressure and, later, salvaged planks showing “inner heaven” both charge the final image. A slightly broader sensory range beyond the visual and tactile could deepen the atmosphere, but what’s here is already strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific: an antique airship in twilight, starling murmurations, a dusty hopscotch board, and stranded luminance all create a strong atmospheric frame. Environment meaningfully affects action—the isolated aft deck enables the hidden board, the luminance is embedded in the planks, and the birds physically threaten the ship until repelled by the activated grid. Details feel purposefully chosen and filtered through Elara’s perspective as a skyfarer and map apprentice. World rules around luminance and rifts are sketched more than fully grounded, but they hold together for this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.3)
    The frozen library above the clouds, auroras, and mirror hall are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elias’s craft-minded perception. Environmental elements—the ice-encased tomes, spectral motes, celestial gears—are not just postcard images but align with the story’s clockwork/cadence concerns, especially in the central pedestal mechanism. The setting does not strongly constrain physical tactics, but it deeply charges the atmosphere and final image. Line by line, sensory detail is rich without losing clarity, though occasionally verges on decorative excess.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    The orchard planet with floating arches, sidewalks, and the nebula is vividly and economically rendered, with recurring motifs (brambles, arches, butterflies, bell) that matter at the climax. The arches and nebula aren’t just backdrop; they participate in the healing mechanism as butterflies “thread” them and pull the nebula down. Details are integrated into action and resolution rather than serving as a static tour. A touch more sensory variety beyond the visual could have deepened the atmosphere further.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lighthouse on jagged cliffs, the dusk sky, and especially the pane of hush create a vivid, specific atmosphere that feels integral rather than decorative. Setting is tightly tied to function: the hidden location encodes isolation; the pane’s properties define what he can and can’t do with sound; the lighthouse itself frames his vigil and final fading. Details like “bruised purple” dusk and the sea meeting “oblivion” are evocative without losing spatial clarity. The environment clearly charges the final image and the mechanics of his act.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is rich, tactile, and tightly integrated with action: cliff edges, jagged paths, mechanical birds, and forming frost all constrain where and how Elias can move and place the nuts. Details like “beak-shadow,” “frost-crack,” and the foaming sea below are not decorative; they frame specific tactical beats. The orchard, blueprint tree, and birds recur to charge the final frost-laced image. Description pushes close to density overload but remains coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.0)
    The braided ravine, bruised-purple canyon walls, and foam patterns are vivid, specific, and clearly filtered through a chemist’s and widower’s gaze. Environmental details (braids of water, foam lattices, chrysalis in silt) are tightly tied to the thematic spine and to his realization about flexible, biodegradable polymers. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, but it absolutely charges the conceptual and emotional stakes and the final image of restored waters and butterflies. Overall, the atmosphere is rich without losing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glass orchard library and cloud sea are vividly specific and filtered through function: hanging glass shards as pages, crystalline boughs, and floor panes over the roiling clouds. Setting is not mere backdrop; the floating paths and sea vortex directly shape Elias’s physical choice to descend once the prismatic map appears. The environment’s fragility and luminosity echo his internal fragmentation without becoming clumsy symbolism. World rules are consistent enough for this length and charge the final image of clouds as “infinite blank pages.”

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.3)
    The desert fortress, the post-rain courtyard, and especially the coral icebound pavilion are sharply rendered with strong sensory specificity (metallic tang in the air, ice “like captured moonlight,” neural-path tidal pools). Setting genuinely shapes events: the rare rain reveals the stairwell, the chill and coral lattice define the pavilion’s function, and tidal pools become both landscape and mechanism. Environmental details are integrated through Elaris’s perceptions and professional lens rather than feeling like a tour. The world rules (desert + impossible ice) stay consistent and thematically charged.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    The astronomical clock tower, orrery dome, and grain elevators are vividly realized and specific, creating a memorable atmospheric blend of agrarian and celestial. Setting details are not postcard-only: the tower’s height and cuckoo weight enable the pulley plan, and the orrery’s starlight returns to charge the final image on the bridge. Spatial relations (tower to silo to bridge) are legible throughout. The environment consistently mirrors and supports the thematic bridge-from-silos motif without feeling mechanically symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    The moonlit canyon, silt, and derelict rover are vivid and recur meaningfully as “strata” of buried dreams and as the first dig site. Environment shapes the ritual—she needs the unnatural moonlight pool and canyon geometry to channel the entangled memories, and the silt literally reveals remnants and glyphs. The final image of a helix-monument built from canyon silt ties setting directly into closure. It’s lush and purposeful, though adding one or two tactile, constraining details under pressure could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    The serpentine grotto, mist, inversion, and crystal chamber are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s refraction-obsessed perception. Environmental rules (gravity inversion, threshold ripples, luminous veins) are internally consistent and shape how she moves and accesses the sanctum. Description is rich without losing spatial coherence, and the grotto’s mood coheres with the story’s cosmic-arcane tone. The setting could press her tactically a bit harder, but it already does meaningful work beyond postcard backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    The siskin alder grove, empty nests, moss-draped trunks, and the Great Stillness create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels integral rather than decorative. Details are consistently filtered through Elowen’s musical sensibility (alders as woodwinds, root-thuds as percussion), and the environmental silence concretely shapes the premise. The setting actively charges the ending image as the grove is “forever subtly changed,” making the place itself part of the closure. This is one of the piece’s strongest craft pillars.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and thematically integrated: twilight, magnetic anomalies, and obsidian monoliths all echo the “eclipsed” covenant and liminal emotional state. Environmental details are filtered through Elias’s chess-and-magnetism mindset (compasses, leylines, shadows on the board), avoiding tourist listing. The worry stone functions as a micro-setting tool that literally sits at the board’s heart and charges the final image as he walks away. The nexus meaningfully constrains action—this ritual can only happen here, in this precise twilight—which strongly charges the atmosphere and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    The workshop under the stars, the tools, the glowing tuner, and the impending fireworks are sensually and specifically rendered, with good use of light, sound, and smell. Setting is filtered through Elias’s sensibility (pacifist among war relics, harmonica, doves on the clasp) in a way that supports theme and tone. The environment and tools meaningfully participate in the action—the tuner and clasp are literalized setting-objects that shape what he can do. It stops just short of 9-band because the workshop itself doesn’t significantly constrain options beyond providing mood and apparatus.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    The treetop village, tidal marshes, and perpetual sway are richly realized and tightly tied to Elara’s goal of “serenity within motion.” Environmental details—pots lashed to platforms, gales rocking walkways, hammock-homes like pods—are filtered through her sensory and emotional lens, not presented as neutral catalog. The setting constrains her tactics (the flower must survive constant motion) and charges the final image where she achieves poise within this environment rather than escaping it. A slight tendency toward decorative neologisms (“tide’s thought”) keeps it just shy of top-tier precision.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and inseparable from the action: inversion gravity, upward rivers, and floating rock arches all constrain tactics and enable the journey. Details like “liquid starlight” rivers and petrified vines pulsing on arch undersides are not just pretty; they teach the world’s rules through use. The suspended cavern and converging roots directly stage the central discovery, and the planet’s inversion cycle times the plot. The final return to the withered grove, now subtly quickening, charges the environment with emotional and conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    The container labyrinth and wind are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with both plot and theme: they literally channel the drones and shape Elias’s tactics. Specifics like narrow alleys, leaning stacks, and variable wind speeds all feel lived-in and functional, not decorative. The environment constrains movement and perception and charges the final image of “documented winds” in the silent port. This is the story’s standout strength.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ice cavern and aurora are richly, specifically rendered and integral to every beat—the hush, light, and crystal geometry are not mere backdrop but the medium of the conflict. Environmental features (refracting ice, auroral threads, the cavern’s “sculpted hush”) directly shape how Elyra must act and what she risks disturbing. The final image—cavern altered yet serene, prism-songs woven into auroral tapestries—clearly depends on this specific setting. It verges on overdescription at times, but the setting consistently carries thematic and functional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Thunder-echo Range, canyon hush, avalanching quiet, and rune-etched amphitheater give a vivid, cohesive setting that strongly supports mood. Details are well-filtered through Elaron’s role and aims (ley lines, hidden clefts, amphitheater where the weave is thinnest). The environment informs where the ritual happens but less so how choices are constrained under pressure. Still, the recurring hush and canyon imagery charge the ritual and final return with a clear atmospheric through-line.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    The topaz workshop, halo fragment, and vanishing stars produce a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels integral rather than decorative. The topaz walls, celestial inks, and press mechanics are filtered through Elias’s sensibility and directly shape action (halo in the platen; star-dust ink; the workshop as emotional lab). The vanishing stars function as both visual motif and soft clock, tightening the climax around the “penultimate star.” Environment and object charge the final image (dimmed halo, new star), satisfying the “setting as constraint/charge” test.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.3)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway is vividly rendered, with the lights, wind, and jagged path consistently inflecting the mood and mirroring the myth-vs-routine tension. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, but it does charge key beats: the aurora light in the pendant, the fork in the ridgeway, and the final image of Kael walking under the auroras all feel inseparable from this setting. World rules around relics and ridge-myth are sketched efficiently through action and memory. The balance of sensory detail to narrative momentum is generally well-judged, though a few atmospheric phrases repeat.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    The quartz arbor, mist, frost, and sedan form a vividly specific, coherent micro-world that feels tactile and psychologically apt. Environmental details—frost “like neural maps,” quartz humming, mist thickening—are filtered through Elias’s dual scientific/mystic lens, deepening both atmosphere and theme. The setting doesn’t just decorate; it becomes the apparatus for his method (frost, light, prism) and charges the final image of returning to the arbor. While the environment constrains emotion and symbolism more than concrete tactical choice, it’s integrated at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bamboo-encroached orchard, rotting apples, and colossal oak’s sap bead create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s both tactile and thematically aligned with decay and endurance. Setting is not mere backdrop: the forgotten orchard and rare peddlers justify the rummage box’s scarcity, while the bead as “ancient heartwood” charges the closure image. Environmental tone (bamboo whisper, autumn leaves, mist) modulates with the rising rite, supporting the accumulative drive. The world feels singular and integrated, though the setting could constrain choices a bit more explicitly to reach the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integrated: azure-fruited orchards, levitating arches, and crystal-veined rubble all matter to what can be done and what’s at risk. The abandoned mine shaft is not just backdrop; its acoustics actively amplify the silk’s magic and its history grounds Elar’s loss. Environmental change tracks the plot—plummeting rocks, then stabilized arches and brightening fruit—so the world responds to his actions. The only thing keeping this below the very top band is that the environment constrains less than it supports; it’s richly rendered but rarely forces tactical compromises.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay is vividly rendered—“rusted hulks of forgotten starships,” dust, oil, ozone—and consistently filters through Elara’s sensory bias. The shard and the bay recur at the end, with the bay “solidified” and charged as the locus where realities overlap, so the environment does participate in the final image. However, the bay rarely constrains her options or tactics; it functions more as evocative backdrop than an active pressure or resource. Still, the specificity and tonal coherence of the setting are strong for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lighthouse, storm, jagged cliffs, and especially the haunted lantern room and stone stacks are vivid, specific, and filtered through Elias’s professional familiarity. Environmental elements (storm, darkness, high room, stacked stones, sea glass) meaningfully charge the emotional stakes and the final image. The atmosphere sustains a coherent, salt-slick, ghost-haunted mood that feels lived-in rather than touristic. Setting could constrain action a bit more directly, but it already does strong thematic and tonal work.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.0)
    The Emerald Lighthouse, glass lantern, sea, and stars are sensuously drawn and integral to the premise; this could not be set in a generic room. The wick and beam are used as functional tools in the magic, not just décor, and the final image of the lighthouse as “eternal sentinel” under indifferent stars is thematically charged. Sensory detail is rich, though heavily visual and sometimes overstuffed. The environment shapes what is possible but doesn’t strongly constrain Elias—he moves through it with ease.

    The floating rock tea house, valley mist, and sun trails are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elowen’s sensory and professional priorities. The environment does more than decorate: the altitude, haze, and moving light enable her method and frame the whole experiment. The blue morpho wing functions as a micro-setting/tool, with its physical behavior under changing light literally revealing the hidden pattern that drives the climax. World rules (floating rock, sun trails) are fantastical yet stable and integrated into action rather than dumped in exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tower, storm, moonlight, and cliffside oaks are rendered with rich, selective sensory detail that always passes through Elias’s workmanlike perspective. Setting isn’t mere backdrop: the storm funnels dreams, the moonlit stone’s healing properties literally enable the repairs, and the oaks outside pivot into the thematic core at the climax. Spatial and atmospheric choreography remain clear and consistent. The setting fully supports both mood and mechanics, with only slight risk of decorative excess.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse, mica window, and endless night are vividly and consistently rendered, with concrete, specific imagery (veins of glowing sap, bruised bark, molten dawnlight). Setting is not mere backdrop; the Heart Tree, mica window, and greenhouse panes all participate in the ritual and charge the final image of cracks of day spiderwebbing the glass. Sensory focus is primarily visual and conceptual, but for this lyric mode it works. The environment shapes what is possible without feeling like a static postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    The library and secret archive are vividly rendered—“aged paper and polished oak,” the spiral staircase, brass lanterns, and the hidden panel all feel concrete and atmospheric. The setting isn’t just backdrop: the idea of a library “hidden in plain sight” directly supports the paradox of staying while leaving and shapes how Elara hides the young man amid the stacks. Spatial choreography is clear, and the transition from public reading room to forbidden mezzanine to inner archive is easy to follow. The environment charges the final image of her as guardian of the secret stacks, even if no physical constraint sharply limits her options.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.3)
    The overgrown palace courtyard and secret tea house are vividly rendered and deeply integrated—frost, ivy, solar brazier, and the scarred table all echo neglect repurposed into sanctuary. Setting details aren’t postcard décor; they directly host the reunion, enable the tea that mediates their conversation, and symbolize reclaimed ruin. The environmental texture consistently mirrors the emotional state (frost/thaw, decay/growth) without feeling mechanically symbolic. While the space doesn’t sharply constrain tactical choices, it substantially charges the final image of tending the garden together.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    The frozen library above the clouds, quartz, frost, and abyssal void are vividly and consistently rendered, with strong sensory and tonal unity. Environmental details evolve with the plot—the deepening freeze, contracting shelves, drifting library, and stabilizing frost all mirror the vows’ state and Elias’s progress. The tools (magic lantern, crystalline gauge, ice wall) are firmly embedded in the setting and used in action, not just described. The atmosphere is rich and specific, though occasionally verges on decorative repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    The pirate market beneath the rotting pier is richly evoked through smell, sound, and light, and feels lived-in rather than touristic. Environmental constraints matter: the hidden location, the timbers, the pilings she climbs, and the dawn deadline all shape what’s possible. The recurring physicality of the pier and market atmosphere mirrors the “comforting unease” theme without over-explicit symbolism. A slightly tighter link between specific spatial positions (who stands where in the final confrontation) and the chaos might bring it into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and particular: Lavender Bluff, aurora, bioluminescent blooms, and “forests held their elections” all create a striking, coherent atmosphere filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Details like firefly drones, synth-groves, and pheromone ballots integrate worldbuilding with action rather than feeling like a static tour. The environment doesn’t tightly constrain tactics, but the bluff’s vantage and the forest elections are thematically and causally tied to the encounter. The recurring weather/aurora/forest imagery charges the final perception of her change.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    The crystal cave is vividly rendered with specific, recurring imagery (“auroral glow,” veins of quartz and amethyst) that mirrors Elias’s emotional state. The environment supplies functional resources (the mica slab, the alcove) and is tied to past action (hiding the box here), giving the setting more than postcard value. Sensory detail is predominantly visual but thematically aligned rather than cluttered. The cave does not heavily constrain physical options, which keeps it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    The greenhouse city under a toxic sky, condensation “lungs,” weeping vines, and zinc postal relics form a distinctive, coherent ecology that’s constantly in play rather than backdrop. Setting constrains and charges choices: dishonest air literally sickens her in bazaars, leaky condensate junctions mark the descent, and the undercity vault of verdigrised leaves is both physical place and thematic engine. Details feel filtered through her professional eye (strokes like a master pen, zinc ridges like Braille), tightening voice and world together. At an elite level, one might want a single environmental constraint to bite even harder at the climax, but the integration is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    The whispering bluff, winds, clouds, and iceberg are vivid and continuous, and the environment materially shapes everything: the gales power the sculpture, the altitude brings isolation and pilgrimage, and the ice’s physical behavior (melting, glistening) charges the final image. Details are integrated into action, not static description, and the setting’s mood (austere, numinous) supports the thematic concern with wonder. The final sunsets fracturing on ice and the whispering winds give a strong object-and-environment-charged closure. Minor abstraction in places keeps it just short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glass-domed desert rose farm is vivid, specific, and consistently used: storm pressure, dome fragility, and the incinerator pit all constrain tactics. The “strangely organic” roses and the desert outside actively mirror and intensify Zeta’s inner state rather than serving as backdrop. Environmental rules (EM storms, glass integrity, low-oxygen burn) feel coherent and are shown through action. The final image of the dome standing sentinel over the blooming farm directly charges the closure with setting-inflected resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    The courtyard at dawn is vividly and repeatedly rendered—dew, jasmine, birdsong, fountains—creating a strong, sensuous atmosphere. The environment is not just decorative: the fixed geography (fountain, oak, gate, mailbox) shapes the trail of clues and the final act of opening the box. The intrusion of the waking city (sirens, helicopters, news vans) sets a tonal counterpoint that underscores the enclave of listening. Overall, setting and charged objects (locket, mailbox) are tightly woven into action and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sunken lab, phosphorescent algae, silt, and cryo-pods are vividly rendered and maintain a coherent, immersive atmosphere. Environmental elements like currents and hull groans brush against the action, but rarely compel concrete changes in her tactics. Still, the underwater lab and oceanic pressure meaningfully inflect tone and plausibility of the stakes (lost archive, frozen colleagues). The ocean as final carrier of their “encrypted strength” charges the last image nicely, even if the setting could interfere more actively with decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    The docks, jagged rocks, beached whale, and especially the salt crystal growing chamber are vividly drawn with strong sensory specificity and integrated with action (using a crystal shard to pierce the gravity pockets, returning the heart to the chamber). Setting feels lived-in and tonally cohesive, and the environment constrains choices (sea caves, tidal sands, where the heart can be hidden and later housed). The “gleaming silence” and refracted light motifs enhance atmosphere without freezing the scene. A slight surplus of descriptive density in places keeps it from feeling utterly effortless.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    The nocturnal brook, willows, mossy stone, and moonlight form a vivid, coherent environment that’s tightly integrated with mood and action. The brook’s behavior changes with the magic (“flow slowing to a velvet glide,” then glowing and becoming a conduit), so setting is not just backdrop but an active participant in the ritual. Recurring sensory anchors (indigo paper, silver threads of moonlight, whispered secrets) reinforce the tone without losing spatial clarity. The piece stops short of using the environment to force tactical trade-offs, but it strongly charges the final image of dawn over a transformed haven.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)
    The settings are vivid and purposeful: the crumbling Victorian, Harlan’s rune-cluttered parlor, and especially the rooftop garden under the Perseids all carry distinct sensory signatures and mood. The environment is not mere backdrop—the meteor shower and groaning building explicitly “awaken” the tongue and charge the climax, while the rooftop garden functions as a liminal, private space where their lies can crack. Specifics like night-blooming jasmine, trellises, and dust motes filtered through Elara’s perception deepen atmosphere without obscuring action. The recurring object-as-micro-setting of the desk seal also contributes to charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    The velvet garden, twilight, fountain, and seashell are vividly rendered with specific, sensuous detail that’s consistently filtered through Elara’s grief and magic. Setting interacts with events—the garden pulses, petals wilt and reform, dawn and the thinning veil constrain timing—so it’s more than a backdrop. The recurring shell and the fountain rim work effectively as micro-settings that channel and contain the ritual. It stops just short of 9-band because the garden itself doesn’t strongly constrain or enable choices beyond atmosphere and sympathetic response.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is richly realized—the marble sanctuary, aurora, stalactites, quartz veining—creating a sustained, distinctive atmosphere that filters through Elias’s ritual. Environmental elements meaningfully interact with action: stalactite drips track time and sync with his heartbeat; the marble serves as writing surface; the aurora and “pearl twilight” charge the final image. This is more than postcard description; the space feels like a chosen crucible for absolution. At times the density of description skirts excess, but it remains legible and integrated with the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.0)
    The “serpentine nexus under starlight” and canyon environment are vividly evoked and tonally aligned with the echo motif. The recurring hum, starlight, and stone webs recur and charge the atmosphere, especially in the final image as the hum softens. While the setting rarely constrains choices tactically, it does meaningfully frame the story’s metaphysics of echo and resonance. Details feel selective rather than touristic, and the seashell functions as a micro-setting object.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glacier shrine and the melted snow globe are vividly and specifically rendered, with ice, candles, and refracted light all working together to build a coherent, tactile atmosphere. Setting is not mere backdrop: the globe and ice prisms literally mediate the visions, and the shrine frames the ritual’s stakes and solemnity. The final image—Elara rising in the dimming “borrowed starlight,” locket in hand—leans hard on environmental and object detail for its charge. A slight risk of overload in icy/light imagery is present, but it rarely muddies spatial or emotional clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is a major strength: the rain-slick parapet, lagoon, moon paths, and fireflies are all sensorially vivid and tightly filtered through Kai’s noticing. Environment and tools (parapet, lagoon shore, whisk, net) shape his actions, especially the descent along the moonlit path and the practical use of the whisk. The natural world subtly mirrors his theme of hidden patterns without feeling like a tourist catalog. This atmospheric integration would sit comfortably in a high-end literary venue.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.0)
    The wasteland storms and the orchard’s eerie calm are vividly drawn and grounded in sensory detail, especially the circular boundary where “dust devils died unborn.” The environment meaningfully constrains action: the stillpoint permits unmasked breathing and lush growth, while the outer wasteland and implied warlords frame why the tech is perilous. The orchard and diamond charge the final image as he leaves the calm for the storm again. A bit more tactile interaction with the homestead/orchard as physical obstacles could further integrate setting with moment-to-moment choices.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stormlit observatory, rusted cobalt portico, and cloud sea form a vivid, distinctive environment that feels integral rather than backdrop. Weather and height meaningfully touch action—followers must climb treacherous spires, lightning “crowns” him, shadows pool in city gutters below. Details are sensorially dense and tonally aligned, though occasionally verge on ornamental excess. The final image of the cobalt portico “gleaming like a promise kept” nicely reweights earlier setting motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is vividly realized: the “feral loft beneath the dunes,” marram grass, shipwreck jars, fishers’ huts, and coastal light provide strong sensory grounding. Details are filtered through Elias’s sensibility so they feel lived-in rather than touristic. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain his choices, the loft, dunes, and sea culture do meaningfully charge the premise and final image (returning to the loft at dusk, winding the box again). World rules around the jars and sounds remain consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.3)
    The drift-ice marina and lighthouse are vividly rendered with strong sensory detail—groaning floes, salt, light through crusted windows—and they matter to action (shifting ice, the sprint to the tower, the physical console and lens). The environment evolves with events (ice cracking under sonic pressure, marina transformed into a “cathedral of frozen light”) and clearly charges the final image. At times, description piles up (“fleshly glow,” “ethereal wings,” “prismatic halos”) where a more selective focus under stress would strengthen urgency. Still, place and atmosphere are distinctive, integrated, and thematically aligned with liminality between flesh and ether.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are not mere backdrop; they directly constrain tactics (must wait for the freeze, exploit post-rain conductivity, time the moon’s effect on fields). Sensory specificity is rich and purposeful—“whale-oil lamps,” “crystalline webs,” “slick and gleaming like oiled veins”—and consistently filtered through Elara’s professional gaze. Environmental elements evolve with the plot (storm, rain, freeze, moonrise) and charge the final image of thaw vs rooted revolution. Setting meaningfully shapes both the plan and its symbolic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    The subway maintenance tunnel is vividly rendered—flooded tracks, algae, rusted pipes—and feels both tactile and historically layered via the Underground Railroad echoes. Environmental forces (rain, puddles, slick ladder, reverberating trains) actively shape perception and trigger the memory bleed, not just decorate the backdrop. The lantern functions as a charged tool-object, linking setting to theme and directly charging the final image of her emerging into the storm. The sense of place is specific enough that swapping settings would meaningfully degrade the story.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    The shop is vivid and sensorially rich—“vibrant hush,” dust motes, dangling keys, ticking curios, storm outside—and the environment consistently mirrors and frames the emotional stakes. The weather and light, culminating in the shaft that hits the workbench, charge the repair beat and final image with a quasi-sacral resonance. While the setting doesn’t strictly constrain choices (Elias could have his epiphany elsewhere), it palpably shapes tone and inflects the thematic arc from storm to clarity. The detail level skirts the edge of overdescription but generally feels purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and idiosyncratic: an acid sea, brass workshops, glider carts, and the kaleidoscope all feel specific and sensorially alive (“bobbing like a drunk philosopher,” “sprockets gossiping steam”). The environment underpins the evolution motif, from slime rafts to sky fleets, and the acid sea’s hostility adds a conceptual pressure to ascend. However, beyond thematic contrast, the physical setting rarely constrains concrete choices on the page; Elara rarely has to navigate specific spatial or material limits. The final image of workshops above a forsaken acid sea is striking and charged, but the world remains more backdrop than active shaper of tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Social Nexus Archive is vividly conceived as a “digital mausoleum,” and details like ghost accounts and corporate purgatory help anchor the world. The Odyssey-2519 mission context and Titan setting add a plausible SF layer without overexplaining. However, the environment rarely constrains action beyond the need for clearance, so setting functions more as atmosphere than a true tactical pressure. Still, the archive’s mood of absence meshes well with the premise of lingering digital ghosts.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse orchard and shifting ice floes are vividly imagined and integrated: the feud’s stakes literally hinge on floes grinding beneath roots, and the final map of “floe paths” versus “orchard roots” is setting-as-structure. The vintage store full of salvaged mirrors is both atmospheric and mechanically crucial to the empathic magic. Details tend to be visual, but they are purposeful and filtered through the story’s mythic register rather than feeling touristic. The closing image of beacon, floes, and orchard recharged by the reconstituted orb gives the environment clear thematic and narrative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    The drift-ice marina is richly evoked—the floes clinking like chimes, groaning hulls, diesel and brine, aurora veils—creating a strong, immersive atmosphere. Setting details are filtered through Liora’s death-obsessed lens (ships as wounded beasts, the marina as cathedral), which deepens theme and tone rather than feeling touristic. Environment influences the premise (trawling for bodies/survivors) but only modestly constrains specific choices in the final beats, which keeps it just shy of the very top tier. The parasol tip functions as a micro-setting object charging the final transformation effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    The autumn vineyard, amber pavilion, and vacant station are vividly rendered with multisensory detail that supports tone and theme (“dormant grapes,” “swirling amber leaves”). The setting concretely constrains options (no bus, no taxis; the pavilion as only refuge) and feels lived-in through tactile touches like the clay jug and fallen leaves on the bench. Recurring light imagery (amber glow, lanterns, dawn gilding vines) charges the final image and mirrors Elena’s inner shift. It stops just short of 9-band because the environment, while rich, doesn’t impose much tactical pressure beyond the initial stranding.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the murmuring pavilion, dunes, and kinetic parapet feel sensorially present and conceptually coherent. Environmental rules (no direct gaze, work through “clearings”) are integrated into action, not dumped as exposition. The whisperfield atmosphere and shifting sands meaningfully shape the rite’s method and its delicacy. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain moral choice, it does constrain technique and charges the final image of the humming barrier.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lavender field and rusted factory ruins are vividly rendered and recur throughout, with sensory detail and strong visual contrast between decay and bloom. Setting is tightly integrated with theme—the vines and lavender mirror reclamation and healing—and it charges the final image of vines climbing into the stars. However, the environment rarely constrains concrete choices; it frames and echoes rather than shaping tactics. The surreal acceleration of the vines works symbolically but reduces their plausibility as a live physical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    The shadowed library, dust, chandelier, and dawnlight are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elowen’s attention, building a thick, coherent atmosphere. The setting is not just decorative: the chandelier remnant and the hush of the vaulted chamber directly generate the crystal and the pressure of breaking silence, which in turn charge the final image of the crystal waiting in the library. Environmental details evolve with the scene (dawn rising, the library “exhaling”), and the recurring object-as-setting (crystal) clearly charges the closure. This meets the high-band test where setting actively shapes both action and final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    The fog sculpture garden is richly imagined and integrated: junked tech, driftwood, vinyl, and bone-like spars are not just backdrop but the medium through which he navigates, seeks, and finally finds the nexus. Sensory and conceptual specificity (“shattered cassette shells spilling like decayed petals,” “VCR giant with tape spools for eyes”) deepen tone without losing spatial coherence. Environment constrains and enables tactics—fog requires markers, the amphitheater focuses the sound, the sculptures suggest age and memory. The final nexus sculpture and the ring of driftwood markers decisively charge the closing image, though a touch less ornamental metaphor density would let key details breathe even more.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lunar observatory, crater rim, regolith, and “above Earth’s churning clouds” framing are vivid and integrated with action: moonquakes shake gear, panels threaten to tear away, dust sifts, hydroponic trays rattle. The bonsai functions as a micro-setting object that constrains choice—the falling leaf literally guides the calibration—and the observatory’s position ties directly into the pulsar-stake and escape-velocity motif. World rules (escape velocity, lunar gravity) are stylized but internally consistent enough for this lyric mode. A slightly broader tactile sense of moving through the physical space under duress could deepen it further.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.0)
    The aerie “above the clouds” with glass walls and thin, golden-threaded light is vivid and consistently evoked, and small environmental details (winds, clouds parting, radiance) support the ethereal, liminal mood. The setting does not strongly constrain tactical choices, but it does meaningfully charge the final image of departure and the hospice’s role as a threshold space. Objects like the floating cushions and the vial of wildflower distillation are integrated rather than merely decorative. While not worldbuilding-heavy, the atmosphere feels specific and coherent to this story’s emotional aims.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    The nocturnal observatory on Aetheria and the post-Bending world are vividly and economically rendered with strong, specific details (“crystal spires humming with captured starlight,” “levitation crystals”). Setting is consistently filtered through Elara’s scholarly gaze and supports the tone and concept. It only lightly constrains choices—the observatory and floating isle inform the final “rift below the isle,” but they rarely pressure tactics in-scene. Rich atmosphere and specificity are present, but the environment doesn’t fully charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    The hedge maze and secret garden are vividly realized and tightly tied to action: the overgrown hedges, bowed vines, cracked sundial, and dew-lit roses all actively stage her journey and the ritual. The garden and sundial pedestal are not postcard backdrops; they physically constrain where she can place the tooth and frame the final act, charging the closure image. Sensory details (honeysuckle, unseen bells, moonlight shifting into dawn) reinforce tone and theme rather than digressing. World rules around fae and the garden’s secrecy stay consistent and legible within this short length.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    The serpentine grotto, mist, ocean, and cliffside village are vividly drawn and consistently filtered through Elara’s attention to stars and safety. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the grotto supplies sand and seawater for polishing, the mist justifies the need for a specific kind of light, and the sea glass is a direct gift of place. The recurring grotto/sea glass imagery meaningfully charges the final image of communal visits to the grotto’s edge. A slight tendency toward decorative adjectives aside, the atmosphere and specificity are strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)
    The moss-overgrown data center is vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elara’s perception (moss as “claiming silicon bones,” icicles as neural-network-like patterns). The environment supports tone and theme, functioning as a sanctuary that plausibly enables their protected vulnerability and contrasts with the frenetic outside world. The recurring natural/technological details (racks, circuits, icicles) evolve toward the final image, charging the closure. It doesn’t heavily constraint physical choices, but as an emotional micro-setting it’s richly specific and structurally relevant.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “feral nexus” and misty wildwood are vividly and consistently rendered, with fog, owl calls, and the crossroads atmosphere shaping the entire piece’s mood. The environment exerts real pressure: the nexus winds and undertow threaten to reclaim each hope before Elias can act. The seashell as a charged object integrates with setting and charges the final image as it warms with the last lantern-hope. Description is dense but purposeful, strongly supporting tone and theme without losing spatial coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.3)
    The verdant arbor, woven platform, and amber harvest moon are rendered with vivid, purposeful specificity that consistently colors perception and action. Setting details (the arbor’s heartwood, dawn light, the village below) are tightly tied to the ritual and its outcome, and the final image of thickening vines and lingering hush feels properly charged. The environment doesn’t overtly constrain tactical choices beyond symbolic alignment, but it strongly shapes mood and meaning. Overall, atmosphere is lush without becoming incoherent.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    The withered subarctic orchard and crater are richly realized and never feel like backdrop: the frost-cracked roots, mummified fruit, and rusted cans become literal tools and symbols in the alchemical map. Environmental conditions—cold, still air, frozen auroras—shape what’s possible and how he works, including his physical endurance. The recurring objects (orchard debris, plate, auroras) directly charge the final image of the hovering dome and his climb toward dawn. Detail is dense but purposeful, consistently filtered through his task and grief.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    The marble cavern is vividly and consistently rendered—veins of quartz, echo behavior, fissures admitting light—and its physical properties directly shape his methods and successes. Light shafts, angles, and acoustics aren’t just pretty; they’re the experimental apparatus that constrains what Elias can do and when. Weather and season (frost, wounded sun, thaw) reinforce the wounded-lull atmosphere and subtly parallel the “wounded” mechanism. A slight overabundance of descriptive flourish is the only thing keeping this from pushing even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bronze grotto under starlight is vividly rendered and integrated into action: metallic veins, dripping meltwater, and the apex star-needle affect how she must orient the burner. The environment and the burner as tool directly shape tactics and the final image (bronze-veined calcified monument). Sensory detail is rich and purposeful, even if heavily skewed to the visual and conceptual. The setting’s consistency and role in the climax justify a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft, the rust-hued light, circus posters, trophies, and antique stove are sensuously rendered and clearly filtered through Elara’s gaze as both sanctuary and reliquary. Setting details recur and evolve (rust-hued light on ash wood, sawdust echoes from the circus grounds) to mirror her emotional state without feeling like static décor. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, it strongly charges the mood and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    The kinetic lagoon, hovering carousel, cloud-bridges, and lily pads create a vivid, idiosyncratic environment that’s integral rather than decorative. Setting is strongly filtered through Elias’s exhausted, regret-focused lens, with the lagoon’s stilled motion and the carousel’s halted spin mirroring his internal erosion. The micro-setting of the lily pad and lagoon heart meaningfully host and shape the ghost encounter and the final image of the discarded wheel. World rules are dreamlike but internally consistent and tonally precise.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    The abandoned spaceport is vividly realized through tactile details (cracked ferrocrete, shattered viewports, crumpled ticket stubs), and the derelict infrastructure directly feeds the plot via conduits, generators, and skylights. The sextant’s alignment with Polaris through the cracked dome nicely marries setting, tool, and action. Atmosphere—carnival detritus fading into eerie quiet—supports the theme of repurposed intentions. The environment constrains tactics somewhat but could press harder on her physically or logistically for an even higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    The soundless sanctuary, crystal forecourt, and post-rain environment are vividly and consistently rendered, with strong sensory specificity (mosaic of crystal shards, droplets trembling along facets, hidden sunrise through mist). Setting is not mere backdrop: the glacial hush and crystals’ whispering behavior shape how sound intrudes and how the climax manifests. The recurrence of the forecourt from threshold pause to final innocent gleam meaningfully charges the ending image. At times the density of description borders on luxuriant excess, but it rarely muddies spatial or emotional clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    The twilight canal, willows, mist, mudflats, and wreck are vividly rendered and clearly filtered through Elias’s professional eye. The environment shapes action modestly (mud, depth, wreck access) and the recurring sundial functions as a tool/object that charges the closing image. At times the description edges into luxuriant repetition, but it still serves tone and character more than it stalls. Overall, atmosphere is a major asset here.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is a standout: the golden dock under snow, fog, wrack, and harbor sounds all feel tactile and lived-in, and they’re consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility. Weather and environment shape tone and focus (the fog’s enclosure, the snow’s hush) and charge the final image of Elias resuming his seed work “richer now with woven wisdom.” Objects like the dock, rope, and fulgurite act as quasi-micro-settings, constraining attention and choice. The only thing keeping this just under the very top band is that the dock and weather rarely impose hard constraints on action; they’re more atmospheric than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    The shadowed autumn garden and palace ruins are rendered with exceptional sensory specificity and atmosphere (“sky bruised purple by dusk,” “overgrown rose arbors heavy with thorny hips”). The environment meaningfully charges choices: the remnant palace explains the thread; the garden’s decay mirrors and focuses the healing work; the final sense of harbor is inseparable from this place. The thread-as-object and garden-as-harbor both reappear in the ending image, reweighted by his transformation. It’s lavish, but the detail generally remains purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    The suspended palace, stalactites, and mechanical abyss below are strikingly specific and carry a coherent aesthetic. Setting is integrated with action—the palace groans and shudders in parallel with Elarion’s experiment, and the rusted gears below briefly respond to the chick’s song. The bioluminescent fungi chamber and scavenged vaults feel lived-in and filtered through Elarion’s sensibility rather than as neutral catalog. Environment does lightly constrain stakes (the palace might fall; the mechanical world resists beauty), though it rarely forces explicit tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and particular—obsidian lagoon, dunes, kelp, volcanic sand—filtered through Lira’s sensibility and tightly aligned with fire/water/scar imagery. Environmental details (black sand, rootstocks, shards) are not postcard; they participate in the action and theme. The atmosphere is strong and coherent, though at times the density of imagery edges toward lushness that risks overshadowing movement.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “city of forgotten fountains” and the bruised autumn sky with frozen geese create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s heavily integrated into action (the fountain network literally guides her and supplies the key). Details like mossed marble basins, dry lips of stone, and sidereal reflections feel specific and purposeful, not touristic. The environment directly shapes her path and the final reanimation of the city, though it stops just short of imposing truly constraining physical or social limits on her.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    The nebula garden is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elowen’s sensibility—petals as time, gas blooms as flowers, the core as a pulsing nursery. Environment and recurring objects (petals, core, throne, gear) meaningfully charge the final image: her legacy is literally wired into the setting. World rules (sonar pinging, petal-sigh timescale, oracle engine shard) feel internally consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition dumps. The setting does more than decorate; it structures the stakes around cycles, beauty masking decay, and the possibility of subtle intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    The greenhouse, fractured glass, humidity, and the river of butterflies create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s tightly married to theme—this is a “living cathedral” whose seasons and architecture embody transformation and accumulation of grief. The butterflies and ribbon act as recurring environmental/micro-setting motifs that charge the final image of interconnected sorrow. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, it deeply shapes the ritual tactics (meeting at dusk, following past migration paths). The time of day and migration season are consistently woven into action, not just painted on as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tidal obsidian ridge, the sea, and the interior of the clock tower are vividly realized and integrated with Elias’s perceptions and vocation. The environment constrains his access (low tide path, slick stone) and mirrors his internal struggle, while the pendulum and chamber atmosphere (“oil and salt”) act as a micro-setting for the climax. The ridge and tower also charge the final image as they shift from adversarial to allied, anchoring the thematic turn. A bit more direct interaction between physical peril and the climactic act could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cemetery, cobalt silo, dust-moted interior, and carefully arranged tools create a rich, coherent atmosphere filtered through Elias’s sensibility. Setting details are specific and recur meaningfully (silo as echo source and ritual locus, tapestry on the crate, chessboard against the curved wall), charging the final image. Environment doesn’t sharply constrain physical choices, but it does tightly frame the story’s possibilities and tone. The sensory texture is consistently purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    The obsidian spire, frozen lake, and auroras are vividly rendered and integrated with stakes: the eternal ice, geothermal vents, and enforcer patrols all grow directly from the environment. Setting details like ink distilled from lake minerals and fungi bred from “spire shadows” feel specific and world-consistent rather than postcard décor. The lake’s cracks and groans mirror systemic strain and charge the final poised moment with the sense that the world itself is on the brink. This environment meaningfully shapes options and atmosphere, not just backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ember alcove, mist, dust, and luminous dial are vividly rendered and tightly woven into action (dust rising, refracting the dial’s glow, forming images). Setting and atmosphere directly charge the premise and final image: mist and alcove as concealment, embers and dust as story-medium. The environment meaningfully shapes options (hidden, pirate transmission from a fringe) and underwrites the closing sense of the world whispering anew. Some metaphor density approaches ornamental, but most details remain purposeful and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Vanishing Point Gallery, the illusory walls, and especially the rocking chair and mask create a strong, unified atmosphere that is both eerie and mournful. Setting is filtered tightly through Elias’s lens—gears as “kinetic elegy,” vanishing point swallowing ash—and directly charges the final image of the scattered dust. The environment is not just decorative; its rules of perspective mirror and constrain his emotional choices. Specific touches like aged wood polish and dim glow make the space tactile without feeling over-described.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and particular: “sunken city ruins,” “bioluminescent fungi,” “primordial ooze hugging bedrock,” and sewer conduits feel tactile and integrated with his actions. The environment constrains and enables tactics (he can excavate because of the sediment layers and ruins; he lives in the sewer because the city is drowned), and the chronometer’s survival through “salt and pressure” reinforces world physics and theme. The city’s drowned grandeur subtly mirrors the burial of rational methods. Description is dense but purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    The velvet library, autumn leaves, and rain-streaked panes are vividly rendered and recur, giving the piece a lush, coherent atmosphere that matches the contemplative tone. The zither and its rosette operate as a micro-setting-object that anchors action and final imagery. Still, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; it’s a beautifully staged sanctuary more than an active pressure source. The result is strong, evocative setting that remains mostly tonal rather than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rusted greenhouse, outlawed growth, celestial alignment, and plant textures are vivid and specific, strongly colored by Elias’s culinary sensibility. Setting consistently feels tactile (rusted beams, dew-slick leaves, iridescent veins) and supports the tone. The environment meaningfully constrains choice—this place is both illegal and uniquely fertile under the alignment—and charges the final image of the sprouting seed. A bit more interplay between physical danger of the location and his actions could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “nectar dusk,” lightning tower, and drone hive are vivid and specific, integrated into action rather than decorative. The world rules of lightning-harvesting drones and the queen crystal feel coherent and are learned via Mira’s understanding, not a static dump. Spatial and atmospheric anchors (booth, stairs, apex hive) are clear and recur, culminating in the final image of electric honey and tower whispers. The environment constrains choices (toll booth, need to climb the tower during blackout) in a way that supports the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    The quiet bay, spring light, blossoms, and “daydreaming” streetlights create a rich, coherent atmosphere that strongly supports the story’s hushed mood. The orris scent, pebbled paths, and specific house details are well-filtered through Elias’s perception. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain his options, recurring environmental cues (bay, streetlights, mist) do charge the final image. The setting feels lived-in and particular rather than generic, though it remains more tonal than tactically consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underwater city garden is vividly, specifically rendered—bioluminescent anemones, coral-crusted arches, bubble-fountains, kelp, and marble statuary all contribute to a coherent atmosphere. Details are well filtered through Elara’s state, with “animate lifelessness” mirroring her shaken certainty. The setting participates modestly in action (the ampoule in silt, the garden subtly responding at the end), though it rarely constrains choices in a hard way. Even so, the final image of the garden “whispering life anew” smartly charges prior environmental detail with thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.7)
    The infinite staircase and void are vividly rendered and coherently strange, with nice touches like the “golden mean helix” and landings that “curve impossibly into themselves.” The environment meaningfully constrains options—he can only climb and work within this architecture—and directly informs his model of perpetual motion. The dice and the staircase together form an effective micro-setting at the end, charging the final image. Some sensory variety beyond abstract light, motion, and math could deepen the atmosphere further.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rooftop greenhouse above a smog-choked city is vivid, sensorial, and thematically apt—ferns/orchids as resilience against pollution, saffron ink against gray air. Environment is not just backdrop: elevation and glass panes allow the glyphs to visibly touch the city, and the final image of him asleep among pots under glowing symbols is charged. The moon, brush, and greenhouse together form an effective micro-setting constellation. A slightly stronger sense of physical constraint (cold, fragility, risk) could make the setting even more tactically decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto city, Veilfall, ice walls, bioluminescent fungi, and rosewater scent create a richly immersive, coherent environment filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Setting is not decorative: the frozen waterfall and impending thaw directly constrain options and drive the evacuation, while secret vents and the cavern structure shape their escape route. The opera lens and honey operate as charged micro-setting elements that color perception and memory. Occasionally the descriptive density verges on overrich, but it largely supports tone and stakes rather than stalling them.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the rocky island, hunger stone, and lighthouse all constrain options (low tide’s window, the slick path, the lens as the final conduit). Details like the “low tide’s exhale,” the stone’s skeletal fish runes, and the beam sweeping “like a skeptical eye” are concrete and atmospherically precise. Environment directly shapes action (access to the stone, the lighthouse height and lens, the sea reclaiming the stone), and the final image of the altered lighthouse beam is charged by all prior groundwork. Description skirts purple at times, but it remains purposeful and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    The funhouse is vividly rendered through smell, sound, and warped mirrors, and it is not just wallpaper: the mirror chamber births and hosts Fear, and the fortune-teller’s booth and scattered Polaroids supply crucial tools. Details like “mirrors weep mercury tears” and floors “groaning like lovers in agony” maintain a specific, grotesque atmosphere keyed to Elara’s state. The opera clasp functions almost as a micro-setting object, accruing charge and constraining her options at the climax. Some imagery leans toward excess, but the environment consistently shapes both mood and action.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and tightly integrated: the floating orchard, driftwood ring, apples, and storm-tossed sea all become both threat and resource. Environmental shifts (rogue waves, incoming debris, cloud formations) directly shape tactics and options, not just mood. The orchard and driftwood constraining where he can stand and what he can build gives the world physical stakes. While heavily visual and metaphor-rich, the atmosphere is coherent and supports the concept rather than feeling like a disconnected backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, original, and continuously functional: the fused turtle shells, rusted inter-shell gate, bridges, and shell-glyphs aren’t just pretty—they determine what’s possible and how Elara acts. Environmental details are filtered through her cartographic and pattern-obsessed gaze, so description feels character-specific rather than touristic. Key setting features (the shell rim, the fissure, phosphorescent brine, the drifting city) directly drive and embody the central turn. This falls just shy of 9+ because while the environment strongly frames cost, we don’t quite see a specific, tactical choice constrained by physical layout at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    The disused station, ivy, and rosebush are vividly evoked and consistently threaded through the piece, with the ivy/overgrowth metaphor nicely echoing the theme of obscured truth. Spatial orientation is clear: platform, waiting room, tunnel, locker all map cleanly to his actions. The environment primarily serves atmosphere and symbolism rather than constraining choices, but it does charge the final image of the station fading and ivy “whispering surrender.” Some descriptive density edges toward reiteration, yet overall specificity is strong and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.5)
    The estuary, causeway, rising tide, and submerged pavilion are vividly and consistently rendered, with strong tactile and visual detail that fits the mood. Water level, stone, and weather actively constrain Elias’s options, especially as the pavilion submerges to chest and then roof height. At times, figurative language edges toward ornamental excess, but the environment never feels generic or ungrounded. The recurring object-as-setting of the pavilion itself meaningfully charges the final image of a restored monument underpinned by hidden notes.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    The underwater library and sunken city are vividly realized and integrated into action: sodden shelves, moss-slick floors, failing arcane lanterns, flooded corridors, and the blackout all shape what she can do. Setting constrains tactics (she must feel rather than see; the blackout enables the shadow-ink hypothesis) and supports tone throughout. The antique stamp and vault inscriptions function as micro-setting elements that directly gate progress and charge the final image. A touch more concrete interaction with the “sunken” condition (pressure of water, bodily logistics) could deepen realism but doesn’t harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating island tea garden and glass basilica are vividly rendered and integrated into action—the tea, mists, and dream-quartz roots supply tools; the basilica’s glass archives shape the ritual and final image. Environmental details track Elar’s emotional state without feeling like a static backdrop, and the last image (cranes over the garden, stars revealed) recharges the setting meaningfully. The world rules (dream-quartz, floating isle, dream-archive basilica) stay consistent. Description is lush but still purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    The floating observatory and scorched planet are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Elara’s perceptions (“suspended a mile above the scorched earth,” “planet pocked by craters”). Setting is not postcard: anti-grav coils, null-grav spindle, and atmospheric null points directly shape where and how she can find the energy pools. The crystal and core chamber function as charged micro-settings that constrain action and charge the final image. World rules (virtual particles, vacuum energy) are sketched efficiently and stay internally consistent within the story’s speculative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    The observatory, cliff, dusk, and brass instruments are vivid and consistent, with the environment (ancient dome, vault, star-slits) concretely enabling the necessary actions. Elara’s professional attention to the sky and drones filters setting details through her biases, keeping description purposeful. The dome, chip, and star trails all participate in the final image, giving the place thematic weight rather than mere backdrop. A bit more non-visual sensory texture or physical constraint could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cobalt terrace, jagged shore, and driftwood carvings are vivid, sensorial, and filtered through Elias’s guilt-ridden gaze. The environment participates in meaning: the shore as a place of drowned bodies and “bones of drowned ships” ties directly to the grandfather’s crime and Elias’s trade in buried truths. The watch hand and terrace recur in the final image, charging the ending with physicalized stakes. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain his choices, it meaningfully mirrors and sharpens the internal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    The storm-worn parapet, mist, and wind create a strong, coherent atmosphere that aligns with the liminal, precarious emotional terrain. The recurring object—the drawer pull—functions as a micro-setting tool, anchoring physical action and charging the final transfer with accumulated meaning. Environmental elements (slick stone, howling wind) are present but influence mood more than concrete tactics. The world-building around clans, vaults, and lunar pacts is suggestive and consistent, though leaning slightly toward familiar fantasy texture.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting work is rich and purposeful: the bruised-orange sea, overcast sky, and "lanky sentinels" of utility poles are all filtered through a seaman’s eye. Environment constrains tactics (kayak vs waves, no stars, reliance on shoreline infrastructure), and weather directly impacts action in the rogue swell. The kayak, shattered compass, and poles function as a micro-ecosystem of tools and constraints, and the poles/star alignment explicitly charges the final image. Occasionally the imagery verges on lush for the scene’s urgency, but spatial and sensory anchors remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    The settings—the sterile post-procedure haze, cluttered apartment, rusted subways, and bioluminescent lake—are vivid, sensorial, and thematically aligned with memory and choice. The underground environment does more than decorate: the fungi, abandoned stations, and glowing water are integrated into how Jax navigates and how the labyrinth’s illusions manifest. The micro-setting of the lake in particular charges the final image by embodying branching futures. A slightly tighter tether between the physical maze and concrete constraints on his choices would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    The fairy-tale orchard, permanent moonlight, phoenix tree, and specific spices create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere with strong sensory texture. World rules (phoenix ash yielding star-anise, griffin lairs yielding void-pepper) are consistent and bound to action, not dumped. The setting does more than decorate; it provides the necessary tools and defines their new role as orchard guardians. Occasionally the density of decorative description outpaces its functional pressure, but not enough to break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    The midnight glade above the clouds is intensely realized through tactile and sensory detail—the “perfumed mist,” “starry moss,” and “obsidian branches” all feel specific and inhabited. The setting is not just decorative: it’s explicitly a site for “cloudbound repentance,” and its vapors and altar shape the ritual and the thematic atmosphere of suffocating beauty. Recurring objects function as micro-setting (the birthday tablecloth, the saucer, the mechanism) and charge the final image of descent. At times the density skirts purple, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    The recycled spaceship, battlecruiser hull, and corridor of faded photographs provide a vivid, specific environment that feels lived in and tonally apt. Setting details aren’t just ornamental: the photos’ tear-shimmer becomes the activation method and “ink” for her stitching, and the console and ship body are integral to the final act. The recurring image of recycled war-machines repurposed for mercy subtly mirrors the thematic transformation. A bit more sensory variety beyond the visual could heighten immersion, but as-is the atmosphere is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is lush, specific, and integrated: black sand, Mount Ebon, bioluminescent shallows, and the celestial alignment all create a charged, coherent world. The environment meaningfully shapes stakes—the volcano’s latent threat, the black sands as prophesied site, and the planetary “slow dance” as a temporal constraint. Details are strongly filtered through mood and theme (“obsidian sands gleamed under starfire,” the volcano’s “heartbeat”). Occasionally the density of description verges on ornamental, but it rarely confuses or stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    The luminous fort, phosphor veins, igniter crystals, and half-painted sundial create a vivid, coherent environment that feels specific to this world. Setting details actively matter: the blackout and phosphor reserves constrain tactics; the sundial and vault architecture become functional tools. The atmospheric touches (twilight, “winking hush”) support tone, if sometimes overinsisted. World rules about light-hoarding and blackout tests are consistent enough to support the premise without distracting exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tidal bluff, aurora, frictionless world, and star-dust all feel vividly particular and are tightly integrated into action rather than feeling like backdrop. The absence of friction and the tidal sands materially affect how Kael moves, how the dust behaves, and how the ritual can only happen under specific conditions. The aurora’s “borrowed dawn” and the bluff itself charge the final image, making the environment inseparable from the story’s emotional logic. A slightly wider sensory range beyond the visual could have deepened immersion further, but what’s here is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stormlit observatory above the clouds is richly realized and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility—lightning as scars, the storm as purifier, the valley as a “distant bruise.” The environment meaningfully shapes perspective: being above the fray enables his cartographic insight and the notion of the observatory as beacon/relay for other poets. Objects like the darkroom timer and bus timetable are well-integrated into the setting rather than feeling randomly grafted on. The main reason this doesn’t go higher is that the physical environment rarely constrains his options beyond mood and vantage.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.0)
    The glass atrium, brook, rain, and half-painted sundial are vivid and consistently woven into action—the sundial enables the cipher, the glass prisms and shattering pane shape both visuals and beats, and the brook threads through as a counterpoint. Setting is filtered through Elias’s philosophical and geometric preoccupations, which keeps it character-specific rather than touristic. The environment modestly constrains choice (the sundial as deciphering tool, light angles, the pane breaking to create mist) but could press on tactics even more. Overall, it’s textured, purposeful atmosphere that supports the story’s mood and key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rusted, star-leaking prison library is intensely and consistently realized; details like cracked shelves, tarp patches, rebar scaffolds, and soil pilfered from the yard are tactile and plot-relevant. Environment constrains and enables action (cracks for seeds, hidden coffee tin, nighttime work under moonlight), not just mood. The motif of light through fractures and stars through holes effectively mirrors the thematic “luminous fracture” without feeling purely ornamental. A slight tendency toward descriptive density skirts purple prose but doesn’t undermine spatial or atmospheric clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tidal arbor above a cloudsea, gravity-defying tides, and magnetic whims of the compasses create a highly specific, atmospheric world that feels distinct and coherent. Environmental forces (roaring surges, labyrinthine branches, prism-leaves, the sanctuary grove where rules shift) meaningfully constrain and enable tactics. Recurring objects-as-setting—the clock, compasses, piano—charge the final image and reconfigure meaning at closure. Descriptive richness edges toward excess at times, but it remains clear and purposeful rather than static postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is lushly realized—“ancient ridge in bloom,” levitating petals, humming orchids, monsoon haze—and consistently filtered through Elara’s empiricist perception. Environmental elements matter: the ridge is the ritual site, the blooms and carvings carry ancestral weight, and the looming monsoon frames urgency and the final charged image. World rules (empirically whimsical magic) stay stable and are shown via action rather than exposition. The ridge and its flora also charge the last look-back silhouette, giving the environment thematic as well as sensory resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.5)
    The islet, rain, mist, bonsai garden, and spectral galleon tree create a vivid, coherent atmosphere, and the recurring cerulean sky/sea image effectively mirrors the internal arc. Setting is consistently filtered through Elara’s emotional state, which keeps it from feeling like a catalog. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or tactics; it is more mood-scape than functional stage, so it doesn’t fully charge decisions. The bonsai galleon and embedded compass come closest to operating as micro-setting that matters to the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.7)
    The atmospheric details of the "skeletal maze" and "sodden earth" are vivid and effectively ground the opening. The setting mirrors the theme of decay well, though the specific mechanics of the experiment obscure the physical reality of the space later in the story.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is established with vivid sensory details ("frost-lit," "kiln's fury"), effectively grounding the action in a specific atmosphere. However, the environmental mechanics (frost maps) feel more like plot devices than integrated world constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "winterglass" and "heat-mapping" concepts are vivid and functionally integrate the silence constraint, grounding the fantasy. However, the repeated insertion of the phrase "unshaken marvels" feels like a museum label rather than an organic part of the world's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is immersive and specific, with details like "bioluminescent anemones" and "ruined aqueducts" grounding the fantasy. The physical reality of the drowned library actively constrains options and shapes the magic.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is established with functional descriptors ("parched earth," "olive groves"), but remains a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker constraining choice. The repeated phrase "amplified quiet" acts as a mechanical tag rather than an atmospheric tool. Spatial choreography is vague, as the narrative zooms out to cover broad spans of time.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.7)
    The setting is atmospheric and visually distinct, with the viaduct and wisteria providing a clear backdrop. However, the descriptions are repetitive ("foggy lucidity" appears multiple times) and the environment functions more as set dressing than a source of constraint or tactical opportunity.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is imaginative and integral to the logic of the story ("saddle-curved paths"), effectively grounding the abstract concept. However, descriptions occasionally prioritize ornamental adjectives ("verdant," "fathomless") over spatial clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is established with vivid but overwrought "purple" descriptions ("cotton candy ghosts," "forgotten dreams") that function more as atmosphere than tactile constraint. While the floorboard and shelf are used, the environment generally feels like a static backdrop for the action.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptional, blending the "bioluminescent apple boughs" and "skeletal husks" into a toolkit that Elias actively uses to solve the problem. The environment constrains the materials (orchard sap, wreck silences) and charges the final image, making the location indispensable to the plot. Sensory details are vivid and filtered strictly through the protagonist's unique perception.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is colorful but leans heavily on a limited palette of adjectives ("emerald," "golden," "luminous") that feels decorative rather than atmospheric. While the station is visualized, the description feels static and adjective-heavy rather than lived-in or pressuring.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.0)
    The visual of the thawing control room is distinct and establishes the atmosphere well ("rivulets that mapped forgotten circuits"). However, the setting becomes a passive backdrop for the monologue rather than a source of constraints or resources that Elias must struggle against. The physics of the furnace fuel source undermines the verisimilitude of the craft.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=2.8)
    The setting is established through heavy adjectival description ("rusted," "roiling," "warped") rather than character interaction or constraint. The environment functions as a static backdrop for the summary rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.0)
    While the atmosphere of the "storm-tossed ridge fort" is established, the setting relies on the mechanical repetition of static phrases like "ambered hush" and "pebble-shore." This reduces the environment to a checklist of descriptors rather than a lived-in space that constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.1)
    Atmospheric details like the "violet sky" and "ice-crusted snow" establish a solid visual baseline. However, the setting exerts little physical pressure on the robotic protagonist, serving mostly as a passive backdrop for the internal monologue rather than a source of constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is atmospheric but leans into "purple" abstraction ("crystal whispering forecourt," "symphony too soft for words") rather than concrete grounding. While the environment is vivid, it functions more as a passive backdrop for the magic system than a constraint that pressures the characters' choices. The sensory details are often generic ("glistening facet," "mirror sheen").

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    Eldergrove is vividly realized as a "paradox of blooming opulence and withering decay," acting effectively as both setting and distinct character. The physical space constrains the auditors while aiding Elias, though some descriptive phrases lean toward density ("shadowed convolutions").

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting contains evocative sensory phrases ("recycled starlight," "iridescent alloy"), but often drifts into purple prose ("velvet shroud") that distances the reader. The station feels like a generic sci-fi backdrop for the central device rather than a lived-in environment that pressures the protagonist. The "hush" provides some atmospheric grounding, but spatial clarity is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.3)
    The atmosphere of the "flooded opera house" is the story's strongest asset, providing vivid, specific imagery ("lanterns bobbing," "sodden"). However, the spatial logic wavers during the climax—the transition from a dry ledge to a foundation-threatening torrent is difficult to track physically within the established geography.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with the "knife-edge peak" and "barometer's ticking" successfully grounding the mystical elements. The physical engagement with the station—boots on worn planking, the kerosene lamp—creates a tactile reality that balances the internal abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.7)
    The atmosphere is effectively damp and industrial, with specific details like the "beaded valve wheel" and "silt" grounding the scene. However, reliance on adjectival stacking ("damp gloom," "skeletal machinery") occasionally clutters the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting is atmospherically consistent but relies heavily on "adjective-noun" pairings ("vine-choked tomes," "dust-shrouded scrolls") rather than specific, grounded interaction. While vivid, the world operates on dream logic where stone yields to bare hands, reducing the sense of physical solidity and constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting suffers from purple abstraction ("hush of dreaming roots") and botanical inaccuracies ("sage trees arching overhead" for low shrubs). The description feels like a backdrop for keywords rather than a grounded, physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "displaced axis" effectively constrains the physical space (leaning bookshelves, warped gravity), adding tangible texture to the setting. However, the "bronze quiet" atmosphere is established through repetitive labeling rather than varied sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.2)
    The lighthouse setting is integrated well into the climax via the beam's manipulation. However, descriptors often lean on generic tropes ("wind howled," "craggy rocky island," "scarred oak") rather than specific, sensory observation.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "dimensional anchor" is evocative but remains an abstract "white room" filled with metaphors ("whispering voids," "edges curling") rather than tactile grounding. While the loop pedal adds a specific physical anchor, the surrounding space operates on dream logic that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=4.5)
    Atmosphere is vivid but relies on purple prose that occasionally breaks logic ("transparent as breath on glass" implies opacity/fog). The setting details are largely decorative, framing the scene without strictly constraining the protagonist's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting blends "ancient stones" with "algorithms," creating a jarring dissonance that feels unearned rather than intriguing. While visual details are vivid (suspended raindrops), the environment feels synthetic—a video game level description rather than a lived-in space that constrains the protagonist. The "glowing viaduct" serves as a stage but lacks tactile interaction beyond the initial entry.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.7)
    The drum maker's cavern is grounded with good sensory details regarding vibration and acoustics, which fit the protagonist's deafness. However, the forced repetition of specific descriptors (e.g., "audibly muted") breaks immersion and highlights the artificiality of the construction.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with vivid specifics like "lightning fractals" and "bruised purple" skies. However, some descriptors drift into ornamental territory ("forgotten scars," "fog-shrouded alleys") without strictly serving the action.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.3)
    The setting is vivid but drowned in adjectival clutter ("dew-kissed," "mist-shrouded," "verdant gloom"). While the UV lighting provides a visual anchor, the description often stalls momentum to focus on ornamental details rather than constraints that shape the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is established with vivid, if slightly adjectival, sensory details like "ruddy walls" and "bioluminescent script" that ground the supernatural elements. The grotto provides a functional backdrop that constrains the interaction, though the atmosphere relies heavily on standard literary-fantasy tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and acoustically grounded; the "sunken orchard greenhouse" and "bowed ribs" of shipwrecks actively shape the soundscape and the ritual. The physical environment meaningfully constrains the action and enhances the central concept.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is excellent, with the "amber grotto" and "static electricity" integrated directly into the magic system rather than serving as mere backdrop. Sensory details like the "crackling" static and specific scents (bergamot, vetiver) ground the fantastical elements in a tactile reality. The environment actively constrains and enables the protagonist's method.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is functional but generic ("starry canopy," "breezy library") and does not constrain action. The "mistake shelves" concept is a nice touch but acts more as a prop than a pressure cooker for the scene's central choice.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting relies on a density of visual adjectives ("shimmering," "crystalline," "translucent," "iridescent") that creates a generic ethereal vibe without constraining character action. The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a physical space with rules or limitations that shape the plot tactics. Sensory details are repetitive and abstract, lacking the tactile specificity needed to ground the high-concept fantasy elements.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, blending the architectural verticality of the canals with the mythic scale of the sleeping giant. The environment actively constrains the plot—the giant's nap determining the timeline, the water's flow mirroring the sleep—integrating world-building directly into the narrative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and well-integrated, with the "stalactite kiss" and "silver needles" creating a cohesive atmosphere. The specific details of the orchard and the mosaic stone actively constrain the ritual's methodology, satisfying the requirement for setting to shape action. The "glass eye" object is handled well within the physical space, grounding the abstract magic.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.1)
    Specific details like "pipe chases" and "dust motes" ground the setting effectively in the "crawl space" reality. However, the atmospheric descriptors are repetitive ("sapphire" appears four times), and the lighting effects feel static rather than dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.0)
    Sensory details are vivid ("verdant fuzz," "droplet's prism"), and the trellis serves as a necessary physical constraint for the transformation. The setting actively supports the climax, though the description occasionally veers into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is established with vivid, if occasionally overwrought, sensory details ("kelp clung like war banners"). The tidal island and rain provide a solid atmospheric container. However, the "water wars" backdrop feels like set dressing rather than a source of immediate tactical constraint; the environment serves more as a thematic mirror than a physical pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is vividly described with specific sensory details ("scent of damp stone and ozone," "chime"). The cave's properties successfully constrain the action and trigger the conflict, though some descriptors lean toward standard fantasy tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.8)
    The atmospheric details of the "alabaster docks" and "ocean spray" establish a consistent visual palette, though the descriptions become repetitive. While the setting is vivid, it functions largely as a backdrop for the magic system rather than offering resistance or constraining the protagonist's choices in a tactile way.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    The atmospheric description of the vault and phantom train is vivid and anchors the scene well ("cracked glass dome," "swirling fog"). However, the sensory details often feel filtered through a heavy adjectival layer that distances the reader from the physical immediacy of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting of the tower and cliffs is established with some vivid sensory details like "salt air" and "thunder." However, the environment rarely constrains the protagonist's choices; it functions primarily as an atmospheric backdrop. The alignment of the tile with the star chart is a nice specific action, though the logic connecting it to the setting is somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=4.3)
    The "prismatic escondite" is described through abstract sensory overload ("refracted light," "crystal lattices") rather than concrete, lived-in detail. The setting functions as a backdrop for the special effects of the climax but does not constrain the character's choices or offer tactical resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is established with vivid, sensory-rich specificity ("arterial glow," "chemical zest," "carboys"), effectively grounding the surreal elements in a tangible, atmospheric space. The funeral home prep room feels distinct and lived-in, enhancing the tone significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bonsai labyrinth and workshop are vividly realized, grounding the surreal premise in specific, tactile details like "rice paper" and "gold leaf dust." The setting actively participates in the climax, reacting to Thorne’s revelations, though the descriptions occasionally verge on the decorative rather than the functional.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the tidal constraints effectively shape movement and access within the labyrinth. The sensory details ("salt-laced wind," "muddy paths," "breached hull") ground the high-concept premise in a tactile reality, providing necessary friction against the abstract "layering" mechanic.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting is established with vivid, if occasionally ornamental, sensory details like "salt-crusted stones" and "dust motes." However, the observatory functions more as a static backdrop than a pressure cooker; the environment does not constrain Elias's choices or force tactical shifts. The atmosphere is consistent but leans on abstract descriptors ("perpetual dusk") over concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.2)
    Sensory details are vivid ("bioluminescent lanterns," "neon-lit frenzy") but often list-like. The setting feels like a static backdrop; the physical reality of the rafts (their weight, drift, connection) is described rather than felt through the character's interaction with the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.3)
    Atmospheric descriptions of the lunar landscape are vivid, but technical details strain credibility—specifically pouring liquid acid in a vacuum environment. The setting supports the mood but the physical mechanics of the "external reaction chamber" feel contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.6)
    Sensory details are abundant but often rely on visual descriptions ("gleaming," "iridescent," "prismatic rainbows") that clash with the blind point of view. While the "mist-coated" atmosphere is established, the setting details feel like generic genre tropes rather than specific, lived-in constraints that shape the character's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is established with standard descriptors ("rusted," "corrugated," "frozen") but functions largely as a backdrop rather than a source of pressure. The atmosphere is asserted through the repeated phrase "worrying tranquility" rather than evoked through sensory details that constrain the character.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting relies on purple abstractions like "shadows clung like forgotten whispers" rather than concrete, tactile grounding that shapes the action. While the archway and cobblestones are present, they function as generic fantasy staging rather than a specific environment that constrains the character's choices. The descriptions are repetitive and detached from the protagonist's immediate physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is visually established but relies on fantasy defaults (bioluminescence, runes) rather than singular details. The atmospheric effect is undermined by the repetitive insertion of the phrase "lonesome splendor" as a tag rather than an organic mood.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the "lighthouse prison" and "confessional lattice" are evocative concepts, the setting description suffers from severe lexical fatigue. The relentless repetition of abstract descriptors like "copperlight" and "repose" flattens the specificity, replacing vivid sensory detail with a static, monochromatic wash.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.1)
    The atmospheric details ("venom-apple vine," "frostbitten evening") are vivid, but the setting suffers from the mechanical repetition of the "winter-cracked fields" refrain. The greenhouse environment is established well, but the repeated descriptors flatten the specificity over time.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is atmospherically described with vivid color ("crimson embrace," "bruised twilight"), but lacks tactile grounding. The physics of sewing stone and the layout of the labyrinth remain abstract, functioning more as a backdrop for the fable-like tone than a tangible environment constraining the character.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the "catacomb orchard" offers distinct visuals, the setting descriptions are often generic ("sacred mountain," "old pilgrim rites") and overwritten ("spectral warnings"). The atmosphere is undermined by the mechanical repetition of prompt phrases ("cautious enchantment") which prevents immersion in the physical reality of the space.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is vivid and specifically rendered ("synthetic pigeons," "brass railings," "dew-kissed tiles"), successfully grounding the scene. However, the description leans toward the ornamental, occasionally cluttering the pacing with adjectives that tell the reader how to feel about the environment ("futuristic nostalgia") rather than letting the imagery do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.0)
    The atmospheric details of the cobalt observatory and autumn hills establish a strong, consistent mood that grounds the magical elements. Specific imagery like the "crimson bead" and "swirling galaxies" works well, though the setting remains largely a static backdrop rather than an active force constraining the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.1)
    The mangrove labyrinth is visually distinct, offering some concrete imagery like the "glass-like" leaves and "silver veins" of moonlight. However, the setting operates largely as a backdrop for the magic system rather than a pressure cooker that forces adaptation; the "spirit-thorn" injury is healed almost instantly, negating its impact as an environmental hazard.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is rendered through heavy adjectival layering ("mist-clad," "bruised silvers") that creates a static, decorative backdrop rather than a pressurized environment. While the atmosphere is consistent, it fails to constrain the protagonist's options or impact the tactical unfolding of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=5.8)
    Atmospheric descriptions are vivid, but the setting lacks narrative pressure; the environment cooperates ("fog parting," "fog blushing") rather than constraining the protagonist. The location serves as a passive backdrop rather than a crucible for choice.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "sound wave garden" is an imaginative concept with vivid, if adjective-heavy, descriptions ("tendrils of waveform flora"). The setting physically enables the plot mechanics (reflecting sound), satisfying the constraint requirement, though the description occasionally stalls momentum with lists of sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.5)
    The greenhouse setting offers some specific imagery ("chitinous life," "carnivorous orchids") that grounds the climax better than the generic "sprawl" opening. However, descriptive density often tips into purple prose ("leathery shell veined with iridescent promise") rather than purposeful, choice-constraining detail.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is vivid and imaginative, effectively grounding the surreal concept in a concrete location. However, the description is static and ornamental, relying on heavy modification ("pearlescent," "nacreous") that slows momentum rather than actively pressuring the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "museum of extinct feelings" is a compelling high-concept setting, and the "opal library" is visualized with some vivid, if abstract, imagery. However, the description often leans on "white room" features (clouds, translucent walls) adorned with adjectives rather than tactile, interactive details that constrain the character's movement.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is anchored effectively with sensory details like "shadows clung" and "spectral murmurs," creating a coherent atmosphere. However, the environment functions primarily as a backdrop; the "dim vaults" do not meaningfully constrain Elara's physical choices or tactics during the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.2)
    The volcanic amphitheater is a distinct, atmospheric setting that initially grounds the technical action well. However, the recurring "breathing" motif and "dappled" lighting effects become repetitive, and the setting turns into a generic backdrop during the accelerated conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=4.7)
    The setting is established with heavy adjectival description ("vintage," "dusty," "withered") but lacks tactile interaction or spatial constraints that shape the character's choices. The environment serves as a static backdrop for the synopsis rather than an active pressure cooker for the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    The "drifting prism terrace" and "corn maze" provide vivid, surreal imagery that establishes a strong atmospheric container. The spatial relationship between the terrace and the maze is somewhat disorienting, but the sensory details ("chairs veined like forgotten maps") effectively ground the speculative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=3.8)
    While atmospheric, the setting lacks physical coherence; the "fractured pressure dome" suggests flooding, but the characters later retreat to an "air-filled" atrium as if the rest were not. The spatial relationship between the submersible, the diver, and the facility is murky, preventing immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is vivid and iridescent but functions as ornamental backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint. The descriptions are heavy with simile ("like frozen fireworks," "like bubbles") which distances the reader from the physical reality of the cave.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.3)
    The "tidal arcade" is the story's strongest element, offering vivid sensory details like "creaking boardwalks" and "sea spray" that establish a clear atmosphere. However, the setting functions primarily as a backdrop and does not enforce specific tactical constraints on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the atmosphere is consistent, the setting relies on generic high-fantasy signifiers ("dew-kissed moss," "violet haze") rather than specific, tangible details that constrain the character. The garden feels decorative rather than a crucible for the action.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "prism atrium" is a distinct and creative image, serving as a functional micro-setting. However, the description leans heavily on purple prose ("pearlescent fog," "dew-kissed," "lover's breath") which distances the reader. The setting facilitates the magical realism but does not provide significant physical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is established but relies on repetitive "celestial" descriptions that feel ornamental. The environment functions as a backdrop for the sermon rather than a source of constraint or pressure on the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is descriptive but functions primarily as a container for magical props rather than a source of constraint. Sensory details are often abstract ("air thickened with... whispers") and lack tactile immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with the "ivy-veiled passage" and "ruins" creating a tangible sense of decay. The environment constrains the protagonist's movement and reflects the theme of nature reclaiming man-made hubris. However, the repetition of full setting phrases ("ivy-veiled passage") slightly diminishes the immersion by drawing attention to the text itself.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is established but suffocated by purple prose ("petals unfurling like whispered secrets"). While the "prism parapet" is a vivid centerpiece, the atmospheric description relies on cliché modifiers rather than specific, grounded sensory details that affect the character's movement.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is vivid but weighed down by purple prose ("reluctant lover," "scars on porcelain skin") and the jarring anachronism of a "clipboard" in a world of quills and runes. The atmosphere is decorative rather than acting as a functional constraint on the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, though descriptions often veer into melodrama ("womb of desolation," "bruised sky"). The sensory details effectively mirror the protagonist's internal state, even if the correlation is somewhat heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting relies on "purple" abstraction ("flakes like forgotten promises") rather than concrete sensory details that constrain action. The environment serves as an atmospheric backdrop but fails to offer physical resistance or tools that shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.8)
    The radar dome setting is distinct and fairly well-integrated, amplifying the protagonist's isolation and breath. However, the atmosphere is weakened by the mechanical repetition of descriptive tags like "meteor hush."

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is established with vivid, if overwrought, imagery ("emerald moss," "iridesced purple"). However, the relentless repetition of specific atmospheric phrases ("blushing stillness" appears four times) distracts from the immersion, turning atmosphere into a mechanical refrain.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sensory details of the aurora and ice are vivid and establish a distinct atmosphere. However, the setting feels overly cooperative ("warming stone," "yielded"), functioning more as a backdrop than a constraint that pressures the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting is descriptive but suffers from "adjective-itis," relying on repeated labels like "ethereal grit" rather than organic sensory evocation. While the bunker provides a functional stage, the environment operates more as a checklist of atmospheric markers than a pressure-cooker for choice.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.0)
    The "reimagined" palace provides some vivid visual anchors, such as the bioluminescent vines and the crystal lattice. However, the setting serves largely as a backdrop rather than an active force constraining the protagonist's choices. The magic square tile is well-integrated as a physical anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "soundless sanctuary" provides a distinct constraint, though the reliance on "vibrations" and "cellular memory" quickly circumvents the silence. The "shifting reality" aspect is described with standard dream-sequence imagery (walls into mist, pillars sprouting vines) that feels generic rather than specifically grounded in the characters' immediate tactical needs.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    The atmosphere is the story’s standout feature, with "decayed apples," "twisted stumps," and "glass mountains" creating a vivid, specific world. The setting actively pressures the protagonist, necessitating the use of mirrors to manipulate the fog. The sensory details effectively ground the surreal events in a tangible environment.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central image of the orchard spanning the cathedral rafters is evocative and grounds the piece in a distinct atmosphere. However, the mechanics of the quartz technology are vague, serving as decoration rather than a hard constraint on the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "astral orchard" and "meteor-glass" details are vivid but veer into decorative prose that doesn't constrain action. The integration of the bathroom feels jarringly literal and ungrounded in the asteroid's logic, serving as a prompt container rather than an organic part of the world.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is cluttered with high-fantasy proper nouns ("Verdant Stacks," "Echo-Lilies") that act as list items rather than a grounded environment. Purple description ("silence hummed an unheard symphony") obscures spatial clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.6)
    The atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, rusted carnival imagery and a tangible sense of decay. However, the setting often feels like a passive backdrop for the ritual rather than a physical environment that constrains the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting of the clock tower and the "Fables of Absence" provides a solid, atmospheric grounding with specific sensory details ("scent of oiled gears," "crimson droplets"). However, the environment becomes static during the climax, serving as a backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting of the harmonic caves and the concept of reading ice cracks as maps are vivid and integrated into the magic system. However, the "energy beings" remain generic environmental hazards, lacking specific presence or threat beyond "luminous pulses."

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting is established with vivid, if slightly generic, "ruined grandeur" imagery (glass pavilion, spiral core). While atmospheric, the environment serves mostly as a backdrop until the storm provides mild physical pressure; the mechanics of the tower remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.9)
    Setting imagery is vivid and atmospheric, effectively using the "stormlit observatory" and "obsidian" monuments to create a consistent mood. The "fog-bridge" and "crystal whispering forecourt" offer a distinct, high-fantasy aesthetic that grounds the abstract action. Specificity in the visual details anchors the scene well, even if the sensory experience leans heavily on the visual and auditory.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.4)
    The visual description of the fortress and the "iridescent tiles" is vivid and establishes a strong atmosphere. However, the setting relies heavily on repetitive keywords ("hush," "starless") to do the work of atmospheric building, and the world outside the fortress remains a generic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is described with sensory density ("phosphorescent waves," "crystalline basins") but remains a static backdrop that does not constrain the protagonist's choices. The "ancient grotto" provides atmosphere but functions primarily as a stage set for the ritual rather than an active force in the narrative. The imagery often veers into ornamental purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the vertical geography and gravity mechanics actively constrain movement and tactics. Sensory details are lush and evocative, particularly the descriptions of the silences and the trellis, grounding the surreal concepts in tangible experience.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is visually distinct and atmospheric, with the "drifting prism terrace" providing a solid backdrop. However, the environment feels static and functions more as a set piece than a source of pressure or constraint on the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is established through a dense list of adjectives ("kaleidoscopic," "prismatic," "bioluminescent") rather than through character interaction or constraint. The environment functions as a static, ornamental backdrop rather than a pressure cooker that forces specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.2)
    Atmosphere is consistent, but the setting remains abstract; "ashen charcoal sanctuary" establishes a mood but lacks concrete, lived-in sensory details beyond the visual. The "fading threshold" is a functional mechanic, but the environment feels more like a metaphorical stage set than a physical place with texture and history.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.0)
    The premise of an epoch where concepts become physical is vivid and imaginative, effectively grounding the surreal bioluminescent farm. However, the atmosphere is rendered artificial by the verbatim repetition of the phrase "shadowseam wonder," which flattens the specific sensory details into a prompt-check tag.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the "sepia reading room" is established, the atmosphere is suffocated by the repetitive use of purple phrases ("golden shadows," "nostalgic gleam"). The setting feels like a static stage set for the prompt elements rather than a lived-in space that pressures the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, successfully grounding the scene in a surreal, alchemical atmosphere. However, the immersion is frequently broken by mechanical adjective stuffing ("factually mystical," "endless night") that feels like checklist compliance rather than organic description. While the imagery is lush, it functions more as a static backdrop than a source of constraint or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is established with sensory precision, using details like "mildew," "grimy windows," and "scarred oak" to ground the archive's atmosphere. The file room and the box act as effective containers for the story, though the environment functions more as a backdrop than a source of active constraint or pressure on Eleanor's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=4.8)
    Setting descriptions are vivid but overly ornamental ("auric lagoon," "sun bled orange"), serving as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice. The transition from a "grimy" city to a bioluminescent fantasy lagoon feels disjointed, and the environment does not exert pressure on the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.5)
    The grotto is described with sensory density ("luminous ferns," "dripping stalactites"), creating a cohesive atmosphere. However, the setting feels reactive rather than constraining; the environment accommodates the protagonist's actions rather than forcing difficult tactical trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is lushly described but suffers from purple prose ("twisted like ancient fingers") and logical inconsistencies in scale. The "moonstone cabochon dust speck" confuses the physical reality—a cabochon implies a shaped, polished gem, which contradicts the scale of a "dust speck." The atmosphere is established but static.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.3)
    The subterranean workshop is a strong conceptual anchor, but credibility breaks with the "screwdriver forged from a shard of quartz" (quartz shatters; it cannot be forged like metal). Sensory details often lean into abstraction ("mist... like forgotten thoughts") rather than concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=4.0)
    Setting details are obscured by heavy adjectival layering ("jagged," "luminous," "rusted"). The inclusion of phrases like "factually mystical" and "verifiable astral force" shatters the mythic tone, reading as jarring meta-commentary rather than organic world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.8)
    Echo Gorge is established with atmospheric descriptors ("mist," "sheer walls"), but the imagery leans into purple prose ("tears on stone," "spectral fingers") that distances the reader. The setting functions as a backdrop but rarely constrains the protagonist's physical movement or choices in a tactile way.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.8)
    The ultraviolet forest is vivid and atmospheric, providing a strong visual palette. However, the environment's sudden responsiveness to her internal thoughts ("forest hushed... as if the world itself computed her release") breaks the established reality rules without prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is vivid but leans heavily on decorative adjectives ("vaporous," "silken," "jeweled") rather than functional details that constrain the character's choices. While the atmosphere is established, the environment feels like a static backdrop for the "eternal instant" rather than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is established with sensory competence, particularly the lighting and dust, though it relies on some "abandoned circus" clichés ("faded big tops," "painted smiles"). The specific focus on the mainspring barrel grounds the scene effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific imagery ("crystalline branches," "tomes like fruit") that anchors the surreal premise. The environment reacts to the climax ("glass leaves shivered," "panes shattering"), integrating setting with action. However, the description occasionally leans into static ornamentation rather than pressuring the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vividly imagined with specific details like the visible time rivers and rococo vaults establishing a distinct atmosphere. The environment feels tangible, though the descriptive density occasionally slows the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "resonance chamber" is established with vivid, if flowery, sensory details that anchor the magical atmosphere. The setting interacts with the plot (amplifying sound), though the descriptions sometimes lean into abstraction ("soul of sound") rather than concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=5.8)
    While some imagery is vivid ("mineral tears," "obsidian"), the atmosphere is severely undercut by the mechanical repetition of the phrase "resonant hush." The setting aims for gothic mystery but feels static, serving as a backdrop for the compass's exposition rather than a source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the archway provides a physical anchor, the setting is obscured by the repetitive "turbine-hum" motif which distracts from concrete sensory detail. The environment feels like a metaphorical backdrop that harmonizes with the protagonist too readily, lacking the resistance of a real cliffside storm.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.8)
    Imagery is vivid but cluttered with ornamental adjectives ("defiant splendor," "honeyed light") that create a static, painterly tableau rather than an interactive setting. The pavilion serves as a passive backdrop ("haven") rather than a pressure cooker that forces choices.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting imagery is vivid ("obsidian lagoon," "floating library"), providing a strong aesthetic backdrop. However, the description leans heavily on adjectival stacking ("merciless brand," "jagged shores") which creates a static, postcard-like quality rather than a tactile, interactive environment.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting is described with vivid, albeit adjective-heavy, imagery ("tattered paper lanterns," "crooked eaves"). However, the environment fails to act as a constraint; instead, it is endlessly malleable to the protagonist's will. The reimagined elements ("self-igniting orbs," "kelp-woven scaffolds") feel like a wishlist of fantasy attributes rather than a grounded, lived-in space that pressures the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.0)
    The skyscraper orchard is a strong, specific concept that grounds the fantasy elements. However, the description suffers from adjectival clutter ("star-pricked," "dew-kissed") and repetitive descriptors ("velvet-cushioned") that distance the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting is established with vivid, specific imagery ("frozen coliseum," "frost-laced arches"). However, the description is heavy with adjectives ("iridescent," "crystalline," "prismatic"), which creates a static atmosphere rather than one that pressures the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=4.3)
    The setting relies on adjective-heavy clichés ("jagged peaks," "whispering spires") rather than specific, sensory grounding. The repeated use of the static phrase "windblown sanctuary" (four times) turns the environment into a backdrop rather than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting relies on high-concept cosmic imagery ("primordial frost," "cosmic lint") which establishes atmosphere but lacks tactile grounding. The "yellow lantern glass" is a strong specific anchor, but the surrounding environment feels somewhat generic in its vastness.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, offering vivid, specific imagery ("splintered woodframes," "prismatic honeycombs") that anchors the supernatural elements. The scorched wasteland and oasis are well-integrated into the plot, providing both atmosphere and resources that shape the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is vivid but suffers from lexical redundancy; "emerald" or "verdant" appears six times in a short text, flattening the sensory palette. While the "fungal bloom" and "corrugated walls" offer texture, the reliance on a single color descriptor diminishes the immersive quality.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.0)
    While the "cobalt lagoon" provides a clear backdrop, the description suffers from severe repetitive artifacting (e.g., "cobalt" appears five times). The atmosphere is asserted through purple descriptors rather than evoked through sensory interaction, making the setting feel like a static stage set.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is the strongest element, with vivid, specific imagery of the "living stone" and "copper coils." The physical environment is distinct and memorable, though its magical compliance reduces its role as a source of friction.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting is atmospherically consistent but relies on repetitive adjectival tagging ("bronze," "luminous," "rainwashed") rather than fresh sensory specificity. The environment functions as a static, gilded backdrop rather than a source of constraints or resources that pressure the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.5)
    Imagery is vivid ("coral bones," "rusted blades"), effectively establishing a grim fantasy aesthetic. However, the atmosphere is undermined by repetitive descriptors (the word "blooming" appears five times in various contexts), which dulls the specificity of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting details ("fuselage bones," "rad-scorched suns") establish a vivid post-apocalyptic atmosphere. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or forces tactical improvisation, serving mostly as a backdrop for the protagonist's travel.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the visual of "warped stars" is initially distinct, the setting functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of physical constraint or pressure. The description is heavily repetitive, relying on the phrase "temporally stretched" (used six times) instead of diverse sensory details to establish the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong, atmospheric imagery ("bruised purple," "frozen fang") firmly anchors the reader in the surreal setting. The environment actively constrains the protagonist's actions, necessitating the use of specific tools like the sundial to navigate the "wrong sky."

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    The whispering gallery is utilized brilliantly as a mechanical tool for the plot, not just atmospheric backdrop. The sensory details are vivid, though the reliance on the phrase "luminous absence" to establish atmosphere feels slightly repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, effectively grounding the surreal elements. The specific tactile constraint of the feather's texture is a highlight, anchoring the magical mechanism in a concrete physical sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmospheric specificity is the story's strength ("cobblestones slick with unfallen rain"), creating a distinct surreal mood. The setting constraints are vivid, though the environment functions more as a static stage for metaphor than a source of physical resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and distinct; imagery like "hollowed femur" and "ribcage arches" effectively grounds the surreal concept. The environment actively shapes the atmosphere and imagery, providing a strong backdrop for the action.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting offers vivid, specific imagery ("acid sea," "corroded hull"), establishing a strong visual aesthetic. However, the environment feels static and permissive, pausing its threat to allow the protagonist to complete his lengthy internal monologues.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.2)
    While descriptive, the setting leans heavily on "purple" clichés ("emerald curtains," "dying stars") and functions as a static backdrop rather than a source of pressure. The oasis is a generic reward space that lacks specific, lived-in texture or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is painted with heavy adjectival description ("cobalt lighthouse," "jagged rocks") that feels decorative rather than constraining. While sensory details are present (jasmine, roses), they read like a list of pleasantries rather than specific, lived-in environmental pressures that force choices. The "runes" and "forgotten grove" introduce generic fantasy elements without grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.5)
    Atmospheric details are vivid ("green patina," "foxfire"), effectively establishing a mythic tone. However, the physical geography is inconsistent (stranded height vs. beach access), and the setting serves more as a static backdrop for the montage than an interactive pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    The hanging orchard is a vivid, constraining environment that mirrors the precarious social state; details like "root ball," "storm-battered walls," and "geomagnetic sensors" ground the speculative elements. The setting actively pressures the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting is vivid but overwritten with purple prose ("iridescent surface shimmered like frozen whispers," "twilight's bruise-purple sky"). The descriptor "opal dock" is repeated four times, and "nautical twilight" three times, diminishing their impact. The environment serves as a tonal backdrop rather than a source of physical constraint or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    Setting descriptions are vivid and immersive, particularly the bioluminescent cavern, effectively establishing a distinct atmosphere. While occasionally purple ("whispered of forgotten worlds"), the sensory details ground the fantastical elements, even if the "antique shop" opening feels slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting descriptions are vivid but suffer from "purple" overwriting and confusing visualization; the grotto is described as both "cobalt" and "ember" in ways that muddy the mental image. While atmospheric, the environment feels more like a stage set for metaphors than a grounded physical space affecting the characters' movement.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.4)
    The setting relies on high-intensity adjectives ("smoldering," "eternal," "abyssal") that create a generic ethereal backdrop without tactile grounding. The environment functions as a static stage set rather than a source of constraints or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is established with specific sensory details (birch bark, pine resin), though often filtered through heavy metaphor. The physical constraints of the cabin are abandoned too quickly for the flight sequence, reducing the setting's pressure on the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is established with heavy-handed atmospherics ("hush of morning fog," "hesitant whisper") that feel decorative rather than constraining. While the shop provides a backdrop, the environment does not exert pressure on the protagonist's choices or escalate the conflict. The sensory details are frequent but often clichéd, lacking the specificity required for immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting of the floating tea platform is vivid and atmospherically distinct, anchoring the scene effectively. However, descriptors occasionally drift into purple territory ("moss-veiled edges," "velvet drone") rather than selecting details that strictly pressure the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with specific sensory details like "dust motes... like lost souls" and the smell of ozone and fruit grounding the supernatural elements. The integration of the environment (the piano's copper veins) into the plot mechanics is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting relies on high-concept adjectives ("ethereal light," "whispering papyrus") rather than concrete, tactile constraints that shape the protagonist's tactics. While consistent in tone, the environment feels like a passive backdrop rather than an active force pressuring the character.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific details like "brass veins pulsing" and "mercury-weighted pendulums" grounding the surrealism. The physical environment palpably pressures the character, though the "holographic mirages" feel slightly less textured than the hydraulic machinery.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, blending specific biological details ("Agaricus luminara") with atmospheric sensory cues ("damp stone," "hum") to ground the technical premise.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.2)
    Sensory details are present (rain, clover, mica) but feel ornamental rather than constraining. The spatial geography relies on convenience, with the "hidden wing" appearing exactly when the plot requires a destination.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is atmospheric and tactile, with details like "stool carved from cable drums" and "iron and earth" grounding the surreal premise effectively in a physical reality that shapes the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting leans heavily on purple abstraction ("forgotten whispers," "stardust regrets") which obscures physical grounding. While specific details like "walnut-ink" and the "bone spoon" show promise, the atmosphere is generic high-fantasy rather than a specific, pressure-filled locale. The "context change" mechanic operates as vague flavor rather than a constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is atmospherically established with specific details ("ivy curtain," "crumbling arches"), though it functions primarily as a static backdrop rather than applying pressure or constraining tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.8)
    The sensory details of the ultrasonic forest are vivid and consistently filtered through the protagonist's unique perception (touch/sound). However, the setting functions largely as a static corridor rather than a source of pressure or constraint that forces adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and imaginative, with strong sensory details like stones drifting "like forgotten sighs" and the "smell of ozone." The physical constraints of the anomaly (gravity's pull and lightness) are well-integrated into the character's movement. The atmosphere consistently supports the surreal, sci-fi tone.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is established through heavy adjectival stacking ("luminous," "silvery," "shimmering") rather than concrete, lived-in interaction. While the harbor provides a backdrop, it operates as a generic postcard scene rather than a constraint that pressures the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting functions as a generic container for clues, relying on familiar tropes ("crumbling shelves," "ancient soil") rather than specific, pressure-inducing environmental constraints. While sensory details like "vibrant ochres" appear, the environment never actively opposes the protagonist or forces a tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.4)
    The concept of the sound wave garden is imaginative and functionally drives the protagonist's method (drumming), integrating setting with action. However, the description suffers from modifier congestion ("iridescent petals," "velvet shroud," "mournful spears"), which distances the reader from the physical reality of the space.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "steel canyon" and "shifting labyrinth" effectively constrain the action. Sensory details of the storm (purple sky, static) add texture, though the "low frequencies hug steel" acoustic logic is scientifically dubious even for a fable.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting of the "cobalt dock" is established with vivid, if occasionally overwrought, imagery ("hesitant stars," "fractured glimpses"). While the atmosphere is cohesive, the reliance on heavy adjectives ("stillwater tension," "spiralingly calm") creates a dense, purple texture that distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.4)
    Descriptions are vivid but decorative and over-adjectived ("cobalt," "sapphire," "velvet," "obsidian"), creating a "purple" atmosphere that lacks tactile grounding. The "magnetic grotto" feels like a genre mismatch, introducing high-fantasy elements into a dystopian town setting without establishing ground rules.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is established with vivid, if slightly purple, imagery ("bioluminescent waves," "gnarled hands"). While the sensory details are consistent, they lean toward generic fantasy tropes rather than specific, lived-in texture that constrains the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the "sagging porch," "endless gray sky," and oppressive turbine shadows create a vivid, constraining environment. The sensory detail of the "remade hush" effectively underscores the protagonist's isolation. The setting actively pressures the character, forcing her performance as a coping mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is vivid and consistent in its "high fantasy" aesthetic, but the descriptions are largely ornamental ("lantern-moth hush," "fleeting umbras") rather than restrictive. The environment functions as a passive backdrop that surrenders to the protagonist rather than a physical space that constrains tactics. The imagery risks "white room" syndrome, floating in abstract beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and tactile, utilizing the glass spires and heat effectively to ground the fantasy elements. The verticality of the spires constrains the action during the climb, integrating the environment well into the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies heavily on the repeated phrase "golden shadows" and generic "vaulted ceilings" without providing concrete, tactile grounding. While the "carbide lamp lens" is a specific object, the surrounding "laboratory" feels like a nebulous dreamscape rather than a physical space with constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.5)
    Atmospheric details like "polished obsidian" and "brass telescopes" are vivid but lean heavily on purple description ("withering flames," "petals of plasma"). The setting serves as a passive backdrop for the magic rather than a physical environment that constrains the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the "rain-beaded skylight" and "onyx ink" provide some visual grounding, the description is repetitive and overly adjectival ("fragile," "midnight-black," "rare volcanic"). The setting details feel like static set dressing rather than constraints that pressure the characters' choices. The constant repetition of the skylight description (four times) dulls its atmospheric effect.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.3)
    The "bronze prism pagoda" is a vivid, specific anchor that organizes the space well. The atmosphere relies heavily on genre stock phrases (bioluminescent fungi, dust motes) and abstract descriptors ("shadowed vaults") rather than singular, tactile details.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting relies on generic ethereal signifiers ("crystal panes," "mist," "glow") rather than specific, tactile details that ground the fantasy in a lived reality. The environment feels static, serving as a postcard backdrop for the action rather than providing constraints or resources that shape the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.5)
    Descriptions tilt toward generic poeticism ("velvet canopy," "dew-kissed fog") rather than specific, grounded detail. The setting feels like a romanticized backdrop rather than a functioning workspace.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.2)
    Spatial logic dissolves under scrutiny; tunneling "deep" through a tower floor implies entering a lower story or foundation, yet the narrative treats it as excavating raw earth where moonlight inexplicably enters underground. The "meteor hush" creates atmosphere, but the physical geography is malleable to the point of confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.1)
    The projection booth is rendered with evocative, tactile specificity ("brass gears whispered," "brittle as autumn leaves") that grounds the magical elements. While occasionally over-adjectived, the setting successfully constrains the search to a physical space. The sensory details of the film strip and dust provide a strong material anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is vivid but ornamental, leaning on standard fantasy tropes ("frozen tundra," "ancient stone") without constraining the character's choices physically. The environment functions more as a backdrop for the light show than a tangible place with friction and resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is atmospherically vivid but operates as a passive backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure. While the sensory details are dense ("phosphor thorns," "silica veins"), they do not force specific tactical choices or impede the protagonist. The environment yields to the character's new power immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.0)
    The mechanical rainforest is vividly imagined with specific, sensory-rich details like "steam-blood" and "maplesprockets," establishing a strong aesthetic. However, the setting sometimes feels like a static catalog of steampunk flora rather than a pressure cooker for the character. The sudden introduction of the protagonist's own mechanical physiology breaks the established world logic without foreshadowing.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting consists of generic "white room" descriptors ("misty path," "seafoam robes," "hidden cove") that lack tactile specificity or distinct atmosphere. While the "ticket punch" is described with some detail, the environment functions as a passive backdrop that rearranges itself for the protagonist (e.g., brambles parting "like reluctant curtains") rather than a source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    The atmosphere of the fortress is vivid, effectively using the cold and "cobalt" motifs to ground the scene. However, the physical plausibility of finding a years-old smudge and bolt in a public stairwell is low, breaking immersion despite the sensory focus.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.6)
    Sensory details regarding the ink preparation are vivid and specific ("tannic heart," "rusty-black"). However, the broader library setting feels static and ethereal, serving as a backdrop rather than a pressurized environment that constrains choices.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid details like "bleached to bone" and the "cluttered observation deck" grounding the reader in the post-apocalyptic oceanic isolation. However, the atmosphere is occasionally disrupted by the forced insertion of prompt phrases (e.g., the repeated "periodically eternal"), which breaks the immersive quality of the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is described with heavy adjectival padding ("bruised skies," "molten amber") that slows momentum without constraining action. While the visual details are dense, they function only as a backdrop for the MacGuffin rather than an integrated pressure on the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is vivid and integrated into the premise, with "geothermal gardens" and "mutagenic vapors" grounding the telepathy concept. However, the environment functions mostly as a backdrop; the extreme heat and volcanic danger are described but do not significantly pressure Mira's tactical choices or physical state during the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting is vivid and atmospherically consistent, effectively contrasting the "fragile Eden" with the harsh cliffside. However, the description occasionally veers into purple prose ("suspended green world," "indifferently swaying ferns") that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=4.2)
    Atmospheric details are present ("salt-scented," "bioluminescent fungi") but lean heavily on generic gothic tropes. The literalization of "walls closing in" disorients the spatial reality of the lighthouse without earning the surrealism. The setting feels like a stage set constructed solely for the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "wind-carved" imagery provides a distinct visual texture, but the setting largely serves as a passive backdrop for the internal monologue. Environmental details are often filtered through heavy adjectives ("sinuous," "relentless," "viscous") rather than meaningful interaction that constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.2)
    The sensory details of the frozen library—frost-rimed controls, breath fogging the air—create a solid visual grounding. However, the atmosphere relies heavily on the repetitive descriptor "dizzying quiet," which loses impact with each use. The setting constrains the action well, but the description feels somewhat static.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.2)
    The glass-domed rose farm provides a distinct visual anchor and constrains the looters' entry. However, abstract descriptors like "chaos," "ruin," and "turbulence" often replace specific, grounded sensory details. The setting serves the plot well but feels slightly generic in its "apocalyptic desert" execution.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "sound wave garden" is an imaginative concept with vivid, synesthetic imagery ("translucent scrolls," "thorny echoes") that grounds the surrealism. However, the setting remains largely ornamental; the "sonic thorns" and "dissonant fury" are described but do not physically endanger the protagonist or force a tactical change, reducing the environment to a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is vivid but strays into hyperbole ("impossibly above the clouds") that strains suspension of disbelief. While the atmospheric details ("vast glass whispered") set a mood, they often distract from rather than ground the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.0)
    The "Laboratory of Lost Sounds" is established with vivid, sensory specificity ("echoes... like frost," "machine's reader"). The blend of archaic furniture and high-tech spectral firmware creates a distinct, memorable atmosphere that supports the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.3)
    While the whispering gallery mechanic is integrated into the plot, the descriptions lean heavily on static adjectives ("lilac mist," "damp sand") that feel like a checklist. The atmosphere is told through abstract phrases ("lilac unease") rather than evoked through concrete sensory details that constrain the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.5)
    Imagery is vivid but overwrought, leaning on purple prose ("wept cold light like frozen blood") and abstract descriptors. The setting functions as a generic atmospheric backdrop rather than a tangible environment that constrains the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is established with vivid, if occasionally adjective-heavy, imagery ("luminous fruits," "weathered stage"). However, the "mystic orchard" functions more as a dreamscape than a grounded environment, and the spatial logic of the maze yielding to the orchard is standard rather than surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    The studio setting is vivid, with sensory details like the ozone scent and the visual of the geode's light diffraction grounding the scene effectively. The environment actively enables the &quot;experiment,&quot; though the pseudo-scientific application of the setting details clashes slightly with the grounded atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.3)
    The thermal overlay offers a specific, vivid lens on the environment, grounding the cave setting well. However, the "unknown leviathans" and wider world remain abstract and slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "amber warehouse" with its "muted fire" and "hoarded dreams of ancient seas" is vivid and atmospheric. The imagery effectively grounds the fable-like tone, though the environment remains largely static and doesn't actively pressure the protagonist's choices beyond providing the props for the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting of Zephyr Bluff is established with vivid, if repetitive, sensory details like the mist and the rook's nest. The atmosphere is consistent, though the frequent repetition of "silver hush" (five times) diminishes its impact, turning evocative description into a rote tag. The physical constraints of the bluff and the cold are well-integrated into the action.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is established early, but the description relies heavily on generic gothic tropes ("gloom," "mist," "shadowed paths") and forced metaphors ("clung like spindrift"). While atmospheric, the sensory details feel like set dressing for the prompt words rather than a lived-in environment constraining the character.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is visually distinct, with specific details like the "flattening smoke" and "thorny blooms" grounding the scene. However, the "scorched wasteland" and "ruins like forgotten sins" rely on generic post-apocalyptic tropes. While atmospheric, the environment functions more as a static backdrop than a source of pressure or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is vivid but rendered through ornamental description ("moonlight silvered the waves like spilled mercury") rather than interaction. The "luminous harbor" serves as a static backdrop for the dialogue rather than an environment that pressures choices or creates obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.5)
    The "Tidal Library" offers some vivid atmospheric details ("churning clouds," "ethereal tides"), but the setting feels static and low-pressure. The intrusion of pseudo-scientific jargon ("atomically reflective," "molecular lattices") into a fantasy setting creates jarring inconsistencies that undermine verisimilitude. The environment functions as a backdrop rather than a constraint on action.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is rendered with repetitive, oversaturated descriptors ("prismatic," "jewels," "rainbow") that feel like a static stage set. While vivid, the lack of grit or sensory variety creates a "white room" effect disguised by color.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is the story’s strongest asset, with sensory details like the "metallic tang of solder" and "ink-veined constellations" grounding the sci-fi premise. The atmosphere of the radio station is vivid and tactile, effectively contrasting the cosmic scale with the gritty, immediate environment.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is vivid, with effective imagery ("silver daggers," "skeletal sentinels"), though the "fallow period" remains somewhat abstract. The narrowing walls effectively constrain the protagonist, integrating the environment into the immediate conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies heavily on generic Gothic tropes ("mist-choked," "jagged rocks," "shadows"). While the sensory isolation of the quarry attempts to mirror Elara's condition, the description often slides into purple prose that distances the reader rather than grounding the scene in specific, tactile constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=4.5)
    While "fog thick as sodden wool" is a decent image, the atmosphere depends almost entirely on the repeated phrase "spongey dread" (five mentions) to do the heavy lifting. The setting feels generic ("command vault," "buckled dome") and lacks the specific, lived-in texture required to ground the "roiling sea" or the station's precarious position.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is obscured by purple abstraction ("luminous haze," "golden disbelief") rather than grounded in concrete sensory detail. While the location is established, the atmosphere relies on telling the reader how to feel (using "disbelief" as a descriptor of the environment) rather than evoking the mood through specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.8)
    The circus train offers vivid, if occasionally purple, imagery ("faded stripes," "monsoon ink") that grounds the concept visually. However, the setting serves primarily as a backdrop for the summary rather than a constraint that forces specific tactical choices in a dramatized moment. The territorial markers are a creative prop but function mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting is established with functional sensory details ("brass instruments," "stone walls"), though it leans on genre standards. While the atmosphere of "midnight solace" is consistent, the environment serves as a static backdrop rather than a source of constraint or pressure on the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.9)
    The concept of the underwater orchard vortex is inventive and visually distinct, grounding the surreal logic of the piece effectively. However, the atmosphere is marred by the repetitive use of specific descriptors ("warlike serenity" appears three times, "serene/serenity" eight times), which dulls the immersive quality of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is vivid and establishes a consistent surreal atmosphere ("cobalt glade," "pulsed like veins"). The physical constraint of the character's roots effectively grounds the fantasy logic, though the imagery leans slightly toward adjectival stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting imagery is vivid and atmospheric ("roots snaked between bleached bones," "phosphorescent fungi"), effectively establishing a mood. However, the description frequently veers into purple prose ("danced like forgotten prayers"), and the environment serves more as a backdrop than a source of active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.8)
    The specificity of the appraisal details (thread count, composition) is excellent and grounds the character’s skill set. However, the atmosphere suffers from cliché ("Dust motes danced in the slanted afternoon light") and heavy-handed pathetic fallacy where the blasting rock explicitly mirrors his internal longing.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.3)
    The "magnetic arbor" is a compelling, specific concept that grounds the story's metaphysical bent. Sensory details like the "iron-rich bark" and "levitated pots" work well. However, atmospheric descriptions sometimes drift into generic grandeur ("endless clouds," "ancient electromagnetic fields") rather than strictly constraining the character's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tidal atrium is realized with specific, atmospheric details ("marble floors etched with forgotten alphabets," "bubbling brine") that successfully ground the surreal premise. The physical environment actively constrains the ritual, with the tides and forge inextricably linked to the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.2)
    Atmospheric details like "mineral tang" and "crystal veins" are vivid, but the physical logic strains credibility (reading "microscopic etchings" with a flashlight). The setting serves the tone well but feels physically malleable to suit the magical ending.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is vivid but leans heavily on stock "ruin" tropes (ivy-cloaked, dust motes, rust) and pathetic fallacy ("vines... like accusations," "station's decay... mirrored his soul"). While the environment is physically described, it functions more as a thematic billboard than a tactile space that constrains the character's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting is generic fantasy ("glowing library," "foggy infinities") that relies on standard tropes rather than specific, sensory grounding. While the mist functions mechanically for the puzzle, the environment lacks tactile reality or POV-specific filtering.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is established, but the descriptions rely heavily on repetitive adjectives ("velvet" appears four times) and abstract metaphors ("mulberry ache" as atmosphere) rather than concrete grounding. The sensory details are vivid but cloying, distancing the reader rather than immersing them.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is imaginatively conceived, but descriptions often lean into ornamental abstraction ("luminescent powders," "crystalline shrouds") rather than tactile grounding. The environment feels static and "white-room"-like despite the vivid visual adjectives, functioning more as a backdrop than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.3)
    The setting relies on generic high-fantasy tropes ("ethereal mists," "ancient vines") without constraining specificity. The phrase "vineyard hush" is repeated four times, becoming a distracting, forced artifact rather than an organic atmospheric detail.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.1)
    The lighthouse setting is atmospheric but functional, leaning on generic markers ("salt-streaked panes," "winding path"). The sensory details are often filtered through heavy adjectives rather than concrete interaction. The wind chimes serve as a plot device but lack distinct physical presence beyond their auditory description.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is active; the platform's motion and the grotto's magnetic hum constrain and pressure the characters. The "sycamore hush" serves as an atmospheric container that amplifies the sound of the stone and the dialogue. While sensory detail is vivid, the grotto itself remains slightly abstract until the end, keeping it just shy of a 9+ integration.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting of bone towers and sonic echoes is imaginative and distinct, providing a strong visual anchor. However, the description often drifts into grandiose abstraction ("fossilized spines of titanic beasts") rather than tactile interaction, distancing the reader from the physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively integrating the prompt's requirements (ice, spire, automated world) into the physical challenges. The specific imagery of the "garden folly" amidst the high-tech spire grounds the abstract conflict in a tangible place.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.8)
    Atmospheric details like the "ink-black sea" and "bioluminescent fungi" are vivid but lean toward purple prose. The logic of the setting wavers; a "hotel skeleton key" for a "forgotten armada" ship feels like disjointed aesthetic patching. The "meteor hush" and lantern light provide a strong, if repetitive, visual baseline.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is established with vivid, albeit repetitive, descriptors ("ambered," "shrunken void"). However, the environment functions largely as a static backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint; the "shrunken void" does not force specific tactical choices beyond the initial premise. The sensory details are primarily visual and abstract rather than tactile or immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is established with some specific details (brass telescope, oculus), but the atmosphere relies heavily on adjectival stacking ("ethereal hues," "luminous scatter"). The "scattered light" mechanic is integrated, though the environment acts more as a backdrop than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral to the plot; the viaduct's "sapphire dew" and the "viscous hum" of the bell act as essential tools for the protagonist. The environment actively constraints the action (the chaotic drips) and provides the solution, demonstrating strong integration of setting and conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the "twilight" and "hush" establish a consistent mood, the setting lacks the visceral physical reality of a drained reservoir; there is no mud, rot, or decay, only clean "glints" and poetic relics. The environment functions more as a thematic stage set than a tangible place that constrains the characters' movements.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=3.9)
    The setting is obscured by intense over-description and generic fantasy adjectives ("kaleidoscopic," "prismatic," "luminous"). While visual, the environment feels like a static backdrop rather than a source of constraints or tools that shape the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "nocturnal arbor" provides a distinct physical anchor, though descriptions often rely on adjective-heavy telling ("star-pricked void," "sky-spanning"). The setting constrains Elias spatially, but the sensory experience remains somewhat generic and visual-heavy, lacking tactile immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "floating rock dojo" is visualized with some vivid details (obsidian, fractals) and provides the tools for the climax (altar, blade). However, the "rewriting history" backdrop remains largely ornamental, failing to constrain tactical choices until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is rendered with generic, "purple" descriptors ("velvet hush," "murmuring waters") that lack sensory specificity or grounding. The brook functions as a convenient container for the plot coupon (the flash drive) rather than a real place impacting the narrative. The spatial logic of finding coordinates to the exact spot he already sits is contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is atmospheric and functional, with the echo chamber mechanics actively supporting the plot. However, descriptions often lean into purple prose ("devoured even the memory of echoes") rather than precise sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.0)
    Atmospheric imagery is vivid ("crystalline petal," "swirling vapors") but static, serving more as a backdrop for internal monologue than a tactile space that constrains action. The "frozen garden" feels disconnected from the physical reality of the character until the final absorption.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is vivid and tactile, with specific details like "frozen blooms" and "iced embers" grounding the abstract magic in physical reality. The environment actively constrains the process, requiring the alchemist to interact with the nexus's heat and materials to advance the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, vertical, and immediately constraining; the "swaying cable bridges" and "gorge's abyss" create tangible physical pressure. The integration of the environment into the plot—where the city itself is the instrument—is excellent, though "Echo Gorge's gorge" in the text is a distracting redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=4.5)
    The "spectral grotto" and "crystalline walls" are vivid but generic fantasy descriptors that serve as a static backdrop rather than pressuring the protagonist. The setting elements are ornamental ("stars piercing through jagged fissures") and do not constrain choices or force tactical shifts beyond providing the magic hourglass.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.3)
    The central image of the sinew loom is vivid and tactile, anchoring the scene well. However, the atmosphere is weakened by the verbatim repetition of descriptors ("unsettling calm") which flattens the gallery into a static backdrop rather than a dynamic space.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.7)
    The benthic setting is evoked with specific, sensory details like "bioluminescent glow" and "pressure seals" that effectively ground the sci-fi concept. However, the atmosphere is enforced through the repetitive use of the phrase "somber marvel" rather than emerging organically from the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is atmospheric but rendered through repetitive phrasing ("mist-clad," "mist thickened," "mist's curl"). While the sanatorium is established, the sensory details feel like set dressing rather than an environment that pressures choices.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.1)
    The facility is described with vivid details ("bioluminescent kelp," "fiber optics"), but the presence of a dry, functional leather book in a "drowned antechamber" strains verisimilitude. The atmosphere is weakened by the forced repetition of specific tonal phrases rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is rendered with heavy, ornamental description ("iridescent domes," "shimmering veins") that creates a visual backdrop but fails to exert pressure on the character. The environment is static rather than interactive.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.1)
    The concept of bone towers and a canyon of echoes is visually evocative and distinct. However, sensory details often appear as lists ("grit of sand, the silk of wind") rather than tactile experiences integrated into a specific moment of action.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.2)
    The underground garden is vividly described with sensory details like "wept dew" and "humming quartz," effectively establishing a fantastical atmosphere. However, terms like "gravitas vine" feel slightly contrived, and the setting serves more as a backdrop than a source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid details like "rusting blossoms" and "gears fused into xylem" creating a distinct atmosphere. The juxtaposition of the mechanical and the natural is visually grounded, though the "sky-bridge" mechanics remain slightly vague. The sensory details effectively establish the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story’s strongest asset; the "Cobalt Arcade" at twilight is rendered with specific, atmospheric detail that grounds the fantastical elements. The tactile interaction with the "thunderstorm in a bottle" anchors the sci-fi concept in the physical world effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and specific, with the "hidden oasis" in the train car providing strong atmospheric grounding. High-density description ("verdant sanctum," "warped glass") effectively establishes the surreal mood, though it occasionally borders on ornamental excess.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral, offering specific tools like the "pseudospherical model" that enable the plot. While the "scientific poetry" concept borders on twee, the physical grounding in the library's atmosphere is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is atmospheric but constructed from generic "mood" descriptors ("whispering archipelago," "salt-laced winds") rather than specific, textured observation. The personification of the environment ("islands murmuring encouragements") distances the reader from physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is an abstract "white room" filled with metaphorical descriptors ("cosmic hush," "timelines brushing") rather than tactile, sensory details. While the visual of starlight is established, the lack of concrete grounding makes the workshop feel like a concept rather than a place. The environment does not constrain the characters' choices in a tangible way.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting of the sunken greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is vivid, atmospheric, and specific, anchoring the story well. However, the density of description occasionally feels static, with the environment functioning more as a backdrop than an active pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "forgotten library" setting is atmospheric but leans on standard tropes ("dust motes," "groaning shelves"). Specific details like the "chipped porcelain cup" and "jagged mirrors" add grounding. The playground swing element is inserted verbatim twice, which feels like a mechanical prompt insertion rather than an integrated atmospheric detail.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=3.5)
    The setting is composed of generic fantasy descriptors ("verdant parapet," "roaring yet whispering") that serve as window dressing rather than constraining action. The environment functions only as a limitless resource for magic, offering no friction or specific tactical limitations.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.1)
    The atmospheric imagery of the prism sanctuary is vivid ("shivering rainbows," "steel eye glinting"), establishing a strong mood. However, the spatial logic—silt suggesting water while stars wheel overhead—relies on dream logic that slightly blurs the physical grounding of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.5)
    The atmosphere is tangible, with vivid details like the "rain-scoured" vault and the "sarsen stones." The setting effectively grounds the action, though the descriptive language occasionally veers into melodrama ("monolithic sentinel") rather than serving the immediate pressure of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.1)
    Atmospheric description is the story's strength, with images like "books bloated and silvered" establishing a vivid, decaying world. However, the geographical and historical disconnect (Earhart near a Titanic sister ship) strains suspension of disbelief without a clearer genre framework.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the "misty courtyard" offers some vivid imagery, the world-building is incoherent, mashing together Victorian mechanics, digital code, and fantasy tropes without logical grounding. The setting serves as a container for prompt elements rather than a pressure cooker for the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific sensory details like "frost-laced clouds" and "ice-veined glass." The mechanics of the spire and the goggles interacting with the light are well-integrated and visually distinct. The environment actively shapes the decoding method, grounding the fantasy elements in the scene's physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting functions as an abstract dreamscape rather than a physical environment, missing critical sensory details like freezing temperatures or thin air that would constrain the character. While the visual descriptions of clouds are vivid, they float in a vacuum of physical consequence, rendering the "aviation" aspect decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is exceptional; the "hollowed oak" is not just scenery but a physical constraint that shapes the light, the method (carving bark), and the stakes. The sensory details of the "groaning" wood and "dust sifting like stars" firmly anchor the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.8)
    Imagery is vivid but overwrought, relying on "purple" descriptors ("stranded luminance," "crystalline motes") rather than tactile grounding. The setting functions as a static backdrop for the puzzle rather than a constraint that shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.3)
    The setting is atmospherically vivid but largely ornamental, functioning as a backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint. Descriptions like "forgotten sighs" and "brittle as old regrets" prioritize poetic effect over concrete spatial grounding. The environment does not force tactical shifts in the protagonist's approach.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting contains vivid visual elements ("floating rock arches," "lavender skies") but feels largely like set dressing. The "deserted sidewalks" in the orchard offer a moment of intrigue, but the world physics (nebula descending to heal trees) function as abstract magic rather than a grounded environment affecting choices.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "pane of hush" is a compelling, specific invention that serves both as setting and core mechanism. However, the broader description relies on repetitive abstract nouns ("oblivion," "void," "hush") and atmospheric clichés ("bruised purple") rather than tactile, granular detail.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and specific, blending the mechanical threat of the birds with the organic decay of the orchard to create a unique atmosphere. The sensory details—vibrating nuts, clattering brass feathers, and the encroaching frost—effectively ground the reader in the physical reality of the maze.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting description is vivid and texturally rich ("bruised purples," "pebbles smoothed"), effectively grounding the scene. However, the environment functions primarily as a metaphorical mirror for the protagonist's internal state rather than offering concrete resistance or constraint. The description occasionally tips into the decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and distinct; the "glass orchard" and "churning sea of clouds" aren't just backdrops but active physical constraints that shape the ritual. The specific tools (obsidian, awl, bottled moonlight) anchor the ethereal concept in tactile reality. The atmosphere consistently supports the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.4)
    Sensory details are vivid but often lean on abstract metaphors ("gleamed like captured moonlight") rather than grounding textures. The "neural paths" simile is anachronistic for the setting. The spatial logic of digging a massive stairwell in dunes during a single scene is weak.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting details are vivid but purely ornamental (&quot;hush of borrowed starlight&quot;), failing to ground the physical reality of the scene. The spatial logistics of the bridge construction are ignored in favor of romantic imagery. While the clock tower is established, the environment feels like a stage set for a fable rather than a lived-in place.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.0)
    The canyon imagery provides a cohesive visual backdrop ("fractured silver," "jagged walls"), though the description often leans into purple prose. The setting provides atmosphere but ultimately feels like a passive stage for the internal monologue rather than an active pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.1)
    The gravity inversion provides a strong, specific physical constraint that shapes the character's movement and interaction with the space. While descriptions lean toward purple prose ("mist coiling like forgotten thoughts"), the physical logic of the inverted grotto is clear and central to the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with specific, tactile details like the porcelain insulator, moss-draped trunks, and silver strings grounding the scene. The atmosphere of the "Great Stillness" is effectively established through these concrete sensory anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    The atmospheric details of the nexus and the "Morse of magnetic whispers" establish a strong, sensory-rich setting. The environment feels tangible, though the reliance on standard fantasy imagery (obsidian monoliths, leylines) keeps it from the highest bands of specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is established with vivid, albeit flowery, sensory details ("glow-worm bulbs," "scented by pine"). While the atmosphere is coherent, the description often slides into purple prose ("moonlight etched silver filigrees") that draws attention to the writing rather than the environment's pressure on the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is vivid, effectively using verticality and the "misty abyss" to ground the village. The sensory focus on smell is well-integrated with the protagonist's specific trait, though the "tide's thought" metaphor becomes repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The gravity inversion concept provides a strong, specific constraint on movement and spatial logic. Visuals are vivid, though occasionally marred by generic sci-fi descriptors like "crystalline fruits" and "liquid starlight" that soften the specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.4)
    The specific interaction between the wind dynamics and the shipping containers provides a solid physical grounding for the mystery. The "urban canyons" creating micro-bursts is a vivid concept, though the setting functions more as a static puzzle box than a pressure cooker that forces difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sensory detail is high-density and vivid, successfully establishing the "sculpted hush" and "auroral colors." The setting dominates the narrative, though it often cooperates too easily with the protagonist ("cavern seemed to lean in") rather than providing constraints or friction. The description occasionally veers into "purple" territory with excessive modification.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is established with consistent atmospheric details like the "canyon hush." However, the descriptions often lean into abstraction ("swallowed thunder into eternal hush") rather than concrete, tactile grounding. The environment provides a backdrop but doesn't actively constrain the protagonist's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with the "topaz workshop" and "vanishing stars" creating a strong aesthetic container. However, the descriptions often lean into static ornamentation ("turbulent refractions," "ethereal inks") rather than tactile details that constrain the characters' physical choices in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.2)
    Atmospheric description effectively establishes the mythic tone, though it relies heavily on adjectival stacking ("ethereal," "jagged," "pulsing") rather than concrete details that constrain action. The setting anchors the scene well but remains largely a backdrop for the internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is atmospheric, establishing the "quartz arbor" and mist clearly, though the description leans heavily into abstraction ("frozen prayers," "watercolor dream"). While the sensory detail is vivid, it often prioritizes poetic effect over concrete grounding, making the environment feel more like a metaphor than a physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.9)
    The setting suffers from a jarring tonal clash between the "ancient," "forgotten" fantasy orchard and the anachronistic "rummage sale box." Descriptions veer into purple prose ("emerald stalks," "crimson decay") that prioritizes ornamentation over sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is vivid and colorful, establishing the "orchard planet" effectively, though descriptions often veer into purple prose ("sparks flying like defiant stars"). While the imagery is consistent, the environment functions more as a backdrop for the fable than a source of physical constraints that shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.3)
    The setting is established with functional sci-fi tropes ("rusted hulks," "ozone"), but remains visual and generic. The parallel worlds are glimpsed only in abstract flashes, preventing them from exerting concrete pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=4.8)
    Atmospheric details like the "Fresnel lens" and "sea glass" establish a concrete setting initially, though descriptors often lean toward melodrama ("dying heartbeat," "abyssal black"). The setting's coherence evaporates when the prose disintegrates into meta-commentary.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse and "glass lantern wick" are established with vivid, if purple, imagery ("star-fretted dome," "primordial silica"). The wick functions well as a micro-setting that constrains the magic, though the "digital fog" of the outside world remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is established with vivid, sensory detail ("ancient lichen," "jasmine steam"), though it functions largely as a static backdrop rather than a source of pressure. The "floating rock" and "sun trails" are visually distinct, offering a solid atmospheric container for the scene, even if they don't severely constrain the protagonist's tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.5)
    The atmosphere is evocative, blending the mechanical (sextant) with the ethereal (moonlight, dreams) effectively. The specific detail of the healing light establishes the rules well, though the storm serves more as backdrop texture than an environmental pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospherically consistent, though it leans heavily on high-fantasy commonplaces (glowing sap, starlit dew, Heart Tree). While the mica window serves the plot, the environment generally functions as a passive backdrop for the magic rather than a source of constraint or tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.1)
    Setting details are generic ("dusty tomes," "polished oak") and fail to constrain action or create specific atmospheric pressure. The library functions as a passive backdrop filled with standard fantasy tropes rather than a unique, lived-in environment.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    The micro-setting of the tea house is rendered with strong, specific sensory details ("solar-heated brazier," "nettle tea") that ground the scene effectively. However, the broader "palace" context feels generic and unmoored, functioning more as a backdrop than a constraint on the characters' choices. The bread serves as a potent, tactile anchor for the memory work.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "quartz hush" and "frozen library" create a cohesive, ethereal atmosphere with clear spatial anchors. However, the reliance on specific "solfeggio frequencies" (432 Hz, 528 Hz, etc.) feels like an imported list rather than indigenous world-building, breaking immersion with real-world New Age associations. The setting challenges the character physically ("ink freezing") but does not force a tactical change.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.3)
    Atmosphere is established with specific sensory details ("fish guts," "dripping timbers"), though the description leans heavily on adjectival stacking ("comforting shadows laced with threat"). The setting effectively constrains the action.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is vivid and imaginative, with "forest elections" and "bioluminescent blooms" creating a distinct atmosphere. However, the density of sci-fi concepts sometimes feels like a list of aesthetic features rather than a lived-in environment that constrains the protagonist's choices. The environment is memorable but functions more as a backdrop than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is visually distinct with "veins of quartz" and "spectral ribbons," though the descriptions feel static and decorative rather than pressuring the character's choices. The "auroral glow" provides atmosphere but functions more as a backdrop than a constraint; the environment facilitates the solution (mica) rather arbitrarily.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific, with the "toxic sky" and "greenhouse city" interacting directly with the protagonist's condition. The environment is not just a backdrop but a source of pressure (lies) and resources (zinc fragments), grounding the fantastical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting is atmospherically consistent and vivid ("whispering bluff," "cloud-sea"), establishing a strong fable-like mood. However, the environment acts primarily as a passive backdrop for the sculpture rather than a source of friction or resources that constrain Elara's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.7)
    The "fragile Eden" and "clown faces grinning from bulbous thorns" create a vivid, surreal atmosphere that grounds the story's unique tone. The setting effectively constrains the action, particularly regarding the dome's integrity during the burn, linking environment to stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.1)
    Orientation is functional, but the setting relies on generic floral descriptions ("dew-kissed jasmine," "roses unfurling") that lack specific sensory grit. The atmosphere feels ornamental rather than lived-in, with the "vibrant" courtyard feeling more like a stage set than a real location.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.2)
    While the "sunken laboratory" is established, physical laws are selectively ignored; performative ballet in a pressurized deep-sea suit is physically implausible and breaks immersion. The setting serves as a backdrop for metaphors rather than a source of concrete, constraining pressure; the "cold" and "currents" are mentioned but do not meaningfully hinder the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.2)
    While visual descriptions of the crystals are vivid, the geography is incoherent (rocks vs. sand; relationship of cave to whale). The setting details are often filtered through stacked adjectives rather than interaction, and the atmosphere relies on repetitive phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established with coherent sensory details ("mossy stone," "indigo from midnight herbs"), though it leans heavily on generic fantasy tropes ("liquid starlight"). While the environment reacts to the magic, it functions more as a mirror for the protagonist's intent than a source of constraint or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.2)
    Atmospheric details like "warped floorboards" and "crimson wax" effectively establish the mood. However, some elements like the "Perseid meteor shower" and "jasmine" feel somewhat ornamental and standard for the genre, lacking a unique, story-specific sensory texture.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=4.5)
    Descriptors like "velvet," "shadowed," and "midnight moss" create a heavy, consistent atmosphere but function largely as a static backdrop. The setting does not constrain the character’s choices or offer tools that shape the tactical execution of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting is established but heavily overwritten with "purple" descriptors ("ethereal dance," "languid rhythm," "crystalline tear") that distance the reader. While the imagery is consistent, the environment functions as a static, atmospheric backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint on the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.4)
    The atmosphere is consistent but heavy-handed, relying on purple descriptions ("frozen tears," "indifferent gaze") rather than concrete sensory details that constrain choice. The setting serves as a backdrop for the magic system but does not physically interact with the characters' movements or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting of the ice shrine is evocative and establishes a strong, chilly atmosphere consistent with the ghost story. However, the descriptions often veer into purple prose ("hull cracked open like a shattered vow"), prioritizing ornamentation over grounding the reader in the physical constraints of the space.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the atmospheric description is vivid, it leans heavily on generic "mystical" tropes ("whispering parapet," "glistening mist"). The specific physical reality of the tool (the tea whisk) clashes with the task (net mending), breaking the scene's logical grounding. The setting functions as a static backdrop for philosophy rather than a source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    The contrast between the "swirling ochre storms" and the "stillpoint" is effective and establishes the stakes. The detail of "confetti-like shreds" surviving for years in a looted house with the door ajar strains credibility given the "radioactive dust storms." The setting generally serves the plot well but lacks unique, unexpected texture.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the visual of the stormlit observatory is distinct, the description is marred by abstract, clashing adjectives that confuse the atmosphere. The reliance on the portico as a frame is effective, but the sensory details often feel decorative rather than grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is established with vivid, if slightly purple, imagery ("wind-sculpted sands," "feral loft"). The atmosphere is consistent, though the reliance on adjectival stacking ("rose-gold light," "salt-crusted shutters") occasionally clogs the description. Orientation is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is vividly described but suffers from excessive, ornate adjectival stacking ("shimmering veins," "fleshly glow") that distances the reader. While the drift-ice provides a backdrop, the environment rarely constrains the protagonist's tactical choices; it serves mostly as a canvas for lighting effects rather than a physical obstacle course.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting details ("basalt sanctuary," "magnetic viaduct") establish a cohesive aesthetic, but descriptions often lean into adjective-heavy telling ("bitter moon," "silent sentinels"). The rain freezing on the girders is a strong, functional detail that grounds the sci-fi logic, though the environment rarely pressures the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.6)
    While the sensory details of the water are vivid, the presence of an Underground Railroad lantern sitting openly in a subway tunnel (built decades after the era) strains credibility. The setting serves the mood but fails the logic test required for high-stakes immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is vivid but overloaded with modifiers ("vibrant hush," "silent fireflies," "ethereal tinkles") that create a purple, suffocating atmosphere. While the shop is established, the sensory details feel like a checklist of "literary" descriptions rather than details filtered through the specific urgency of the character's guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting (acid sea, workshop) is visually distinct and creative, but the summary mode keeps it distant; we are told of the "corrosive waves" but do not see them constrain a specific, urgent choice. The environment serves as a backdrop for the "evolution" rather than a source of immediate, tactical pressure in a scene.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.3)
    The "digital mausoleum" and "social detritus" offer a functional, if standard, cyberpunk backdrop. Specific details like "Stellar Drift" help ground the timeline, but the setting largely feels like a generic container for the plot rather than a pressure-cooker shaping the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.5)
    The juxtaposition of the lighthouse orchard and ice floes creates a vivid, imaginative atmosphere. However, the sudden introduction of a "holographic map" at the climax clashes tonally with the established vintage/fantasy aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    Atmosphere is evocative ("clinked like fragile chimes"), but mechanical details strain verisimilitude (trawling inside a marina, a lace parasol in a survival suit). The setting successfully mirrors the internal state but functions more as a backdrop than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.8)
    The setting is rendered through decorative, repetitive adjectives ("swirling amber," "amber pavilion," "amber glow," "golden foliage") rather than concrete, constraining details. The environment feels like a stage set designed to mirror the mood rather than a physical place with distinct, tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.6)
    The "kinetic parapet" requiring peripheral observation is a strong, constraint-driven concept that shapes the action. However, the atmosphere relies heavily on repetitive adjectival phrases ("whisperfield calm," "murmuring pavilion") rather than distinct, varied sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is visually distinct but relies heavily on pathetic fallacy ("vines... patient fingers," "flowers swaying in gentle conspiracy"). While the imagery is vivid, the description often creates a static backdrop rather than a pressure-cooker environment that forces choices.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, establishing the "post-dictionary" rules effectively. The crystal serves as a functional micro-setting that constrains attention and enables the climax, integrating well with the sensory details of the library.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "fog sculpture garden" and "hush of old videotapes" are vivid, specific, and functionally integrated. The environment actively constrains visibility and necessitates the protagonist's specific tools (chalk, driftwood) to navigate.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting suffers from conflicting details; "High above Earth's churning clouds" and "observatory secure above the clouds" conflate a lunar setting with a terrestrial mountain observatory, confusing the sense of place. While the pressurized environment allows for sound, hearing a leaf fall amidst a moonquake and wailing alarms strains credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on vague, ethereal descriptions ("radiant haven," "glass walls") rather than grounding, specific details. Imagery often leans into cliché ("sunlight pierced... like golden threads") instead of sensory particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.2)
    The observatory imagery is vivid ("crystal spires," "filigreed bronze"), anchoring the scene well visually. However, the backstory element of "spoons" bending reality creates a jarring tonal clash with the solemn, high-fantasy atmosphere of rune scholars and ancient automatons.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=4.7)
    The setting contains standard fantasy tropes (hedge maze, secret garden) but is marred by semantically confused descriptors like "nostalgic riot" and "innovative memories." These "hallucinated" adjectives obscure rather than illuminate the sense of place. While the spatial choreography is legible, the atmosphere is synthetic, relying on clichés ("moonlight pooled," "dew-kissed") mixed with incoherence.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is obscured by excessive adjectival clutter ("serpentine," "mist-veiled," "salt-kissed") that renders the geography vague. While the grotto is established early, it serves as a static backdrop for internal monologue rather than an environment that pressures the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting concept (mossy data center) is vivid but functions primarily as a container for metaphors ("silicon bones") rather than a constraint on action. While the imagery is lush, it doesn't force choices or create obstacles; the environment is too passive to generate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "feral nexus" is atmospherically consistent but abstract, relying on vague descriptors like "misty" and "languid" rather than concrete sensory grounding. The setting functions as a generic stage for the allegory rather than a pressure-cooker environment.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy descriptors ("verdant arbor," "silken veil") that create a visual backdrop but fail to constrain action or force tactical tradeoffs. The environment feels decorative rather than a source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting integration is exceptional; the "withered orchard" and its refuse are not just backdrop but the active ingredients of the magic system. This creates a high degree of specificity and tactile grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory details in the cavern are vivid ("quartz veins," "mauve" dusk), effectively grounding the technical action. However, the repeated atmospheric markers ("wounded season," "lull") float without specific grounding in the world's logic or constraints, creating a somewhat generic post-apocalyptic mood.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "bronze grotto" and "starlight" create a consistent, vivid atmosphere with strong visual anchoring. However, the recurring abstract phrases ("shingled hush," "whalebone reverie") eventually clutter the setting rather than deepening it. The imagery is distinct, but the spatial geography of the "natural altar" relative to the "apex" remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmospheric details like the antique stove and lion posters are strong and specific. However, the verbatim repetition of the prompt's tone phrase ("rust-hued peace") three times undermines the immersion, making the setting feel checklist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integral; the "kinetic lagoon" and "brass-rimmed platforms" create a distinct atmosphere that constrains the action. The disposable camera wheel serves as an excellent micro-setting object that anchors the surreal mechanics in tactile detail. Sensory details like the "plastic warm as flesh" enhance immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.2)
    The contrast between the carnival's garish debris and the sterile, abandoned spaceport creates a vivid visual atmosphere. However, the spatial geography dissolves into abstract "flows" during the repair sequence, reducing grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is vivid but static, with descriptions like "glacial hush" and "crystal whispering" repeated to the point of dilution. The environment serves as a passive, atmospheric backdrop for the epiphany rather than a source of pressure that constrains the character's tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting contains some evocative imagery ("mist clung... like unspoken regrets"), but leans into purple prose that distances the reader. Specificity is undermined by the reliance on abstract metaphorical descriptions over concrete, sensory details that constrain the character's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.3)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with the "golden dock" and "fog" creating a distinct, dreamlike stage. Sensory details like "salt-crusted pods" and "barnacled pilings" ground the fantastical elements effectively, though the setting functions more as a backdrop than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is established with lush, sensory-rich imagery ("gnarled oaks," "scent of damp soil"), providing a strong atmospheric anchor. However, the descriptions often veer into decorative excess that serves the prose style more than it constrains the character's tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting of the suspended palace and mechanical undercity is visually distinct and anchors the action well. However, the atmosphere is marred by the excessive repetition of specific descriptors ("quaking," "reverie") which deadens the sensory impact.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.5)
    Setting details are vivid and central to the ritual ("obsidian shards," "black sand"), grounding the action. However, the description often stalls momentum with heavy adjectival stacking ("languid peace," "ancient volcanic calm") rather than strictly guiding the character's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "frozen geese" provide a strong, specific visual anchor, but the setting largely relies on generic fantasy adjectives ("ancient runes," "bruised sky"). The environment feels like a static backdrop for a fetch quest rather than a pressure cooker forcing choices.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    The nebula garden is vivid, and the integration of the "calculating machine gear" as a tactile object against the ethereal backdrop works well to ground the setting. Specific details like the "luminous soil" and "petal-throne" establish a distinct atmosphere, though reliance on abstract adjectives ("ethereal," "fragile") softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.5)
    Atmosphere is established with vivid sensory details like "fractured glass" and "iridescent river," though the descriptions tilt toward the melodramatic ("living cathedral," "glass womb"). The setting largely serves as a static container for the dialogue rather than exerting pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is established with vivid, if slightly purple, imagery ("tidal obsidian ridge," "froth hissed like damned souls"). While the atmosphere is coherent, the high-intensity descriptors feel static and heavy-handed, occasionally cluttering the spatial choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the atmosphere is established, the description suffers from severe verbatim repetition ("velveteen gloom" appearing four times) that breaks immersion. The setting feels like a static stage set where props are "tenderly organized" rather than a lived-in environment that constrains the protagonist's tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and distinct; the obsidian spire and frozen lake act as effective constraints that shape the protagonist's methodology. The sensory details strongly support the atmosphere of "grounded" fantasy, though occasional purple phrasing distracts.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=5.5)
    The atmospheric details ("yellowed sheets," "ember light") create a cohesive mood, but the setting operates largely as a backdrop rather than a source of pressure. The repetition of the phrase "thistled calm" distracts from the physical specificity of the alcove, reducing the environment to a stylistic label.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gallery setting is integral, not just decorative; the "illusory depths" and vanishing point physics actively enable the protagonist's method of disposal and thematic denial. Sensory details—the creak of the oak, the scent of scorched paper, the porcelain shards—are vivid and purposeful. The environment effectively charges the final image of the dust spiraling into nothingness. (Score capped by Q7 artifact debt).

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.7)
    The sewer setting is rendered with vivid, if slightly adjective-heavy, sensory detail ("slime-slick," "plague ash") that grounds the action. The environment offers functional resistance (mud, layers) that shapes the pacing, though some elements like "bioluminescent fungi" feel like stock tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is atmospheric but repetitive, relying heavily on the descriptor "velvet" (used four times) and generic autumn imagery. While the zither is described in detail, the library itself feels like a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker for the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rusted greenhouse is established with decent sensory detail ("corroded panes," "dew-slick leaves"). However, abstractions like "iridescent knowledge" in the final visual break the concrete sensory grounding required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.3)
    The atmosphere is vivid and specific, successfully establishing the "bio-punk" aesthetic of the tower. However, the phrase "nectar dusk" is repeated four times in a short space, and the "honey/amber" motif, while cohesive, becomes heavy-handed. The setting details successfully ground the fantasy elements.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.1)
    Specific objects like the "perfumer’s orris root shard" and "silver locket" add necessary texture, but the setting is often obscured by excessive personification ("streetlights daydreamed," "forgotten sighs"). The atmosphere feels ethereal and detached, lacking the sensory grit required to ground the magical elements in a believable reality.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.5)
    The underwater atmosphere is vivid ("bioluminescent anemones," "slow veils of bubbles") and the telepathy acknowledges the physical constraints of water. However, the setting primarily functions as a backdrop for the visions rather than forcing specific tactical choices beyond the initial communication barrier.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting functions well as a metaphysical constraint, though the "ethereal paper conjured from the stair's glow" is a convenient prop that lacks grounding. The sensory details of the dice are tactile and effective, but the "seismic belch" clashes with the otherwise elevated atmospheric tone.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.5)
    The rooftop greenhouse offers a vivid, specific setting that contrasts effectively with the "smog-choked" city below. Sensory details like "fogged by distant factory haze" and "plant-derived inks" ground the magical realism elements well.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.0)
    The grotto setting is established with vivid sensory details like bioluminescence and ice walls. However, the specific atmospheric descriptor "rosewater dread" is repeated mechanically, diminishing its effect.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting anchors the action functionally, with the tide and lighthouse providing necessary constraints. However, description relies on adjective stuffing ("mysterious lighthouse," "jagged cliffs," "cruel arrow") rather than specific, sensory interaction, resulting in a generic atmospheric backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is vivid and the mirror maze is integrated effectively into the climax, serving the theme of distorted reflection. However, the atmosphere suffers from oversaturation; the relentless density of modifiers ("moldy," "sickly," "grotesque," "warped") creates a claustrophobic texture that sometimes stifles spatial clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "orchard afloat on a circle of driftwood" is vividly realized and actively provides the tools (debris, apples) for the resolution. The sensory details ("sapphire shards," "salt-rimed tattoos") effectively ground the surreal concept in a tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and functional, with sensory details like "molten gold" and "hummed with captured winds" grounding the fantasy. The physical geography of the turtle shell actively constrains the protagonist's actions and shapes the method of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=4.4)
    Setting details are heavy with adjectives ("damp earth," "ivy curtain") and standard Gothic tropes rather than specific, constraining elements. The environment serves as a static backdrop for the discovery rather than an active force shaping tactics. The rosebush appearing to "nod" is a jarring moment of pathetic fallacy that undermines the requested realism.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=5.5)
    Atmospheric details like "mist-shrouded" and "slick steps" are vivid, but the physical mechanics of the scene break suspension of disbelief. Writing with a dipping inkwell and paper while chest-deep in a storm-tossed sea is physically impractical, as is applying mortar underwater in high turbulence. These logistical gaps undermine the setting's solidity.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.1)
    The underwater library setting is established with functional sensory details like "sodden shelves" and "water's distant murmur." While atmospheric, the description feels somewhat generic to the "sunken city" trope and does not significantly constrain the protagonist's tactical choices beyond the blackout necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is imaginative, blending the floating tea garden with the glass basilica effectively. However, the description often favors ethereal abstraction ("whispers of rice paper," "dew in crystal webs") over tactile grounding, creating a "white-room" effect disguised by ornate imagery. The paradoxical staircase is a strong visual concept that anchors the ascent well.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is established with evocative sensory details like "thrumming anti-grav coils" and the "scorched earth" below. However, the logic of the protagonist wearing shredded rags for five years in a high-tech environment strains verisimilitude and distracts from the otherwise grounded atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.2)
    The observatory setting is established with clear visual cues ("brass instruments," "cracked dome"), but the description relies heavily on repetitive prompt phrases ("brilliant dimness"). The environment functions as a container for the props rather than a source of pressure or constraint that shapes the characters' tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting of the cobalt terrace and driftwood shore is atmospheric and visually distinct. However, the descriptive language leans toward the purple ("shadowed indigo," "jagged rocks"), occasionally prioritizing aesthetic over function.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established early, but relies on generic fantasy tropes ("mist clung... like a shroud," "wind's lament") and purple prose. The physical space is functional, but the atmosphere feels manufactured through adjectives rather than specific, sensory interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    The concept of the utility poles as a "terrestrial constellation" is a distinct, high-quality specific that grounds the scene effectively. However, other descriptions veer into purple prose ("bruised oranges") that distracts from the physical reality of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=3.5)
    Setting details rely on generic sci-fi tropes ("bioluminescent fungi," "azure" glow) and confusing descriptors ("delicately robust currents"). The atmosphere is conveyed through heavy-handed adjectives rather than sensory grounding that constrains the characters' actions.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=3.0)
    The setting consists of generic high-fantasy tropes ("silver leaves," "glowing fruit," "eternal spring") without sensory specificity or grounding. The environment functions as a vending machine for plot coupons (spices found in nooks) rather than a source of constraint or atmosphere that pressures the character.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vividly realized, with the "midnight glade above the clouds" providing a distinct, atmospheric container for the ritual. The environment actively constrains the action, forcing the protagonist to interact with specific elements (dew, roots, mist). While impactful, the description occasionally thickens into static ornamentation that slows the scene's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "recycled spaceship" offers some texture ("melted-down battlecruisers"), but the physics of a hologram manipulating physical objects (pearl, tapestry) are indistinct. The spatial blocking at the end (ascending then descending) is contradictory.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is established with high sensory density, but the description often veers into purple prose ("velvet breath," "sapphire whispers") that creates a fairytale distance rather than visceral grounding. While the location is clear, the reliance on ornate adjectives over specific, tactile details weakens the atmospheric impact.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with vivid details like "phosphor veins" and the "half-painted sundial" grounding the fantasy. The environment actively enables the protagonist’s method (the sundial's shadows), satisfying the requirement for setting to constrain or guide choice. However, the sensory experience is mostly visual, lacking tactile or auditory texture to deepen the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    The frictionless physics are the story's strongest element, grounding the fantastical premise in concrete constraints (boots whispering, dust unable to settle). The imagery of eels as "living smoke" and the "slide" of the world effectively builds a coherent, tactile atmosphere. However, the reliance on standard "sacred geometry" tropes slightly flattens the specific strangeness of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting is described with dense, ornamental imagery ("veins of forgotten gods," "roiling clouds") that establishes a heavy mood but rarely constrains specific tactics. While the darkroom timer and telescope are used, the environment largely functions as a static, atmospheric backdrop rather than a pressure cooker for the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is visually distinct but functionally vague; the sundial's "coded angles" operate as plot magic rather than a grounded element of the world. The atmosphere relies on telling ("serene chaos") rather than sensory evocation.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is established with specific details like the "warped volume of Rilke," but the atmosphere suffers from overwriting ("luminous shards," "splintered gloom"). The description often draws attention to itself rather than serving the narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Tidal Arbor and Cloudstation are visually distinct and imaginative, providing a strong backdrop. However, the description sometimes drifts into the ornamental ("ethereal moons," "prism-leaves") rather than tactile constraints that force character decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting contains vivid imagery ("orchids hummed forgotten lullabies," "glowing archives"), but relies heavily on adjectival stacking rather than interactive constraint. The "empirically whimsical flora" is a creative concept, but the environment mostly serves as a backdrop for the action rather than a source of pressure or tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=4.4)
    Setting details are obscured by purple prose ("bruised with cerulean regret"), rendering the environment abstract rather than concrete. The "islet" feels like a stage set constructed solely for the metaphor, lacking tactile grounding or specific sensory texture beyond the visual overload.

Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s bias—she sees light, feels vibration, ignores scent—keeping description urgent rather than catalogic. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across the group circle, Kai recoil, lily tremor, final encirclement. One hairline slip: “perpetual twilight” is stated twice in similar phrasing, a micro-loop that barely dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    The drowned library is not a backdrop but a tactical partner: airless rifts, petrified leviathan spines, and the cracked air dome literally hold the prisms that rewrite death-protocol. Sensory hierarchy is biased by Elias’s profession—he catalogues silt graves, notes “bioluminescent anemones pulsing like hesitant heartbeats,” and smells decay only when it signals an echo he must silence. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies, books, and currents are tracked without drift during the multi-vector shard installation. Micro-setting triumphs: the lighthouse lens charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate even though environment is slightly less active than body/tool in constraining choices.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)

Spatial choreography tracks cleanly as the robot glides, lifts, plays, sets down.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    The forecourt’s mirrored crystals function as both mirror and loudspeaker, constraining Elias’s tactics (he must hide within their_echo) and charging the final image (wholeness reflected back). Rain-polished facets narrow Mira’s movement—she fears literal reflection—and the wet surface forces tactile contact when she steadies herself on the niche. Spatial choreography is pristine: booth, niche, crystals, bodies track without drift. Sensory economy favors hush and glint over visual excess, keeping density high.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—thaw mistrust via transparency—is signaled in paragraph four. Escalation is textural: each ticket-image deepens density until denial becomes impossible; the lens’s hologram projects a literal “mirror” Mira must face. Cost is conceptual rather than tangible—her self-image fractures—visible when she murmurs “I hid to protect, but it froze me.” A sharper external price (e.g., Elias risking his registrar post) would have pushed the band higher.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    The maze is rendered through touch—vine binding, leaf snap under boot, moss fur on the cache—so setting constrains every tactic. The cracked marbles operate as micro-setting; their fracture planes decide which orb gets polished and thus which luck value the auditors read.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Flooded pit, bobbing lanterns, water-lapped proscenium—each detail is filtered through a violinist’s ear-eye hierarchy and actively guides choice (the prompter’s box below stage, the submerged grate). The lantern chains, muck underfoot, and sloshing acoustics constrain movement and supply the final tool (water as developer of images). Micro-setting (sodden program on a dry ledge) doubles as plot engine. One small float: spatial relation between pit, prompter box, and grate could be one sentence tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mountain weather station is evoked through frost-rimed windows, anemometer clicks, and kerosene flame—every detail filtered by Elara’s fevered selectivity.

    The tunnel’s damp echo, rust grit, and silt half-burying the bulkhead are selectively filtered through Jax’s goal-driven attention, guiding his kneel-and-touch choice. The beaded wheel re-appears with evolving texture (rusted → yielding) and finally fragments in pocket, charging the last image. Spatial choreography is clean; distance to valve, radio, and door track. Sensory economy favors touch and sound over visual catalog, supporting drowsy-alert tone. Environment constrains the final act: only by breaching the buried door can symbolic release occur, meeting 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    The library-catacomb is a living organ: vines “pry at flagstones,” fungi pulse overhead, paper hums—details act, not decorate. The obsidian refuge re-enters as charged micro-setting, its light-absorbing walls forcing the hush that mends. Sensory economy is excellent; one line (“sodden and renewed”) conveys both bodily state and environmental baptism. Spatial choreography holds as the keeper crawls through obedient soil to river-edge.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sage Ridge is evoked through wind-scented brush, root-arch ceiling, and eclipse chill that silences birds—details filter Elias’s therapist gaze and nudge Lila’s attention upward. The locket micro-setting charges the final image when corona-light ignites the curl. Spatial choreography is flawless; only the ridge’s prior geography is sketched broadly, but that never constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tilted silo is not backdrop but pivot: bookshelves lean, dust spirals upward, and the vault’s warp enables the cache discovery. Micro-setting (fireplace choking ash) constrains the recovery method and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy stays with Thorne’s perceptive bias—vibration, bronze hush—never tourist catalog. 9+ gate missed only because the axis itself is never allowed to alter his bodily tactics on-page; environment shapes mood more than choice.

    Fog-soaked tavern, iron spiral, sweeping beam—each detail is filtered through Elias’s habitual solitude and later weaponized. The lighthouse mechanism itself becomes the decisive tool, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography holds as Elias moves bar→stairs→lantern→bar→stairs without drift. A single overripe phrase—“familiar enigma of solitude wrapping him like a well-worn fog cloak”—slows the opening, but the rest is taut.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    The chamber of “whispering voids” is tactile: paint smears fracture-lines, pedal clicks echo off unseen walls, silence pools like frost. Micro-setting succeeds—the loop pedal and single-color palette are handled repeatedly, their states tracked (paint consumed, pedal clicked off). Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible body shifts. The white palette’s final coating of the core literally re-images the setting, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    The frozen lake and mirrored horizon are not backdrop but instrument: ice vibrates beneath her, reflecting dawn and memory in perfect inversion—this constrains her final gesture and charges the closing image. The nautilus shell functions as micro-setting, its logarithmic whorls dictating the memory-map and baton-conduct. Sensory economy is acute—pearlescent glow, salt-stung wind, prismatic scores—each filtered through Elara’s synesthetic composer-perception. Spatial choreography is flawless: descent of spiral stairs, kneel, lift, collapse track cleanly across the ice.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Glowing post-storm viaduct, suspended rain, wet stone and reflected halo light are filtered through Elias’s gravity-attuned senses; every sensory pick threads into mood and choice. The viaduct’s pulsing glow literally feeds the tablet and gates the corridors, so the macro-setting constrains tactic and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean—hover, skim, press, land—no impossible positions. Idiom remains consistent and concrete, not tourist-catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is not backdrop but resonant tool: cavern walls become vibration conduit, drum-stretched hides act as amplification membranes, phonograph horn a “petrified shout.” The body-as-instrument micro-setting (palms to stone, ribcage as cavity) constrains every action and is reprised in the final image. Seasonal rustle is threaded through cracks rather than dumped; it tightens the final hush by contrast. Spatial choreography stays legible as students circle the phonograph—no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Courtyard micro-setting constrains every move: gate lock, olive tree, workbench lantern; these tangible objects channel her choices and charge the ending image. Sensory filtration mirrors her anemometer gaze—wind direction, gravel sound—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no floating rooms.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Crystal-shadow lattice, dew-kissed fronds, UV scalpel-beam: selective sensory triad mirrors emotional filtration. Greenhouse topography stays coherent—dome center, loamy soil under knees—guidifying physical choices (kneel, pocket lantern). Extinct-plant biopics limited to necessary; no exposition dump. Tool (lantern) doubles as micro-setting that constrains angle of reveal, satisfying 9+ gate. Weather is internal humidity, tracked consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grotto’s clay acoustics and spiral etchings actively shape the encounter—energy patterns need the curved walls to refract, making setting tactical. Rope-fibers-as-vein function as micro-setting, constraining the final wrist-wrap choice. Starlight color-shift (crimson/silver) times the climax, welding atmosphere to beat. All detail is filtered through Elias’s poet-perception; no cataloguing.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—touch time’s texture—signals early and tightens via binary fork: sever past (burn rope) or stay surface-skimmer. Escalation is density-driven: each unveiled layer thickens the ethical cost of fusion. The spiral pattern’s impossible loop embodies the tightening; no external coincidence. Price is visible—rope ignites, prison identity irretrievably merged—altering tactics for future roadside poems.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    The half-flooded greenhouse and bioluminescent plankton are not spectacle; they amplify acoustics and dictate the ritual’s stage. Shipwrecks literally act as organ pipes; shattered panes tinkle only after the music, tying setting to closure. Micro-setting works too: the mendicant bowl’s shimmer refracts firelight, cueing the listener shift. No spatial drift; bodies orbit the bonfire with clear vectors.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Amber veins, static crackle, and resin glow are inseparable from the emotional tech; the grotto itself is the instrument that charges the petal and constrains the transfer. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Elias’s perfume craft—scent first, touch second, sight last—keeping detail purposeful. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies, petal, and amber outcrop track cleanly across the beat. Setting passes 9+ gate: environment directly shapes the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sea-salt air, swaying lantern-lit shelves, and creaking dock planks texture every beat without catalogue overload. The locket photo acts as micro-setting, charging the final image when replaced by a new joint snapshot. Spatial choreography stays clean across cottage knock, pier memory, and starry alcove. Weather (breeze) nudges gestures but never thresholds choice, keeping atmosphere supportive, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is never backdrop: the translucent trunks literally bear the glyph that catalyzes action, while the obsidian arbor’s facets catch starlight to “pulse” the crater’s glow—charging the final image. Sensory economy is disciplined: one tactile branch, one visual shimmer, one auditory murmur, each filtered through Elara’s reed-sculptor eye. Spatial choreography is clean—ridge crest, vault apex, kneeling placement of reeds—no impossible positions. The orchard–crater dyad constrains every move: they follow branches inward because the geography dictates it.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rooftop canal ecosystem is vividly particular—bioluminescent fish, vine-wrapped otters, skeletal finger-towers—each detail filtered through Elara’s illustrator gaze. Spatial choreography is clear across the coracle’s path; the narrowing canals and sculptural barriers track cleanly. The Echo Cradle basin recharges earlier cadence imagery, satisfying the 9+ gate. A few phrases flirt with excess adjectives (“perpetual twilight… iridescent water… ancient teeth”), but they serve texture more than stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cavern orchard is not backdrop but tool: stalactite drip nourishes trees, luminescent fruit heats wand-tip, chipped tesserae provide dovetail blueprint. Spatial choreography clean—roots, stepping-stone, eyes, wand— tracked without drift. Sensory hierarchy obeys conjurer’s gaze: moon-angles, fractures, iris facets. Environment literally channels the dovetail act and final heartbeat image.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Library at dawn, outage-lit, is no postcard: warped metal crevice, chalked seam, and scavenged phonograph needle constrain every tactic. The “sapphire hush” hue is filtered through POV—Elias notices blue gleams because he lives in chromatic near-dark. Micro-setting (tape fragment wedged where moisture warped flanges) physically blocks insulation removal, forcing delicate trowel work that shows methodical kindness. Final image re-uses the color/tone, now reframed as shared light rather than solitary hide-space, recharging the motif.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mossy trellis functions as micro-setting that literally embraces and disciplines the body; its wet wood scent + lightning flashes constrain the exact posture he must take. Rain rhythm tracks metamorphosis beats, tightening screws. “Valley prone to storms” is tourist-lite but immediately filtered through Elias’s professional worry. Environment charges final image: rain washing moss onto his new leaves = undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Island topography is tactile—“basalt cliffs scarred by war-era bombardments,” “kelp clung like war banners”—and directly guides Elias’s descent to the pool. Tidal rhythm is lived, not catalogued: it swallows shacks, spits bones, dictates when the altar is reachable. The amber brooch charges the final image; environment + artifact together constrain the closing brush-stroke. Weather and spatial choreography remain coherent across the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cave is not backdrop; crystal angles dictate the choreography of shadow-invasion and constrain the only exit. Music’s cadence mirrors emotional crests, forcing Elara’s surrender on the down-beat. Sensory hierarchy favors sound over sight, matching POV bias. Pearl-as-micro-setting charges the final image; removing it collapses the transfer logic.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Starlit vault, mist, and cracked dome are tactile and filter through Elias’s cartographer gaze; the phantom punch as micro-setting constrains every move. Spatial choreography stays coherent down the spiral stair and into the spectral car. Environment charges the final image: the distant vault prologue to “eternal cartography.”

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stargazer’s tower dominates as micro-setting: wind, salt spray, telescopes, lantern-lit floor—every cushion and carved number is handled under pressure. Whale migration and storm thunder constrain pacing (migration = clock, storm = muffled songs, forcing indoor focus). Spatial choreography clean: fisherman climbs, deposits tile, exits; visitors circle the square later. The square itself becomes the charged object that alters choices; environment thus meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prismatic escondite, crystal spires, and magnetic flux lines are sensuously specific and directly inform tactics—fields become conduits he modulates to steer the mutiny. The body-as-setting is thin, but the crystal nexus where fields converge functions as micro-setting that charges the final collapse. Sensory economy favors visual and kinesthetic; other senses appear only once, yet the selection mirrors Elowen’s detached, optic-centric awareness. World rules remain consistent: dimensions rebel only when storm-amplified fields intersect the fragment’s pulse—no late rule patches.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prep-room micro-setting acts as both pressure-cooker and toolkit: refrigerators tick like metronomes, embalming fluids become chemical clue, door doubles as breach vector. Stainless-table spatial choreography stays clean throughout. Sensory hierarchy obeys Eli’s con-artist eye for hidden pockets and timing. Ink pot as recurring object constrains choice and reweights at closure. Modeled arterial glow and chemical zest verge on overwrought but stay purposeful; one excess adjective keeps under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bonsai labyrinth is no postcard; its “minuscule canopies trembling as if inhaling his refractions” constrains Thorne’s decision to leave the book at its heart. The rice-paper pavilion, single humming lamp, and gold-dust air supply tactile stage business that alters action (leaf adherence, waveform inscription). Spatial choreography holds as Thorne rises, wanders, returns. Environment charges the final image: the riotous bloom signals successful re-release of time-textures, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Container cathedral, salt-laced wind, and tide-clock choreography are filtered through the wanderer’s synesthetic bias—containers “brimming with layered narratives.” The poison label’s curl is tactile, re-used at climax to anchor re-identification. Environment actively gates movement (flood/retreat) and supplies the decisive object, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Observatory, cliff, salt-crusted stones, and failing-light dome are selectively sprinkled, never catalogued. The half-finished cello and flaking painted shell function as micro-setting, constraining the only possible climax (resonance requires both). Wind and perpetual dusk mirror interior tone without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean—boots crunch, bench splinters, shell aligns to f-hole. Environment never dominates page space yet charges the final image; gate for 9 not met because no environmental detail literally forecloses a live alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    “Bioluminescent lanterns ignited the waterways” and “gear-spokes traced a cipher” anchor sensory specificity to plot function; the raft lattice becomes a living map that constrains tactics. Spatial choreography stays clean across raft-to-raft moves; no floating rooms. Environment directly shapes the final image—stone pressed into wet paint—earning the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lunar summit is viscerally anchored—gloved rungs, fogging visor, velvet pad on vacuum-exposed basalt—each object constrains camera angle or flare timing. Micro-setting (the grain on black velvet) becomes the charged final image. Light progression from ghostly silver to gold is tracked via Elias’s visor and shutter, never as postcard filler.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mist, rail iron, water-basins, and lantern shards form a micro-setting that literally bends light to reveal cracks; environment constrains every tactical move. The drone’s iridescent wing serves as mobile setting-object, its refractive state dictating repair tempo. Final image of depot beacon refracted through fog re-weights the stake. No credibility gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rusted outpost, lake ice, and stove steam are never backdrop: corrugated walls groan under snow-load, condensation micro-maps the terrain, and the falcon’s iced feathers set the thermometer. Steam rivulets function as micro-setting that literally redraws Harlan’s course—8.8 gate met. Sensory hierarchy obeys cartographer priorities—distance, texture, line—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.3)
    Place detail is selective and atmospheric: “shadows clung like forgotten whispers,” “cracks…knitting like healed flesh.” The archway, cobblestones, and fork function as micro-settings that physically transmit the rhythm, directly enabling the revival beat. Sensory economy keeps the ghost-town palette vivid without expository drift, meeting the 9+ gate for environment charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.1)
    Temple architecture, current vortex, and O₂ gauge act as micro-setting trio that jointly constrain tactics; spatial choreography is clean—pedestal distance tracked as she “approaches,” “extends arms,” “kicks upward.” Sensory hierarchy follows diver POV: sight narrowed to flashlight cone, touch filtered through gloves, hearing replaced by internal “alarm shriek.” Sapphire polyp glow recurs to color final image, qualifying as recurring object charging closure. Kelp-petrified pedestal is only named landmark; wider geopolitics absent but unnecessary at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Salt-etched windows, copper dusk, and narrow scuffs function as micro-setting that guides every move; the lighthouse prison’s spiral tightens proportionally to Elias’s breathing. Sensory hierarchy follows trespasser priorities—touch of worn stone, lattice warmth, hush density—never sliding into catalog. Spatial choreography survives the squeezes, hovers, and descents without impossible positions. Final image of reef waves “glinting in repose” reuses the same copperlight motif, now re-priced as accomplice to silence. World rule (lattice sustains shades) is shown through beats, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting details (frost-laced panes, luminous pear, venom-apple vine) are filtered through Elias’s alchemical gaze and constrain his choices—what he can eat, what he can transmute. The greenhouse itself acts as a micro-setting crucible: spatial choreography stays consistent as he moves from potting bench to frost-pane to floor collapse. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis—taste of poisoned wine, hum of runes—never a static postcard. Final image reuses the same glass panes now glowing with unnatural bloom, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    Red canyon walls, petroglyphs, and cooling rock under bare feet deliver tactile specificity that constrains movement; the loom of tide pools sets a live clock. “Orchid-solace” dye becomes micro-setting, its purple visible in final seams. Spatial choreography stays clean across dream-veins; no impossible positions. Environment directly supplies the stone “cloth” she sews, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    Catacomb orchard is sketched with macabre economy—bones as “forgotten relics,” roots “possessively between ribcages”—and the image of apple blossoms drifting onto skulls is indelible. Spatial layout stays coherent across fourteen days of action. Weathered granite, lichen-crust, gnomon slot all supply tactile micro-setting that later constrains the rebuild, satisfying 9+ gate. A few stock cues (“dusty road,” “gnarled trees”) slightly dilute specificity but never stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    Golden arcade is no backdrop: chrome benches reflect her chalk dust, drones cast shadows that distort her grid, brass post chute gleams like a trap. Pavement square functions as micro-setting—its “pristine” surface scars under her strokes, constraining where glyphs can hide. The chalk’s “powdery blue” returns in the final heart, recharging earlier innocence with risk. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: she hears vendor bots but filters out their sales pitch, attention locked on fading dust.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cobalt walls, domed stained glass, and the fuel-less candle are not backdrop—they physically shape her work-light, hide spies in balconies, and let autumn leaves sound like marching boots, directly cueing her feints. The eternal candle’s physics is introduced as founding relic, not explained, but its rhythm synchronizes her needle—an on-page constraint that charges closure. Spatial choreography is immaculate; hoop, satchel, tea-cup, and courier’s hand track cleanly through the single continuous scene. Selective sensory hierarchy favors touch and hearing over visual gloss, matching an old embroiderer’s narrowed vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mangrove cathedral breathes through brackish tides, glass-leaf windows, vines that arch like serpents—details are selective, urgent, never touristic. The shard’s jagged storm-captured glint and moon-warmth function as micro-setting that constrains action: she can’t advance without its healing pulse. Spatial choreography is clean: from root-hall to pool-clearing to throne of roots, bodies track believably. One hairline slip: “cathedral of green gloom” edges toward familiar metaphor, but immediate tactile follow-through rescues freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting: the creeping mist mirrors emotional seepage and physically allows privacy for decryption. Twilight’s bruised silvers recur as color-filter for POV bias. Sensory economy is tight—fading skylights, distant waves, cool coral—each later reappears to charge the final image. Spatial choreography clean: bedside → cast → string pocketed → fragment pocketed.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.0)
    Ruined orchard district functions as active antagonist: fog limits visibility, gnarled trunks become projection screen, mossy roots conceal fresco. Micro-setting—lantern beam, crumbling plaster—constrains light-painting tactics. Sensory hierarchy follows artist’s eye: color fade, tactile moss, scent of phantom fruit. Final image of silver-thread fog recharges opening haze with new meaning—less haunted, more canvas. Specificity never stalls momentum; earns 9-band by charging closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Waveform fern and silver-grooved nickel act as micro-setting that literally bend sound and choice; without them the climax cannot occur. Sensory selection stays filtered through Elias’s restorer eye—he notices flaking pigment before leaf color. Spatial choreography is clean: coin, fern, woman, wall track across the beat without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    The carnivorous-orchid greenhouse is tactile: humid air, pollen storms, vines throttling trellises. These details constrain movement (Elias must step around scarab swarms) and charge the final image—warped stems literally rewrite tax ledgers on the leaves. Kale-glyphs seen from drone-height cleverly link micro-garden to macro-surveillance. Selective sensory focus (smell of pheromone soil, rattle timbre) keeps economy tight; no tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Shell interior operates as tool and body: spiral mouth funnels off-key wind that carries his half-sung lyrics; nacre walls bloom open only after postcard anchoring, directly enabling the climax. Sensory economy favors echo, salt, glint, and chord over sightseeing lists. Spatial choreography holds as he moves from tidal debris to prismatic core; distances remain trackable. Environment constrains the victory—had the shell lacked a heart-chamber, ensconcing would fail—so Q3 9+ gate is met.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    The opal library, cloud winds, and glass orchids are filtered through Elara’s tactile caretaking; each wing’s extinct emotion is rendered via specific sensory hinge (“cobwebbed laughter-mirrors”).

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prism parapet is not backdrop; its rain-slick crystals hum under touch, decide where she can paint, and refract the final image back onto city glass. Micro-setting (parapet edge) literally constrains her body position and brush strokes. Sensory hierarchy follows Elowen’s painterly eye—light, droplet, rainbow—integrated into action. Spring dusk is familiar season, but the terrace’s echo and rain-stone scent are particularized through her perception.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cracked marble terrace, torch-glossed clipboard, and midsummer star-alignment are not backdrop but tactical resources: the altar’s worn smoothness ritualizes the signatures, the celestial halt times the blood-price. Sensory hierarchy is Elara’s—she notices moss-veins and flint-eyes in proportion to threat and hope. Micro-setting qualifies: the clipboard’s polished surface becomes a mirror for “ghosts of a thousand unsigned accords,” constraining her final palm-press. One slip: “weathered marble veined with moss” is visually rich yet haptic/temperature cues are missed.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    The salt-flat itself is treated as a tactile antagonist: boots crunch, cracks “etch,” clay lips “pried open,” each geological feature constraining the only possible gesture—kneel, place, surrender. Weather is not backdrop but countdown clock; thunder’s lull → roar parallels the internal shift from pause to release. Micro-setting (the egg’s curve kissing clay) charges the final image with erotic/home-coming frisson. No static postcard; every sensory detail is filtered through Elias’s predator eye—“shattered porcelain,” “bruised sky,” “manufactured scars”—so landscape reads as self-portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dome’s concrete curve and meteor hush are continuously filtered through Elias’s perception—breath amplified, lantern glow catching reversed script. The stick functions as micro-setting: its flipped inscription physically constrains the reversal choice. Spatial choreography is clean—cross-legged center, pacing the floor, hatch exit. Weather metaphor (“meteor hush”) is tethered to interior silence, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    The grotto is not backdrop but material: vines must be dew-beaded to grip stone, thermals must stall to mirror wing-stillness, moss must be emerald to refract rosy light onto scales. Micro-setting becomes tool—lattice tension, pedestal stone, breeze vector—each constraining how and where the next knot can be tied. Final image reuses the “blushing stillness” as atmospheric lens that lets the moth wing flash its Morse farewell.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.0)
    Glacial sanctum, braided hemp-silver rope, and auroral lattice are not backdrop but tooling: rope channels light, altar ice cracks under ardor, and card scrap’s perforations align only because the setting’s geometry is specified. Spatial choreography is immaculate—coil unspool, thread, knot, step-back—every motion mapped against altar wall. Cold actively opposes fingers, meltwater dilutes time, forcing night-long urgency. Final image of rope slung as glowing talisman literalizes setting as future crucible for bronze recasting.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rewilded forest and vine-choked bunker are tactile: “consoles choked by moss,” “rust flaking under nail.” Bioluminescent fungi and ozone air constrain breath and visibility, feeding stakes. The dream-pod’s etched sigil reappears to charge closure. Weather moves from distant thunder to breaking dawn, mirroring internal shift without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is reimagined Babylon via bioluminescent vines, crystal dome, and 369-square—particulars that constrain method (schematics must fit the mosaic pit). Palace micro-geography (mosaic floor, observatory dome, lamp ration) guides every tactical choice. Sensory selection skews visual, but the dusky palette is thematically coherent. The vines’ glow re-appears in the final image, charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.0)
    The music box is the micro-setting that constrains every choice; when it vanishes Elias is weaponless, forcing pacifist tactics. Shifting marble/mist rules are learned through Thorne’s stagger, not exposition. The hush itself is tactile—vibrations travel through bone, not air—charging every beat. Spatial choreography is flawless: Elias winds, Thorne convulses, floor tilts, stars wheel, all tracked without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orchard ruin, mirror-pane “mountains,” and fog function as micro-setting that actively guides choice—visibility, footing, reflective surfaces are exploited minute-by-minute. Frost-laced branches mirror glass spines; both are veins that must be navigated to reach the clearing. The sextant’s cracked brass is a handled tool that alters tactics and re-appears in the final anchoring beat. Sensory economy favors crisp, selective detail that never stalls motion; no static cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cathedral-orchard is no postcard: Rotting beams dictate foot-placement, sap-slick marble endangers grip, and the apex quartz literally cracks choice-space. The ribbon’s reprise from childhood scent to storm-banner shows micro-setting as charged object. One hairline slip—“dripped sweet sap onto cracked marble pews below” repeats the sap image two sentences later; otherwise environment constrains every upward move.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    Bathroom tiles of meteor-glass, petals that bloom in vacuum, and the pistachio shell’s “multidimensional engravings” are tactile, specific, narratively functional. Setting constrains her breakthroughs (privacy, echo, drain swirl) and charges the final image (mirror-fractured void). Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation drift. High-band met.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mountain-bookstore is evoked with kinetic specificity: “roots of an ancient tree,” “vaulted stacks,” “bioluminescent vines strangled a scholar mid-note.” Sensory hierarchy shifts with urgency—Echo-Lilies’ glow under moonlight runes narrows perception precisely. Spatial choreography stays clean; no floating bodies. The final image—golden light cascade—charges the closure by making the environment itself ratify the new pact.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    Selective sensory strokes—“rusted hull whispering secrets,” “confetti dust”—root the carnival ship in tactile decay and keep the fog as an active shroud that limits movement. Spatial choreography is clean: the boardwalk leads to the funhouse, threads run from carousel to big-top to prow. The ship’s tilting deck and vortexing fog literally constrain Elara’s steps and charge the final archway image; environment is character here.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clock-tower mechanism room is textured with oiled gears, frozen hands, dust motes—selective, POV-filtered, never touristic. The seal and rope micro-settings act as pressure-tools: the rope’s hidden runic compartments literally constrain how Elara can solve the puzzle. Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies and objects track cleanly from spiral stairs to pedestal to mandala of pages. One minor over-pattern: “scent of oiled gears and aged dust” recurs almost verbatim, a loop that dulls the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ice fractures serve as micro-setting that constrains tactic—she must read them to place the stone. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: luminous pulses narrow to crack-veins under fingertips. Spatial choreography clean; stone, ice, body positions track. Environment charges final image—cracks become luminous mandalas—meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    Glass pavilion, shard, and skylight lens are not backdrop—they constrain every move: silence inside the shard dictates when she can think; curved glass dictates star-viewing angles; broken prism limits rekindling method. The final beam is inseparable from the etched circuits and humming facets already established. Micro-setting (shard in palm) literally bridges past-present. 9+ gate met: environment charges the culminating image.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stormlit observatory, crystal forecourt, and fog-bridge are never postcard backdrop: the forecourt’s rain-slick tiles literally amplify whispers she must parse, the fog-bridge’s dissolution forces her ascent. Micro-settings (crystal tiles, quill-tip) constrain tactics. Sensory hierarchy biased to sound (whispers) and touch (cold crystal) under archival urgency. Spatial choreography clean—no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.0)
    Luminous vines, iridescent tiles, and kerosene stink are filtered through Elias’s pyro-perception; the fire’s glow off mosaic tesserae directly enables the blueprint reveal, satisfying the 9+ gate by constraining the pivotal discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    The grotto, cicada, and tidal pools constrain every beat: only the angled reflection yields truth; only the pool’s pulse can amplify memory. Starlight refracting off jade literally changes what can be foreseen, satisfying the 9+ gate that environment charges the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate—cicada placed, reflection watched, distance held. One minor over-description: “fragmented skies trapped in eternity” drifts toward ornament, not tool, keeping it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sky-trellis is handled, not catalogued: vines curl “hospitably,” snag clothes, mimic bunker walls—environment as pressure tool. Inversion flips spatial logic, forcing new sprout geography; body becomes orienting device. Gilded hush sprout and porcelain doll recur as micro-settings that charge final image. Weather, height, vine density all shift tactical access; no white-room lapse.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    “Drifting prism terrace” and “silken cables” supply a micro-setting that literally steers choice: Elias must balance on a transparent surface while dosing the vial. Sensory hierarchy favors sight and haptic shimmer, suiting an operator who reads vibration. Spatial choreography is clean; gondola, glass, children, and foam track without drift. The setting constrains the final image—silence as visible foam—earning the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    Neo-Eden’s chrome smog, bioluminescent tunnels, and prismatic nano-mist are filtered through Elara’s cybernetic gaze, never touristic. The hidden orchard’s perpetual-twilight petals constrain her pace—she must wait for dawn’s exact ray—so setting directly shapes tactics. One hairline slip: “gravity-boots” is later “grav-boots,” not quite nailed down.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    “Ashen charcoal sanctuary” is a micro-setting that doubles as body/mental space; its cracks and dome guide the final starlit image that recharges the motif. Selective sensory focus (cold metal, coal heat, starlight) constrains the ring choice; no over-cataloguing. Spatial choreography stable; ring materializes at threshold edge and stays manipulable. Environment is metaphoric yet tactile; threshold and sanctuary function as tools that channel choice.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    The farm’s bioluminescent veins and compressing earth constrain every beat: spore-mist limits vision, tectonic whispers literally crush carbon into diamond. The submarine bolt’s fractal hum is re-handled at climax, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy is biased to Elias’s scavenger eye—glow, hum, weight—never touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sepia room is lived-in: floorboards confess, brass horn flares like a “trumpet of fate,” dust motes line up along nodal tracks to point at the panel. Details are filtered through Elias’s engineer-ear; the gramophone and crank are handled so tactilely they become micro-setting that literally unlocks the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    Alchemical orchard greenhouse is not backdrop: dew-portals and sigil-etched dome constrain tactics—proximity to root-veins enables the pattern-alignment beat, and the endless-night aperture allows lunar elixirs to power the final orb solidification. Spatial choreography is clean across Elowen’s slip, kneel, rise sequence; no impossible props. The marionette program itself functions as micro-setting on the pedestal root, charging the closure image when its threads snag the air. Sensory hierarchy stays locked to Elowen’s hyperfocus—sound of cloak whispers, sight of prismatic shards—never tourist catalogue.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    The file room functions as micro-setting: dust thickness, mildew scent, and slivered sunlight all dictate how Eleanor moves (gloved finger, careful pry) and what she can perceive. The button’s brass eagle and the parchment’s frayed edge become tactile “tools” that constrain handling and decide next steps. Space stays coherent—desk, shelves, box, compartment—and era idiom (“contraband camp,” “mustered out”) rings true without caricature. Final image of polished button charging the closure satisfies 9+ gate for object-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    “Rain-slicked plaza” and “golden veins” in puddles give tactile, visual specificity that guides plot; the lagoon’s bioluminescent reeds hum anthems, merging sensory texture with theme. The submerged booth is a micro-setting object that physically constrains the final move—key-slot fit decides cache access. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from alley→plaza→lagoon→booth without impossible jumps. One minor overreach: “starlit spires” reflected at dusk is implausible light logic, but the image is POV-filtered as hopeful illusion, so tolerated.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prism atrium functions as micro-setting: its facets refract his quieted notes into rainbow after-images that charge the final glance. Dewdrops swell, vibrate, cascade—each state alters resonance and mirrors his dwindling breath. Spatial choreography is tight: sax bell aimed at core, bell lowered, dew on shoulders tracks cleanly. Environment constrains tactic (negative space needs crystal surfaces to amplify absence) and reweights the last coded glint.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.2)
    The ashen skyborne arbor is evoked through tactile neologisms—“seed-spired tower,” “pebble-base cairn”—that also serve as tools constraining Lir’s next move. Ash flakes, moss drapes, and moon-glow veins are filtered through Lir’s sorter-eye; what he notices is what he can use. Spatial choreography is immaculate: leaf caught, speck prodded, sylph alights, procession forms. Setting actively supplies the map coordinates and the transformative medium; without the arbor’s ash-root physics, the ending descent collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Subterranean waterfall, mist-beaded gears, vine-spring lattice, and soot-thick chamber are sensory-filtered through Elias’s tinkerer gaze; each locale offers tactile tools that constrain next improvisation. The compass rose functions as micro-setting, its swivel charging the chest-opening beat. Final ash image reprises “beneath the ashes” concept with visual cost. Environment never slips from POV notice; missing 9-band only because waterfall itself could have bitten back harder (spray-slick grip, etc.).

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Foundry rain, slick anvil, and the coin’s humming edge are tactile pivot-points: the anvil’s face steers the coin-spinning ritual, the crucible’s fissures dictate where gold must flow. Weather and rusted mirrors externalize regret without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography clean: coin drops, is spun, halts; crucible is lifted, brushed, glows. Environment constrains the final image—balancing the coin on the rain-slick anvil requires steady hands, charging the climax with physical risk.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mist, wall-caught light, and jagged path are filtered through Elara’s urgent bias, not tourist detail. Echo Gorge functions as instrument: its acoustics amplify confessions and compel the harp counter-music; without the chasm’s feedback the tactic fails. Spatial choreography remains exact across slick rocks and ledge; no impossible positions. Crocodile-tooth and harp serve as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice, meeting 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Ultraviolet forest operates as micro-setting-cum-diagnostic tool: branch angles refract neural fractals, roots graph decay, forcing Elara to read herself against arboreal axis. Pewter strap functions as portable setting fragment, its cold weight steering every brace and recall beat. Sensory hierarchy favors proprioceptive data over visual spectacle, narrowing perception to crisis-relevant inputs (joint angle, cardiac thud). Spatial choreography remains coherent across collapses and re-braces; environment evolves as canopy flickers in response to trauma surges.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dangling market is not mere décor: its aerial walkways force Elara to move stall-to-stall, the swaying lanterns supply the mist-screen for the final projection, and the jeweled spider-web layout mirrors the fragile web of erased histories she restores. Sensory Hierarchy is POV-true—she notices brass astrolabes and writhing shadows because they once awed an eight-year-old sneak. Micro-setting (lens fragment) physically constrains her gaze and ultimately charges the final image. No slips touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    Environment is more than postcard: the warped counter, rusted grate, and ghost-worn dust spirals literally guide Theo’s choices and supply the lock that resolves the plot. The circus ticket office is compressed into a micro-setting whose every surface (ceiling mural, dust, grate) constrains access and discovery, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy is technician-biased—metallic tang of mildew, flashlight beam angle—never tourist-catalog. Spatial choreography stays legible across stool-climb and bone-extraction.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.1)
    The glass orchard is not backdrop but causal engine: buoyant fragility enables the perfect system that the bottled whisper then destabilizes. Micro-setting becomes tool when Elias presses discarded type against the cork—environment literally supplies the key. Frost filigrees recur with shifting stakes, charging the final shatter. Spatial choreography stays clean across the vertical descent; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    The baroque asteroid is more than postcard: mirrored gallery’s chronal fragility enables the heist; velvet shrouds become tactical tools; rococo vaults supply spatial logic for stealth. Micro-setting (his inked palm couplet) constrains the plan. Environment mirrors interior—“frozen screams” spires echo Elias’s stalled insurgency—yet detail is filtered through POV attention, never tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Resonance chamber functions as micro-setting: walls amplify sound, guide Elias’s fingertip vibrations, and force him to work in absolute quiet—choices constrained by acoustic physics. Crystal flower and soul-spring are tactile objects whose states are tracked beat-to-beat; their gleam/petal angle signal honesty and success. Sensory economy is tight: sound (chime, sigh, hum) dominates, matching POV priority. Final image of blooming flower + blazing chip recharges opening covenant, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Limestone weeping mineral tears, bioluminescent algae shimmering on obsidian water—details are selective, tactile, and filtered through Elara’s scent-oriented gaze. The vials, compass, and lagoon reappear as handled objects that alter tactics (pull hinge, bottle essence), satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating bodies. A single over-ripe phrase (“gothic hush”) is forgivable amid otherwise precise economy.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Driftwood, lantern-slide, and archway form a tactile micro-setting; storm spray and turbine-hum narrow perception; final sculpture-lantern constrains the literal path home, anchoring the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    The amber pavilion’s autumn glow is a micro-setting that constrains choice: it supplies perpetual twilight for night-flower sketches and becomes the final atelier where Elara seals herself away from spring sunshine. Cathedral glass functions as tactile tool—each scrape alters tactics (what she can paint next). Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: an artist notices “etched vines,” “incense-aged stone,” “lantern alone.” Spatial choreography is immaculate; snow retreats in measured beats that mirror glass unveilings.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.0)
    Floating library, dune basin, and obsidian lagoon are economically seeded and return in the final image; the zeppelin’s resources (letters, diary) materially enable the plot. Sensory triage is POV-tilted (archive dust, sun-brand, volcanic glass), embedding world-rules through touch rather than exposition. Spatial choreography keeps the spectral ring and debris circle coherent under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    The amber bottle functions as micro-setting: its seamless surface literally constrains every attempt to open it and channels the revival. Lanterns shift from paper to silk, streets to crystal, kelp scaffolds—all particular, sensory, and filtered through Elias’s alchemical gaze. Spatial choreography is clean: pier → waves → pylons → crowd, no impossible jumps. Weather and sea breath evolve with the action. One hairline slip: “memory-infused crystal” is abstract until the later “whispered histories”; still, the object-driven constraint satisfies the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rooftop orchard is never tourism-piece; its gnarled apples and dew-kissed rainwater basin physically enable the immersion rite and later echo the “tallest fruit falls unripe” line. Spatial choreography is clean: shaving unearthed → basin at bough-base → lights below. Sensory hierarchy favors tactile and auditory over visual, matching archivist priorities. Missing 9.0 because the city’s harbor/fog infrastructure is sketched more generically than the orchard micro-zone that actually constrains the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    Icebound atrium under starlight is no postcard: frost-laced arches, prismatic halos, suspended snowflakes all filter through Elara’s seed-saver gaze, guiding her tactile placement of pods and cap. The dome’s scale breathes—vaulted glass becomes a frozen coliseum—then contracts to the oak acorn cap she turns like a valve. Micro-setting (the cap’s ridged wooden dome) literally focuses the starlight beam that reverses entropy, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean: no impossible body shifts during the hand- plunge.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.1)
    Windblown sanctuary above clouds is vividly tactile—rope “like a vein,” ozone scent, frost-rimed platform—and constrains the final choice: bell’s resonance couples with mountain wind to amplify detection. Spatial choreography clean: bell, switch, rope, platform all tracked through final pull. Weather is not backdrop but active instrument. Microclimate instruments function as micro-setting that alters tactics. Meets 9+ gate for environment charging final image, but lacks the last increment of specificity that would make the place irreplaceable.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    Frost-etched domes, stardust trails, and the orb’s amber pulse ground every beat in tactile specificity. Micro-setting (glass sphere) constrains the final stance—forehead contact becomes pivot of revelation. Spatial choreography is clean across the dome sweep. One 9-gate tick missed: environment never endangers or depletes resources, capping at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    The oasis is rendered through broken irrigation channels, splintered hives, and the stained glass box that “hummed faintly under his fingers,” all filtering through the recluse’s beekeeper eye. Sensory selection favors touch and sight; smell of ghost smoker plume is implied, not declared. Spatial choreography is clean: box unearthed → stump → hive apex; bodies and distances track. The box functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice; without it, guardian ritual collapses—meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Environment, body, and tool trinity constrain choices: fungal-emerald walls leak chronal vapors that literally bend lantern light, forcing Elias to work in distorted glow; corrugated ladder and cracked capsule dictate pacing of descent and breath. The cremation shard micro-functions as setting-in-hand—its stasis field rewrites spatial safety, allowing the broadcast listing to go out without Shift-enforcer detection. Sensory hierarchy obeys horologist bias: ticking absence noticed first, damp spore-scent second. No static catalog; every detail either warps air or reflects verdant sheen.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt lagoon’s post-rain sheen, ankle-deep cool, and petrichor-laden air constrain every move: Elias wades farther than intended, the paper soaks instantly, the feather’s iridescence supplies both ink and mend. Spatial choreography is tight—kite spirals “toward the lagoon’s heart,” later “hover low over the lagoon”—so environment steers the climax. Micro-setting (drake feather as quill-brush) directly enables the repair that charges the ending. One notch off 9+ only because the fisherman/children are briefly floated silhouettes rather than bodies that re-shape space.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    “Living stone pillars veined with quartz that pulsed faintly” is tactile and specific; copper wire harvested from shipwrecks grounds method in world. Temple orchard functions as micro-setting: every wrap of wire alters architecture and possibility. Spatial choreography is clean—string lines, chalk, shed, oak ladder—no floating props. Final lattice charged image satisfies 9+ gate by constraining pilgrim touch and reweighting meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rainwashed ivy, gritty dust under nails, and bronze-filtered light are selective, POV-filtered, and woven through action rather than paused description. The tower’s etched facets and half-buried marble pilgrims constrain physical approach and echo the “overgrown sculpture path,” charging the final image when footprints become “theirs alone.” Micro-setting (amber against skin) doubles as tool and emotional thermometer. Weather and sculpture together guide choreography—no floating white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    Jetty as micro-setting constrains every action: narrow planks force single-file scattering, amplify hoof-clatter, frame vast horizon. Bleached coral battlefield and salt-fed blooms evolve causally with reef-collapse rule taught early. Sensory hierarchy favors touch (cracking pods, creaking boards) and sound (avian Eldari) over visual catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate—reader tracks Thorne’s kneel at jetty root, scatter along pilings, final mount without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.0)
    Scrapyard terrain is sketched with economical sensory hits—fuselage-bone shack, rad-mirages, catwalks over abyssal rifts—each detail double-duty as externalized emotional state. The waxed leaf functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: it literally powers the trek and is finally re-pocketed, charging the closing image. One minor spatial drift: the “greatest fissure” appears without prior scale cue, but choreography recovers instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Temporal stretch is not mere backdrop—it warps Orion into ‘elongated smears’ and makes pencil trembles last miniature eternities, constraining how she can draw and thus how she discovers the rift. The compass rose functions as micro-setting: its golden petals glint against starlight at both ends, charging the final leap. Station geography stays coherent—window edge, micro-gravity hum, residual power surges—each detail filtered through Elara’s navigator-trained eye rather than tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    Icebound spire is more than postcard: frost “whispered warnings,” bioluminescent veins “pulse,” enchanted frost snaps like veins—details constrain stealth tempo. Micro-setting objects (sundial, chess pieces) are handled tactilely and return in the final image. Weather evolution mirrors plot reversal; spatial choreography remains crisp during swap scramble.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    “Whispering gallery” and “luminous absence” are never mere décor; the curved acoustics physically amplify his word-walk and the missing pawns echo the emptied streets, so the setting’s geometry and vacancy actively constrain tactics and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.1)
    The mountain-bookstore is not backdrop but prosthetic memory: geothermal warmth, teetering stacks, obsidian-skinned stone—each detail constrains how she moves (kneeling, tracing, abandoning exit). Micro-setting of the feather’s “silken rasp” becomes wind-over-valley, fusing body and world. Final image—stone aglow on pedestal—recharges every prior shelf as latent home. Spatial choreography never slips; distances tighten as she descends.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    The frozen village is not postcard scenery; its suspended raindrops and ajar doors physically permit Elias to enter the hall and handle the tapestry. The bone pawn recurs as micro-setting—handled in six beats, final promotion charges the closing image. Platinum corridors are rendered through tactile thread-plucking rather than visual catalog, satisfying economy. Spatial choreography is immaculate: square → hall → altar → tapestry border → mirror, each move legible. Weather never restarts until the final thunder-crack, so environment causally links to interior thaw.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Bone towers constrain movement (echo corridors force poetry to ricochet as weapon) and the pale spire’s mist literally refracts light across the final image, reweighting the stake. Body-as-setting counts: knobby vertebrae perch is handled, tracked, and becomes stage for the first public subversion. Spatial choreography clean: no impossible positions during the swelling crowd. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s artist eye—gleam, smear, fracture—never tourist catalog. World rules consistent: echoes never die, so once verse is loosed it can’t be recalled—this physics underwrites the irreversible closure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    Acid sea, corroding cogs, and clockwork familiars are tactile, selective, and constantly bite the body. The statue’s pockmarks function as micro-setting that gates each confession; their chill flank steadies his hand—concrete constraint. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis: fumes → lungs → touch of bronze, ignoring extraneous sight. Final image of glowing scars on bronze repels corrosion, recharging the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.1)
    The coastal caves are not backdrop but tactical maze: quartz-veined walls narrow passage, the hidden skylight provides the only light needed to finish the shell, and the spring’s mirror-calm surface becomes the projection screen that reconfigures meaning. Fern, orchid, and brine tang are filtered through Elias’s painterly eye, selecting detail that serves the moment of reveal. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible positions as he crawls the fissure. Environment thus constrains the final act and charges the image; 9+ gate satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    The cobalt lighthouse, dawn-cool after heat, is evoked through Elias’s skin and nostrils—paint mimics “deep sea’s heart,” mist “curled like smoke.” Spatial choreography is clean from lantern room to hidden garden lee to cliff path. The vial functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice; its cork pop and perfume exhalation charge the closing embrace. Scale matches stakes: lighthouse beam stays off, keeping focus on intimate radius.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.1)
    Starlit signal station, hydraulic wreckage, and salt-stung wind are filtered through Elias’s navigator eye—selective, professional, urgent. The censer foot operates as micro-setting: its lodestone hum constrains knot timing and charges the final flare. Spatial choreography stays clean across ladder moves and shore-line sight-lines. Environment never stalls momentum; instead, moonlit antenna ribs literally guide coil winding.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    The hanging orchard is not backdrop; wind-lashed boughs and suspended aeries dictate where Elias can stand, climb, and conceal the rite. Truffle mycelium bridging “relic and flesh” fuses world-logic with body-tool intimacy, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: probe → root ball → wind-whipped aerie → descent to tenders; bodies never float. Weather and altitude narrow perception to “storm-trapped moon” gleam and branch creaks, keeping sensory hierarchy tight.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    Opal dock’s iridescent veins function as micro-setting: surface smear of seawater after the plunge literally changes traction and cues Elias’s kneeling discovery; mist and twilight narrow visual field, forcing tactile investigation. Edelweiss acts as portable alpine setting that re-weights the maritime space. Sensory economy—no tourist catalogue—filters through Elias’s keeper habit of “whispers under boots.” Final lighthouse beam refracts off dock, charging closure image. World rules hold; no physics amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sensory economy is excellent—phosphorescent motes on brass, nectar-thick air—always filtered through cartographer bias. The cavern’s bioluminescent moss literally lights the only viable ledge, forcing Elias’s crawl; environment constrains body and tool use. Creek rise is tracked audibly, lapping higher each beat, a live timer. Only micro-slip: “distant thunder” is never paid off as weather that affects access.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ember-grotto walls “shimmered cobalt-blue, veined with embers that flickered without flame” constrains the final choice—she can literally see the price glowing. Body-as-setting is tracked: ragged breath, palms bitten by rope, gown trailing like spilled mercury—each tactile detail narrows her options. Spatial choreography is pristine from throne mirror to ridge spine to cavern dome. The grotto’s living crown of fireflies is the charged final image, impossible to swap out.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ember nexus, twilight threshold, and columella curl micro-setting collectively constrain every beat—colors must be poured into the spiral, voices must drop to a whisper inside the nexus tunnel—charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors heat, spiral geometry, and hush, all filtered through Lirien’s empirical-poetic gaze; no static tour, every descriptor feeds the alchemy.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    The birch bark scroll functions as micro-setting: it’s harvested, inked, clutched, and finally folded—its changing tactile state tracks the arc. Mountain ridge, creaky bunk, and frost-slivered window constrain her lucid-break ritual (the envy must crest in physical confinement). Final image of dawn creeping over the ridge reprises the setting with shifted weight. Meets the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Fogged windows, brass reservoir, occluded glass, and drip-synced pulse create a micro-setting that constrains Elara’s inspection path. The midwife-screw is a recurring object whose physical odd threading is re-illuminated at closure, recharging the birth-room flashback. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound—touch and sound dominate because smell is absent—no checklist cycling. Spatial choreography is clean: screwdriver, tweezers, screw, and reservoir remain trackable.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tea-platform’s hum against the void, blue brazier flame whispering to stone, and prismatic crystal weight on arms all constrain gesture and attention, charging the final image. Atmospheric details are filtered through Elara’s rune-scholar gaze—she notices moss-veined edges, slate-grey suspension stone, verdant froth—never tourist-catalog. Weather is literal pressure: storms paused outside the breath-frame, echoing internal truce. Micro-setting (body + tool + tea service) functions as crucible; removal would collapse ritual logic.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    The player-piano’s copper guts and the wax-sealed bottle function as micro-setting that literally conducts the haunting; removing either breaks the reconnection physics. Dust-motes as “lost souls” is baldly symbolic, but the image is immediately re-filtered through Elara’s professional gaze, saving it from cliché. Orchard countdown outside the fence keeps spatial choreography legible and time-tracked. Archive air is tasted as much as seen—myrrh-static grit on teeth—so sensory hierarchy obeys crisis-narrowed perception.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dictionary as micro-setting constrains every move: its fluttering pages dictate when Elowen advances, and its final dissolution charges the closing unity image. Sensory triage is POV-true: cracked light, groaning shelves, star-map veins underfoot. No orientation drift; anchoring (“ancient temple library,” spiral staircase) occurs within first 60 words. Environment, body, and tool co-operate to crystallize the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Fjord cliff, perpetual quiet, mercury-weighted pendulums, whale-oil lamp—selective sensory triad anchors professional gaze. Horizon station constrains every move: height amplifies solitude, water supply drives clocks, observation deck delivers final test. Micro-setting works: the mantle key’s ice-bright barbs become the literal “razor edges” Elias must handle, cutting flesh and certainty. Spatial choreography immaculate; no drift or white-room lapse.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    The farm is not postcard scenery; the veil’s permeability directly enables the security insight, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: she notices refraction angles, drip cadence, spore thickness—never tourist inventory. Spatial choreography is flawless: beam, rat, footprints, alcove all track without drift. The mushrooms’ “living lens” metaphor is accurate, not purple, and charges the final image. One hairline slip: “quiet wildfire” appears twice; still, the second use re-inflects the tone at closure, so penalty is nominal.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rain-washed stone, clover vapour, and the diffused mica glow are selectively returned so that weather and object charge the final image; the lantern functions as micro-setting, constraining her choice to read in low light and later to extinguish. Spatial choreography remains coherent across subway transfers and the forgotten stairwell. One minor slip: the “abandoned station” materialises without prior map cue, but the lantern line immediately re-anchors us, so the waiver applies.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tunnel’s damp, lamp-hum, and iron scent constrain every action: the booth’s alive lines enable the friendships, the disc’s glass tones bleed through the receiver, the dripping pipes foreclose surface escape. Micro-setting—the spinning disc—charges the final image when Elias polishes it between calls. Spatial choreography stays crisp; bodies and objects never float.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    The jetty’s phosphorescent blooms, tidal slaps, and briny air constrain access and supply the ritual water; spatial choreography never slips.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.9)
    Ivy-choked station is vividly textured—“crumbling arches,” “ivy curtain”—and the rock’s starlit glint serves as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean through courteous queueing; environment nudges choices (lantern light enables rock reveal). Yet, world rules (how moon rock catalyzes bonds) remain poetic rather than materially constrained.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ultrasonic forest is not postcard backdrop; its very medium—sound beyond hearing—forces Elar’s haptic navigation, constraining every step. The platinum ring operates as micro-setting, cooling, warming, scorching against his flesh, charging the final release when discarded. Constellation pause supplies a live clock: the sky holds breath until the instant he touches the pool, then resumes, marking before/after. Spatial choreography stays clean—mossy hummocks, bioluminescent fronds, mirror pool—always discovered through touch, never visual gloss.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    The gravity bubble is not backdrop but tool: the same flex that warps the pen nib lets Elara straighten it against her thigh, turning environment into lever. Micro-settings—floating slate, ozone-ink smell, panel moth—are filtered through her signal-interpreter bias (she clocks “celestial chatter” before smell). Spatial choreography is clean: arm strain, pen hover, vines retract in observable sequence. Final image of “right-seeded vines now climbed true” re-anchors the once-ruined garden as proof of rewritten physics, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dock-plank puddles, warped shutters, and the dental mirror’s polished arc function as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice—she needs reflective water and slatted canvas to project constellations. Weather-stripped wood and salt-damp metal are returned to tactile life with each shutter snap. Spatial choreography is clean: reader tracks her movement from boathouse mouth to canal edge to final retreat. The mirror’s reused state (healer relic turned star-conduit) meets 9+ gate by charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cobalt library, magnetic grotto, and obsidian rook are not backdrop but toolkit: the lodestone veins literally orchestrate the synchronization, constraining Elias’s tactics. Mist and blue light recur, evolving from mood to signal of conspiracy. Spatial choreography is clean—panels sigh open, pieces hover, compass needles quiver—each tactile detail braided to the plan. Micro-setting qualifies for 9+ gate; only a hairline short because weather (mist) is more observed than reacted to in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sublittoral fringe is more than backdrop: salt-crusted crates, bioluminescent waves, barnacled hulls all constrain posture and tool use. Micro-setting is the scrimshaw itself—handled, warmed, used as knife—charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s dock-trained eye; she notices rope fibers snap one by one, not tourist vistas. Environment alters tactics: tide timing, skiff surge, whale-call resonance all force the detachment moment. Meets 9- gate: setting/tool constrains choice and charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.9)
    The turbines’ drone is not backdrop but metronome that paces every cut; the dried petals’ dust mingles with pine shavings to become the new talisman. Micro-setting (knife, thumb, ribbon) constrains the final gesture. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: she notices only what can be weaponised or narrated. One hairline slip: “another farmhouse mirrored hers” drifts toward postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cobalt atrium, quartz colonnade, and frozen lake are vividly particularized (“quartz veined with captured starlight,” “lantern-moth hush”) and directly constrain action: the pillars must be touched, the lake must thaw before crossing. Environmental evolution is causally linked—quartz softens as verse progresses—so setting actively enables climax. Sensory hierarchy favors visual/auditory, but compressed lyric scope justifies the narrow palette. Micro-setting (quartz under fingers) functions as tool and threshold, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Glass-spire shards, quenching trough, and plant codes are filtered through Elias’s touch-centric POV, creating lived-in specificity.

    Frost-kissed threshold, brass hum, auroral greens/purples are selective and POV-filtered; the archway constrains posture (kneeling, tracing) and recurs as the applause-light final image, satisfying micro-setting use. Spatial track stays clean across an essentially single-location sequence.</question>
    <question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—liberate trapped creativity—is clear early; pressure escalates by accumulation (each meteor traced adds density) rather than causal reversal. The tightening moment is the final surrender to sleep, but because the prior exhaustion is told, the visible price is diluted; still, one meaningful deepening is achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    The library-as-freezer is rendered through cold-metallic synecdoche—“frost-rimed controls,” “ice-veined display”—and the snow’s weight pressing echoes into “oblivion” recharges the final image. Spatial choreography is tight: she steps back, seals console, moves to next pod. The micro-setting (the console itself) literally enables the breach, satisfying the 9+ gate; only a touch of generic “vast chambers” keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dome, roses, sand, and canvas scrap are tactile and bias-filtered: Elara notices thorn tremor before sound. The scrap’s grit mixed into soil later constrains the roses’ evolved response, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean during the breach fight. One minor slip: “sun-baked with purpose” edges toward overt symbolism but is saved by POV warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sound-wave garden is not postcard backdrop; its transliterating vines physically corral the prey when Elias’s calm converts to “stabilizing azure bands,” directly enabling closure. Rail spike serves as micro-setting that constrains tactics—its iron curve is the only surface the echo will coil around.

    The observatory’s glass dome and amplified wind are used to pressure dialogue acoustics and mirror tightening regret; the brass telescope and starfield serve as tactile tools during the proof scene, satisfying micro-setting test. Spatial choreography is clean; only lapse is no sensory shift under peak pressure—all visual.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.3)
    Laboratory’s “frost of echoes” and insect-amber micro-setting constrain every move; firmware port and constellation ink derive their logic from these objects. Sensory hierarchy favors hush and vibration over sight, mirroring guilt. Spatial choreography clean: drawer opens, amber lifted, slot inserted, skin etched—all tracked. Could edge higher if lab architecture had forced one more tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grotto’s lilac mist, echo-tiles and damp sand are never backdrop: acoustics shape the overheard secrets, mist governs visibility and timing, sand is literally shaped to force peace. The flake re-appears three times, each state altering tactics. Spatial choreography remains clean—bodies encircle mandala; no impossible moves. Micro-setting (iridescent flake) charges the final image as much as walls.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tessera functions as micro-setting: its chipped glyphs both constrain how the rename can be performed and literally map the minaret’s fall, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—kneel → trace → whisper → rise—bodies track without drift. Cracked flagstones and crimson fissures are filtered through Elara’s ghosted perspective, never touristic. Weather/environment (the wind sigh, sky dimming) evolves causally with the emotional turn, reinforcing rather than decorating the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.1)
    Synesthetic color-sound mapping is relentlessly POV-filtered, turning setting into a sensory instrument: “verdant greens swirl with night’s chill blue” guides her deeper into the maze. The stage-boards, coin, and glowing apples each get tactile handling that charges later beats; the coin’s warmth bridges beats and becomes the final talisman. Spatial choreography inside the maze stays clean—no impossible moves.

Spatial choreography stays clean across wand passes and camera clicks.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Coastal cave topology is not backdrop—it funnels every beat: bioluminescent veins guide, salt spray erodes, submerged ruins glimmer beneath her feet while airborne. The palm-sized emitter is a micro-setting extension whose heat palette dictates what she can even perceive; its amber grief/crimson hope overlays literally overlay the limestone walls. Spatial choreography is pristine—boot crunch, grit brush, chest press—every motion geo-anchored. Final image of fossil surrendered to tide makes the ocean itself the next unmapped chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    The amber warehouse and cliff geography constrain every move: amber cracks yield buttons, cliff path dictates ascent, warehouse silence mirrors internal hush. Micro-setting objects—jar, hourglass, buttons—are handled repeatedly and their physical states (half-buried, veined, reversed) directly alter tactics. Sensory selection is POV-driven (Elias notices dust, spiral runes, lantern fireflies) and integrates into action, not catalog. Final image of dawn-lit canyon singing back is charged by prior descriptors, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Bluff, mist, ladder, rook niche all constrain access and visibility; pillbox doubles as micro-setting that keys the snow glyphs.

Environmental evolution (rain → drip → silence) tracks internal progress without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    Environment is never backdrop: cracked adobe, skeletal hives, and sun-cast acacia shadows literally guide Kai’s path and clay shaping. The lantern glass and spinning pot function as micro-setting that constrains hand motion and narrows options. Sensory economy is sharp—heat, thrumming, smoke flattening—each filtered through a potter’s haptic bias. One minor slip: “dunes swallowed ruins like forgotten sins” is the only mixed metaphor, but it does not taint the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    The luminous harbor is not postcard backdrop—moon-fractured water and swaying masts constrain proximity, dictate silent approach, and supply the rhythmic cadence that paces Elara’s parable.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.5)
    The station itself—flickering CRTs, solder tang, fog-needled tower—functions as micro-setting that both supplies tech and externalizes cerebral war. Charts recur as handled objects whose curling edges mirror Elara’s fraying hope. Fog and subsonic vibrations narrow perception to immediacies, forcing tactical choices. Final image of tower against whitening sky recharges motif, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.1)
    Starlight daggers, skeletal pipes, and the narrowing stone throat are selective, POV-filtered, and directly guide the final compass thrust. The nexus itself functions as a micro-setting that constricts choice, satisfying the 9+ gate. One minor drift: “cracked vault” and “throat of stone” never fully reconcile spatially, but clarity survives.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mist-choked quarry functions as micro-setting that constrains search grid and hides the flooded basin; every sensory note (cold seep, moss, flashlight scalpel) is filtered through Elara’s tactile POV.

Final image—bench, fiddle, wind applause—crystallizes environment as emotional instrument. Meets 9+ gate: recurring objects charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.9)
    Abandoned circus train is tactile throughout: rust grinding under boots, solar panels screwed to rotted marquee, rain pinging on tin as LEDs strobe the hoops. The space constrains tactics—hoop perimeter becomes defensive line—and the final image recharges the same dusky palette, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Micro-details (monsoon-stained rupees, dragon-scale yuan) edge toward catalogue but stay tied to Elias’s currency obsession, so they serve POV filter.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    Observatory stone walls, brass instruments, and cliffside temple form a micro-setting that constrains movement (single night, single climb).  Starlight/color choreography tracks cleanly: “roseate hues” gild tools only after dream-data arrives.  Dream-void is rendered through perceptual bias—variable stars as “erratic heartbeats”—anchored in Thorne’s professional filter.  Final image of glyphs glowing under first light recharges the setting with closure cost, meeting 9+ gate; slight shortfall because temple interior spatial layout remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lake-bottom orchard is delivered through motion—roots coil around his boots, frost cracks under knee-pressure—so setting constrains tactics. The ice shard functions as micro-setting that finally melts under the plant’s acid, directly enabling the confession. Sensory hierarchy obeys Thorne’s druid priorities: runes before taste, spiral math before color. No exposition dump; world rules learned by how the seed eats.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    Cobalt glade and dusk are anchored by word 30, and the irradiated foliage stays sensorily alive throughout; hue pulses against skin, sap-blood smells metallic. Spatial choreo is clean: body-root-clipping-maze axis keeps orientation as viewpoint detaches. Micro-setting (scar, clipping) doubles as tool and map, satisfying the 9+ gate. A single over-brushed phrase—“twilight’s deepening veil”—keeps this out of the 8.8 tier.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.0)
    Catacomb orchard is no backdrop: roots tightening around bones after the blood-rite physically constrain further motion and literally nail the Lovers card in place. Half-lit phosphorescence, loam-strewn corridor, bone shard tool—every sensory detail is filtered through Elara’s ritual urgency; the final root pulse mirrors her heartbeat, charging the closure image. World rules stay internally consistent; no orientation drift.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dust motes, scarred Formica, and blasting echoes are filtered through an ex-roadie’s ear—sound is prioritized like light, a crisp POV bias. The trailer’s thin walls and slanted sun impose real constraints: the grille cloth is literally unearthed from the same fill that buried his past. Spatial choreography is immaculate—cloth pulled from wire tangle, pocketed, truck door clanged—every object tracked to the final engine growl. Environment, tool, and recurring object jointly charge the last image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.7)
    The magnetic arbor above cloud-sea is vividly particular: iron-rich bark humming, dew conducting currents, gliders docking. Sensory selection stays tight—Elias’s knees feel cool soil, his palm the seed-pulse—filtering through translator-biased attention to etch and echo. The environment never actively constrains his tactics (no polarity panel to flip, no altitude clock), so the 9+ gate is missed, but atmosphere is evocative and internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.1)
    Glass-domed winter-sun and marble alphabets are not scenery but tools—Elara slips on wet marble, the creel’s bamboo “echoes spines of scrolls,” fusing object + setting. Tidal floor constrains every footstep and shapes the smelting pool. The atrium’s very walls press the paradox: serenity vs. flux. Final image—gears drip seawater—crystallizes setting as body.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Crystal caves function as both macro-setting and micro-tool: the master node socket is a literal apparatus Elias must decide to modify, constraining the climactic act. Sensory hierarchy is inspector-biased—flashlight angles, corrosion, mineral tang—never tourist catalogue. Spatial choreography is clean: footfalls echo, shell extracted, crown enacted; no floating geography. The “resonant hush” tone is sustained through selective auditory detail (distant sigh, faint scrape) and charges the final image of soft connection-thrum.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ivy-strangled tracks and moss-choked porcelain are handled, not catalogued: Elias wedges boot in cracked sink, vines snap like accusations, graffiti layers read like river silt—each detail constrains his climb and his moral rereading. Accordion functions as micro-setting; its taped fragility is the final image. Sensory hierarchy follows ex-chronicler’s bias: coordinate graffiti first, texture of mildew second, smell of decay last. Spatial choreography is clean from platform to windowsill to waiting-room exit.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Velvet observatory, midsummer humidity, and enchanted ice violin constrain tactics (ivy needs warmth, violin won't melt) and charge the final image. Selective sensory layering—steam “like spectral fingers,” crimson drapes—mirrors emotional heat without cataloging. Spatial choreography clean: ivy creeps, plants quiver, roots anchor floors. Micro-setting (coffee-stained cup, transparent strings) functions as prop chain that alters choice.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    The skyborne grotto is not backdrop but instrument: the aurora’s static is the loom Lirien must read, the void below is the fate she tailors against. Micro-setting—the alabaster slab, crystalline shroud, frozen-dew needle—literally channel the spark; remove any prop and the ritual fails. Spatial choreography is flawless: bodies drift downward, chip rises, Lirien’s reflection trapped inside. Only the phrase “rivers of light across the vaulted ceiling” flirts with postcard prettiness, but it is instantly re-functioned as the pattern she must decode.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    The umbral grotto is not backdrop but tactical constraint: vines wrap wrists, clouds part below to isolate decision space, the eldest oak’s scalloped branches literally provide the perch that triggers revelation. Micro-setting supremacy: hairpin, bark-crevice, and petal-edge function as the handled “environment” that channels rebirth energy. Sensory economy favors touch over vista—cool silver weight, sap welling—mirroring Elara’s caretaker bias. Final image fuses setting and body: wind lifts hair secured by the heirloom, making the grove’s dome her own skull.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.1)
    Luminous-moss basalt, ferrous-veined cavern, and mirror-black pond are tactile, selective, and theme-locked. The platform’s bob under Elara’s step subtly signals unseen physics, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean across the single continuous scene. One minor lapse: “magnetic grotto” is never sensed (no tug on jewelry, hair, or compass), so its constraint is implied, not experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    Bone towers, dust storms, and echo choreography are not backdrop but instruments: the towers supply skimming ledges, dust buries relics anew, echoes amplify harmonics that summon birds. The arrowhead itself becomes micro-setting—its obsidian edge pressed to forehead—charging the final image. Spatial tracking is clean: half-buried → cradled → ledge → forehead. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Thren’s priestly bias: he notices resonance before color, grit before temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    The spire’s ice, cloud-sea glow, and strap-bitten wrists act as micro-setting that literally constrains every footfall and spell-cast; removal would collapse tension. Sensory economy is selective—ozone tang, frost etched stairs—mirroring internal starvation for authentic wonder. Spatial choreography is clean: the climb, vortex, pinnacle garden-arch all track. Final image of lantern-light against automated dawn reweights the environment as insurgent territory for handmade futures.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Atmosphere is the story’s strength: lantern-gold on black waves, bioluminescent fungi breathing like hearts, brass key warm against salt-soaked chest—tactile, selective, immersive. The meteor hush is more than mood; it muffles waves and footfalls, shaping Elias’s stealthy approach. Spatial choreography stays clean: railing climb, knee-deep water, bulkhead door push. The sunken library acts as micro-setting that supplies the decisive book and spectral guardian; environment directly enables closure. One minor slip—"ink-black sea" leans cliché—but overall sensory economy is exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ambered deck, resin-locked telescopes, and orrery receiver are not backdrop—they are tools that physically constrain her sequencing of bursts; removing the amber resin would break the distillation mechanics. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV bias: she notices haptic coin-etch over sound until the high-frequency whine is selected. Spatial choreography is flawless—coins spill, shard is inked, beacon hatch opens in clean succession. World-rules stay consistent: the Big Bang echo can be backward-read because the contraction has literally reversed radiation.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    The observatory is not backdrop but instrumentation: its oculus diffracts dusk into the prism-device that powers the crystallization, its dome amplifies sacrificed voices into the binding incantations. Micro-setting hierarchy obeys Elowen’s reaper senses—she notes marble cracks before constellations, scythe before telescope—thereby fusing tool-body-environment under pressure. Scattered light is a recurring object-as-setting that literally changes state from beam to lattice, constraining the final naming stroke. Spatial choreography is flawless; the scythe, plinth, and chest form a triangle we can track as she orbits them between namings.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    The viaduct’s perpetual sapphire tears function as micro-setting: their cadence is the tool that constrains every tactical decision and is literally channeled through silver needle into bronze. Sensory hierarchy maps Elowen’s priorities—sound of drips, chill on sweat, bronze taste under fingernails—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is immaculate: bell wedged in railing, pendulum carved from Leviathan bone, drops falling five-per-breath then lagging; positions track without drift. Weather (dawn cold that condenses dew) directly affects spell efficiency and bodily stamina, grounding the fantastical premise in lived physics.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    Environment-as-constraint is vivid: the receding reservoir literally unearths the past, forcing Elias’s feet and conscience onto mud that was once Main Street. The midnight ridgeway’s shadows act as a natural confessional booth, narrowing egress to a single overlook where the burning must occur. Tool detail—the lantern adjusted, reopened, finally tilted to scatter ashes—tracks cleanly and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys drought optics: visual glints (sapphire, sepia) dominate, but the hush is repeatedly auditory, embedding the wind-chime silence as lived tension. Spatial choreography is flawless; no impossible body or prop positions. The sapphire label’s micro-setting (palm-to-palm transfer) supersedes any need for town-exposition dumps. World rules (drought mechanics, levee protocol) remain self-consistent. Only cap-keeper: the reservoir town itself is glimpsed as “spires piercing,” never walked through, so the environment constrains symbolically more than tactically—enough to merit high band, but a half-step from 9+ gate that demands full tactical leverage.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall, luminous fruit, and moss-veined roots are filtered through an alchemist’s precision—every glint counts toward the rite. Spatial choreography is airtight: kneeling → spiral of vials → crystal aloft → steam threading the flock. Environment directly constrains the ritual steps (root-pulse dictates kneeling site; prism-spray supplies the light that ignites the steam). A fraction off the 9.0 because the orchard’s perimeter remains vaguely bounded, though this never affects choice.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    The arbor-platform above clouds is more than backdrop: its creaking branches and harness anchor points dictate posture, tool access, and radio line-of-sight; the buckle itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the rescue method. Sensory selection narrows to windless hush and cold metal—exactly what a lone spotler would track. Spatial choreography stays clean: scope-line, lens fog, eastward vortex all track relative to Elias’s perch. Final image reuses the arbor as crucible of perpetual vigil, charging the setting with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    Floating obsidian slab, anti-grav hum, and temporal ink-bleed rewinds outside the barrier are selective, sensory, and immediately constrain stakes—time edits are lethal if the duel fails. The brain-in-jar micro-setting functions as the contested territory; its pulsing glow and label “duplicate” are re-used at climax to re-weight meaning, clearing 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays crisp—Kai lunges, Elara repelled by wards, jar placed on levitating crystal—no impossible positions. Weather/history-as-environment evolves beat-by-beat, mirroring internal volatility without dropping into tourist-catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    Willow-and-brook micro-setting is filtered through puzzle-designer eyes: seed = map overlay, soil = volcanic ink, petrichor = solvent cue. Every environmental detail is recruited into Elias’s decoding loop, so place actively constrains tactics rather than decorating. Night chill, damp stone, boot-level water all double as sensory cipher surface. Only 120-word orientation anchor is met; spatial choreography stays clean.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.1)
    The echo chamber is not backdrop; its acoustic physics multiply wind into polyphony and literally dissolve grief, constraining Elias’s tactic. Phosphor fungi, rebar baton, and worn pull-cords are tactile micro-settings that charge the final image as engines fail. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: arc of blowers, alcoves, table—no impossible placements. Sensory economy favors sound/(absence of) touch, mirroring Elias’s translucent state; specificity anchors the fantastical.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Frozen garden is tactile—rime-matted fur, drip-Morse from thorns—and the misty limbo doubles as macro- and micro-setting, constraining movement and perception. Spatial choreography is clean; the guardian’s body, the pendant, and the cultist’s ghost stay trackable. The environment literally melts into a door, charging the final image; without this cold haze there is no boundary to breach. Gate met.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ember nexus is rendered with selective, sensory economy: “frozen blooms of ash and glow” that mirror Elias’s stalled hope. The crozier evolves from relic to slurry to living tree, functioning as micro-setting that constrains each tactical choice; its material state directly governs what Elias can attempt. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible moves—and the environment’s cold/heat actively limits or enables each approximation. One minor over-trope: “eternal winter / eternal spring” risks symbolic convenience, but the final thaw is causally tied to the destruction act, so the cap remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dish, catwalk, and moon-tugged gorge are not backdrop but tools: the feed horn accepts the Hollywood fragment, the cliff crystals become the new resonator. Spatial choreography is immaculate—boots on perforated steel, rungs vibrating under lunar gravity—so environment constrains each action. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s technician bias: she notices cable tension before mist color. Micro-setting (the shard of hush in the signal nexus) literally mutes noise and thereby enables the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sensory selection is vivid and POV-filtered: salt spray, luminous whispering rocks, starlight through fissures. The ferry itself becomes a micro-setting whose dissolving edges directly constrain action. Spectral grotto is atmospherically rich, yet its physics (how hull scrapes crystal without breaching) stays fuzzy; because no tactical choice depends on that physics, credibility holds. Final image of pocketed empty hourglass reuses setting detail as symbolic constraint, meeting 9+ gate but not quite charging tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.3)
    The loom-sinew functions as micro-setting: its warmth and grit constrain every weaving choice and charge the final eruption. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Elias notices translucency, hum, muscle-heat—while optical murals act as living mirrors, rippling in sympathy. Selective detail keeps momentum; no exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    Benthic city is sketched with bioluminescent fish and pressure-seal thrums; the vaulted chamber and hologram orb anchor the scene. Spatial choreography is clean; the chain link’s micro-setting role constrains the final pedagogy, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.1)
    The mist-clad atrium is vividly filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias—marble arches “like forgotten sighs”—and the photograph plus hearing aid function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless: bench, balustrade, and railing positions track cleanly across the encounter. Weather (twilight, mist) affects Clara’s suicidal timing and Elara’s visibility, thus constraining approach. Sensory hierarchy narrows to sound (aid) and touch (tarnished brass) under crisis, meeting the 9+ gate for environment-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is sensory-filtered through claustrophobic bias: brine-slick rope, kelp-lit airlock, kelp sway as locator beacon. The drowned lab’s flickering tubes and floating debris are economically sketched; the codex doubles as micro-setting that physically charges the climax. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible moves during phase walk. Tide clock is omnipresent, guiding every beat, qualifying for 9+ gate, but final cliff image doesn’t newly reweight the stake, so capped at 8.4.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Opal-glass dome, frost veins, and snow-muffled silence create a tactile micro-setting that constrains access and amplifies isolation. The cracked console and residual quantum hum are economically seeded, then exploited when ink pours across living circuitry. Spatial choreography stays exact: lantern glow, ink nebulae, shard scrape all track without drift. Weather deepens stakes—exit into storm literalizes the cost of new knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Bone towers, copper-lit skin, and the echo-tunnel are tactile, selective, and constrain every move; the diamond’s flaw even refracts light like a “trapped scream,” charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean as Thorne climbs, positions the gem, exits. Environment literally amplifies his voice—setting is antagonist and archive simultaneously, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.1)
    The garden’s bioluminescent herbs, quartz-veined soil, and rime-crackling dome are filtered through a researcher's gaze—every noticed detail doubles as specimen or tool. The arrowhead’s warmth against cold and the phone’s bent-antenna question-mark give tactile micro-settings that charge the metamorphosis beat. Spatial choreography is flawless: half-buried phone under echofern, receiver lifted, voices spiraling while pots levitate in lazy spirals. Environment directly enables the levitation choice, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Enchanted orchard is not postcard; it constrains—lantern eyes sweep, gears fuse into xylem, bark splits under bow pressure. Sky-bridge silk and starlight function as micro-setting that enables stealth descent. Locust shell’s “brittle curve” is tactile and charges the final crack. Persistent object (violin) and body (callused fingers) meet the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    Cobalt arcade’s bruise-light and pinball ghosts are re-used as environmental mirror for Elias’s internal flicker; the glassed booth constrains every tactical move. Thunderstorm bottle functions as micro-setting—its glow dictates drone launches and border visibility. Spatial choreography is clean: cycle → booth → vent → ravine, distances track. Sensory hierarchy favors sight and sound, narrowing to heartbeat and drone hum under pressure, justifying the ellipsis of taste/smell.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.1)
    The warped-glass greenhouse inside a flatbed, spring weeping from the undercarriage, and moss-wrapped pony neck are irreplicable micro-settings that constrain tool use and body posture. Halo-light refracting through dew charges the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track Elias from gaping door to sunken oasis to restored ring without drift. Environment literally shapes tactics—vines part for chisel, mildew scent masks approaching dawn—meeting 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.0)
    The scientific-poetry library is not backdrop but instrument: pseudospheres and saddle-shaped metrics are literally pulled from shelves to bend the scarf. The scarf itself becomes micro-setting—its silk resists, warms, blooms color—constraining every folding act. Patrons’ coughs and dawn’s gray light anchor time and keep the infinite horizon at human scale. Spatial choreography is flawless; no floating props.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Archipelago breathes as character: salt-laced winds whisper coordinates, dictating when Elara climbs. Palette wells “harvested from sunrises long past” is a micro-setting marvel that constrains her limited dawns. Driftwood-bound cipher literalizes island skin, fusing library and reef. Spatial choreography crystal—lens, dome, tide—tracks cleanly across three dawns without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.0)
    Starlight, mists, and anvil form a micro-setting that constrains ritual action; the ribbon’s scent and shimmer direct attention and choice. Sensory economy is high—one smell (distant memories), one visual (shimmering hair), one tactile (frayed edge)—all filtered through POV urgency. Spatial choreography is clean: woman enters / stands / steadies / exits; locksmith remains anchored to anvil. Final image of ribbon re-tied on his own lock satisfies 9+ quick test by charging the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse’s half-submerged dome, cracked glass, and drowned apple trees are not backdrop; they force Elias to wade, kneel, and read the sky through fractured panes, directly shaping the decryption act. Shipwreck husks echo the 1947 flood that first let the sprites in, binding history to present tactic. Sensory hierarchy obeys a folklorist’s eye—phosphorescence, silt, salt wind—without tourist catalog. Micro-setting (the fairy ring itself) ultimately charges the final image as its glow seals the door.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.1)
    The library functions as micro-setting: creaking floorboards constrain Elara’s backwards walk, shards act as tools that must be handled, and the tall glass pane physically traps the shadow—charging the final release. Dust motes, cracked spines, and chipped cup create textured specificity without checklist overload. Playground swing outside re-enters the last line, evolving from atmosphere to approving witness, re-weighting the hush. Spatial choreography remains clean across tea brewing, sigil tracing, and shadow merger.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Waterfall spray, moss pulse, and orchard buds are filtered through Lirien’s cultivator gaze, each sensory note tethered to his next ritual move. The parapet’s slippery ledge and the seed’s warmth in Elowen’s palm constrain gesture and decision, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays crisp across the single scene. A half-point shy of 8+ only because weather/environment never push back—no wind shear, no mist-blind misstep to test the weave.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Star-refracted crystals, silted floor, and the coarse net’s bloated knots are returnable resources that constrain posture and tool choice; the prisms’ colour warnings (reds for rage, blues for drowned sorrow) directly colour-code the escalation beats. Spatial choreography is clean—bodies kneel, reach, pierce, fetch—without impossible drift. Sensory economy favours touch and sight under urgency; calmer star-wheel moments admit wider visual scope. The setting micro-reifies into the tapestry needle itself, whose stained eye supplies the final charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rain-scoured vault, wind-lashed henge, and mossy chapel steps are filtered through Elias’s conservator gaze, guiding each discovery; the northeast-shadow discrepancy smartly compresses decades into one tactile detail. Still, the chapel interior receives only a cinematic once-over, keeping the final image from charging the physical space with irrevocable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    The library is not décor but a hydraulic antagonist—warped shelves, gelatinous pages, silt that swallows footprints—every detail constrains movement and attention. Micro-setting (snow globe on captain’s desk) becomes the fulcrum on which the entire thematic lever pivots. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s scientific gaze: brine chemistry before nostalgia, pressure before poetry. Missing the 9+ gate only because spatial choreography of the larger wreck is sketched in silhouette.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Environment (floating stone balustrades, perpetual vapor) constrains movement and supplies ochre moss-pigment for ink—directly enabling the encoding act. Spatial choreography is clean: mural→ blank wall section→ skyward arc. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elowen’s artist-eye: visual vines, tactile plate hum, acoustic thunder. Weather (lightning-thunder gap) functions as live clock, tightening choices. Micro-setting (brass plate) charges final image: its warmth = transferred ghost/code cost.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Icebound spire and glass-walled elevator operate as micro-setting that literally constrains choice—she can only read while ascending, forcing the decryption into ten compressed beats. The frost-laced panes and prismatic auroras mirror the emotional thaw of each secret, charging the final glare of light at floor ten. Spatial choreography is immaculate: case, goggles, diary, and light angle track cleanly across every floor marker. Environment never stalls momentum; instead, denser ice layers coincide with deeper wounds, integrating description into rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sky-gondola, brass telescope, and logbook function as micro-settings that constrain every move; the snapped string literally reconfigures spatial possibilities.

No orientation debt; who-where-when anchored within first 60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    The hollow oak is handled tactilely—bark channels carved, knothole light caught, dust sifted—so the library-tree actively enables the tactic. Micro-setting doubles as tool: the inner bark becomes substrate for mirror channels; spatial choreography stays clean as she pries, carves, steps back. Weather/demotion murmur tighten the clock. Final image of salvaged planks glimpsing sky links environment to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.9)
    Airship deck, hopscutch grid, and murmuration layer tactile anchors that steer choice—boards must be dusted, birds repelled, rift approached. Sensory economy is tight: one sniff of “dust-caked” planks, one gleam of crystalline motes, all filtered through map-maker gaze. The final image of glowing veins charging the sails satisfies the 9+ gate by constraining ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.0)
    The frozen library’s stratospheric cold actively numbs fingers, slows metal, and forces deliberate movements; the hall mirrors’ vertiginous infinity dictates a kneeling stance and narrowed visual field, directly shaping gear placement. Gears themselves act as micro-setting, their brass weight anchoring attention and limiting which pieces can be handled with gloved hands. Final image of “clocks carrying echo” is charged by the library’s prior frost and mirrored light, fulfilling 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Thalia’s bramble-fruit, floating arches, and lavender sky are vivid, but operate more as painterly backdrop than choice-constraint until the bell is hung beneath the grandest arch. The butterfly garden watering bell itself is a perfect micro-setting that finally charges the image, earning partial 9+ credit. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the hauling scene. World-rules (nebula as renewable resource) remain consistent, though the exact physics of “butterfly wings lassoing nebula” is accepted as fairy-tale logic.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hidden lighthouse, dusk-void horizon, pane that folds sound, and the cracked puppet head micro-setting all constrain the final action: song can pierce only via the nested cracks. These tangible objects crystallize the closing image, passing 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.2)
    Cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, and cursed orchard interlock tactilely: birds’ brass clatter, jagged paths, foaming seas below supply immediate bodily stakes. Micro-setting rule met—nuts and blueprint act as handled tools that reshape stone, directly enabling closure arch. Detail economy is ruthless: “gnarled roots…forgotten regrets” marries tactile and emotional in one stroke. Frost-lace final image recharges earlier frost-crack mention, crystallizing the graceless beauty motif under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Braided ravine is more than postcard: its foam constrains the scientific breakthrough and the chrysalis provides the talisman that charges closure. Spatial choreography is clean—boots on pebbles, silt retrieval, upstream departure—anchoring time at dusk→stars→dawn. Sensory hierarchy respects crisis: narrow focus on iridescent bubble lattices widens only after insight. Environment directly enables the polymer blueprint, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    Floating orchard-library, obsidian tablets, bottled moonlight—each object is handled, not catalogued; the crystalline boughs part to let Elias descend, proving setting constrains exit. Cloud-sea swirls mirror internal fragmentation, integrating environment with body. Sensory selection favors touch (cool silver) and sight (prismatic map) over tourist catalog. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from counter to vortex.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rain-slicked mud, “metallic tang,” and ice-veined coral walls are filtrated through Elaris’s synesthetic palate, guiding his shovel and later his flame; the desert-after-rain micro-setting literally softens the sand so the stairwell can yield—environment as enabling constraint. The final image of dawn on wet walls reprises the metallic taste now cleansed, recharging the opening anchor with earned lightness. This meets the 9-gate test: setting charges the final image while remaining causally active.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prairie-constellation mingling with orrery projections is sensorily precise and filtered through Elara’s librarian gaze. The astronomical clock tower functions as micro-setting: its gears, brass binoculars, and lead weight supply the literal pulley rig that powers the bridge, so environment constrains tactics. Grain elevators evolve from “concrete silos of suspicion” to “fragile arc of unity,” a causal state-change mirrored in the physical planks. Spatial choreography stays clean: 200-yard cable, lantern glow tracking bodies, no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    The canyon body is micro-setting-as-tool: silt yields glyphs, moonlight pools are calibrated by microns, the rover’s relic status supplies the mirror. Spatial choreography stays clean—ledge, crevice, floor—guiding her downward spiral. Sensory hierarchy favors visual fractals, but POV bias justifies it (engineer). The moon’s final fade recharges the mirror, satisfying the 9+ gate. One minor over-repetition: “quaking reverie” appears four times with identical phrasing, dulling atmospheric evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.9)
    The grotto’s serpentine walls and mist filter every beat; spatial choreography stays clean as she floats among inverted crystals. “Prism-minded” perception keeps description selective—spectral facets, refracted shards—so setting doubles as perceptual instrument. Environment does not physically constrain victory, preventing 9+, but it supplies the only palette the climax can refract.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Micro-setting (porcelain dome, cracked elder heartwood) actively constrains the strumming technique and amplification; failure to wedge it would silence the piece. Sensory economy favors bone-conducted thrum over aerial sound, reinforcing silent-world rule. Alder root-curl and moss-draped trunks evolve from postcard to orchestrational stage as branches sway in response. Spatial choreography holds: sculpture, insulator, and Elowen’s body remain triangulated across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    The worry stone functions as micro-setting: its dent dictates the final board alignment and literally shapes the closing move. Twilight nexus is sketched with selective sensorial strokes—“compasses spun wild,” “obsidian monoliths humming”—that guide the correlation task rather than stall momentum. Spatial choreography is clean; the knight-leap pacing across scree is tracked. Weather and scale stay subordinate to the stone/board dyad, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting that constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Workshop micro-setting is tactile: rusted tools, violin-string tuner, glow-worm bulbs all constrain tactics—no brute force, only resonance. Final image of clasp “like a surrendered flag” recharges earlier dove etching. One line-level over-tell (“cool air scented by pine and distant gunpowder”) barely dents specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Whispercanopy’s swaying walkways and tidal winds are not backdrop but active antagonists, rocking the pot and forcing micro-tactics (lash, doodle, breathe). The corpse-flower stench evolves from “faint rot-scent” to “tidal wave,” mirroring internal escalation. Micro-setting—the seed’s leathery husk and lantern-filtered leaf roofs—constrains handling and timing. Final image: village platforms “heaving like breath,” crystallizing the setting-body merger.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    The floating arches, up-cascading rivers, and root-etched cavern are selective, pressure-filtered details that guide flight choices. Sensory hierarchy obeys pilot priorities—airflow over color—so environment shapes tactics. The arrow-tip itself becomes micro-setting when it finally constrains growth. A hair’s-breadth slip: “orchards seemed to salute” edges toward sentiment, not terrain.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    The container canyon is not backdrop but airflow architecture: every gap, angle, and crate skin steers the breeze that killed the town. Details are filtered through Elias’s engineer gaze—rust hues become data, wind vectors become survival. The patch and the crater function as micro-settings that charge the final image; without them the reconfiguration would feel weightless. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis logic: sound of howling wind, smell of hot metal, feel of grit under glove—never tourism.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ice walls, auroral veins, and prism-faceted bells are not backdrop but instruments: the cavern’s hush literally softens under chromatic assault, turning setting into antagonist and finally collaborator. Every sensory pick is POV-filtered—Elyra notices what a bell-ringer would (resonance, light-split clappers) and ignores what she wouldn’t. The environment constrains tactics—only the aurora’s realtime colors can temper the strike—so the final glow bathing spent amber satisfies the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    The canyon hush is not mere atmosphere; its absorptive acoustics mandate the flute’s precise tones to tear the veil, making environment an active gatekeeper. Driftwood branches, ley-line clefts, and the rune-scratched amphitheater are etched through action, not catalogue. The “avalanchingly quiet” neologism is taught early and repaid when silence swallows his scream inside the weave. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from riverbed to amphitheater without white-room drift.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Topaz walls refract starlight to force disorientation; the press’s trapped-hornet hum constrains pacing and attention. The workshop’s jagged cliff position mirrors the emotional precipice Elias courts. Micro-setting succeeds: the halo fragment’s heat and glow alter tactical choices (when to pull the lever, when to release). Sensory hierarchy is POV-specific—Elias notices ink viscosity, Mira notices vanishing stars.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ridgeway, aurora pulses, and pendant function as micro-setting trio: terrain forces the fork stop, sky-light supplies the vision canvas, object acts as conduit. Each constrains choice—Kael cannot leave the ridge, must trade, must use the wing. Sensory hierarchy stays courier-biased: wind against throat, leather cord bite, vibration before visual dazzle. Final image—auroras etching path into legend—recharges earlier “ethereal crystal” line, closing the texture loop.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Quartz arbor and mist function as micro-setting that constrains every move—fog coils through arches, prism light bounces off facets, silence is literally pregnant. Frost on glass becomes a second setting-layer whose neural-map veins dictate where Elias places his palm and reads emotion. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s scientific lens: he measures dew, notes temperature, then yields to synesthetic color-bleed of anger and grief. Spatial choreography is immaculate: sedan parked at edge, pane touched, rivulets descend, prism light lands on quartz floor.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.1)
    Bamboo forest, rotting orchard, and amber bead function as micro-setting: the bead’s captured light literally powers the tapestry’s flight, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory detail is selective—emerald clatter, sweet rot, moon-dyed thread—filtered through Elara’s spinner perception. Spatial choreography stays coherent within the single grove; weather (dew-weight bamboo) cues the final dawn. One minor slip: “crate at the orchard’s edge” appears without prior spatial anchor, but the lyric mode absorbs it.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Floating rock arches and azure fruit are particular, re-used, and directly supply the raw material for the climax; the mine shaft micro-setting constrains acoustics that amplify the silk’s magic, cleanly charging the final image. Sensory balance favors twilight hues and mineral dust, giving the orchard planet a memorable, non-generic skin.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is micro-textured through Elara’s sensorium—ozone, rust, green glass edge—each detail filters her map-maker bias.

Final image—mist curling like “approving spirits”—mirrors internal acceptance without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stormlit tower, cliffside updraft, moon-healing shafts—each detail doubles as resource and metaphor. The sextant’s brass and the oaks’ rings function as micro-settings that constrain method: only dreams + moonlight can zero the grief ledger. Spatial choreography is tracked through Elias’s knees aching on stairs, puddles silvering underfoot. The final image re-weights the entire cosmos into root-soil grace, meeting 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    The crystalline greenhouse etched with glowing sap, the mica window warping reflections, and the Heart Tree’s bruised-bark veins are tactile, selective, and charged. These micro-settings constrain every beat: light motes are pulled from the window, the tree’s elixir veins ignite only when swaddled. Spatial choreography remains clean as Elara kneels, hums, rises. The final image of the cleared mica window reweights the whole mirror world, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    Library air “thick with aged paper and polished oak” is inhaled through Elara’s biased attention; the brass lantern pools and concealed panel constrain her path.

No environment detail feels touristic; every sense note is tethered to her decision pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Ivy-choked palace, solar brazier hiss, and frost-rimmed leaves filter every beat; the secret tea house itself constrains the reunion—only one entrance, shared steam veil forces face-to-face honesty. Tool-as-setting (chipped pot, scarred table) is handled, not catalogued. No headcount or geography confusion; weather shifts from brittle dusk to night exactly as the bread disappears, guiding emotional temperature. Slight over-reliance on visual vs. other senses, but selective detail keeps momentum; qualifies for 9-band gate under micro-setting rule.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Quartz shelves, cloud-forged silver lantern, ice-veined pedestal are tactile tools that constrain posture and procedure; the library itself functions as an extension of Elias’s body.

Micro-setting gate satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    The pier’s rot, tidal groan, and lantern sway are not backdrop but tactical cover—timbers mask footfalls, shadows hide knives, dawn tide forces evacuation. Object-as-setting: the antique fob constrains every major choice (bait, evidence, loaded heirloom). Sensory hierarchy obeys Lila’s runner DNA—she clocks barrel proofs, scent-tracks contraband routes, feels gold temperature for status jolts. Final image of dunes at sunrise re-prices the same salt air from lure to exile.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    Environment, body, and tool triangulate choice: the ring’s nano-needle literally steers her downslope; aurora-lavender dyad mirrors internal shimmer-to-storm transition. Spatial choreography stays crisp—“crest,” “descend,” “cluster at bluff’s edge”—no floating bodies. Micro-setting (mouth taste) doubles as weather sensor, constraining forward motion. 9+ gate met: ring charges final image; one hairline slip—“electric tang” edges toward cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Crystal cave is not postcard fluff: the mica slab, refracted violet light, and glittering dust are manipulated physically to create the schematic surface and hide the spare parts. Spatial choreography is flawless—kneeling, brushing, prying—every motion tracked. The cave’s “auroral sorrow” mirrors interior regret but never yanks control from Elias’s hands. Final image of cave-as-studio re-uses setting as earned studio, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)

    The Victorian’s creaking skeleton and Harlan’s paper-crowded parlor are filtered through Elara’s obsessive ear, turning every warped board into data; sensory hierarchy is strict—sound first, scent second, sight last. Rooftop garden is sketched with three precise strokes—blankets, jasmine, meteor streaks—just enough to let the sky act as sounding board for the building’s voice. The antique seal’s brass lion and crimson wax are tactile mini-settings that constrain choice: only the nimble fingers can work it, so possession = access. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from threshold to rooftop; no floating rooms or impossible exits. Setting never expositions itself—details attach to action (Harlan pocket-tracing the seal, Elara pressing it into her palm).

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    The velvet garden is no backdrop; its wilting/re-forming petals track the ritual’s intensity, supplying visceral feedback. Midnight moss–choked fountain and jagged shell act as micro-settings that constrain gesture—she must kneel, balance the shell, trace curves.

The geese shadow is a recurring environmental clock whose stretch marks the accrual of sidereal time. Sensory detail is selective—glass shard star-glint, condensation droplet iridescence—woven through action rather than catalog. Final image of reborn waters charging the mosaics reuses the celestial-tile motif, so setting charges closure under 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.1)
    The petal-throne–gear mesh literally constrains the final choice—no substitute object could serve the “soft glow” mandate. Nebula density occludes starfire, forcing sonar transit and mapping tactics; spatial choreography of pollen clouds and gas eddies is tracked cleanly through every ping return. Sensory economy favors luminous tactility over visual catalog: “brass teeth worn smooth” is touch memory, “veins of bioluminescence” fuses setting into the decisive act. Micro-setting (gear-in-throne) becomes the crucible; environment thus charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.1)
    The greenhouse is never a postcard; its “vine-choked” arches and “humid air thick with nectar” physically guide Elias’s retracing steps and constrain where the ribbon can be laid. Butterflies operate as both weather and chorus, their wing-beat “thundering calm” altering his heart rate and filtering what he notices. The central fountain and shadowed alcove are revisited with precise spatial memory, each return recharging the family’s ghosted poems. Micro-setting triumph: the woven ribbon itself functions as portable terrain, its knots dictating the path of revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tidal obsidian ridge is not backdrop but antagonist: “waves hurled themselves… like damned souls,” stone slicks the grip, lantern light glints off brass—every sense is recruited and filtered through Elias’s professional eye for friction and balance. Spatial choreography is flawless: we track handholds, distance to tower, iron door swing, pendulum arc. Weather/tide rules are learned through action (only low tide grants access). The broken rake handle becomes micro-setting; its splinters and carvings physically constrain the final ritual—remove it and the visionary beat collapses. This is textbook environment-as-tactic, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    Velveteen gloom, cobalt silo, and star-slit dust motes are selective, sensory, and filtered through Elias’s gardener eye. The silo’s cramped vertical space forces him to crate-props the tapestry, so micro-setting constrains the decoding action. No spatial drift; weather is night-cold but registers only as shimmer on paint—economy upheld.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Obsidian spire, frozen lake, and lantern gears are tactile and POV-filtered; ice groans like a “beast awakening,” mirroring stakes. The kingfisher quill operates as micro-setting: its iridescence and diving legend constrain Elias’s belief in predictive leaps. Environmental pressure is literal—cracking ice, gale shaking facets—forcing recalibration. Spatial choreography stays coherent; enforcers advance up the same shore Elias watches.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Mist, ember pulses, and the radio’s pale-azure glow are not backdrop but apparatus: they filter visibility, dictate illegal timing, and refract the final star-like dust. The alcove’s physical logic—stone cracks, rising motes—tracks cleanly across every move. Micro-setting (the shortwave dial) literally powers the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    The gallery’s “tapering walls” and “illusory depths” are not backdrop but active constraint: they literally swallow the ash and certify the scam of perpetual recession. Micro-settings—rocking chair, mortar, mask—are handled in motion, their states change (chair stops, mask sheds flecks, pestle grinds). The final image of dust spiraling “into the vanishing point” concretely charges the ending, fusing setting with theme. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible object hops.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sewer conduit, jury-rigged auger, and brass cog function as micro-setting that literally constrain posture, tool-choice, and final fusion. Bioluminescent fungi pulsing like “false heartbeats” is sensory, selective, and thematically charged. Spatial choreography is immaculate: hand, muck, spire, bedrock distances track without drift. Final image—cog ticking inside frame on sewer throne—crystallizes environment-body-tool unity.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.1)
    The velvet library, autumn leaves, and zither rosette are vividly filtered through Elara’s perceptual bias; the rosette constrains her teaching method and charges the final image. Selective sensory detail (amber light, plush shadows) mirrors internal quiet without cataloguing. Spatial choreography remains stable despite off-page choristers. Environment subtly guides choice: the library’s hush enables the subtraction method.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rusted greenhouse is tactile—dew-slick leaves, flaking beams—yet never blocks or enables a specific tactical choice; it’s backdrop, not constraint. The celestial shafts function as mood lighting rather than environmental pressure. Micro-setting (shears, seed pocket) is handled well, but the final image could not swap places with any other ruined structure, keeping it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    The tower, booth, and matchbox function as micro-settings that constrain choice. Lightning rods, waxen halls, and nectar dusk are sensory, selective, and filtered through Elias’s perceptual bias toward golden, viscous imagery. Spatial choreography is clean: line → booth → spiral stairs → hive core. The matchbox’s striker and worn lid are tactile anchors that evolve from heirloom to ignition tool, charging the final image of sparks relighting the hive.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Setting is filtered through Elias’s synesthetic bias—“cherry blossoms drifted like forgotten sighs,” “streetlights daydreamed”—so sensory detail is selective and purposeful. The bay’s geography stays schematic, but micro-setting (porch, hyacinths, worn table) constrains choices: objects must be displaced before they can be returned. Weather is soft spring mist, never urgent enough to alter tactics, so environment mirrors rather than pressures. Final image of reignited porches recharges the early “hollow shells” motif, earning a modest glow of specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Garden is not backdrop but tactical interface: the foxglove ampoule is half-buried in silt, the marble pedestal becomes the tool-platform, and the kelp tendrils physically assist the cork extraction. Bioluminescent anemones “pulse like forgotten heartbeats,” mirroring Elara’s dawning moral arrhythmia. Spatial choreography is flawless—every motion of statue, thread, and vapor is trackable. The underwater physics stay consistent: telepathy bypasses water’s muffling, bubbles erupt from gills, fountains weep veils of bubbles—each sensory detail is filtered through her urgent attention.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.9)
    Infinite staircase functions as micro-setting: each step’s sameness pressures tactic of mathematical escape; helix curvature enters equations, constraining proof. Sensory economy—glow, seismic groan—mirrors internal vortex without catalogue. Object-as-setting (die, paper scrap) handled tactilely, altering choices. Light-breach image recharges earlier missed-leap memory, meeting 9+ gate for final-image charge.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Rooftop greenhouse, fogged panes, saffron ink, and moon-tipped brush form a micro-setting that actively refracts moonlight into the city’s windows, directly enabling the climax. Smog, ferns, and orchids are filtered through Elias’s painterly eye—selective, never catalogue. Spatial choreography is flawless: rice paper unrolled across the floor, brush pauses, moonbeam path tracked glass-by-glass to tenement panes. The only thing preventing 9+ is that the environment does not physically constrain a final choice—he could have painted anywhere—so the charge is luminous rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is hero: the ice-locked museum, cascade thunder, bioluminescent fungi, and communal hearth each constrain tactics—baking bread is only warmth source; lens sighting is only recon tool. Waterfall geography is tracked cleanly from fissure-peep to shatter-to-flood without spatial drift. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis—sound of rupture drowns colour, smell of rosewater turns cloying toxin. Micro-setting of the lens-as-tool charges the final image; without emerald refraction, opera-house hope never sparks.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    The hunger stone’s green bile-glow, the counter-clockwise beam, and the salt-stink of shells are selective, pressure-filtered details that guide Elias’s hands and最终的 lens-smash. Lighthouse geography stays coherent: slick path → stone → stairwell → lantern room. Tide-as-clock is the dominant sensory metronome, narrowing perception as vitality leaks. Micro-setting (bone-and-shell yoyo) becomes the fulcrum object that literalizes “reverse time,” charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is micro-scaled to the floating orchard, xylophone-debris, and tattoos; each constrains action (rope strings, plank dome). Sensory triage under wave assault narrows to salt-slick touch and vibrating apples. Spatial choreography survives the slap-splinter sequence; no geography drift. The driftwood ring and whalebone mallet return in the final image, recharging the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    Tortuga Spire’s fused turtle districts, phosphorescent brine, and sun-bleached haze are tactile and bias-filtered through Elara’s cartographer eye; the spiral vortex she straddles literally guides her final act. The turtle-shell-as-setting constrains the whistle’s sonic path and thus the plot, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.0)
    Ivy as green choke constrains movement (tunnel breach) and mirrors narrative overgrowth; rose petal signals time and illusion’s end—both recharge final image. Flashlight beam catching gold “D” micro-setting turns bench into altar of discovery, constraining cautious handling. Sensory hierarchy (damp earth, rust smell, crimson ink) filters through historian’s curator eye. Environment, tool (letter), and recurring petal collectively charge closure; 9-band gate met.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    The brass inkwell’s salt-scarred lid, the lantern’s ember-shadows on kelp-wrapped domes, the tide lapping at chest then chin—every sensory pick is filtered through Elias’s surveyor gaze and steers the next action. Spatial choreography is immaculate: steps descend, slab wrestled, lintel pins, drawbridge remains distant. Weather is not backdrop but antagonist, dictating the clock. Only minus: the lovers’ etched initials could be more idiosyncratic, less generic relic.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Floating island, glass basilica, dream-quartz veins, and origami cranes are never mere postcards: the helix staircase physically embodies descend-while-ascending, the lantern facets constrain how dream-light fractures, and the tea-mist anchors time. Spatial choreography is flawless across the basilica’s nave and vented skylight. Environment directly shapes tactics—gems harvested from misty roots, glass walls amplifying projection—charging the final aerial release. Micro-setting (the lantern’s captured heartbeats) functions as pivot-object, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating observatory is more than scenery—anti-grav coils, null-grav spindle, and panoramic crater-view directly enable/constraint her hunt tactics. Micro-settings (railing, spherical void, grated floors) are handled tactilely, never catalogued. Geode acts as portable setting-fragment that phases through her palm, merging body/tool/environment. Slight discount because atmospheric null-point physics is asserted more than demonstrated through sensory consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    Observatory tools (brass pedestal, launch tubes, matrix chip) constrain every tactical move; the cracked dome mirrors emotional fracture and is recharged in the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless—bodies, drones, and star arcs track cleanly. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: Elara notices metallic hums and star spectra, never tourist filler. Weather-light shift from dusk to lantern to star-flare modulates tension. Only micro-slip: “jagged cliff” remains generic; no tactile interaction with stone or wind.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cobalt terrace, jagged rocks, brine, and driftwood create a tactile, odor-rich micro-setting that filters cleanly through Elias’s professional eye for carved symbols. The shore objects (netted-man noose, crest plank, watch hand) double as evidence and moral mirror, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays crisp across descent, kneel, sift, rise. Environment directly shapes tactics: only this forgotten shore could deliver the carvings that contradict his forgery.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Storm-scoured parapet and waning moon are not backdrop; wind dictates rope handling, mist veils intent, slick stone risks literal fall. Micro-setting (drawer pull in palm) constrains the apology ritual. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV priorities: lunar phase > tactile relic > brother’s wrists. Spatial choreography clean across four bodies and two artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cracked compass and the eighteenth utility pole literally constrain the final image; remove either and the star-alignment moment collapses. Salt-laced wind, bruised-orange waves, and the humming insulators on the poles are filtered through Elias’s navigator-reflex attention, never touristy. Spatial choreography is flawless—kayak, swell, pole-line, beach approach track without drift. Environment shapes tactics: he times strokes to pole spacing when stars fail, a tactile covenant between body and infrastructure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Body, tool, and micro-setting converge: the cracked-leather baseball literally steers every descent choice; the bioluminescent lake supplies the final reflective surface that charges the tear. Spatial choreography is clean—rust-grate → tunnel fork → cavern—tracked through flashlight, drips, echo. Sensory economy favors bioluminescent pulses that mirror emotional flicker, avoiding tourist catalog. No environmental constraint alters tactics in the 8.8 way, but the baseball-as-compass is specific enough for high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orchard is lushly rendered—silver leaves, starlight antlers, dew-kissed roots—yet description sometimes ornaments rather than constrains choice. The phoenix tree finally serves as ritual anchor, but earlier environment could more actively shape tactics. Sensory hierarchy favors visual; scent (the pivotal spice vapor) deserves sharper tactical foregrounding. Micro-setting success: the cookie’s gleam amid roots instantly grounds the inciting beat.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glade’s obsidian branches and “moon like a bruised lung” are not postcard but choice-limiting: the choking perfume mist literally narrows breath, forcing Lirien to her knees. The saucer’s crack acts as micro-setting: its fracture glow guides her eye to the clockwork, becoming the pivot object. Spatial choreography is immaculate—cloth spread on root-altar, infant fist pressed, vapors parting for descent. Weather/environment (perfumed mist that tastes of milk-dawns) directly alters tactics: she must bundle the cloth and flee before the beauty strangles them.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Recycled hull, faded photographs, and Kwan Yin’s tear function as micro-setting: the tear is tool, the photos are portal ink, the hull’s melted battle-cruiser steel ghosts the pacifist ethic. Spatial choreography is ghost-clean—no drift in zero-g. Sensory hierarchy is Elara’s luminous bias. Final image—“golden mist spilling”—is recharged by the same tear and photos, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.1)
    Selective sensory layering—black sand “cool and yielding,” bioluminous “sapphire whispers”—mirrors interior quest without catalogue bloat. Volcano, planetary alignment, and beach constrain both mythic stakes and bodily choreography; the bottled bugs act as micro-setting that charge the final auroral release. Spatial tracking stays clean across cliff detour → beach → treeline arrival. The setting’s specificity elevates the closing image, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)

Environment, body, tool trinity charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Rusted-eaves/“broken teeth” and star-poked vault set an immediate tactile ceiling; later, mildewed pages and “soil pilfered from the exercise pen” keep the world practical. The library itself acts as micro-setting—every shove of a book-stack rewrites floor space and possible barricades—so environment directly shapes tactics. Recurring moonlight fractures act as lantern and clock, charging the final image of flowers “defiant against frost.” Detail never stalls plot; it is discovered through stacking, prying, sowing—lived-in specificity that meets the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cloudstation, tidal surges, and prism-leaves constrain every foot-hold; the arbor’s groaning “colossal organ” metaphor charges the final piano-ascent analogy. The compass-needles’ physical twitch is felt in Elias’s skin-level navigation decisions. No encyclopedic dumps—detail arrives as sensory threats or tools. The miniature upright assembled from branch-scraps literalizes setting-as-instrument, charging the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Micro-setting (ridge, arbor, dream-library) supplies every beat; the levitating petals and echo-mirrors constrain observation rules that Elara must calibrate, charging the empirical-whimsical tension. Sensory hierarchy stays biased to her instruments and gaze; weather serves as live clock. Spatial choreography clean across the dream/real divide. Final image of villagers humming while petals fade re-uses setting to re-weight stake. World rules stay internally consistent once taught.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    Bonsai galleon, brass compass, and antique lace act as micro-settings that constrain every tactical move; their tactile handling (snip, breathe, clutch) charges the final image. Weather diffuses grief—mist thickens as regrets are pruned—so environment actively participates rather than decorates. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elara’s narrowed attention: salt taste before sound, starched lace thread-count before horizon. Spatial choreography is immaculate: Hiroshi emerges from mist, retreating again into it as she departs, the grove’s circumference mirrored by islet’s shoreline.

The final image—dawn through grimy windows, town breathing anew—is charged by the setting’s transformation from battleground to fragile sanctuary. Environment constrains and catalyzes choice throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.3)
    The shadowed nexus isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choices: narrowing vaults, predatory ceilings, starlight fracturing. The church organ and compass point function as micro-settings that constrain tactics (sound triggers mutiny; compass anchors chaos). Final image of starlight softening charges the closure with earned calm. Every sensory detail serves tension or theme without tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.0)
    The quarry isn’t backdrop—it pressures choices: mist limits sight, slick stone demands precision, flooded basin hides the body. The lancet and ribbon function as micro-settings that constrain and charge the climax. Sensory detail is selective (cold stone, velvet texture, ruby blood) and filtered through Elara’s tactile, posture-based perception. Final image (“mist parting”) reconfigures the opening’s “furrowed hush,” proving environment shapes closure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.3)
    The “spongey dread” atmosphere permeates every sensory detail—the weeping walls, squelching floors, fog-dampened glasses—and directly constrains Elara’s actions (e.g., salvaging waterlogged journals). The experimental station functions as micro-setting: its buckled dome, archive glow, and command vault shape access to truth and confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.3)
    The mountain pullout isn’t backdrop but active micro-setting: gravel, shale, skeletal scaffolding, and translucent wrap directly enable plot (flake discovery, map decoding). Weather and light (“luminous haze,” “gilding aspens”) filter through the fiddler’s perceptual bias, narrowing focus to glints and flutters under grief. The scaffold wrap’s materiality constrains the revelation—it must flutter to map the path—and charges the final image as “applause from the ether.” Every detail serves pressure or closure, avoiding tourist cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned circus train is vividly rendered and functions as micro-setting: its decay mirrors Elias’s arc, and its spatial features (lion-tamer’s car, perimeter) directly shape negotiation and defense tactics. Light, weather, and debris are filtered through POV perception and modulate with emotional beats. The recurring hoops charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate—but the setting doesn’t *constrain* a pivotal choice (e.g., no tactical use of train layout during Raoul’s raid), capping just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    The observatory functions as micro-setting: brass instruments, stone walls, and cliffside slits constrain and reflect action. Sensory detail is vivid yet selective—wind through pines, roseate dawn on brass—and filtered through Thorne’s professional attention.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.3)
    The skyborne grotto under aurora isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains choice: the aurora’s dance measures time, static hum enables pattern-finding, and crystalline shrouds are sourced from the environment. The emerald chip, alabaster slab, and frozen dew needle function as micro-settings that directly shape tactics and charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposefully narrowed under pressure (e.g., “faint crackles… like distant thunder trapped in crystal”) and filtered through Lirien’s professional perception. Every atmospheric element tightens the dominant stake: capturing sparks before oblivion.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.3)
    The umbral grotto isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains choice: clouds isolate, vines tangle thought, and the oak’s height enables revelation. The hairpin (micro-setting) charges the climax, its filigree echoing grove motifs. Sensory detail is selective (wind in hair, cool silver, whispering leaves) and POV-filtered, avoiding tourist cataloging. Crucially, the setting evolves—wilted flower → vibrant bloom—and directly enables the final scalloping that rebirths the grove.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lighthouse isn’t backdrop—it’s a crucible. Salt-streaked panes, spiral stairs, and suspended chimes directly shape action: the shard projects light onto chimes; the cloak hangs by the lens; the circular walls “protect” vulnerability. Crucially, the hollow mirror shard functions as micro-setting—its concave emptiness constrains Alex’s self-perception and charges the final image when it clatters away. Every sensory detail (wind-whipped words, bone/crystal/iron chimes) serves the theme without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating basalt platform, luminous moss, and magnetic grotto are vividly rendered and filter through Elara’s urgency. Crucially, the pond’s reflective surface constrains the method—truth emerges only via ripples distorting the grotto’s image—and charges the final image. Spatial choreography (platform, pond, grotto) remains coherent. Yet the setting doesn’t *force* a costly action; it illustrates rather than pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.3)
    The canyon of bone towers and endless echoes isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting. Bone ledges supply skimming stones; dust layers memory; echoes amplify harmonics. The obsidian arrowhead gleams “unnaturally sharp” against this desiccated world, its pulse contrasting the canyon’s decay.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cave mouth, tidal chamber, and cable nexus function as micro-settings that actively constrain choice: narrow passages force bodily contortion, rising water tightens time, and the codex enables phase-shifting through walls. Sensory detail is selective and crisis-filtered—bioluminescent kelp marks paths, brine slicks rope, fluorescent tubes flicker erratically. The environment charges the final image: open air contrasts the “ethereal squeeze,” making closure tactile. Only misses 9+ because the facility’s spatial logic isn’t fully choreographed during phasing.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.3)
    The opal observatory is not backdrop but active micro-setting: its residual energies enable the ghost, its frosted glass conducts Elara’s touch, its cracked screens frame the defragmentation, and its snow-buried domes externalize her isolation. The recurring objects—porcelain shard, ink, opal light—constrain choices (ink must be spilled; shard must anchor patterns) and directly charge the final image (stained shard catching refractions = reformed identity). Sensory detail is selective (cold, static roar, pulse of opal) and filtered through Elara’s trauma, avoiding tourist cataloging. The setting’s rules remain consistent and are learned through action, not exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.6)
    The bone towers, tunnel of echoes, and flawed diamond aren’t backdrop—they actively constrain and enable. Thorne must climb to the tunnel; the diamond’s fracture aligns with linguistic imperfection; bird shadows modulate entrance acoustics. Sensory specificity (grit→bass, silk→harmonics) emerges from setting logic, not checklist. Final image—wanderers hearing texture through sound—is charged by the very environment that threatened erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.3)

    The scientific poetry library functions as both macro- and micro-setting: its shelves of “quantum sonnets” establish rules, while the worn oak desk, pseudospherical model, and tattered silk constrain Eliza’s actions. The scarf itself becomes a tactile setting—its folds resist Euclidean logic, forcing embodied negotiation. Crucially, the environment charges the final image: Eliza slips the warmed scarf around her neck, its “reawakened” presence merging setting and character. Every sensory detail (whispered spines, chalk on silk, crimson/azure blooms) serves the central stake without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse apex, driftwood-bound book, and antique camera function as micro-settings that constrain choice (e.g., positioning at dawn, film exposure limits). The archipelago’s “whispers” evolve from atmospheric motif to active pressure (“urging her to persist”). Sensory detail is selective—salt-laced winds, glowing paints—but avoids checklist overload. However, the setting never *forces* a tactical pivot beyond enabling the method; it charges the ending but doesn’t narrow options under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)
    The “shadowed nexus under starlight” functions as a charged micro-setting: its ancient rune aligns with the first star, its anvil receives not metal but memory, and its pulsing shadows fold time—all directly enabling the locksmith’s method. The recurring objects (ribbon, lock of hair, starfire flame) constrain choices: only here can fear be unbound. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (scent of memories, strands like moonlight), filtered through the characters’ yearning. However, it stops just short of 9+ because the setting doesn’t *foreclose* an option—it facilitates rather than pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.3)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse—ringed by shipwrecks, half-submerged, glass dome cracked—functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains choice: Elias must wade, kneel in silt, and align celestial fragments through warped panes.

    Setting functions as micro-setting: the sky gondola, brass telescope, and clouds actively constrain and charge choices. The telescope warms in his palms, enabling observation; the gondola’s drift forces engagement with voids; clouds become emotional landscapes that dictate his log entries. “Dusty starlight” evolves from ambiance to active agent—anointing, sifting, thickening—culminating in the final image where it charges the closure with spectral confetti and ghostly silhouettes.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.3)
    The tree trunk library functions as both macro- and micro-setting: its bark-lined shelves supply tools (mirrors, silver leaf), its knothole admits light, and its impending demolition tightens tactics. The hollow’s curvature shapes spatial choreography—Elara moves inward as pressure mounts. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: the fractal sky endures *within* the wood even as axes bite outside. Every sensory detail (groaning trunk, warped shelves, tarnished coin) filters through Elara’s tactile, non-facial POV.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    The antique airship functions as a potent micro-setting: its abandonment, creaking deck, and dust-caked planks directly enable the discovery and constrain Elara’s resources. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—swirling starlings, stranded luminance, frayed phrasebook—and filtered through her curious POV. The hopscotch board charges the final image by becoming both map and mechanism. Yet the setting doesn’t impose meaningful tactical limits beyond atmosphere; it facilitates rather than pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.1)
    The frozen library functions as both macro- and micro-setting: its ice-bound tomes, auroral light, and rime-crusted lectern directly pressure Elias’s search and discovery.

Starlight, brass binoculars, and the cuckoo weight are tactile, recurring details filtered through Elara’s librarian-astronomer POV. The setting evolves—from division under stars to unity on the bridge—and culminates in the orrery’s light bathing the new structure. However, occupational plausibility (librarian rigging cables) strains slightly, though not enough to break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    The moonlit canyon functions as a potent micro-setting: its silt buries rovers and dreams, its crevices pool unnatural light, and its winds whisper regrets—all directly enabling Elara’s excavation. The periscope mirror, as object-as-setting, constrains her actions (micron tilts) and charges the final image (fused to her palm). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, though over-reliance on visual fractals occasionally neglects other senses during peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.7)
    The serpentine grotto is vividly specific (“walls gleaming faintly under perpetual fog,” “crystals hung like inverted chandeliers”) and actively constrains Elara’s actions—gravity inversion enables access, mist swirls upward to signal the window. Sensory detail is filtered through her archival focus, avoiding tourist cataloguing. However, while the setting charges the climax, it doesn’t *foreclose* an option or impose a tangible tradeoff beyond time, missing the 9+ gate for environmental constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.1)
    The siskin alder grove isn’t backdrop but active collaborator: moss-draped trunks supply the forgotten sculpture, roots cradle the insulator, and branches sway in empathic unison.

No white-room syndrome; every detail serves pressure or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    The amber pavilion, skeletal vines, and swirling leaves are vividly selective and emotionally resonant, avoiding generic autumn clichés through tactile specificity (“latticed walls draped in golden foliage,” “steam carrying notes of clove”). The setting actively charges the closure: dawn gilding the vines mirrors Elena’s internal shift. However, the environment doesn’t constrain choices—Elena could’ve walked elsewhere, and the pavilion offers refuge without consequence. Still, sensory hierarchy aligns with POV urgency, and spatial choreography remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting is masterfully integrated: the murmuring pavilion, whisperfield calm, and kinetic parapet aren’t backdrop but active constraints. The parapet demands peripheral awareness; the pavilion’s hum syncs with the rite; dunes part only under proper attention. Final image charges the setting—the parapet now veined with luminous remnants, humming in vigil. Every sensory detail serves the central concept without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lavender field and rusted factory form a micro-setting that actively charges the final image: vines climb “audibly” as witnesses, lavender scent veils “earth’s old wounds,” and concrete cracks birth defiant blooms. This environment constrains nothing tactically but emotionally frames transmutation—nature’s reclamation mirrors narrative healing. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (scent, hum, visual purple), filtered through Elara’s archival gaze. Yet it never forces a choice; it decorates rather than pressures, preventing 9+ despite lyrical strength.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.0)
    The shadowed library functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and charges every choice: dust-moted aisles frame isolation, shattered glass signals rupture, and the lectern scarred by generations becomes the altar for testimony. Dawn’s light evolves causally with Elowen’s arc—from pallid rays to full break—mirroring her movement from silence to speech. The crystal, as object-as-setting, reflects sonic history and enables the climax. Every sensory detail serves pressure or closure without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.4)
    The fog sculpture garden isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and resource: driftwood becomes markers, VCR giants orient vision, vinyl-bone spars emit the target sound. Every sensory detail (magnetic whispers, salt-bleached grain, rust weeping) filters through Elias’s tactile urgency. The setting charges the final image: chalk runes pulse, cassette shells bloom as decayed petals, fog recedes only after capture. Environment directly enables and shapes the protagonist’s method and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.1)
    The lunar observatory functions as a charged micro-setting: its dome vibrates during quakes, hydroponic trays rattle, and viewports buckle—all constraining Elias’s actions. The bonsai and chronometer are tactile extensions of setting that directly shape tactics. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (papery sigh of leaf, stars smearing like tears), filtered through Elias’s professional perception. Final image of the observatory “gleaming eternal” gains weight because environment actively pressured every key choice.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “radiant haven above the clouds” functions as micro-setting that charges the closure: its ethereal light frames the final embrace and departure. Sensory specificity (rainbows on vinyl edges, wildflower vial, whispering winds) is vivid and filtered through Elara’s professional attention. Spatial choreography remains coherent—glass door chime, kneeling, stepping into shadows. However, the setting doesn’t constrain choices; it decorates them. For 9+ eligibility, environment must alter tactics, which it doesn’t—hence capped below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    The observatory isn’t backdrop—it supplies star-ink, levitation-crystal winds, and brass telescopes that contrast Elara’s true focus. The floating isle’s perpetual twilight and crystal spires directly enable the shadow-vault premise. Crucially, the pedestal and key function as micro-settings that constrain choice: only by aligning spirals can loops close. Final image charges the setting—the dome projects the rune-map, making environment active in revelation, not passive spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    The secret garden functions as micro-setting: its roses, sundial, and dew constrain Elara’s ritual and charge the closure. Sensory detail (honeysuckle, chime of bells, iridescent enamel) is selective and POV-filtered through a bone-setter’s tactile attention. The hedge maze’s whispering boxwood mirrors internal tension without overt symbolism. Final image of fused tooth on marble bench ties environment to thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    The serpentine grotto functions as a micro-setting that actively supplies abrasive sands and seawater—essential tools for gem polishing—and its dome frames the sky, directly enabling Elara’s star-watching. Sensory detail is selective (salt-kissed mist, cool glass, rhythmic lap) and filtered through her longing. The environment charges the final image: light blooms “without a single spark” because the grotto forbade fire. However, the setting doesn’t *constrain* a pivotal choice—it facilitates, which narrowly misses the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.1)
    The abandoned data center turned moss garden is not backdrop but crucible: silicon bones claimed by moss, skylights fracturing light, concrete shaped by thawing icicles—all constrain and charge character choices. The setting actively enables the story’s logic (the icicle message only works here) and culminates in the amber pendant glowing against ruin. Sensory detail is selective, tactile, and filtered through Elara’s watchful dreamer POV. This environment irreplaceably shapes the final image and thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    The feral nexus functions as a charged micro-setting: mist, dripping leaves, and swirling winds actively pressure Elias’s vigil, while the seashell fragment serves as a tactile anchor that constrains choice (used ritually to “solemnize” each hope). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—Elias notices owl calls and pearly whorls because they mirror his fractured yet luminous state. The final image (“manuscript alive in his hands”) is charged by the setting’s earlier textures. Only minor deduction for slight overreliance on visual metaphor in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.0)
    The verdant arbor functions as micro-setting and crucible: its heartwood yields the vine tendril, its hush amplifies song, and its thickening vines signal healing. Sensory detail is selective (amber moonlight, beetle-wing gears, thistledown voice) and filtered through Elowen’s whimsical perception. Crucially, the setting constrains choice—the loom must be woven at dawn during lunar alignment—and charges the final image as vines “promise endless green.” No white-room syndrome; every leaf serves pressure or payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.3)
    The withered orchard functions as micro-setting: skeletal trees, frost-cracked roots, and auroras directly supply materials (bones, cans, branches) and atmospheric pressure that shape Lir’s tactics. Brass plate warms “as if recognizing kin,” tying object to environment. Final image—dawn climb from crater depths—is charged by the setting’s transformation from decay to departure. Sensory detail is selective (hoarfrost, emerald auroras, wind-whipped ice) and filtered through Lir’s grief-bound attention.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.3)
    The marble cavern functions as micro-setting and active constraint: its quartz veins amplify echoes, its curves dictate rebound angles, its phosphorescent fungi warp nocturnal refractions. Every sensory detail serves Elias’s method—dust motes as spectral chaff, frost-veined leaves echoing the season’s wound. The environment directly charges the final image: “manifold reflection” in polished walls merges setting and self. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent across time shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.4)
    The bronze grotto functions as both macro- and micro-setting: its metallic veins refract starlight to enable calcification, directly constraining the method and charging the final image.

The kerosene lamp and whalebone reverie are tactile anchors that evolve with pressure. Every atmospheric element serves the central action, fulfilling the 9+ gate by constraining choice and shaping closure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.3)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: its amber light dictates carving conditions, rain patters rhythm for focus, and circus relics (posters, trophies) pressure Elara’s ritual. Tools (chisel, ash blank) are handled with tactile specificity, their history altering tactics (Theo’s smoothed handles guide her cuts). Final image charges the setting—the rust-hued peace seals her motive as wood blushes in skylight glow. Environment, tool, and body cohere to shape the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    The kinetic lagoon isn’t backdrop—it’s active pressure: its stillness deepens as Elias collects stories, its vapors coil between him and his ghost, its waters “poised for the next halt” while he descends. The disposable camera wheel functions as micro-setting: plastic teeth click like metronomes, warm as flesh, constraining how truth is gathered. Every sensory detail (cloud-chill, carousel dust, viscous waters) filters through Elias’s scavenger perception, never tourist catalog. Final image reweights the lagoon from trap to witness.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.3)
    The abandoned terminal functions as active micro-setting: bulkheads whisper stress fractures, skylights align stellar inputs, conduits “snake like veins.” Every spatial detail constrains or enables Elara’s choices—e.g., rooftop collectors feed gravity-fed water loops. The sextant’s celestial arc charges the final image by aligning Polaris through a “cracked dome,” fusing tool, body, and environment.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.3)
    The “soundless sanctuary” and “crystal whispering forecourt” function as active micro-settings: the hush constrains Elias’s tolerance for sound, while the rain-lubricated crystals enable the music box’s revival.

The environment doesn’t just reflect but catalyzes transformation, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.4)
    The twilight barge canal functions as both setting and micro-setting: its mist, mudflats, and glassy flow directly constrain Elias’s actions (e.g., sinking boots, obscured wreckage) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—Elias notices ripples, static hum, groaning timbers—not as catalog but as diagnostic cues. The sundial’s shadow interacting with dying light ties environment to theme. Every atmospheric element serves pressure or perception, never stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    The golden dock, snow, and fog aren’t backdrop—they shape action: snow melts on Elias’s skin during decoding; fog enshrouds the world, narrowing focus to rope and glass; the dock’s creak underscores fragility. The fulgurite and rope function as micro-settings that constrain choice (only through glass can patterns be seen). Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias’s botanical attention: salt-crusted pods, barnacled pilings, fog-beaded whiskers—all filtered through his profession.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.4)
    The shadowed autumn garden isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting that constrains and enables: leaf litter hides the thread, crumbling benches anchor ritual, thorny rose hips impede movement, and moonlight silvering charges the final image. Sensory detail (damp soil, fading jasmine, crunching gravel) is filtered through Elias’s melancholic attention, avoiding tourist cataloging. The thread itself functions as object-as-setting, its texture and glow guiding choices. Every atmospheric detail serves the Accumulative lens, culminating in the garden becoming “a living obituary”—a final image where environment fully embodies theme.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.0)
    The suspended palace isn’t backdrop but active constraint: stalactites groan in sympathy, fungi provide only “quivering light,” and mechanical clamor below opposes organic rebirth. The eggshell’s opalescence and the chick’s patchy feathers charge the final image, while spatial choreography (kneeling in chamber, retrieving from alcove) remains coherent. Crucially, the setting shapes tactics—scavenged vault fragments are the only available materials—and directly pressures the climax when stalactites crack in jealous fury.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.3)
    The obsidian lagoon isn’t backdrop—it supplies black sand for drainage, obsidian shards echo blades, and kelp mirrors Lira’s peace. Every sensory detail serves the grafting act: volcanic grit aids regeneration; diffused light enables precision; dune scars frame her mission. The setting constrains choice (only here can she heal what her father burned) and charges closure—the lagoon’s “kelp-drift peace” enfolds her as harmony replaces shadow. Micro-setting (the graft site) functions as crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting isn’t backdrop but active constraint: dry basins limit water-based solutions, moss-cracked marble slows movement, and celestial mosaics guide Elara’s star-aligned patience. Each fountain functions as a micro-setting that supplies resources (feather, condensation, key) tied to memory retrieval. The final image—fountains gurgling anew—charges the closure by transforming environment from tomb to conduit. Sensory detail is selective, tactile, and POV-filtered, avoiding white-room syndrome or generic autumn clichés.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.4)
    The greenhouse functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and charges choices: its fractured glass, mossy floor, fountain, and alcoves are tied to specific memories and poems. Sensory detail is purposeful—humid air thick with nectar, wings humming “thundering calm”—filtered through Elias’s carver’s attention. The setting evolves with the migration and directly shapes the climax: the plague-loss knot is discovered *because* of the greenhouse’s spatial history. Final image (“butterflies departing like souls released”) reweights the space as a cathedral of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.3)
    The tidal obsidian ridge functions as both macro-setting and micro-setting: its slick black stone constrains Elias’s ascent, and its volcanic fire metaphorically ignites the rake handle’s inscriptions. The pendulum chamber’s oil-and-salt air and brass gleam are filtered through Elias’s professional attention, avoiding tourist description. Crucially, the setting charges the final image—the waves now “caressing rather than clawing”—directly reflecting Elias’s internal shift. Every environmental detail serves pressure, perception, or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.3)
    The cobalt silo, sovereign case, and frayed tapestry function as micro-settings that actively constrain and charge choices—Elias decodes threads *because* they’re housed in the silo, under starlight filtering through its cracks. Sensory detail is selective (dust-moted starlight, brass cool against palms) and filtered through a gardener’s tactile precision. The environment culminates in the final image: refolding the border into the case inside the silo, now sanctified by revelation. Every object earns its place through causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.0)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake aren’t backdrop but active constraints: the spire’s facets refract auroras into data, the ice’s groans signal systemic collapse, and the lake’s geothermal vents enable Elias’s work. The kingfisher quill, mineral ink, and astrolabe-lantern are tactile tools that shape decisions. Crucially, the setting charges the final image—the blank vellum poised beneath the quill embodies the threshold between stasis and change. Every detail serves pressure or possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ember alcove functions as micro-setting: embers provide light for copying, mist enables concealment, and stone cracks admit both fog and narrative possibility.

The setting constrains tactics (broadcast timing, cloaking method) and directly enables the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.3)
    The Vanishing Point Gallery isn’t backdrop—it actively shapes meaning: walls “taper into illusory depths,” perspective “tricks the eye,” and the vanishing point swallows ash into “nothingness—or infinity.” Key objects function as micro-setting: the porcelain mask catches light like “fractured memories,” the rocking chair’s gears protest then fall silent, and charcoal becomes both medium and relic. Every sensory detail (scent of scorched paper, tinkling shards, creaking oak) serves theme and closure. The gallery’s deceit mirrors Elias’s selective portraiture, making environment indispensable to final image.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.3)
    The sunken city functions as micro-setting: sewer conduits, bioluminescent fungi, and sedimentary layers directly constrain Elias’s choices (he must dig, sift, risk ascent). Sensory detail is purposeful—slime-slick walls, black plague ash, primordial ooze—and filtered through his obsessive POV. The chronometer cog and ruins evolve causally: unearthed → doubted → fused → weaponized. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: the ticking cog in a drowned world embodies defiance against erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.0)
    The velvet library, autumn light, and zither function as a fused micro-setting that constrains choice: Elara uses the rosette’s spiral to trace progress, and the room’s plush hush forces vocal confrontation. Sensory detail (amber light on abalone, wind howling preludes) is filtered through Elara’s musician POV, avoiding tourist catalog. The setting charges the final image—the rosette as “talisman against oblivion”—and spatial choreography (choir encircling her) remains coherent despite multiple characters.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.3)
    The rusted greenhouse isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and enables: its decay demands pruning, its hidden soil receives the seed, its celestial-filtering panes make the alignment actionable. The shears, dew-slick leaves, and iridescent veins all function as micro-settings that shape choice. Sensory detail is purposeful (humming vines, bitter tang of eviction) and filtered through Elias’s chef-perception. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: the shoot’s emergence *in this ruin* embodies the story’s core thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    The “lightning collection tower” functions as micro-setting: its spires, apex, and spiral stairs directly constrain access and tactics. “Nectar dusk” isn’t backdrop—it modulates perception (“painting her face in amber”) and charges the final image (“electric honey”). The lacquer box and matchbox act as tactile extensions of setting, their textures (“black sheen mirroring dying light,” “striker worn from old fires”) grounding magic in physicality. Every sensory detail serves pressure or closure—no white-room syndrome, no tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.1)
    The quiet bay functions as a micro-setting that actively supplies resources (displaced objects) and constrains tactics—Elias can only sanctify what the tide or gardens yield. Spring’s cherry blossoms, violet hush, and salt air aren’t backdrop but sensory filters that shape perception and ritual. The perfumer’s orris root shard and recurring streetlights charge the final image, embodying the “hushed blaze.” Every atmospheric detail serves the central stake: aliveness as shared silence.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.6)
    The underwater garden isn’t backdrop but active crucible: coral-crusted arches frame moral decay, weeping fountains mirror grief, and kelp stirs only when truth surfaces. Crucially, the ampoule’s location and Thalor’s chest-fissure are spatially precise, enabling the threading action. Final image charges setting—“lifeless relics found voice”—as environment responds to thematic shift. Every sensory detail (bioluminescent pulses, moss-webbed hands) serves character pressure or closure resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.1)
    The infinite staircase functions as micro-setting and constraint: its frictionless, helical geometry directly shapes Elias’s mathematical tactics and enables his perpetual motion model. The ethereal paper conjured from stair-glow and the dice’s physical asymmetry are tools that charge the final image—especially the chipped die trailing “sparks of captured regret.” Sensory detail is selective (visual glow, tactile chip, auditory hum of symbols) and filtered through Elias’s obsessive focus. The setting evolves causally: steps blur into a “golden mean helix” as his proof intensifies, then buckle at rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.1)
    The rooftop greenhouse functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and enables: its glass panes become canvases, its plants yield ink, its height isolates yet connects Elias to the city. Smog and moonlight aren’t backdrop but active forces—smog obscures, moonlight activates the brush. The final image charges the setting: symbols pulse on panes, rousing strangers below. Every detail serves theme and tactic, avoiding white-room syndrome or generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.1)
    The grotto city, Veilfall, and ice walls aren’t backdrop—they actively constrain choice: fissures limit vision, floodwaters force evacuation, bioluminescent fungi dictate museum tours. The emerald lens functions as micro-setting, altering perception and inspiring the ‘V’ loaf’s curve. Final image of Veilfall as “guardian of ghosts” charges closure with environmental resonance. Sensory detail (rosewater dread, peat-fueled ovens) is selective, POV-filtered, and woven into action without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse, hunger stone, and low tide are not backdrop but active constraints: the stone’s exposure dictates timing, the lighthouse supplies tools and final stage, and tide governs urgency. Sensory detail is selective (“sickly green glow seeping like bile,” “boots crunching shells”) and filtered through Elias’s inventive perception. The setting charges the climax—smashing the yoyo into the lens only works because of the lighthouse’s architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    The funhouse setting is vividly rendered and actively constrains choice—mirrors reflect and amplify Fear, glass promises secrets, the booth houses the dictionary. Sensory detail (moldy cotton candy, mercury tears) is selective and POV-filtered. The opera clasp functions as micro-setting, anchoring ritual and reappearing charged at closure. However, spatial choreography occasionally blurs (e.g., exact mirror chamber layout), slightly diluting tactical clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.3)
    The orchard-on-driftwood setting actively supplies resources (logs for xylophone, ropes for strings) and constrains tactics (circular fragility dictates defensive harmony). The whalebone mallet, salt-rimed tattoos, and bruised apples are micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—sound dominates during crisis, aligning with POV priority. The blue hour’s light refracts through sapphire shards, grounding abstraction in concrete atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    The floating island tea garden isn’t backdrop—it supplies dream-quartz gems, thermal updrafts that lift Elar while grief drags him down, and camellias whose iridescent dew mirrors his tears. The glass basilica functions as both setting and tool: its panes project dreams and resonate with folded cranes. Every environmental detail constrains or enables action (e.g., staircase’s paradoxical helix shapes ascent/descent). Final image—stars revealed as “Lira’s cranes wheeling eternal”—charges closure with transformed setting.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    The floating observatory functions as a potent micro-setting: its altitude, isolation, and failing systems directly pressure choices (e.g., ten-minute window). The geode crystal—cool, mist-like, intangibly tangible—constrains and enables action, culminating in its fusion with the energy pool. Sensory detail is selective and urgent: recycled air, thrumming coils, roiling haze. Final image charges the crystal as both tool and heart-echo, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.3)
    “Brilliant dimness” isn’t just mood—it’s a functional micro-setting that evolves with the plot: dusk enables star trails, lanterns reveal glyphs, slits frame celestial data. The observatory’s brass instruments, cobwebbed gears, and cracked dome constrain choices (e.g., requiring drones to capture trails). The type foundry chip pulses in this light, and the final anomaly appears only because drones map the dim sky. Setting actively shapes every key beat and charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cobalt terrace and forgotten shore aren’t backdrop but active micro-settings: the terrace’s height frames judgment, the shore’s driftwood carvings constrain Elias’s knowledge and force confrontation. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—brine, decay, cool stone—filtered through his guilt. The recurring watch hand and carved noose charge the final image, fulfilling the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains coherent as he descends, kneels, sifts, and returns, each movement tethered to emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    The storm-worn parapet isn’t backdrop but active crucible: wind howls “impartial judgments,” mist veils intentions, slick stones threaten footing—all heightening tension and forcing deliberate movement. Crucially, the setting constrains choice: neutral territory enables trust; the lunar phase visible through thinning mist times the release. The drawer pull functions as micro-setting, its phases guiding action. Sensory detail (mist beading like “unshed tears,” groaning stones) is filtered through Elara’s anxious focus, avoiding tourist cataloging. Only slight overreliance on visual/weather motifs prevents a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    The coastal kayak launch, utility poles, and bruised-orange waves aren’t backdrop—they actively constrain and charge choices: poles become navigational aids, the shattered compass a talisman, the inlet a magnetic pull. Sensory detail is selective and urgent (salt-laced wind, icy water flooding his lap, insulator gleam), filtered through Elias’s professional bias as a former navigator. The final image—beaching under a pinpoint star aligned with the eighteenth pole—fuses environment, object, and closure into a single resonant unit. This micro-setting functions as both physical and symbolic terrain, fully satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is masterfully integrated: the bioluminescent lake isn’t backdrop but active crucible—its glowing paths manifest choices, directly shaping the climax. The baseball (“delicately robust”) and newspapers function as micro-settings that constrain tactics (navigation via obits) and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective (pulsing fungi, azure waters) and filtered through Jax’s jaded wonder. Crucially, the environment enables the thematic turn—without the lake’s illusions, empathy couldn’t be kindled visually.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    The orchard is vividly rendered—silver leaves, glowing fruit, nocturnal blooms—and actively supplies key resources (spices from ash, saffron, void-pepper). Setting constrains and enables: the phoenix tree is the ritual site, moonlight the constant witness. However, spatial choreography falters during metamorphosis—beasts circle “protectively” but never interact meaningfully with Elara’s transformation. Final image charges the setting: petals unfurling in witness earns high marks, though environmental causality remains decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    The midnight glade functions as micro-setting: its root-woven altar, starry moss, and perfumed vapors directly enable Lirien’s ritual and constrain her choices (e.g., spreading the cloth *here*, not elsewhere). The body (postpartum exhaustion), tools (onyx vial, cards), and recurring objects (saucer, tablecloth) all charge the final image—time’s accumulation in intimate relics. Sensory detail is selective and pressure-driven: cool air “knifing,” mist “tasting of milk-warm dawns.” The setting evolves causally—from choking to forgiving—as Lirien’s stance shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    The recycled spaceship functions as a potent micro-setting: its hull of melted battlecruisers and corridors lined with faded photos directly supply resources (tear-shimmers) and pressure (ghostly solitude). The Kwan Yin tear and photographs aren’t just backdrop—they constrain tactics (portal activation method) and charge the final image (tapestry woven from spectral ink of dried tears). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara’s grief. However, spatial choreography lacks tactile specificity during the stitching sequence, slightly muting environmental constraint at peak action.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.1)
    The black sand beach isn’t backdrop but crucible: its obsidian grains “hummed with latent fire,” directly charging the final image where transformation feels “gritty as black sand yet luminous as bug-light.” Setting constrains choice—fog forces the lava-cliff detour—and supplies resources (bioluminescent plankton mirroring stars) that amplify the bugs’ release. Sensory detail is filtered through Elias’s poetic perception (“waves lapped in murmurs,” “velvet breath” hush), avoiding tourist cataloging. The volcano’s “heartbeat” glow and harmless ember rain show environment evolving causally with plot, not statically repeating.

    The luminous fort isn’t backdrop—it constrains choice: phosphor veins power rebellion; the sundial’s location and state enable coded communication. Tools (quill holder) and micro-setting (eastern garden stone) are tactile and consequential. Sensory detail is selective (cool stone, blue spark) and filtered through Elara’s vigilance. Final image of “patches” of light recharges the setting as a site of resistance, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

    The tidal bluff under aurora functions as active micro-setting: frictionless stone dictates movement, tides govern dust collection, and auroral light guides geometry. Every sensory detail (eel ink, humming rocks, star-dust slurry) constrains Kael’s tactics or charges the climax. The environment culminates in the mandala’s glow, making the setting inseparable from resolution. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains precise throughout.

    The stormlit observatory functions as both macro- and micro-setting: cracked panes admit revelation, the telescope reframes storms as maps, and the scarred table anchors illicit history. Weather, altitude, and spatial choreography (spiral stairs, dome apex) directly shape Elias’s choices and final descent. The setting charges the closure—dawn piercing clouds mirrors his clarified mission.

    The glass atrium, brook, and half-painted sundial form a micro-setting that actively constrains and charges choices: fractured light guides bladeplay, the brook’s murmur contrasts “dignified chaos,” and the sundial’s coded angles directly enable the plot-turn. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—Elias notices runes, prismatic fractures, flaking paint—never tourist-like. The setting evolves causally (rain amplifies fencing frenzy; mist veils the climax), and the final image of the sundial “pointing true north” reweights the entire environment as a compass for their new alliance.

    The rusted library under stars isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and enables: holes admit starlight for work, cracks host seeds, fallen beams hide tins. Every sensory detail (mildew-blooming Rilke, damp iron thrillers) reflects Elias’s poetic perception and urgency. The setting charges the final image: sprouts piercing concrete literalize “blooming resistance.” No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent amid decay.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.3)
    The Tidal Arbor isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures every choice: tidal surges threaten life, prism-leaves enable navigation, bark platforms defy gravity. Key objects function as micro-settings: the piano keys become tools, the clock centers the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful (briny gusts, shimmering foam) and filtered through Elias’s musician POV. The refuge’s flowers pulsing to “imagined rhythms” directly charge the closure, fulfilling the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ancient ridge functions as micro-setting: its carvings, soil, and blooms directly enable Elara’s ritual and charge the final image (“ridge in eternal bloom against the storm”). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—petrichor, humming orchids, golden haze—all tied to urgency. The knowledge fruit arbor emerges from this soil, making place causally active. Final bloom intensity reflects thematic victory, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    The breezy islet after rain functions as a charged micro-setting: mist, pebbled shore, and bonsai grove directly shape Elara’s actions (pruning, diffusing breath) and culminate in the final image where environment mirrors inner state. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—salt spray, glistening rocks, damp lace—but avoids over-description. The bonsai galleon and compass are environmental tools that constrain choice (she must prune to proceed). Yet the setting never imposes physical stakes beyond mood, capping its pressure potential.
