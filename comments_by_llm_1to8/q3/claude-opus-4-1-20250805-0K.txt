  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.1)
    The greenhouse is vividly particularized (cracked glass, mud-caked benches, rot smell) and constrains Elena's choices by offering an alternative research site. Butterfly dust accumulation creates micro-environments that explain plant survival, directly shaping her documentation method. The damaged structure charges the final image when contractors arrive and find her notes predicting structural failures. Spatial choreography remains clear across visits, and sensory detail is purposeful rather than catalog-like.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    Canyon frost, charred paper, and the kiln environment are rendered with concrete sensory detail and constrain Marina's choices (she fled here for concealment, frost teaches her about safe transformation). The frost patterns at dawn directly charge the final image and her pivot to harmless luminescence. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the setting's isolation enables both the revelation and the staged-death conceit. Minor: the "vast darkness punctured by stars" leans slightly toward postcard phrasing, but the recurring ice-crystal motif and its linkage to glass structure elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    The winterglass conservatory is vivid and purposeful: transparent walls refracting aurora, thermal imaging system, frost vines responding to vibrations. The setting enables Mira's discovery (tuning fork against glass wall, plants visible through thermal camera) and charges the closure image (winterglass holding its breath, surfaces reflecting organism light). Sensory detail is filtered through her deaf POV (vibrations felt through the floor at 62 Hz, aurora as visual music). Micro-setting (tuning fork case, thermal monitor) constrains and enables her work throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.4)
    The underwater library is vividly rendered with coral columns, floating books, and translucent librarians, establishing strong atmosphere. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint; no environmental detail (pressure, breathable grief mechanics, spatial layout) forces a tactical choice or complicates Silas's work. The "broken lighthouse lens" object does shape the descent and final transformation, qualifying as micro-setting that charges the closure image, which lifts the score into mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.1)
    The terra-cotta arbor with its antique silver bell anchors the spatial and symbolic geography; the bell's nightly toll organizes time and choreography across the settlement. Sensory detail is selective—"weathered columns," "dark paths," "preserved plums"—and filtered through survival priorities. The arbor functions as a micro-setting that charges the final image (Marta standing beneath it at closure). Spatial choreography remains clear across the six-month ellipsis. The sanctions context is established but not developed through environmental constraint or evolving scarcity on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.1)
    The viaduct setting is vivid and specific: wisteria blooming only at twilight, arches, spatial choreography with the camera obscura. The camera itself functions as micro-setting, constraining Mae's perception and shaping her approach to the door. Sensory detail is filtered through her artist's attention (sparks, phosphorescence, "compressed starlight"). The setting meaningfully charges the final image—sparks trailing her footsteps—lifting the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.1)
    The living bridge garden with hyperbolic geometry and vine-woven walkways supplies vivid, purpose-driven detail. The halo fragment as micro-setting object constrains early perception (photographs, memories) and charges the final image through disintegration. Sensory selection is selective and atmospheric, filtered through Elara's designer perspective. The bridges "pulsing with accumulated decades" and moss-covered spans provide tactile, lived-in texture that supports the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.7)
    The redemption center is vividly seeded (dusty stuffed animals, ring toss games, old piano) and supplies resources that enable escape. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting constrains Marcus's movement (chains allow "just enough") and he harvests from specific carnival objects. However, the environment doesn't force a tactical choice or dilemma—it's a backdrop and a supply depot rather than an active pressure. The arrow's arrival through "a broken window" and the piano in "the corner" are functional but not charged with specificity that would push this into high-band territory.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sunken greenhouse, flooded orchard, shipwreck graveyard, and forge are vivid and purposeful, anchoring the story's sensory world. The aurora functions as both setting and perceptual cue, filtered through Elena's synesthesia. The forge constrains her process and the wrecked ships provide thematic resonance. Spatial choreography is clear: descent into the chamber, placement of prototype on anvil, hours at work. The micro-setting (forge surface, heating coils, oilcloth-wrapped notebooks) charges the final act, though the body itself could be more tactilely present during the climactic imprinting sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    The emerald-tiled station, moonlight, and golden-hour glow are vivid and purposeful. The jar of moonbeams functions as both tool and recurring anchor. Spatial choreography (stairs, platform, jade pillars) remains clear. The setting constrains Cassia's timing ("only minutes before the golden hour faded") and the moonbeam jar operates as a tactile, charged object that shapes her method, charging the final image with its pulse and silver patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned control room supplies concrete constraints: dead monitors become shelves, the emergency shutdown button anchors a sphere placement, melting ice tracks seasonal time. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The micro-setting of the control panel and torch workspace charges the final image by transforming authority-space into tender inquiry-space. Sensory detail (visible breath, dripping ice, blue torch flame) is selective and filtered through Marina's professional attention, avoiding catalog description.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.4)
    The rusted library under stars delivers vivid sensory anchors (chill metal, collapsed roof, stellar dust, rotting paper reek) and the setting's decay mirrors Marcus's fractured identity. The seashell functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image when made whole. However, spatial choreography falters: Jake "emerging from shadows" in a library filled with fallen shelves lacks clear staging, and the confrontation's physical blocking (how close, what obstacles) remains vague. The environment provides atmosphere but does not materially constrain the final choice—Marcus could enact the reversal sequence anywhere with the two shell halves.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    The storm-tossed ridge fort, crumbling battlements, and pebble-shore anchors are vivid and consistent. The booklet (flaking gold leaf, brittle pages) is handled twice and its physical state mirrors thematic decay. The fort's isolation and the storm's pauses create micro-setting pressure that constrains the oracle's vigil. Sensory detail is selective (waves, wind howling, purple-black sky) and filtered through the oracle's focus on the star, supporting the Accumulative lens without catalog clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frozen courtyard at twilight is vivid and sensory: "ice crystals catching the last amber rays," minus twelve Celsius, the ice violin "so pure it seemed to bend light." The violin's sublimation directly charges the final image, and the setting's repetitive circular path mirrors Seven's endless loops. Spatial choreography (mop bucket, bench, courtyard tiles) remains coherent. The micro-setting (the violin as object-setting) constrains the revelation and participates in closure, meeting the 9+ gate criterion for constraint/charge.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    The crystal whispering forecourt is vividly rendered with selective acoustic and visual detail (puddles as mirrors, quartz pillars singing with rain, mist on the lens). Micro-setting constrains the tone and charges the final image: acoustics amplify whispers into music, paralleling the thematic shift from silence to honesty. Spatial choreography is clear (Mira's approach, lens on ledge, hand-holding). Minor: the museum archive and board-meeting vents are referenced but not grounded enough to test the eavesdropping claim's plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    The garden maze is anchored early and constrains Marta's movement ("practiced ease," "heart," "entrance"). The spiral of training wires at the center functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: each loop commemorates a rebellion, and tomorrow's promised addition ties the ending to spatial memory. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("whispered secrets," "rustled behind her, a sound like laughter, like grief, like growth"), and the marbles in her apron pocket recur with tactile weight. The maze itself pressures the young woman's encounter at the threshold, framing departure and inheritance.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    The research station, xenobiology tanks, and magnetic nexus are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (amber glow, frost forming on glowing surfaces). The "magnetic nexus at twilight" constrains Ira's experiment window and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear. Cap applied at 7.0 per Q2 Orientation Test penalty, preventing higher band entry despite strong atmospheric work.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    The flooded pit with oil lanterns creates vivid, purposeful atmosphere that shapes Marcus's isolation and the acoustic transformation. Spatial choreography is clean (knee-deep, chest-deep progression) and the water functions as both constraint and instrument. The recurring floating violin case and dissolving program are tracked consistently. The setting directly enables the climactic moment where Marcus must stand chest-deep to finish the piece, demonstrating genuine environmental pressure on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mountain weather station constrains choice throughout: Mira's access to magnetometer readings enables her vigil, and the window margins literally house the hidden illustrations. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (thin alpine air, altitude sickness, particular weight of darkness at elevation). The aurora's descent and the flowers' bloom are spatially choreographed and charge the final image when Mira tapes her own drawing to the window. Micro-setting (supply closet sleeping, emergency rations, pencil on outdated forms) shows her occupying margins physically, not just conceptually.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tunnel functions as active constraint: sweating brick walls, "metal tombstones" of equipment, and the junction box behind which the valve wheel hides all shape Marcus's path and final choice. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("dust that hadn't stirred since...1982" anchors professional notice; "the tunnel's circulatory system" reflects his explorer's gaze). The micro-setting—valve wheel wedged behind rusted equipment—charges the closure image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from descent through curve to chamber to final ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The overgrown library supplies vivid, selective detail—vines through volumes, phosphorescent moss, books-to-mulch—that charges atmosphere and reflects the protagonist's acceptance of decay. The obsidian refuge and underground river constrain her spatial existence and prime the ending image. Sensory hierarchy (green darkness, water murmur, spore weight) filters through her contemplative stance without tourist cataloging. The library's transformation does not directly alter a peak choice, capping the score below 8.0, but the micro-setting (refuge, river, paper swan) charges the final paragraph's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sage Ridge is named and visually sketched (sage-covered hillside, shadow bands, eclipse watchers), and the eclipse itself provides atmospheric pressure. The flute functions as a micro-setting prop that constrains Elena's ritual choice. However, the ridge itself never supplies a resource or obstacle that alters tactics; it remains a stage rather than a participant. The "dreaming roots" motif recurs but operates metaphorically without on-page physical grounding or choice constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The silo is vividly particular: curved walls, spiral stairs, three levels, fireplace, grain-to-shelter-to-library history. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("bronze-quiet," "misting breath," "taste of old paper"). The tapestry fragment and half-burned diaries function as micro-setting objects that constrain Thrain's investigation and charge the closure image. Spatial choreography (third level fireplace, spiral descent) remains coherent. The silo's "walls dense with listening" directly shapes her perceptual gift and the ending reconfiguration, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrains choice or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.1)
    Skeleton Rock is vividly particular: smugglers, watered whiskey, the lighthouse beam's three-second rhythm, salt-stained windows. The beam's rhythm and the tavern's corner table anchor choices effectively. The lighthouse door standing open charges the final image and the microdot specs constrain Chen's perception throughout. Sensory hierarchy reflects Chen's professional filter (notation, morse code) and the setting supplies both resources and social context that pressure his orchestration.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cathedral's acoustics and dimensional anchor constrain Marcus's method (loop pedal requires resonance, the exact center-point is essential). Sensory hierarchy is consistent: Marcus notices frequencies and stone tensions, the woman's stillness as vacuum. The palette and loop pedal are handled objects that shape action. Spatial choreography is clear (altar, nave's center, footfalls placed for resonance). The dimensional anchor charges the final image ("held them both steady"), fulfilling the 9+ gate, but "dimensional anchor" itself remains under-defined—its mechanics are asserted rather than shown, a minor specificity gap.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.1)
    Glass spire and frozen lake are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (mirrored horizon, seam of light, frost in bones). The nautilus segment functions as micro-setting, handled twice and charging the final image. However, spatial choreography during the climax (fortune slips lifting, swirling) lacks concrete physics—how high, what triggers movement. The setting constrains perception and charges atmosphere but does not materially alter a tactical choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.1)
    The viaduct functions as active setting: bioluminescent moss, shifting glow from amber to green, procedural generation that responds to subconscious fears. The tablet's physical presence—"heavier than physics should allow," "runes burning cold"—constrains her movement (she must float to bear it). The final beat where she "touched down…no longer defying gravity" uses the viaduct's dissolution to charge closure. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting avoids postcard description and instead pressures her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cavern is vividly realized through its acoustics-as-vibration, and the phonograph setup at "the cavern's center, where generations of drum makers had tested their creations" grounds the action in lived history. Stone walls "remembering vibrations" and "frequencies she couldn't hear but could feel in her teeth, her ribs, her skull" create a strong sensory signature filtered through Lucia's deafness. The broken needle's physical details (copper wire, beeswax, fractured tip) constrain her method and return polished smooth at the end, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    The courtyard at dusk is rendered with purposeful sensory detail (amber light, fountain's edge, evening breeze) and the instruments function as micro-setting that charges the final image. The spatial anchors remain stable and the pigeon's presence on the fountain edge provides concrete staging. The courtyard's tranquility creates meaningful contrast with the revolutionary currents, and the setting constrains Elena's choices (establishing new monitoring stations "through the city's forgotten spaces"). Minor gap: the quarantine wall and abandoned sectors beyond remain somewhat abstract; a single concrete detail of the wall's proximity or the sectors' visible decay would have sharpened the world's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.1)
    The terra-cotta grotto is vividly anchored (amber glow, clay texture, vibrations) and recurs through the piece. However, it functions primarily as a backdrop for passive revelation rather than constraining Marcus's choices or altering tactics. The rope's texture is noted but does not shape action. Micro-setting qualifies (the rope, the wall) but lacks constraint or closure charge, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sunken greenhouse with seawater lapping at lower windows and shipwrecks providing percussion actively shapes the music's transformation. Spatial choreography is clear (ash-dusted doors, stone bench between apple trees, flooded foundation, broken roof). The setting constrains and enables: "The greenhouse captured their imperfect music and transformed it, the water below adding its own rhythm." The hearth's return for the bonfire at evening charges the closure by recalling tradition. Micro-setting (the bowl on the stone bench) becomes a vessel for community offerings, linking environment to stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    The amber grotto is vivid and functional: its walls transform at dusk, permeable "just enough to release what it had held," and static electricity mediates access. Sensory detail (burgundy streaks, crackling sparks, hair standing on end) is filtered through Vera's professional lens. The grotto constrains her work (time window, static discharge method) and appears in the final beat as she climbs the steps, but it does not charge the closure image with a new cost or realization—she simply leaves. Micro-setting (the petal, the carved steps) supports the action without becoming ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.1)
    The roofless library is vivid and specific, recurring at key beats (Margot's nightly visits, Martha's return, the final sorting scene under Orion). The harbor setting and Pier 47/74 detail anchor place. However, the library functions more as atmosphere than constraint—no choice hinges on its open-sky vulnerability or book placement. The locket and ledgers are handled physically, but environmental pressure on tactics remains modest. Sensory detail (symphony notes, breeze, starlight) supports tone without directing action.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.7)
    The crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, and crater lake supply vivid anchors and the marsh reeds function as Kira's tool across multiple beats, shaping her sculptures and the final collaborative act. Spatial choreography remains clear (crater edge, descent, cave behind waterfall) and the extinct languages filter through dialect without caricature. However, the setting never constrains a key choice—Kira's reed-weaving succeeds unimpeded by material limits or environmental friction—and the final image uses the arbor as symbolic backdrop rather than a resource that alters tactics or forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rooftop canals, upward water flow, and Morteus's body-as-architecture create a vivid, constraint-driven environment. The canal spiral around the giant's throat and the gap in his breathing function as physical gates that enable Marina's entry. The pendant and illustrations are handled tactilely (humming, fluttering, cracking) and constrain choices. Spatial choreography remains clear across vertical and interior transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cavern orchard is vivid and purposeful: dripping stalactites nourish apple trees, bioluminescent fungi spread as calculations, mineral deposits form the chipped mosaic pattern central to the puzzle. Sensory detail is selective and integrated (limestone-filtered water, eternal twilight, frequencies below hearing). The mosaic stepping stone constrains Morrow's choice—she must place the eyes "precisely where two specific chips intersected"—and charges the final image when she leaves them there. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    The crawl space between floors, the copper pipe, the ventilation grate, and the battery-powered reading light on twine all constrain Edgar's methods and charge the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through Edgar's long habitation: "old beams that had supported him for thirty-seven years," dust motes, the click of mechanical relays as sense memory. The library's physical architecture (pipe chases, floor gaps, stacks) enables his providential acts and shapes the archivist's search pattern. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mossy trellis, greenhouse, and rain-soaked gravel are rendered with selective, purpose-driven detail; water droplets and glowing moss charge the atmosphere and reflect the transformation underway. The linden leaf functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and constraining Marcus's final choice through its physical merger with his palm. Spatial choreography is clean (trellis entrance, greenhouse beyond, nursery interior). The storm season frames urgency and the moss's "ancient electricity" subtly mirrors the threshold logic, elevating setting's role in the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tidal causeway's twice-daily window and vanishing rain trails constrain Mara's approach and charge the closure image as the paths blur beneath her feet. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: barnacled stones, silver veins in the seabed, the jar's weight "impossibly light." The post-war setting (desalination towers, rationing stamps, acidic clouds) filters through Mara's artist lens without becoming a catalog. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from mainland to island edge to return crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    The singing crystal cave is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail: phosphorescent veins, bioluminescent minerals creating breathing shadows, the pearl's tooth-aching hum. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the cave's acoustics actively shape Vera's perception shifts. The environment constrains her gift (visions go blind) and provides the lens through which she learns to see differently. Setting details are filtered through her expanding awareness rather than offered as catalog, and the micro-setting of overlapping shadows becomes the mechanism of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ivory Harbor's salt-crusted surfaces, pearl-white towers, and rain-washed windows create vivid micro-setting that constrains Kessa's archival method—different light reveals different ink layers, directly shaping her staggered-interval approach. The herald's trumpet valve functions as charged object-as-setting, its corroded state reflecting the exile's duration and its whispered percussion becoming part of the archive's grammar. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Kessa's professional lens (ocean-spray patterns, water-marks as "ghostly images").

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "mist so dense it appeared solid," "stars burning through the haze with painful clarity," "street lamps that cast shadows in five directions." The ticket punch returns with purpose (marks maps, blazes cold, parts mist), charging the closure image as the tool of validation. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though "alleys that bent at impossible angles" and "districts that shouldn't connect" operate as atmospheric assertion rather than navigable space. The vault and fortress are described in abstract terms ("moments...conversations never finished") that sacrifice tangible constraint for thematic mood.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.9)
    The tower anchors location effectively (stone wall, cold, highest platform) and the clifftop setting supplies the whale songs as external pressure. The tile functions as a micro-setting object, warm despite the chill, and its shifting symbols guide Elena's work. However, the environment does not constrain a choice at a decisive moment—Elena's movements (pressing palm to wall, placing tile at workspace center, climbing to highest platform) are atmospheric rather than goal-narrowing. Sensory detail is selective but leans generic ("cold stone," "wind carried both whale songs and stellar silence") without character-specific filtering or spatial choreography that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prismatic escondite is vividly rendered ("light bent into impossible colors," "gravity obeyed suggestions") and the solar storm's magnetic fields enable the crew's approach, creating atmosphere and tactical constraint. Spatial choreography of the dimensional breach is coherent. The amulet fragment as micro-setting object charges the final image by fusing with its siblings, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. However, occupational detail (Consortium exile policy, interdimensional navigation) remains abstract; the "translucent barriers" and "crystalline walls" are described but never constrain a choice or impose cost.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prep room functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: steel counter, fluorescent light, formaldehyde air, and embalming tools anchor every beat and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("chemical-sweet air," "deathly vitality"). The vintage ink pot—small object as setting—recurs with reweighted meaning (mercury-like fluid → ashes). Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The room's transformation function (endings into beginnings) subtly mirrors thematic work without over-symbolizing.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bonsai labyrinth, fountain, and fluorescent lamp anchor the scene with vivid specificity. Sensory detail is purposeful: "twisted trunks," "water trickled over stones shaped like sleeping birds," "moss," and the lamp's hum all ground the ritual. The lamp's positioning and the fountain's spray matter to her method, constraining her technique. The mountaintop setting and the town's silence below frame the temporal boundary effectively, charging the final image of dawn breaking.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.1)
    The container labyrinth constrains Mari's navigation (sound-based pathfinding, tidal access windows) and charges the final image—Container 47-B becomes the physical site of erased testimony. Rust, tide rhythms, steel voices, and echo patterns are filtered through Mari's memory-texture perception, creating a sensory signature. The poison-bottle label functions as micro-setting (tactile anchor in pocket, "compass pointing toward memories"). Spatial choreography remains clear across the shifting maze, and the spring tide directly enables the climactic discovery. Environment shapes choice and amplifies the thematic resonance of permanence-as-rust.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    The abandoned observatory is vividly anchored—copper dome, rusted stairs, gaps in panels, dust motes—and the clifftop locale charges atmosphere. The cello and painted shell function as micro-setting objects that constrain the investigation and enable the final resonance. However, the observatory itself does not pressure Marina's choices; it remains backdrop rather than crucible. Spatial choreography is clear (bag set down, approach to cello, shell positioned at sound hole), and the setting's decay mirrors theme without forcing symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    The raft city is vividly rendered: perpetual carnival lights, recycled bottles, wave generators, fortune teller booths, oil-drum fires. Sensory detail is filtered through Maya's practiced ease and the community's lived-in textures. The foundation stone chip and the lighthouse replica constrain choices (communication tower, cornerstone). Spatial choreography across platforms remains clear throughout. The setting charges the final image (edge of floating world, mainland boats approach) and the carnival's perpetual motion mirrors resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.1)
    Tycho crater, the fissure, and the vacuum environment constrain Vera's final vigil: the ice pocket's exhaustion creates a temporal deadline, and the airless setting shapes her chemical timer innovation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "that peculiar silence more profound than Earth could ever know," vapor "like a ghost's breath, crystallizing instantly." The hourglass and camera function as micro-setting elements that charge the closure—tools that embody her mission and constrain her final choice to document rather than salvage. The lunar surface's permanence (boot prints lasting millennia) contrasts with humanity's impermanence, and this tension shapes the ending's melancholy without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mist-coated depot is vivid and purposeful, filtering perception through Maya's sensory method (water droplets, refracted light, vibration). Spatial choreography is clear: workbench, skylights, depot doorway, harbor view. The environment constrains Maya's repair technique positively (she needs the mist and light collectors), charging the final image when she stands in the depot doorway listening. Minor note: the rail depot's industrial chaos is declared but never pressures the quiet corner where she works.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frozen lake with pressure ridges, rusted outpost, and frost patterns are vivid and specific. The condensation on the window functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables Margot's key discovery, directly shaping the plot turn. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (window, desk, door, falcon perch). The setting charges the final image with "worrying tranquility" and "held breath," making the environment inseparable from the thematic question of buried potential.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.1)
    Cobblestones, fountain, archway, and bell towers recur with purposeful detail; the ebony tuning fork's "pure tone" constrains the bell tuner's diagnostic method. Spatial choreography (kneeling by fountain, marking spots with chalk, walking measured steps) remains clear. The archway's straightening and the fountain's return to flow tie setting transformation directly to closure, charging the final image when she touches the arch "one last time."

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    The underwater temple is vividly realized through spatial paradoxes ("corridors that spiraled into themselves"), bioluminescent light, and water-formed architecture. Setting constrains Maya's movement and supplies the compound vial as a live resource tied to her survival clock. The sanctum's "gossamer threads of experience" and the machine for capturing moments charge the final image, making environment integral to both tactics and closure. Minor slip: "diving mask" and "diving equipment" anchor sensory detail to professional context, but the compound's mechanics (inhaled through a mask?) and nitrogen narcosis as a specific threat for her colleagues but not Maya could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse prison, Devil's Tooth Reef, scuffed door, and confessional lattice anchor setting vividly. Copper light modulates through the piece, and the narrow door physically constrains Marcus's movement (he must hover through the widened gap). The lattice's shipwreck origin and maze-like shadows contribute to atmosphere. The sealed basement with wrapped bones charges the final stakes. Micro-setting (door scuffs, lattice) participates in the closure image when Marcus's words "hover-carve" into the wood, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    The alchemical greenhouse is vividly anchored (luminescent fruits, liquid mercury pools, phosphorescent leaves) and directly constrains the action: the bead's pulse triggers the "resonant awakening," the greenhouse trembles, and eternal night retreats. The eternal night and winter-cracked fields function as micro-setting that charges the final image—dawn breaking for the first time in three centuries. Sensory selection is filtered through Marlow's work (tapping bleeding trees, harvesting resin) and supports the closure beat when ordinary fruit replaces alchemical produce.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    The flooded labyrinth is vivid and specific: barnacles on petroglyphs, coral breathing air, salt-crusted succulents. Spatial choreography is clear (canyon walls, tide pools below, overlapping paths), and the red sandstone functions as both setting and conceptual anchor. The illustration plate and the nautilus-spiral path pattern lightly constrain her ritual, though the environment never forces a tactical choice or alters her route.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    The catacomb orchard is not mere backdrop: roots lifting tombs, pomegranates splitting against marble angels, and bees in the ossuary create tactile world logic that pressures Miriam's stance. The sundial base emerging "like a forgotten promise" and the grandmother's tomb with roots-as-pillars constrain her final choice to rebuild. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (excavation site, deeper grove, tomb chapel). Sensory detail is filtered through Miriam's POV bias (historian's recognition of the inscribed bronze, grandmother's role as "keeper of hours"). Gate met: environment constrains the choice to position the gnomon and charges the final image of olives ripening on branches "that had learned to grow through tombs."

    The golden arcade, brass fixtures, marble floor, and skylights are vividly rendered and filtered through Mira's professional focus. Spatial choreography (chalk sprawl visible from above, depot next door, entrance gate) remains coherent across the scene. The chalk and analog camera constrain her process, and the arcade's emptiness charges the final image of seed-carrying across the continent, lifting the score into the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt dome and eternal flame function as more than backdrop—the flame's "adjacent possibilities" mechanics enable her encoding method, and the observatory's status as trusted navigation hub makes her position plausible. Spatial choreography stays clear (work table, corridor, dome). Autumn light and rattling wind recur purposefully. Micro-setting strength: the needle, velvet, and flame serve as constraint-tools that shape her intelligence method. The eternal candle's properties (three-century burn, shadow-casting) constrain tactics and charge the final image of "threading one last secret."

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mangrove labyrinth—roots "like frozen screams," knee-deep water, mercury-pooled moonlight—is vivid and constrains movement (wading, circling spirits). The shard functions as micro-setting: its warmth pulses with heartbeat, it channels fear away from love, and it crumbles at closure, actively shaping the final image. Sensory detail is strong and filtered through urgency (moonlight, condensation, brackish air). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting and object together charge the ending, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.1)
    The atrium's mist, twilight glass, and automated rain anchor the scene and modulate with emotional beats (misters activate as darkness claims the space). The coral fragment acts as micro-setting, constraining Maya's final choice—she must decide whether to keep or release this salvaged anchor—and its ridges echo her scars, tying body to object. Spatial choreography is clean (patients wander, child approaches, others gather). One slip: "mist-dampened glass" in the coral moment slightly repeats the opening mist without adding new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ruined orchard district, fog, and studio-cave anchor place with consistent sensory detail (fog-dampened decay, twisted skeletons of wood). The fresco fragment recurs and charges the final image (glows faintly, held close). Micro-setting qualifies: the fragment constrains her initial touch and primes the daydream fold. Spatial choreography is clean (cave walls, palms, air shimmers). The fog functions as atmospheric constraint rather than tactical obstacle; it dampens souls but does not force a present choice on the page, keeping the setting in strong support rather than indispensable territory.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.1)
    The Sound Wave Garden's acoustic architecture is described in vivid but static terms ("surfaces designed to bend and reflect every whisper into a symphony") without showing how it constrains Elena's movement or choices during the restoration. The hobo nickel's shadow on the spiral triggers the sound shift, so the setting does participate in the turn, lifting it above ornamental. However, spatial choreography remains unclear—we never learn where Marcus stands, how close Elena is to the panels, or how the curved walls shape her access to the mural.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    The greenhouse environment actively constrains choices: insect wing-beats scramble scanners, creating the tactical space for the resistance. The maintenance tunnel and pneumatic mail system provide escape infrastructure that alters Serena's options. Sensory detail is purposeful—humid gleam, condensation-fogged glass, the cacophonous shield of white noise—and filtered through Marcus's professional attention. The seventeen community gardens function as micro-setting nodes that charge the closure image of distributed planting.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.1)
    The gargantuan shell functions as micro-setting and constraint: its acoustics transform broken voices, its pinholes cast new constellations from damage, its chambers grow crystallized music. These details recur and charge the final image ("still spirals, still breathes"). The galaxy postcard also acts as anchoring object. Sensory selection is purposeful (mother-of-pearl pulse, charcoal on walls, reef-shadow twilight) and filtered through the poet's priorities. The setting constrains her choice to remain and shapes the closure's resonance, meeting the 9+ gate's environment test.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    The opal library, crystalline walls, glass orchids, and cracked bamboo chime establish vivid, purpose-driven setting. The crack itself functions as micro-setting, creating the new resonance chamber that constrains Mira's window of action. Sensory detail is selective (dawn light, hollow melody gaining undertone, the orchid pulsing with light) and filtered through Mira's caretaker focus. The Wall of Lost Names as spatial anchor charges the final image. No occupational depth issues; the library's suspended state and the orchid preservation mechanics read plausibly fantastical and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.1)
    The extinct language archive beneath Prague's oldest library is vividly established with dust-filled air, spiral stairs, and lamplight scattering through the glass ink well. The pearl-infused ink glowing faintly when truth is spoken provides a tangible constraint that validates her work and charges the final image of the ink well clinking in her bag. Spatial choreography remains clear across the single location. However, the archive functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active pressure on Elena's choices—she works uninterrupted through the night without environmental obstacles or resource constraints that alter her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.1)
    The amphitheater's "breathing" via thermal expansion anchors the setting vividly and recurs across the story, charging the final exhalation. The surveyor's chain and the dual-resin envelope function as tactile, purpose-driven details that constrain her method. Spatial choreography is clean (amphitheater center, carved stones, night departure). The volcanic basin and dormant volcano provide thematic resonance—power held without destroying—but remain largely atmospheric rather than forcing a micro-choice. The chain and the amphitheater's stones both constrain her plan and charge the closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.8)
    The attic skylight, dust motes, ledgers, and music box anchor the workspace with tactile specificity. Dust motes constrain Margot's attention and become her meditative tool, directly charging the closure image when piano notes rise "like pigeons returning home" and she maps music through dusty air. The vintage bookshop attic supplies resources (the meteorite, the envelope) that drive the ending. Sensory hierarchy reflects Margot's professional lens: she traces trajectories, maps patterns, and converts melodies into flight notation.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.9)
    The drifting prism terrace, grain patterns, and maze geometry are vivid and purposeful. The terrace's counterclockwise spiral mirroring the maze is a strong anchoring detail. The pressure differential at the center—three degrees cooler—functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography (terrace descent, maze navigation, central circle) tracks cleanly. Sensory detail is selective but leans visual; the "fractured hush" and corn whispers supply atmosphere without deeply constraining Marina's choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.1)
    The underwater research facility and Thymal ruins are vividly rendered with specific, purpose-driven details: bioluminescent algae, glass dome, bacterial light channels, embedded minerals. The burnt feather in the observation tank constrains Mira's interpretation and charges the final sequence, satisfying the 9+ gate at the micro-setting level. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities (stellar alignment, luminous patterns). Spatial choreography through facility chambers and the dome is coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    The iridescent cave is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (smooth crystal floor, rainbow cascades, breathing walls, luminescence) and establishes a liminal, purposeful atmosphere. The cave's dimming as day wanes and the discovery of sprouts in crystal cracks both ground the final turn in the physical setting. The geode functions as micro-setting that enables the protagonist's work and charges the closure image with the sprouts, clearing the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain a choice or charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal arcade is vividly anchored: weathered planks, natural amphitheater carved by waves, tide clock, foam fingers on steps. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered (Marcus notes acoustic sweet spots, darkness pooling). The environment constrains choice: the two-hour tide window structures his cycles, and the seawall provides staging for the teenager encounter. The bishop catching moonlight and the waves erasing footprints charge the final image with micro-setting specificity. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint and closure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.1)
    The twilight garden, wisteria, and clifftop dwelling anchor space and mood effectively. Celestial choreography (meridians, orbits, galaxies) gives the dance spatial logic. The moonstone dust constrains the final image: it seeds the soil, altering the environment's future function. The setting evolves from performance space to archive of memory, charging the closure with micro-setting specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prism atrium and pool are richly detailed, functioning as micro-setting that constrains Marcus's communion ritual and charges the closure. Sensory detail is filtered through his glazier's expertise: condensation beads, interference nodes, spectra painting water. The stone-and-ripples method becomes a tactile, lived-in practice. The pre-dawn mist and timed sunrise create urgency and modulate atmosphere. Pearl Bay's waterfront anchors the piece spatially. Small deduction: while vivid, the atrium's geometry could be more legibly tracked across moves—some angles and reflections blur slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ridge path, moon, and celestial conjunction create atmospheric pressure and frame the liminal moment. The porcelain box functions as micro-setting, handled twice (turning it over, opening it) and constraining his emotional state. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. Minor slip: the valley below and station location are asserted but never grounded in sensory particulars or travel logistics, leaving the descent abstractly gestured rather than anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.1)
    The grotto's tide-polished spirals and phosphorescent lanterns supply vivid sensory anchors. The gauge functions as micro-setting, appearing in multiple beats and charging the final image when the needle spins to infinity. However, spatial choreography remains abstract—Marina's body and the lanterns' physical arrangement never constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure, limiting the setting's causal role.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    Ivy, stone walls, and the fireplace mantle function as active setting elements that constrain Mira's movements and supply the hidden archive. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "cool stone wall," "curtains of leaves," "brown and brittle as autumn leaves." The micro-setting (fireplace and specific stones) charges the final image when Mira places her notebook on the mantle. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single continuous passage.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    The terrace is anchored early with vivid, purposeful detail: rain-slicked stones, prism parapet trapping rainbow fragments, echoing acoustics. Sensory selection is strong (water droplets, brush whisper, humming) and filtered through Maya's focus on light-bending possibilities. The prism parapet functions as micro-setting that constrains her method (painting after rain to capture refracted light) and charges the final image when the sparrow lands there with "rainbow mist." The cathedral's jammed bell mechanism and the city waking below provide temporal and spatial pressure. Setting details recur with shifted meaning (the parapet's rainbows at start, the sparrow on it at close), meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    The terrace and clipboard are concretely rendered and constrain Mara's opening move: she sets the clipboard between delegates, turning it from a dividing line into a connecting object. The twin suns' alignment provides a temporal and symbolic frame that charges the final image ("suns touching—painful and necessary and true"). Spatial choreography is clean (terrace, lower chambers, delegates emerging, kneeling). Sensory detail is selective (bones chiming, corona bleeding) and filtered through Mara's urgency. The Theren's translucency and Kolani's darkness are described but not deeply integrated into choice or perception beyond the single observation that they "blurred into something neither beautiful nor ugly." Minor reliance on abstract descriptors ("ancient and patient," "broken music") and the terrace's ritual significance told more than shown prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    The salt flat is vivid and purposeful: "crystalline crust," "tons of salt," and "industrial salt pellets" create tactile pressure. The setting constrains the burial choice (acoustic properties, preservation matrix) and charges the final image ("cracks in the earth spelled out songs"). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Vera's priorities (climate-sealed case, drone feeds, tablet). The spatial choreography remains clear across moves. Micro-setting qualifies: the egg case, salt crystals, and cracks function as setting elements that directly enable tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.1)
    The silver courtyard and prism sanctuary are vividly anchored with snow, starlight, and crystalline walls. The threads and echoes function as tactile micro-setting elements that constrain her unlocking process across multiple beats. The final image (melted snow circles revealing silver stones) charges the closure by showing environmental transformation tied to her act, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    The radar dome's acoustic properties and visual gaps (meteor showers visible through broken panels) are vivid and specific, and the dome functions as workshop setting that mirrors his narrative philosophy. The story stick's notches and the campfire are handled tactilely across multiple beats. However, the "seedy bars" where he performs remain abstract placeholders—no sensory detail of the dive bar audiences or spatial choreography during a puppet show appears on the page, weakening the micro-setting that should ground his ethical practice.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto is vivid and specific: mosses like curtains, ferns in weeping crevices, suspended bowl formed by collapse. The setting constrains choice (Mira climbed three days to reach it, moisture dissolves her structures within hours) and charges the final image (structures returning to the grotto that "sheltered so many forgotten stories"). Sensory detail is filtered through Mira's attentive, reverent perception. The moth wing as micro-setting object participates in the closure (placed at the spiral's center, read by the butterfly).

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    The icebound sanctum, aurora, and frozen sanctum floor create vivid atmosphere and the ice investment material literally constrains her casting method. Sensory detail is strong (breath clouding, tears freezing, ice walls sweating). The rope as tactile object charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. However, the Victorian collectors and Arctic peoples remain abstract historical set-dressing without affecting present choices.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vine-draped bunker, bioluminescent moss, quantum processors humming after two centuries, and neural crown are vivid and purposeful. The storm provides urgency and the flooding water creates physical constraint that shapes the ascent. The wafer seal bookends the journey (entrance and exit kiss) with clear symbolic weight. Spatial choreography remains clean throughout the descent and ascent. Sensory detail is selective and reflects Kira's foresight-driven attention without catalog listing. The bunker's decaying directive and preserved dream-tech anchor the conceptual premise in concrete setting elements that constrain and enable the protagonist's discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.1)
    The palace architecture constrains Mara's search through calculated gaps, ceramic depressions, and the magic square tile mechanism. The tile's warmth when Mars aligns and the phosphorescent minerals embedded in mortar are concrete details that affect her actions. The body and tools (satchel, hand-drawn charts, transparent sheets) shape her method and the climax. Spatial choreography is clear: descent, chamber entry, wall tracing, floor arrangement. The setting actively pressures and enables the closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.6)
    The soundless sanctuary is described atmospherically ("where sound had never existed") but does not constrain Marcus's tactical choices—he would pursue the same plan in any setting. Spatial choreography is abstract: "pressed the box into the Magistrate's hands" occurs without clear positioning or movement. The music box as micro-setting does recur and charges the final image, but the sanctuary itself remains ornamental backdrop rather than a pressure that shapes action.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ruined orchard district, fog, and workshop are vividly anchored with purpose-driven detail: "fog crystallized into tiny prisms," "twisted trunks...preserved...like insects in amber." The mirrors-as-constellation arrangement and fog-as-lens transformation constrain Elara's method and charge the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the séance. The workshop's permeability and the final hand-mirror are micro-setting elements that directly enable the ending's conceptual shift. Sensory selection favors sight and texture, appropriate for a mirror maker's POV, though sound ("crystalline note") and tactile detail ("reading the curve of glass") balance the palette.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard-in-rafters image is vivid and specific, recurring across multiple beats and charging the final glow. The quartz eyes as suspended fruit constrain the mending work spatially. Micro-setting (the tools, the tuning fork's tone, the branches) enables and shapes the repair sequence. The cathedral transformation anchors who/where/when early and evolves with the mending, satisfying the constraint test for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    The astral orchard constrains the curator's reality and charges the final image: trees at all ages simultaneously, blossoms falling upward, Earth in multiple states. The pistachio shell functions as micro-setting—its microscopic coordinates compel the journey, and she carves into it with a tool "she didn't yet possess," creating a tangible paradox. Magnetized boots and porcelain-from-bark bathroom ground the impossible in sensory specifics. The orchard's impossibility (fruit trees in vacuum) is filtered through her bewildered perception and directly enables the temporal logic that closes the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    The labyrinthine bookstore provides vivid, layered detail (shelves carved into granite, circular trap room, amber-preserved seekers) and the setting constrains choice in the trap room where Mira must solve the book-sequence puzzle. The botanical diary as micro-object charges the ending when its blank pages become the payment. Spatial choreography remains clear across descents, though the mountain's rearranging nature is declared but never pressures a tactic on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The carnival ship is vivid and purposeful: "rusted calliope pipes singing ghost notes," "carousel horses frozen mid-gallop," "cotton candy machines crystallized with salt." Spatial choreography is coherent across ladder, carousel deck, mirror mazes, and theater. The emerald swatch—micro-object as setting—charges the final image and constrains Marina's climactic choice (pocket vs. pin), satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3. Sensory selection reflects Marina's scientific lens without becoming a catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mechanism room atop the clock tower supplies a recursive, liminal space that constrains access (door exists only during the thirteenth chime) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("brass gears clicked overhead with warmly methodical precision"). The rope itself functions as micro-setting, its braids revealing maps and borders through tactile interaction. However, spatial choreography of Elara's movements within the room remains vague; we lack a clear sense of workbench position relative to door or gears.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    The harmonic caves function as more than backdrop: the frozen pool at the cave's heart supplies the bloom of hush, the echo chamber stone anchors the ritual, and cave walls register the beings' frequencies. The ice's "internal architecture" and stress points constrain her extraction method. Sensory detail is purposeful (gentle luminescence, cascading waves of pure sound, ice parting along predetermined fractures) and filtered through her professional lens as a mapkeeper. The setting charges the final image when new ripple-mark patterns emerge, requiring her to update her maps. Micro-setting (the pool, the stone, the ice) constrains choice and enables the climactic act.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glass humming pavilion is vividly rendered with synesthetic detail (walls vibrating with frequencies, harmonics shifting), and the beacon tower's spiral stairs and navigation ring provide concrete spatial anchors. The shard of hush and its interaction with the prism ("shadows that fell upward") offer striking, purposeful imagery that charges the final rekindling. The pavilion's song modulates at closure, directly contributing to the ending's resonance and satisfying the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stormlit observatory and fog-stone topography are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (lightning forking through clouds, alabaster seas, pale fire). The crystal whispering forecourt functions as micro-setting: Lyra touches the central crystal, triggering memory floods that anchor her realization and charge the final gathering. Spatial choreography remains clear (edge of observatory → forecourt → central crystal → survivors arriving), and the environment constrains the survivors' existence to "islands of memory." Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency in peak moments (thin mountain air, visible breath), though some descriptions lean decorative without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.1)
    The phosphorescent moss and ceramic mosaic are vivid and specific anchors. The courtyard's spatial layout remains clear through Kaia's walk. The setting provides literal materials (moss, tiles, metal shavings) that enable the ending, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. However, the "starless void" and "Dimming" remain abstract; we never see how darkness constrains movement or choice in a concrete beat.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.1)
    The grotto functions as more than backdrop: tidal dynamics (retreating waves, bioluminescent plankton), the opening to stars, and individual pools supply concrete constraints that shape the conversation's rhythm and Chen's confession. The jade cicada and hermit crab are handled on the page, and spatial choreography (stone placement, wave intrusion) remains coherent. Sensory detail (barnacle-crusted walls, seawater drip, plankton sparkle) is selective and voice-filtered through Mira's chronicler perspective. The final image of pools "poised in transition" charges closure without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    The trellis setting is specific and functional: golden lattice, curved glass walls, clouds below as "inverted mountains," and the groaning musical beams under gravitational strain. The observation deck's spatial choreography (feet lifting, everything inverting, tendril weaving through space) remains coherent throughout the inversion sequence. The porcelain doll functions as micro-setting—its cracking and sprouting tendrils constrain Mira's movement and enable her collection work. The final image of Mira descending with a heavy satchel while the doll reforms charges the trellis as both literal and metaphorical space, making the environment indispensable to the story's conceptual architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drifting prism terraces are vividly realized with acoustic specificity (Ruby absorbs whispers, Sapphire amplifies heartbeats, Emerald echoes unspoken thoughts) and the gondola's spatial movement through refractive zones is clear throughout. The storm glass vial functions as body-object micro-setting, though it never meaningfully constrains a choice. Sensory detail is filtered through Marcus's professional expertise and the piece maintains coherent spatial choreography. The final terrace (Prism Crown) charges the ending image with "full of all the sounds that had been gently filtered," meeting the gate for closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.7)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall, orchard, and maintenance shed are anchored with vivid sensory detail (bio-luminescent leaves, smart-paint flickering, chromium oxide trace). The shed's layered paint constrains Anya's method (precision laser peel) and charges the closure by housing the ultraviolet revelation. However, spatial choreography inside the shed remains vague—no body-scale choices (e.g., kneeling, shifting light angle) pressure her movement. The sunrise ritual (trees singing) enriches atmosphere but does not alter her tactical options. Micro-setting (the ruby flake in her pocket, the suit's visor) appears but does not constrain a choice. The orchard supplies resources (the song, the mural) that shape understanding, lifting the score into mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ashen sanctuary is vividly rendered (charcoal pillars, absent roof, starlight) and the setting consistently pressures the keeper's work. The doorknocker ring functions as micro-setting when handled, and the blackened walls constrain her solitude. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (shadows "pooled in corners like wounded animals"), and the spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. The final image uses starlight and charcoal pillars to charge the closure, meeting the 9+ gate test for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.9)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail ("tiny star," "shadows dance backwards," temporal fold). The farm constrains Marina's work and supplies the transformative field that enables the climax. Micro-setting via the bolt functions across beats (grounding touch, key mechanism). However, spatial choreography weakens in the convergence scene—Dr. Chen's position and Marina's physical actions blur when precision matters most. The setting charges the final image but doesn't impose a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sepia reading room anchors consistently and the gramophone as micro-setting object charges the closure when Victoria throws the crank through the window, shattering glass "like frozen moments of the truth she was choosing to release." Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered (amber-tinted air, golden shadows deepening). The mockingbird's ambiguous song at the end completes the environmental constraint: she can no longer read meaning, which is the story's thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.1)
    The greenhouse's silver-barked trees, obsidian floor, and liquid starlight pools are vivid and purposeful, establishing a charged micro-setting. The marionette stage at the heart of the greenhouse constrains Aldric's ritual choice. However, the endless night and glass walls remain postcard elements that do not alter tactics or pressure; the phosphorescent glow is atmospheric but never limits movement or visibility in a way that matters. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    The file room setting constrains every beat: dust as language, concrete floor, fluorescent light, yellowed folders, and the physical archive structure Marcus's choices and anchor his emotional arc. Micro-setting excels—the button's weight and oxidation, paper clips, fading ink colors, and disturbed dust patterns all function as tactile evidence and pressure. The final image of Marcus turning off lights and leaving "the archives to their patient dust" charges the closure by converting setting into thematic resonance. Sensory hierarchy reflects both professional focus (archival details) and personal need (the warmth of the button in his palm), with selective attention that never catalogs but always advances understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.1)
    The auric lagoon under starlight is vivid and purposeful, providing the map via reflection that launches the plot. The pier memorial and the hidden maintenance tunnels below ground are concrete and well-staged. However, spatial choreography during the descent and file retrieval remains generic—"rows of filing cabinets and boxes"—without tactile detail or constraints that shape Mira's choices. The lagoon's color shift from gold to silver at dawn charges the final image but arrives as description rather than a lived constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.1)
    The radiant grotto with bioluminescent moss and prism atrium creates a vivid, purpose-driven space where "silence had weight and substance." Dewdrops on the saxophone keys function as micro-setting that charges the closure image: "each one carrying away a syllable of the prophecy." Sensory detail (pale light, emerald/gold glow, mist) is filtered through the magical-realist frame and supports the stakes. The grotto's unique acoustics constrain Marcus's method, elevating setting beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.7)
    The Arbor's petrified branches, cloud-drinking roots, and upward-falling leaves create a vivid, inverted ecology that remains consistent. Spatial choreography stays clear (workbench, sorting bowls, gaps in the arbor). The moonstone speck and seeds function as micro-setting objects that constrain Mira's attention and action. However, the setting mostly provides atmosphere rather than shaping tactical choices—the environment enables her transformation but doesn't create obstacles or force trade-offs. The moss growth at the end charges the space but arrives after the key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    The subterranean waterfall and neglected greenhouse supply vivid, purposeful detail that constrains Marcus's work (dampness vs. thermal chaos). The compass suspended on a chain and leaves organizing into streams are specific images that charge the final tableau. Spatial choreography across workshop and greenhouse is clean, and sensory selection (mist, roar, swirling leaves) filters through Marcus's priorities, though the waterfall's mechanics feel slightly ornamental when not actively shaping a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rain-washed foundry provides vivid, purposeful detail: water patterns like blood vessels, residual heat in iron, moonlight through broken skylights. The crucible, furnace, and wet footprints are integrated into action beats and charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The micro-setting (Vera's golden facial seams, the coin's surface) constrains and enables the alchemical demonstration, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for setting-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Echo Gorge constrains choice through amplified sound ("footfalls became thunderclaps") and provides the bronze-lit cathedral effect that charges the final dissolve. The crocodile's tooth functions as micro-setting, warming with spectral presence and pulsing at confession climax, though its saint-swallowing backstory remains ornamental. Spatial choreography stays clear (narrow path descent, ledge for sitting), and sensory selection—distorted harp notes folding into weeping, moisture turning to gold—filters through Mara's practiced attention. The hidden sunrise timeframe tightens the confessional window and provides the transformative light that integrates with Thomas's release.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ultraviolet forest functions as micro-setting that charges the closure: UV-reactive moss in Fibonacci spirals, bioluminescent canopy visible only to enhanced eyes, and the setting's status as sanctuary for the displaced all constrain Lyra's renunciation and enable the final teaching scene. Spatial choreography is clear (recovery station → forest paths → tree where child sits). The pewter strap's forty-seven grams and the child's "safe distance" calculations ground proprioceptive detail in action. However, the forest remains largely backdrop until the final third; earlier beats could anchor choices in its alien soil or luminous patterns to deepen constraint across the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    The alchemist's market (rope bridges, chimney stacks, bubbling vials) is vivid and purposeful, grounding the scene in a specific vertical cityscape. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's professional focus: pentimento shadows, mercury-silver preservation spells, indigo stains on hands. The palette knife functions as a micro-setting tool that enables the central discovery, constraining her method and charging the action. The lighthouse fragment's hidden location (foundation stone, painted constellation) shapes her next choice and charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment constraining tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned circus ticket office is vividly particular (cracked window, sequined ghost, dust-map floor, hidden ceiling journals) and constrains Marcus's investigation throughout. Dust accumulation patterns function as micro-setting that drives his choices, and the mainspring barrel's warmth provides a tactile anchor. The fluorescent buzz bookends the piece, charging the final image when Marcus turns it off to see "in honest darkness." Spatial choreography is clear across moves (toolbox, counter, ceiling tile). The setting earns high marks for purposeful, pressure-driven detail that shapes both middle beats and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Glass Orchard Library is vividly rendered with consistent, purposeful detail: glass trees bearing book-fruit, bottled whispers arranged by frequency, the cloud sea below. The frost patterns guide Moth's letterpress work and return at closure, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting constrains Moth's choice structurally (the library's stability depends on her filing system) and the final rupture is inseparable from the location. Strong work; environmental detail actively shapes the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    The baroque asteroid setting is vivid and purposeful: gilded cherubs, silk-draped mirrors, visible timestreams create a sensory surround that charges the final act. The shard functions as micro-setting, catching temporal light and summoning ghosts, directly enabling the story's central revelation. Spatial choreography (table, windows, mirrors) remains clear, and the temporal storm gathering outside tracks causally with the escalation. The mirrors' symbolic role (showing possibilities during storms) is explained rather than demonstrated in action, slightly weakening the constraint test, but the environment unmistakably shapes Cassia's proof and Huang's shift.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    The resonance chamber is vividly realized—copper walls, thousand mended boxes, acoustic design that reveals Vex's whisper—and directly enables Elias's tactic (the mirrors and combined song). Sensory detail (wilting sensation, brown spots on tools, chip's warm light) tracks pressure and filters through Elias's POV. The chamber constrains and resources the final move, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for setting integration at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    The subterranean lagoon is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail: phosphorescent algae, "frozen rain" stalactites, and the shimmer on the far wall. The compass and vial function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice and charge the closure image. The "resonant hush" after factory silence anchors the frame and returns in the ending to bracket the descent. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the descent and lagoon scene.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.1)
    The storm-tossed archway is vividly anchored early—limestone pillars, rain drumming metal, wind singing turbine-hum—and returns at closure as "patient and eternal," framing Marina's departure. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered (driftwood "suggesting movement frozen mid-gesture"), and the archway functions as both literal shelter and symbolic threshold. The van's interior, driftwood cargo, and the sculpture itself are handled concretely enough to ground action, though the magic lantern slide and the projected future artists remain somewhat ethereal. Spatial choreography is clean; the setting constrains her pause and charges the final departure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    The amber pavilion's copper roof, weathered floor, and loose panel constrain Mara's final choice to hide the postcards, charging the closure image. Seasonal markers (October dusk, November near-complete, winter solstice snow) track time and shift atmosphere purposefully. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "candlelight, the way the postcard artist must have worked" reveals her working method as discovery. The pavilion's dual nature (daylight botanicals, nocturnal blooms) functions as both setting and thematic container, shaping her layering technique and final understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.2)
    The obsidian lagoon, zeppelin gondola, and Sahara dunes are vivid and specific. The beach debris arranged as cipher constrains Amara's final action, charging the closure image with purpose. Spatial choreography (zeppelin descent, walking the shore) tracks cleanly, and sensory detail (black water shimmer, bleached wood) is filtered through Amara's archival lens, meeting the micro-setting constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cove's luminescent jellyfish anchor place and recur meaningfully—they pulse in unison at closure, functioning as both environmental witness and thematic echo. The amber bottle's physical warmth and cooling track the essence drain, constraining Silas's method. The dry fountain and empty houses supply spatial grounding. Sensory detail (golden liquid catching dusk light, moss-covered stone) is selective and purposeful, filtered through an alchemist's perceptual priorities. The jellyfish's final synchronized pulse charges the ending image without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rooftop garden forty stories above drowned streets is vivid and purposeful, with apple trees from a destroyed monastery grounding the post-apocalyptic setting. The northern tower crack at sunset fulfills prophecy and constrains the physical environment. Sensory detail is selective: "wind that smelled of salt and endings," "sound like breaking teeth," "sky that hadn't been blue in his lifetime." The wax shaving and restoration basin function as micro-setting elements that enable the central discovery and charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    The icebound atrium under Cassiopeia's light, crystalline dome, and subliming ice provide vivid spatial grounding; starlight touching the acorn cap triggers its key function. The oak panels "waiting" for a thousand years and the transition from frozen air to living wood constrain Mira's timing and charge the closure image. Sensory detail—ridged texture, velvet-worn time, humming seeds—is filtered through her professional lens as seed saver, and the atrium's architecture enables the vortex stabilization and garden reformation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.1)
    The windblown sanctuary, cloud layer, and stone floor are vivid and pressure Mara's choice: the bell rope is tactile ("hemp fibers rough beneath her fingers"), the stone hum is felt, and the spatial setup (five thousand feet above the clouds, open arches) frames her isolation and the warning's reach. The glue drying on the siren's weatherproofing functions as a micro-setting constraint tied to the timeframe. Slight drift: "acrylic seal gleaming in the morning light" and "ice crystals that chimed like a thousand tiny bells" are decorative touches that don't alter tactics or charge the closure image, lowering integration density.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tracking station is vividly rendered through selective, purposeful detail: the yellow lantern glass lens, ancient equipment, detection screens, and the dome's spatial grounding. The station's obsolescence constrains Kepler-9's tools and social context, pushing them toward handwritten documentation and making their isolation tactile. The yellow lantern glass becomes micro-setting that constrains perception (can perceive intention, not just light) and charges the final image with its warmth. Sensory selection reflects the janitor's professional priorities (cosmic radiation as company, frequencies felt rather than heard).

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned apiaries and stained glass box provide strong sensory anchors—"white boxes bleached by decades of desert sun," "amber and crimson panels catching dawn light." The oasis setting constrains Mara's existence and the box's placement among rotting hives charges the discovery. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (shelter, hives, box location). The desert's "slow consumption" returns at closure to pressure the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.2)
    The emerald silo and its "crystalline walls" and "vibrations of accumulated years" supply vivid sensory detail filtered through Marcus's timekeeping lens, and the cremation urn fragment "grows warm" at a key beat, constraining his perception. Spatial choreography inside the silo remains coherent. However, the rust-colored horizon and post-numeric world receive only abstract gestures ("numbers lost their meaning") without concrete sensory consequences that would ground daily life or shape Marcus's tactics. The silo does charge the final understanding, meeting the 9+ gate, but the world outside feels generic.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt lagoon, tidepool, mangrove roots, and wet sand anchor the scene immediately and remain spatially coherent. The drake's feather functions as micro-setting: Mira catches it, presses it into her notebook, tucks it behind her ear—each handling constrains a micro-choice and the final mention ("its broken shaft somehow making it more graceful") charges the closure image by reinforcing the thematic reconfiguration. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (iridescent greens, pewter sky, hammered gold water) without catalog excess. The setting breathes with the story rather than decorating it.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    The copper wire, oak branches, volcanic stone pillars, and orchard are vividly detailed with purpose-driven specificity: wire tension, spiral direction, and phosphorescence constrain her actions and charge the final image when she places her palm against the pillar. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's scientific attention (electromagnetic pulses, mineral phosphorescence). The temple orchard functions as micro-setting, supplying resources (diary, copper, root networks) that alter her tactics and reweights meaning at closure. Spatial choreography is clean across her nighttime installation.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rainwashed tower, bronze light, narrow windows, and April weather create a coherent sensory frame. The amber warms in Elena's palm at a key beat, and "bronze quiet" recurs with purposeful intensification. The sculpture path footprints serve as both physical and metaphoric anchors. Spatial choreography (spiral stairs, uppermost chamber, equipment placement) remains clear. The tower's dampened sound and the rain's return charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test: environment constrains perception and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    The jetty, twilight harbor, wild roses, and shrapnel-laden soil are vividly rendered and filtered through the coachman's professional lens (death-carts, plague seasons). The mirrored water creating "narrow vastness" and the gulls' phosphorus-nutrient observations ground the ritual in sensory specificity. The seed pods constrain his method—he must match plant to toxicity—and the final image charges when "roots reaching down toward the reef's calcium embrace" unites setting with closure. Spatial choreography remains clear across the jetty, shore, and return path.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Heap is vividly particular—tower-stacks of automobiles, cracked earth where the Mississippi ran—and the scrapyard supplies the phonograph that unlocks the map, constraining Sage's means. The green valley hidden in a glass crater charges the final image with impossible contrast. Spatial choreography across the three-night journey remains clear. The micro-setting (shipping container den, phonograph horn) shapes key choices. One slip: the valley's autumn trees and fertile soil feel ornamental rather than causally prepared; their mechanics are asserted, not earned through prior world rules.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    The observation deck as void-space and the gilded compass rose as tactile anchor constrain Kira's role and charge the ending image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "crystalline walls reflecting nothing but the void," "light that no longer existed," "hot, then cold, then something beyond temperature." The micro-setting (her hand on the compass, the rice paper) functions as setting and shapes her final act of sketching-as-navigation. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The transparent walls through which crewmates appear complete the setting's role in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.1)
    The icebound spire and wrong sky are vivid and purposeful, anchoring the fantastical stakes early. The chess pieces constrain Renn's choice (she must physically swap them), charging the closure. Spatial choreography is clean. However, the spire itself remains largely postcard after the opening; the summit chamber and the wrong sky do atmospheric work but do not alter tactics mid-scene beyond framing the test.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.1)
    The whispering gallery's acoustics actively shape Marina's method (footstep-words multiply into chorus) and the chessboard's absent pawns charge the final image with loss and remembrance. Spatial details (curved space, dome, marble floor, spiral stairs) remain coherent and the setting constrains choice: Marina stays in this specific acoustic sanctuary rather than join the government. The body-as-micro-setting (her feet tracing letters) functions purposefully. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Marina's documentary priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.9)
    The mountain bookstore is vivid and purposeful: "books formed walls that spiraled upward," "pages made of materials that weren't quite paper," and the soil chamber with its skylight constrain the seer's journey and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her blindness (trailing fingers, texture of the stone). The garden chamber—dark soil, starlight, no books—serves as micro-setting that enables the closure action (planting). Environment shapes choice and charges the ending, meeting the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.1)
    The time-frozen village constrains Kaspar's journey—he cannot physically help the villagers or his student, only achieve internal resolution—and the platinum labyrinth charges the final image (the copper piece placed on its edge). Sensory detail is vivid and selective: raindrops like glass beads, lightning as permanent veins, the board's internal light. The "woven hush" and "fierce repose" atmospheric phrases recur with some thematic weight but occasionally drift toward ornamental lyricism. Spatial choreography is clean (archway → central square → board's edge → exit through raindrops).

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bone towers and canyon acoustics constrain Kira's tactic—she climbs to the resonance chamber precisely because it amplifies and remembers. The "carved handholds that previous prisoners had left" grounds the setting in lived use. Sensory detail (chill seeping through skin, mist coiling, boots striking in unison) is selective and serves pressure. The "hollows of the spires" where other prisoners hide remains vague—spatial choreography of their positions and how they hear Kira's whisper across distance is unclear, preventing the setting from fully earning the higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop floating on acid sea supplies vivid, purposeful constraint: dissolving supports create a ticking clock, the platform's tilt forces tools to cascade, and the acid tang burns Mira's throat. Sensory details (hissing condensation, groaning gears, rising fumes) are selective and pressure-driven. The statue functions as micro-setting, physically present and handled across multiple beats, charging the final image. Minor slip: the "crystalline processors" detail feels like world-building ornament rather than choice-shaping specificity, but overall the setting constrains action and charges closure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    The coastal setting moves from mechanical familiarity (quay stones, ropes) to the phosphorescent cave network that charges the final image. The cave's natural shelves and blue-green light constrain Marina's new ritual and anchor the grandmother's hidden practice. Spatial choreography through the passages is clean and the cave functions as micro-setting that enables the closure choice. The quay detail is vivid but largely atmospheric in the opening; the cave does heavier causal work.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt lighthouse, dawn light, and lamp room constrain Mara's movements and frame the vigil effectively. The jasmine scent functions as micro-setting, spiraling up stairs and charging the reunion beat. Sensory detail is selective (salt air, cool stone pulse, static electricity) and filtered through Mara's focus. The lighthouse beam's rotation participates in closure, catching "a solid shadow" at the turn. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Professional detail (assistant keeper) is mentioned but does not shape a choice, fitting this length.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    The signal station is spatially coherent (manual crank, radio array, receiver) and the bronze foot functions as micro-setting—used as lever, anchor, and warmth source—constraining her physical capability under the moon-phase weakness. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "sulfur fields," "poisoned corridor," "burned church" anchor the geography Marina navigates. The final image charges when the bronze foot "sat heavy in her lap, warm as a living thing, holding her to this place between worlds." Minor: the broader poisoned landscape remains somewhat abstract; specifics like "toxins settle lower at night" are instructional rather than experientially grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    The hanging orchard is vivid and purposeful: storm-bent branches, trees growing sideways from cliff cables, sodden earth. It directly enables the plot (the truffle grows only here) and mirrors theme (survival through adaptation). The glass eye's painted iris shifting in liquid, the tin box green with verdigris, and the ravine's physicality all charge key beats. Minor gap: the settlement "beyond the ridge" materializes late without prior spatial setup, slightly weakening the final move's grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    The opal dock, nautical twilight, and lighthouse beam are vividly rendered and constrain Magnus's investigation—timing gaps by rotation, reading coordinates etched in wood at a specific angle. The Edelweiss functions as micro-setting: its Alpine origin contrasts with sea spray, and its transparency under the beam reveals the wedding memory. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Magnus's professional attention (navigators losing the sea's edge, rice becoming sea foam). The final image of a figure swimming toward shore uses the water as both literal setting and metaphor for memory's return, charging the closure without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cavern with "impossible summer light" and luminescent formations charges the final image and the matrix chip constrains multiple beats (grandfather's gift, recognition, doorway activation). The dusty shop and limestone cliffs are anchored early. However, the kudzu curtain and warehouse district serve as transit decoration without altering tactics, and the cavern's glimmering map of unlived choices functions more as visual metaphor than as a space that pressures decision—Marcus's exploration inside remains frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt grotto, ember crystals, and bleeding starlight create a vivid, coherent atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"blue-black in twilight, pulsing like a bruised heart" anchors both image and tone. The setting constrains choice: the grotto's altitude and warmth guide the revelation, and the transformation occurs at the threshold between mountain air and magic. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting charges the final image as fireflies rise "through the cobalt grotto's mouth into the space above clouds."

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ember nexus and nautilus shell function as micro-setting that constrains the final choice: the shell's spiral geometry becomes the key to solving the formula, and twilight recurs to charge the ending. Sensory detail (amber shadows, calcium curves, dying embers) is selective and purposeful. The laboratory remains spatially generic—no tactile workspace detail or equipment that shapes Lyra's moves—but the shell and nexus anchor the scene adequately for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ranger cabin, birch bark, and mountain wind are concrete, recurring anchors that constrain Maya's archival work and charge the closure image. Sensory details—"scent of birch sap and something else—possibility, perhaps, or resignation"—filter through Maya's philosophical stance without catalog tourism. The birch bark as both tool and object recurs with purpose, shaping her choices to document and her final step outside. Spatial choreography (cabin interior, window, outside) remains clear and evolves with the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    The water clock mechanisms constrain Mara's repair process (mineral deposits mapping emotional terrain, water channels singing different notes through brass versus copper) and the fogged windows recur purposefully, softening Mrs. Huang's arrivals. The shop's atmosphere—steam, brass gears, ceramic vessels—integrates into Mara's tactile methodology without postcarding. The birthing clamp screw functions as micro-setting, its oxidized surface read through touch, and its wedged position at 3:47 charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's professional bias (touch and sound prioritized over smell), and the fog/clarity tension underpins the thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    The floating platform, saturated hush, and jade-green tea anchor setting with purposeful mood. The crow quill and parchment constrain the test's parameters. Kira's crystallizing skin functions as micro-setting—her body is the terrain she navigates—and it charges the final image when she traces those patterns onto parchment. Spatial choreography (platform sway, Master Yuen pouring tea) remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archive and orchard work as linked pressure: chainsaws create urgency, perfume scent anchors the spectral mechanics, sheet music becomes active tool. Spatial choreography stays clear through "towering shelves," "above them," descent imagery. The perfume bottle functions as micro-setting object that constrains the reconnection method and charges the final beat when corked empty. Sensory detail (bergamot, roses, yellowed paper, dust shaking from ceiling) is selective and tied to POV priority. Setting details integrate through action rather than static description.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.1)
    The library's impossible geometry and "wanderingly exact" corridors supply vivid, purposeful detail filtered through Kaia's trained perception. The dictionary as micro-setting object constrains her path (etymologies whisper directions) and charges the final image when it scatters like seeds. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite the non-Euclidean premise. The setting pressures choice and participates directly in closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but the broader temple architecture remains more atmospheric than tactically decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    The horizon measurement station, fjord, and hydraulic system are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (stone rim calibration marks, mercury-still water, valve gurgle, bell tone). The mantle clock key functions as a tactile anchor throughout, and the station's dual timing systems (mechanical/hydraulic) constrain the shepherd's understanding and ritual. The fjord's "particular quiet" modulates with the counting sequence, and the cliff's "razor edge" location charges the final image of standing "at their intersection." Environment and recurring object (key) both shape the protagonist's stance and resonate at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    The rainwashed library window, antique mica pane, and amber candlelight are vivid and purposeful. The mica pane splitting light into "rainbows that danced across her equations" ties setting to theme cleanly. The storm's progression bookends the piece, and "midsummer" anchors time. Spatial choreography is clear (window, reading room, marble stairs). The mica pane's "interference pattern" in the final third charges the closure image by literalizing the theme of holding multiple truths. However, the hospital basement casino and subway seats are referenced but not integrated into the present scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.1)
    The utility tunnel is vivid and specific: rusted ladder, obsolete payphones, electromagnetic hum from passing trains. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Marcus's eleven-year familiarity. The glass harmonica disc functions as micro-setting, handled twice (pressed to receiver, played with wet fingers) and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; the tunnel environment shapes Marcus's routines and constrains his world, meeting the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    The blooming jetty is presented with layered sensory detail (wisteria perfume, amber light, violet-gold water) and recurs at closure to bracket the action. The portable ink set functions as a micro-setting/tool that enables the codicil decision on-site, constraining Mara's choice to act now rather than later. Spatial choreography is clean: Mara arrives, works at the jetty, Eleanor approaches through the bower. The walnut-ink stains and locket photo serve as recurring tactile anchors, though the photo's physical presence (breast pocket / Eleanor's hands / left behind) tracks less precisely than the ink.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ivy-claimed station is vivid and purposeful, creating a "green cathedral of abandoned intentions" that mirrors the theme of connection/disconnection. Spatial choreography is clean (pillar, shadows, platform). The setting functions as more than backdrop—the abandoned station that "once connected six towns" directly charges the closure image of new connection forming. However, the environment does not constrain a middle choice with visible cost, limiting the score's ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ultrasonic forest is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (bark, soil, moss). The platinum compass ring recurs across beats and warms/spins as a constraint marker, shaping her navigation choices. However, the setting functions primarily as atmosphere rather than forcing a tactical trade-off at closure. The "perfect silence" at the stillpoint charges the final image but does not alter her available moves or foreclose an option, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    The gravitational anomaly and observation chamber anchor the setting vividly with bent starlight and microgravity choreography. The pen's physical weight and osmium-iridium nib provide tactile grounding, and the station's spatial layout remains clear. However, the anomaly functions primarily as a conceptual device rather than a physical constraint that alters Mira's tactics—she observes and interprets, but the environment doesn't force difficult navigation or resource trade-offs. The final image uses the pen and twisted starlight effectively, charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.1)
    The harbor at night provides vivid sensory detail ("spilled mercury," "luminous," "silver paths") and the moon serves as spotlight for their performance, charging the closure image. The empty camera constrains Maya's method throughout (no film = pure ritual). Spatial choreography is clear. However, the harbor itself does not alter a choice or tactic—it serves primarily as backdrop. The camera and moonlight do the heavier lifting as micro-setting elements that shape the final visual symphony.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.4)
    The archive setting supplies concrete details (limestone corridors, carved shelves, copper taste, textile fragments) and the tapestry fragment constrains her attention. Spatial choreography is clear. However, the environment doesn't force a consequential choice or alter tactics; Mira moves through it without resistance. The body and tools (her hands, the weaving pattern) are present but ornamental until the final beat, where memorization begins—a micro-setting function that slightly charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sound wave garden and auric lagoon supply vivid sensory anchors (crystalline barrier, acoustic flowers pulsing with heartbeat, auroral shimmer). Spatial choreography between observation deck and the shared mental lagoon is atmospheric but lacks clear rules—no consistent cues for toggling realms or physical constraints. The drumming encodes messages in "resonance patterns" and "the walls, the medical equipment, her own bones," grounding the action in micro-setting, but we never see those objects respond or resist. The final aurora spilling into the lab charges the closure image, pushing this just past mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.1)
    The container labyrinth during geomagnetic storm provides concrete spatial constraints (GPS dead, compasses wild) that force Marcus's map-and-gait method. Aurora light, metallic groaning, and acoustic amphitheater effects are vivid and purposeful. The graffitied validation marks on XB-471 charge the closure image by making the whisper-system visible. Micro-setting (the coin's warmth, brass key tapping) functions as tactile anchor, though the zodiac coin's constellations "revealing hidden paths" reads more mystical than material constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    Cobalt dock, wet planks, puddles reflecting stars, and shutters are vividly anchored and revisited across beats. The dental mirror's reflective surface constrains Mira's teaching method—she positions it "with the precision of someone who had learned that small surfaces could hold infinite depth"—and charges the closure when she hands it to Thomas. Spatial choreography (kneeling, opening shutters, mirroring starlight) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt library with its magnetic grotto provides vivid, purpose-driven setting that constrains the chess lesson and amplifies the scene's tone. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (Marcus and Elena in the grotto, townspeople outside), and the mist functions as both atmosphere and concealment. However, the synchronized window displays across town exist only as summary; we never see a shopkeeper place a piece or a citizen pause to decode the pattern, reducing the setting's causal pressure at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sublittoral fringe—kelp forests over underwater cliffs—recurs and directly enables the closure (Mira wades into phosphorescent surf). The scrimshaw as object-setting constrains Mira's attention and charges the final image when it's left "still warm, waiting" on the pier. Sensory details (bioluminescent beaches, whale's call vibrating through bone) are vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the dock, rocks, and water. The Pacification's "muscles locking in painful rebellion" detail is vivid but does not materially shape Mira's on-page actions.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    The turbines' shadows and "whisper-roar" recur purposefully, mirroring surveillance and the relentless mandate. The dried bouquet and basswood function as micro-setting, constraining the whittling choice and charging the final image. Spatial choreography (table, doorway, window) remains clear. Minor gap: the farmhouse interior beyond "yellowed wallpaper" stays generic; we never learn why this specific location matters to Mrs. Chen beyond its isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cobalt atrium, quartz colonnade, and frozen lake are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory selection (blue light, perpetual chill, scripture-carved ice). The humming colonnade constrains Silas's movement and charges the final image when it "sang again, but now with a thousand voices." Spatial choreography remains clear, and the setting's permeability to shadow-poetry connects directly to the thematic question. However, the atrium functions more as symbolic backdrop than tactical constraint; no environmental feature forces a choice or alters his approach.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glassblower's courtyard is vivid and purposeful: kiln, workbench, potted herbs, and the glass sculpture all constrain or enable choices. Flower placements are tactile and specific (chrysanthemums in spirals, rosemary shifted left). The phoenix-ravaged city provides atmospheric stakes, though the ruins function more as backdrop than immediate pressure. The concertina reed tongue and glass sculpture physically shape the reunion, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.1)
    The laboratory setting is vivid and specific: Victorian glass, acoustic chambers, archived extinct sounds. The carbide lens recurs purposefully, shifting from navigation tool (grandmother in mines) to perceptual filter (warping the lab view) to pocketed talisman. Spatial choreography is clear (bells, doorway, gathered strangers). The lens constrains Vera's perception and charges the final image, pushing this into the 7-band despite the setting being more atmosphere than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory as timeless refuge (no clocks, stars marking time) and candlelit workshop constrain Elena's ritual-making and signal the refuge's open-door ethos. The phoenix stencil on vellum is handled twice (traced, then pressed to skin) and the rice paper cranes accumulate materially. The workshop window functions as beacon, drawing the stranger in. Spatial choreography is clean (bench, window, door, single chair). The timelessness motif charges the closure image but does not force a high-pressure choice on the page, keeping this slightly below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    The loft setting is vivid and purposeful: rain-beaded skylight, salvaged servers, fiber-optic cables create a charged archaeology-of-the-digital atmosphere. The ultraviolet lamp and measuring tape function as tools that constrain Vera's method. The rain intensifies at a key beat, modulating tone. The skylight returns in the final image to charge the closure with "tiny lens focused on the future," though this remains more lyric than tactical.

    The bronze prism pagoda, crystalline walls, and liquid amber tubes create vivid sensory anchors. The chaotic movement through the archive and the seven-tier structure constrain Mira's path and shape her choices (erratic steps to evade sensors, climbing tiers to reach the plague). However, the archive's defense systems and guardians remain abstract threats—they "hum" and "search" but never materially block or redirect her, reducing their pressure on the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.1)
    The blooming library's "glass petals" and "bio-glass membranes" are vivid, but the setting never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters Mira's actions. The river stone appears as a prop without spatial choreography—placed, held, warming—but never limits access or frames a tactical decision. Micro-setting credit cannot be awarded when the object is inert.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    The misty workshop under stars, glass roof panels, and redwoods frame Marina's exposure and judgment. The terrarium and surgical tools constrain her choices: she can only do precise work here, and the workshop's isolation allows the confession to unfold privately. The tail tip in moonlight charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. Minor: the workshop's symbolic resonance (judgment, exposure) is slightly overt, though it remains anchored in physical detail.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tower, medical bay, narrow windows, and rooftop garden are anchored early and used selectively. The coffee-ring stain constrains a key recognition (tree-ring analogy), and the window becomes a tactile interface when Maya presses her scarred palm to glass, enabling plant communion. The frosted hourglass recurs three times with evolving weight. Spatial choreography is clean (bed → window → garden view). The micro-setting (body as map, palm-print on glass) charges the final choice to "begin again," meeting the 9-band gate for constraint or closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.1)
    The projection booth is vividly realized with Art Deco curves, spatial "emotional geography" (regret in the northwest corner, hope in the ceiling), and the film strip as tactile object. The setting constrains Vera's psychometric reading and charges the final image—she navigates the booth's stored grief to make her choice. The booth functions as both micro-setting and conceptual vessel, meeting the high-band test for environment shaping choice and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.9)
    The aurora-lit archway is vivid and returns with purpose: the aurora "flared white-hot" at closure, the archway "crumbled into luminous dust," and the temperature drop creates immediate sensory pressure. The astrolabe's weight and warming constrain Lyra's physical choices ("pulling her forward," "cradling the instrument against her chest"). Spatial choreography is clear, and the setting charges the final image, though the broader seventeen-month journey remains abstract rather than texturally accumulated.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glowing dune is vividly rendered with phosphorescent sand, quantum blooms, and helical grain-dances that constrain Kess's awareness and charge the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through a post-catastrophe lens (smoke three years ago, divergent archives, probability fog) and feels purposeful rather than ornamental. The train, dune, and blooms provide spatial choreography that remains coherent throughout. The micro-setting (dune + clock) charges the closure image when the dune "sang along in harmonics that only the dreamless could hear."

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Mechanical Rainforest is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory specificity: brass oaks rumble warnings, steel pines whistle mathematics, titanium ferns harmonize. The Loom Tree functions as micro-setting that charges the closure moment when the gear is inserted, causing the forest's song to change. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting constrains the philosopher's nocturnal journey and directly enables the final act, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment shaping closure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    The veiled ridgeway, limestone spine, and twilight water are vivid and consistent; the brass ticket punch and the star-shaped holes provide concrete touchstones. Spatial choreography across the boat journey is clear. The setting charges the final image when Marina follows "star-shaped light leaking through her ticket," satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain or charge closure. Minor: the "shore that was somehow also the place where she'd started" briefly blurs spatial logic but recovers quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cobalt fortress, frostbite, and the discolored seventh step are vivid and specific. The piano bench bolt and the bell tower's acoustic channels ground the world in tactile detail. However, the spatial choreography of Elena's seven-year journey to the bell tower and her daily kneeling is vague—how does she access a closed hotel? The fortress's warming at the end charges the final image, lifting the score slightly, but the micro-setting of the music room doesn't constrain the ending choice.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.1)
    The library's crystalline dome, drift stasis, and constellation pauses create vivid micro-setting that constrains Syln's temporal experience and charges the final arrival. Sensory hierarchy is selective: "simple robes whispering against stone floors," "starlight caught from the dome." The pellet—a recurring object—charges the closure image when it shatters and spreads truth. Spatial choreography is clean (main door, shelves, dome overhead). The drift rune and constellation mechanics remain decorative rather than tactically limiting mid-scene; only at the end does the library "tremble" to signal breach.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    The monitoring station constrains Lena's initial observation and the descent mechanism becomes tactically relevant at closure. Sensory detail is purposeful: "bleached skeleton," "high and clear" glass tones, ventilation catching the atlas page. The coral formations shift from death-marker to preservation medium, and this transformation is earned through accumulated perception rather than declaration. Micro-setting via surfaces (glass, metal, plastic) generates the tapping symphony that reveals pattern, directly charging the final image of descent.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.4)
    The repair bay and stone circle are vividly rendered with purpose-driven sensory detail: "cathedral of rust," "textured steel," "hum…below hearing." The stones constrain Kira's movements (barefoot perimeter walk) and the opera glasses enable discovery of star-map etchings, both shaping her final stance. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. Setting actively charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.1)
    The volcanic springs anchor setting early and recur at closure, but function primarily as backdrop rather than constraint. The springs' heat and mist supply atmosphere; the amber's dissolution uses volcanic minerals, giving the setting light causal participation. Spatial choreography (insurgents forming a protective circle, soldiers bursting through the tree line) is clear but generic. The kite in the dead birch upstream adds a specific micro-object, yet its retrieval is summarized, not dramatically constrained by the environment. Setting never tightens a tactical choice or charges the final image with environmental pressure, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    The arboretum constrains choice throughout: untended olive trees frame abandonment, rough cedar bark becomes the "pearl of stillness," and sapling transplanting enacts her succession logic. Micro-setting (her palm against bark, dirt under fingernails) charges the final image. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from cliff to greenhouse to lighthouse beacon sweep. The automated beacon in the final beat functions as setting-as-argument, mirroring her withdrawal-with-function. Sensory hierarchy reflects trauma-trained attention: she distinguishes aircraft types, reads wind and wave as patient forces.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lighthouse library, tarot box, and charcoal from the dead beacon supply vivid particulars, and the walls' inward press becomes a motif that charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays legible within the single room, though physical distances and Marina's movements (climbing, picking up cards, sketching) are gestural rather than tactile. The setting participates in the closure (walls embrace, beacon blazes) but functions more as symbol than as a constraint that narrows her tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.4)
    The obsidian pool, spilled ink, artificial hummingbird drone, and wind-carved encampment provide vivid, selective detail filtered through the tracker's priorities. The drone constrains her method of observation (quantum processors detecting chronological anomalies), and the ink's behavior charges the final image as it "disappeared into quantum probability." The Tibet avalanche anchors the premise with embodied memory. Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling tracker, hovering drone, surrounding tents) and the eclipse shadow functions as a live environmental constraint that pressures the observation window.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cryogenic vault setting is vividly rendered with "frost-glazed window," "titanium floors," and "quantum-locked passages," and sensory detail is filtered through Vera's professional lens. The cooling system becomes a tactical element when she triggers cascade failure, directly enabling her plan. Spatial choreography is clear throughout—observation window, Terminal Seven, security rounding the corner. However, the "echoing library under snow" Damascus backstory functions primarily as exposition rather than a present constraint, and the snow motif, while atmospherically consistent, remains more symbolic than tactically relevant to her choices in the vault.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glass dome and desert rose farm are vividly rendered and anchor spatial choreography throughout: Mira's movement between rows, the central rose, the entrance where she meets her father. Sensory detail is purposeful ("geometric patterns across the desert rose farm," "airship descended," "blazing crimson despite its tranquil bearing") and filtered through Mira's perception. The dome constrains and protects—"the desert waited with its harsh truths. Inside, the roses continued their quiet revolution"—charging the final image. The sandbag scrap and the roses as tactile objects recur across beats and ground the body/tool micro-setting, meeting the 9+ test narrowly.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sound wave garden is vividly realized through selective, purposeful detail: acoustic flowers from pure resonance, emotions crystallizing as silver vines and blue thorns, vertical rivers of sound. Kova's bare feet "finding the spaces between feelings" grounds her navigation in tactile, body-level choreography. The rail spike hums and grows warmer, then burns—a recurring small object that constrains her method and charges the final moment when it cools. Spatial tracking remains clear: she stands at the garden's edge, moves through it carefully, casts her line in zigzag patterns that mimic the constellations above. The setting actively shapes her tactics (voicing silence to create the opposite of noise, using the spike to navigate frequencies) and the hybrid blooms where starlight touches sound supply the charged backdrop for the climactic encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    The observatory setting constrains choice subtly: its isolation permits Margot's solitary decision, the brass instruments "mock the slippery nature of human truth," and the vault provides the pen's final resting place. Sensory details (copper dome, clouds below, dawn glow like burning newsprint) are filtered through Margot's observer lens and support atmosphere. The grandfather's unreported asteroid functions as thematic mirror but doesn't physically constrain the present choice. Spatial choreography is clean. The micro-setting (pen, paper, vault) charges the final image adequately but doesn't drive a mid-story turn.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    The laboratory "between heartbeats," the amber pendant warming, and the three-dimensional mandala floating in controlled atmosphere all constrain Mara's method and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (Mara approaches terminal, needles etch air, constellation hangs above). The "meteor hush" recurs purposefully and the cracked amber at closure shifts from warm to fractured, marking cost. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's professional priorities (subsonic frequencies, visual star maps). Minor: the laboratory's mechanics (how it "amplifies frequencies" into tangibility) remain assertion rather than dramatized constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    The whispering grotto is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (lilac mist, limestone walls, acoustic curves, damp stone) and the setting actively shapes the protagonist's work—sound amplification spots guide her mandala design. The micro-setting (sand mandala, tile flake) constrains her artistic method and charges the final image when the tile crumbles into the pattern. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the environment's acoustic architecture becomes integral to the thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    The plaza, shattered sky, and tessera constrain Sarai's choices throughout—she must physically place each piece to trigger visions, and the mosaic's pattern shapes her understanding of transformation. Sensory detail is purposeful: "warm despite the frost," "chipped and blackened" stones, the "strange light" that will nurture "impossible plants." The final vision of the plaza becoming a garden directly charges the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves between kneeling, standing, and the old man's emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    The hedge maze, mystic orchard with season-fractured apple trees, and amphitheater are vivid and purposeful. The tarot coin's temporal fractures and the garden's unstable timeline constrain Cornelius's method (producing echoes to braid past/future). Spatial choreography is clear across beats. The setting charges the final image—two names carved on the bench, paths rearranging nightly—meeting the 9+ gate criterion that environment shapes the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.7)
    The studio's prismatic light and projectors are handled across multiple beats, and the muscovite particles create spatial architecture that Maya navigates. The light-painted structures guide David's movement ("stepped into the light structure") and the geode sliver's refractive properties enable the final demonstration. While the studio constrains and shapes action throughout, it functions more as a stage than as an environment that decisively alters tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cave network is vividly rendered with bioluminescent organisms, tidal breathing, and limestone's emotional absorption. Sensory detail is filtered through Kira's augmented perception ("amber" heat signatures, colors without names). The harness and electromagnetic suspension function as micro-setting tools that enable her floating stance. The caves constrain exploration and supply the alien thermal signature that drives the climax, meeting the Q3 gate for choice constraint and closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.4)
    The amber warehouse provides vivid sensory anchors (amber-colored glass, light like frozen honey) and the canyon echo jar offers a tactile constraint at closure. However, spatial choreography is loose—Mara's movements through the warehouse remain vague, and the button spiral's physical assembly lacks grounding. The setting charges the final image but does not constrain a middle choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bluff setting provides strong atmospheric grounding with purposeful detail: frozen rock, accumulated snow forming codes, mist as obscuring curtain. The snow-codes function as micro-setting, constraining Margot's route and method of discovery, thus shaping one key choice. However, spatial choreography weakens when Viktor "emerges from the mist below, climbing steadily upward" while Margot simultaneously "followed the trail of snow-codes down the bluff's eastern face"—their relative positions and movements blur. The setting charges the final image ("silver-hushed dawn") but environmental details don't constrain the climactic conversation itself.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.1)
    The fog-bound river crossing functions as both atmosphere and constraint: the rain gutters tick a countdown, the fog feeds on promises, and the bridge becomes the path to resolution. Sensory details—mist condensing around Thomas's hands, wet planks, metallic ticking—anchor perception and guide the woman's approach. The yarn needle behind the ear and the fog's retreat directly charge the closure image. Micro-setting (the coach, the bridge, the river accepting what was released) alters tactics and stakes throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    The scorched wasteland, stone well, and hexagonal hive arrangement are vivid and purposeful. The oasis functions as more than backdrop: hive positioning explains temporal stability, and Mei's seated posture at the well mirrors her wheel work, charging the space with her craft identity. Sensory detail is selective—cracked earth, thrumming glass, flattened smoke—and filtered through Mei's potter's perception. The micro-setting (lantern glass against her spine, hives catching sun) constrains her interpretive choices and directly enables the closure insight, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    The harbor setting is vividly rendered ("moonlight like mercury," "barnacles formed a rough border") and sensory details are purposeful and POV-filtered. The gauge tooth functions as micro-setting: Marina handles it across multiple beats, and it constrains her final gesture (wedging it into the dock crack). The luminous harbor charges the closure image, making environment indispensable to the ending's resonance. Spatial choreography (fire escape to dock to return path) tracks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Tidal Library is vividly realized with atmospheric tides, glass floors over clouds, and the stone circle below, creating a distinct spatial signature. The brass sundial functions as a charged object across multiple beats, warming under touch and reflecting fragmented selves. However, the environment does not constrain a choice at closure—Kira's decision to set the sundial on the ledge is symbolic rather than tactically forced by setting elements. The body and tool (sundial) participate meaningfully but the final image's resonance is thematic rather than environmental.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lotus temple and lily pond are vividly rendered with prismatic light and reflective doubling that charge the atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's artist's eye (thrush's nest spiral, copper wire, glass slides). The installation itself—wire, lights, rice paper—constrains the collaborative work and provides tactile grounding. The temple's architecture and post-storm clarity recur at closure, reweighting the final image with symbolic resonance that serves theme without becoming overt.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.7)
    The radio booth's "ancient receivers" and "vacuum tubes and copper wiring" constrain Maya's method and differentiate her from the digital-dependent faculty, shaping her tactical advantage. Spatial choreography is clean (booth, campus, faculty senate building). However, the subsonic battle and equipment glowing with heat are asserted rather than felt through sensory particulars. The "electromagnetic dust" opener and "metallic sentinels" are vivid but don't recur or charge the closure; the final "analog defiance" gestures toward the equipment without grounding it in a concrete choice or image.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.1)
    The shadowed nexus, starlight, geometric wound, and impossible angles create vivid atmosphere and the spherical room with stars through stone is memorable. The blueprint and compass function as micro-setting elements that constrain his search and charge the final image. However, spatial choreography in the shifting corridors remains abstract ("passages that rearranged themselves") without concrete blocking, and the setting's pressure is mostly ambient rather than forcing a specific choice or trade-off. The fallow period timeframe anchors the opening but does not tighten decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    The quarry's mist, limestone walls, and carved steps are concretely rendered and return at closure ("The quarry held its shadows close as she climbed back toward the light"). The scarlet ribbon fragment supplies tactile specificity. However, the environment doesn't constrain a choice—Sarah's easel positioning and the quarry's spatial features don't alter her tactics or force a trade-off. The setting frames but does not pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.1)
    The weather station is vividly rendered with barometric sensors, holographic map table, and reinforced windows that track the approaching storm. The copper nail's oxidized surface and cemetery earth provide tactile specificity, and the waterlogged journals "reeked of brine and decay." The station's instruments and the storm's visible eye create spatial pressure. The nail's magnetic properties constrain Elara's choice at the map table, though the broader setting (station layout, her physical relationship to equipment) remains somewhat abstract during the climactic broadcast sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.7)
    The mountain pullout anchors location adequately, and sensory details (afternoon light, wind, amber air) filter through Marla's musical perspective. The glass flake functions as micro-setting, returning with reweighted meaning in the reversal sequence. However, spatial choreography remains vague—Marla's van, the gorge bridge referenced, and her position at the pullout never cohere into a legible physical space that constrains movement or choice. The setting descriptions serve atmosphere more than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned circus train is vivid and purposeful: "painted tigers fading to shadows," "elephant car's broken skylight," "fortune teller's car." The bills function as micro-setting, constraining Marcus's method (rearranging them into warnings) and charging the closure conversation. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("dusky harmony of truth told at twilight"). The train's acoustics enable the whisper campaign. Spatial choreography remains clear across cars and seasons. The final image—bills on the wall where "shadows and light played their eternal game"—uses setting to embody theme without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.9)
    The observatory supplies concrete anchors (telescope, dome, brass housing, speakers) and the daylily telegram constrains the inciting question. Sensory detail is selective (starlight whisper, whale-song audio, pearl-and-gold dawn). The micro-setting (pressed flower, viewfinder, laptop) charges the closure act of documenting and passing forward. Spatial choreography remains clear across beats, and the setting evolution (silent vigil → collective arrival) reflects the thematic shift.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.7)
    The orchard vortex, glass-tree garden, and amber sphere create a vivid secondary world with rule-consistent physics (blossoms bloom and rot simultaneously, roots grow into underwater sky). Sensory detail is selective and tied to discovery rather than catalog. The living amber sphere and the frozen confession ice act as micro-setting constraints that Kael must interact with to advance plot. The lake and vortex charge the closure image as he emerges "water streaming." Minor penalty: spatial choreography inside the garden (expanding circles, garden center) remains abstract; we never see Kael's body navigate specific obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cobalt glade supplies vivid imagery ("blue grass catching...like scattered sapphires") and the maze topiary materially constrains Mira's action (she kneels, presses it, follows the spreading roots). Spatial choreography is clear. However, the glade functions primarily as stage rather than constraint—Mira encounters no environmental resistance or cost. The final image charges slightly ("cobalt glade pulsed...recognizing its gardener") but the setting does not alter her tactics or foreclose a path.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered with phosphorescent apples, roots threading through bones, and moss-touched ceilings. The setting constrains Mara's choice: she must descend, find Elena's tree, and the keeper materializes from shadow to challenge her. The "deepest chamber" and the "cathedral of bone and bark" charge the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through Mara's urgency and grief. The burned card grows warm as a compass, making the environment an active navigation tool that shapes her path to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    The quarry office functions as micro-setting that mirrors his emotional landscape (water pools "reflected nothing back") and constrains his isolation choice. The speaker cloth as recurring object charges the closure through its shift from cataloged artifact to embodied memory vessel. Sensory hierarchy is well-filtered through his professional POV—weave pattern, weight, discoloration—then shifts to emotional register. The B-flat frequency callback effectively links past venue acoustics to present space.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    The magnetic arbor is vividly described with "silver branches," "glowing orbs," and electromagnetic hum, and the cloud-layer ascent provides spatial specificity. The laboratory platform and the tablet in the opening anchor early setting details. The seed's warmth and thrumming energy offer tactile grounding at the closure beat. However, the arbor functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint (tool access, spatial limit, magnetic interference) shapes Sarah's final choice, capping the score below 7.0 despite vivid description.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.0)
    The tidal atrium's glass walls and titan-gear harness anchor setting through recurring sensory cues. The furnace room and bamboo creel are handled in multiple beats, and the ocean's rhythm subtly mirrors Kaine's mechanical heartbeat at closure. However, the Q2 Orientation Test penalty caps Q3 at 7.0, and the setting does not constrain a choice—it atmospherically supports theme without altering tactics or imposing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.1)
    The crystal caves are vividly established (phosphorescence, conch shell, pedestal) and the pearl's radiance charges the final image when it "erupts, filling the cave with light." The caves function as more than backdrop—Crown's "cultivation chamber" concept integrates setting with theme. However, spatial choreography remains somewhat abstract; we don't track Mara's movements through the bunker or understand how the pearl's light physically weakens the reinforced walls. The body and tools (flashlight, inspection knife) appear but don't meaningfully constrain choices beyond the knife enabling the etching.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    The disused station and ivy are vividly rendered with purposeful detail: "pressed his palm against the crumbling brick, feeling how the vines had worked their fingers into every crack." The bathroom graffiti functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables Marcus's epiphany. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The bellows and notebooks ground Marcus's physicality. The ivy returns at closure to charge the final image: "green overtaking gray, nature reclaiming what humans had abandoned." Minor gap: the train whistle feels slightly ornamental rather than integral to the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.1)
    The glowing library, mist, and amber light create vivid atmosphere. The confidence man's watch serves as a recurring object that shifts function (stealing time → revealing cipher), meeting the micro-setting standard. However, spatial choreography grows vague in the second half as "countless other libraries" appear without clear mechanics, and the library's physical constraints never force a tactical choice—she moves freely through without navigation cost or resource limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.1)
    The velvet observatory is vividly rendered with purpose-driven detail: sound-absorbing drapes, constellation charts, the prize jasmine vine. The midsummer twilight's "bruised purple" and the ice crystal violin's transparency create a cohesive sensory environment. The setting constrains action minimally—the observatory functions more as atmospheric backdrop than tactical pressure—but the final image of the puddle reflecting "stars not visible from Earth" charges the closure moment effectively. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.1)
    The grotto carved from "crystallized cloud" and "tethered to...aurora's magnetic breath" establishes vivid sensory anchors. The Silence rising "like a tide of glass" constrains Mira's time and movement, forcing her to work faster. The aurora provides cover ("movement large enough to hide within") which directly enables her tactics. The emerald chip's physical handling and the star's body on the "table of solidified aurora light" ground the scene in tactile detail that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    The umbral grotto is anchored with vivid, purposeful detail: "shadows pooled in its recesses with the quality of aged wine," the ancient oak rooted through cloud and stone, the scalloped floor visible only from height. The setting constrains Mara's journey—she must climb to see the spiral pattern, and that elevation triggers the encounter that shifts her understanding. The micro-setting of the tree branches functions as both physical obstacle and metaphor, directly charging the closure image when she descends with new comprehension. Sensory hierarchy reflects her caretaker priorities (the way air shifts before a pilgrim arrives) and the vineyard-hush tone permeates spatial description without becoming ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lighthouse at dawn, wind chimes, and hollow mirror shard work as micro-setting that charges the final image. The chimes constrain revelation (the narrator must decipher their song), and the shard's transformation—from showing nothing to reflecting gray space—anchors the conceptual closure. Sensory detail is filtered through the narrator's professional stance ("each combination of notes told stories the wind remembered"), and the salt air/October wind create atmospheric pressure without postcard excess.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.4)
    The floating platform and magnetic grotto are vividly anchored and the pond ripples provide concrete sensory focus. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it functions as backdrop. The "tenth ring inside the first" offers a charged image but arrives without micro-setting pressure that shapes the meditation's outcome, capping the category below 7.0 despite strong descriptive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bone towers, canyon echoes, and arrowhead constrain Yula's method: she reads vulture formations like sheet music, accesses temporal currents through acoustic resonance, and uses the arrowhead as a compass aligned with her heartbeat. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—dust as temporal marker, vulture shadows crossing her face in rhythm with the arrowhead's carvings, the pulse "ricocheting between the bone spires." The micro-setting (arrowhead, body stillness, acoustic environment) charges the final image when the wandering pulse returns as her own voice. Spatial choreography is clean; the towers, canyon, and Yula's fixed perch remain coherent across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    The icebound spire and cloud-sea setting are vivid and purposeful, grounding Mira's walk through impossible space. The keystone's rough surface and the ice flowers' "impossible colors" anchor the climactic realization, constraining her final understanding through tactile and visual particulars. Spatial choreography (spire door → mist → gardens → return) tracks cleanly, and sensory hierarchy (cold, luminance, texture) reflects her perceptual priorities under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sunken ship library is vividly rendered with "bloated volumes," "ankle-deep brine," and phosphorescent masts that guide Marlow's search. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. The hotel skeleton key tag recurs and the journal's alchemical treatment adds tactile specificity. However, the environment does not constrain a choice at closure—Marlow climbs to the deck and speaks her vow without spatial friction. The setting charges the mood but does not alter tactics in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ambered observatory deck functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: its tuning-fork nature enables Voss's role and constrains her to this preserved moment. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (purple-white bursts, warm amber walls, metallic song of coins). The nothing-space and collapsed-time physics remain coherent throughout. Spatial choreography is clean; the coins rise, orbit, and settle in tracked patterns that advance understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    The observatory functions as more than backdrop: the great lens enables the crystallization phenomenon, the clockwork marks time pressure, and the tower's acoustic properties reinforce the "echoes" motif. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (bruised sky, wax cylinders, brass instruments). The atlas page as micro-setting constrains the naming ritual and charges the final image when she tucks it into her coat. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the descent sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sapphire viaduct functions as a tuning fork, constraining Mira's choice of location and enabling the ritual through its crystalline resonance—this qualifies as micro-setting that shapes tactics. Dawn's temperature/humidity equilibrium is specified and necessary. Sensory detail (azure arches, translucent fish, pure water reflecting sky) is vivid and filtered through Mira's focus. The bell's broken edge and condensation mechanics ground the climax in concrete process, charging the final image when the bell hums without being struck.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Vivid, selective detail throughout: "rooftops emerged like ancient teeth," sapphire label catching moonlight, silt-filled fountain. The drowned pharmacy's warped door and preserved highest shelf create tactile specificity. The ridgeway and submerged structures constrain Marcus's physical path and guide his photographic choices. Spatial choreography remains clear across multiple locations (pharmacy, courthouse steps, school playground, town square). Minor slip: "midnight ridgeway at twilight" introduces temporal confusion in the required timeframe element, though the prose itself maintains dusk-to-darkness coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    The orchard with spiral pear trees, rainbow waterfall, and frozen dew crystal function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "air that tasted of centuries," "wild warmth of intention," prismatic light. The crystal's sublimation constrains Vera's choice—she cannot both preserve and release it—and the orchard's "ancient freshness" recurs to anchor her resolve. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the single continuous scene. Detail filters through Vera's alchemist perspective without catalog bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.4)
    The nocturnal arbor is vividly particular: bioluminescent moss, upside-down trees, phosphorescent beetles, aerial roots, fungal networks spanning miles of sky. These details are filtered through Maya's professional attention and constrain her final choice—the chemical-signal documentation she's withheld becomes the crucial leverage. The parachute buckle functions as micro-setting (body object under stress). The arbor's "soundless echo" quality charges the final image when "the forest itself were listening" becomes Maya's stance of witness. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single-location scene.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.4)
    The floating dojo, crystalline walls, and gravity generators establish a vivid SF frame early. Spatial choreography in the sparring sequence is clear (low gravity, mirrored movements, transparent floor revealing Earth). However, the setting remains largely decorative—the dojo's features don't constrain Marcus's choice; he could reach the same epiphany in a traditional dojo. The jar is handled twice (Chen lifts it, Marcus picks it up) but doesn't pressure the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    The echo chamber tunnel is vividly rendered with functional specificity: curved walls multiply sound, ventilation shafts connect to houses above, limestone pores transmit memory. The twelve leaf blowers arranged in a semicircle constrain Marcus's ritual through precise spatial choreography. Sensory selection is purposeful—sound dominates appropriately, with tactile and visual details (pull cord handles "gleaming like teeth," dust motes dancing) integrated into action. The tunnel's acoustics directly enable the central mechanism and the setting charges the final image of mechanical prayer ascending through stone.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.4)
    The frozen garden is vivid and consistent: "dead grass that crunched like broken glass," "ice-glazed topiaries," "cherub's face cracked down the middle." The setting pressures the guardian's isolation and charges the thaw at closure. Spatial choreography is clean (fountain, hedges, library entrance). The pendant functions as micro-setting, constraining her perception of dimensional boundaries. Minor slip: the library's "walls that curved impossibly" is asserted late without prior setup of impossible geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Ember Nexus is vividly realized ("crystalline formations pulsing with heat," "superheated air") and directly constrains Marcus's method—only extreme heat enables the transformation. The monastery's stone walls and reliquary anchor the backstory spatially. The staff's material properties evolve on the page (wood → ash → crystallized flame), and the Nexus's roar accompanies the creation, charging the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.1)
    The suspended tower city, maintenance ladder, and lunar perigee create vivid spatial and temporal anchors. Sensory details—mist, mineral rain, moon shadows, rung-pitch—are purposeful and filtered through Maya's professional lens. The fragment and copper filaments function as micro-setting that constrains her method. The gravitational sway during perigee directly enables the shard's appearance, charging the final discovery with environmental necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.1)
    The spectral grotto, starlight, and ferry deck provide vivid atmospheric anchors. Sensory detail is selective and mood-consistent: "limestone cliffs phased between solid and ethereal," "constellations that spelled different stories." The woman's "three reflections" in water is a strong micro-setting image. However, the environment remains decorative—spatial choices don't constrain Marcus's actions or alter his convergence plan. The compass in the final beat is a charged object, but it appears only after the hourglass shatters, so it doesn't guide prior tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    The optical illusion gallery supplies vivid, specific anchors (Penrose stairs, impossible triangle) and the sinew thread's texture is described concretely ("rough like doubt, smooth like certainty"). The environment constrains her method—she must work in a space where "certainty crumbled"—and the gallery's exhibits respond to her weaving, transforming from static to fluid. The final image charges the space itself (labyrinth of perception), lifting the setting beyond backdrop. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.4)
    The benthic city is vividly rendered with bioluminescent pearls, transparent corridors, crushing darkness, and pressure as embodied constraint. Sensory hierarchy matches POV (sonar, pressure gradients). The chain link is handled twice but remains ornamental—it resonates and serves as metaphor without altering a choice. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting does not constrain a closure choice or charge the final image beyond mood, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mist-clad atrium is rendered with layered sensory detail—amber light fragments, copper taste, orchids leaning away—that grounds Mara's movements and reflects her audiological focus. The photograph functions as a micro-setting object: it warms, faces fade, Mrs. Valdez's eyes track Mara, creating tactile pressure that narrows her search. Spatial choreography (atrium → green shadow caves → running into the night) is clear and the environment's moisture and twilight filter choices without becoming a postcard. The basement location is named but not entered, so the final constraint remains conceptual rather than physically dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.4)
    The flooded station's pressure is felt viscerally ("corridors like a throat swallowing her backward"), and the phase chamber's crystalline sphere constrains her final choice—she must use its field to recover Marcus. The forty-minute tidal clock and emergency lighting create tactical pressure. The gold-flecked journal charges the final image, and the cables function as both setting infrastructure and thematic spine. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the descent and ascent sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    The opal observatory under snow supplies concrete sensory grounding (snowflakes on glass, unheated space, breath clouding) and the setting constrains action—the isolation enables the ink-pattern ritual without interruption. The porcelain shard on the desk anchors physicality against digital abstraction. Spatial choreography is clear: desk, monitors, dome overhead. The "gentle darkness" and falling snow charge the final image, supporting the tone of midnight solace. Minor: the radio's function (why interference matters, what cleared it) remains vague, slightly weakening the environmental logic.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bone towers, canyon, and copper veins create a vivid micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "dried lavender crumbling," "silk dragged across bark." The setting constrains her method (she uses the towers' resonance, carves with her nails) and the starlings' negative space becomes a spatial tactic. The only slip: the shift to "years later" abstracts the physical continuity, but the return image of her as a tower re-anchors strongly.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.1)
    The underground garden supplies vivid, purposeful detail—upward-floating lavender, spiraling moss, phosphorescent fungi—that establishes the gravitational playfulness and charges the atmosphere. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the transition from underground to "above ground, thunder rolled" lacks a concrete anchor. The gravity pockets constrain action (the arrowhead tumbling upward, soil dancing) and the garden's defiance of physics mirrors the thematic question, elevating the setting beyond decoration and linking it to the closure image of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sky-bridge's "iron lattice work humming with industrial frequencies" and "rivets" ground the opening. The locust shell functions as micro-setting, constraining Lira's tactical choice (she studied it, holds it to light, weaves its memory into playing). Trees "welded into productive angles," "harvest-optimization devices," and "compacted growing grids" create a vivid mechanized orchard whose physical constraints the music then breaks. Spatial choreography is clean: statues patrol below, one approaches the bridge's base, the eldest climbs toward her. The bridge's metal bones resonate with her music, making setting an active participant in the climax. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: initially selective (wind through metal), expanding as transformation spreads.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt arcade is vividly rendered with sensory detail (neon tubes, hole in roof, game screens) and provides spatial coherence for the drone ballet. The setting supplies the neutral-ground history that charges Ezra's mission. The bottle's electric light illuminating abandoned screens creates a purposeful lyric callback at closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting or object charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    The train-car workshop, hidden garden, and angel carousel constrain Emil's path and charge the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: sawdust through light, fog breathing, moss on painted horses. The fragment's light and wind bells' extended chime supply concrete environmental pressure. Spatial choreography is clean (third car workshop → corridor → curtain → circular garden). The garden functions as micro-setting that enables the singing turn, qualifying for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    The library's non-Euclidean architecture is vivid and specific (aisle seven-and-a-half, spiral staircase, shelves breathing), and the scarf functions as micro-setting that recurs with tactile detail. The setting pressures Marcus's search and charges the final image when the infinite shelves "fold through dimensions." However, the environment does not visibly constrain a choice—Marcus moves freely, and no door, distance, or rule blocks his path at a decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    The archipelago, dawn light, glass palette, and skiff constrain Mara's movements and methods throughout. Sensory hierarchy is consistent: molten copper water, salt-stained books, morning mist interacting with refracted light. The smallest island serves as the closure location with purposeful geographic selection. However, the floating library and individual islands remain lightly sketched; spatial choreography of the rowing and palette positioning is clear but the islands themselves lack tactile specificity that would deepen the sense of place under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.7)
    The shadowed nexus under the archway is vividly rendered with impossible angles and upward-falling shadow, and it does constrain Vera's approach (she must wait for the first star, step into the specific shadow). Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, filtered through a voice attuned to cosmic strangeness. The setting participates in closure—starlight carries "the faint echo of liberated possibility"—charging the final image. Minor: the nexus's spatial choreography (seven passages, which archway, where Vera stands) blurs during the climactic beat, and the lock of hair glowing as "fiber optic cable" introduces a register clash between mythic and technological imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sunken greenhouse is vividly rendered with salt-crystallized benches, barnacled walls, and shattered constellation-etched glass. Spatial choreography is clean (floor, shelves, panes overhead, central ring) and sensory details serve mood without catalog excess. The fairy ring itself constrains the final action (Margaret must kneel, place the mushroom, reach in) and the constellation maps charge the closure by becoming "whole in her memory now," satisfying the 9+ gate test. Micro-setting (the ring, the greenhouse architecture) drives the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    The forgotten library's micro-setting (marble floor, dusty light, tower of crumbling atlases) is vivid and purposeful; Elara's backward heel-clicks on marble embody her nervous state without exposition. The shadow-glass and tea-cup function as tool-settings that constrain the annotation method. The playground-swing timeframe image bookends the piece, shifting from suspended memory to "something new beginning," charging the closure. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. Minor gap: the Mirror Realm itself remains abstract; one concrete detail of what exile looks like would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.1)
    The verdant parapet, waterfall, and boundary between worlds create a vivid, purposeful setting that directly enables the planting action—Mira uses the waterfall's mist as "thread" and the parapet's stone for the seed depression. Sensory details are filtered through the POV and support the tone (mist, moss, rainbows at sunrise). The setting constrains the choice by requiring "both soils, both suns, both moons," which shapes Mira's method. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single-location scene, and the environment directly participates in the closure image when "the first true ray of sunrise struck the waterfall."

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Prism Sanctuary is vividly rendered with crystal walls fracturing moonlight and prisms humming at key beats. The setting actively constrains and enables: starlight focuses to illuminate masks, the sanctuary's hush deepens to mark spirit presence. The tapestry needle and hemp net function as micro-setting elements that charge the final arrangement. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the restoration sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rain-scoured vault is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (rain hammering skylights, water stains spreading like continents, flaking fresco eyes). The torn map becomes a micro-setting that constrains her investigation and charges the final image when she presses her palm to it. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The vault's physical properties—damage, water, UV light—enable her discovery and guide her choices, elevating the setting beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sunken library functions as micro-setting that constrains Marina's choices: the contracting air pocket creates a ticking clock, the desk and journal are untouched by specific quirks of pressure architecture, and the brass handles' verdigris signals seventy-three years underwater. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Marina's professional lens: "darkness thick as centuries," "verdigris," "phantom currents." The snow globe's miniature recursion and the library's impending flood charge the final image directly. Spatial choreography remains clear across the descent, interior exploration, and ascent without floating-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    The misty courtyard, floating monastery, and luminescent graffiti are vivid and purposeful. The flower press bolt plate anchors tactile action and the storm's electromagnetic window constrains the ghost's clarity, directly shaping Chorus's timing. Spatial choreography is clean (courtyard center, workshop, walls). The micro-setting (bolt plates, fog droplets) charges the final image of "encoded gardens," meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint and closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound spire, elevator mechanics (gears clicking like a grandfather clock, ice cracking from cables), and the observatory's panoramic windows create a coherent vertical world. Sensory details—frost-etched windows, misted breath, ice crystals in updraft—reflect Mira's emotional and physical ascent. The astrolabe functions as micro-setting: its placement constrains the diary's discovery and charges the final image when she sits in Thorne's chair. Spatial choreography remains clear across ten floors and the transition into quarters.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sky gondola functions as micro-setting that constrains Elena's drift and enables her untethered observation work. Sensory details (brass warming, gondola sway, dusty starlight) are vivid and purposeful, filtered through Elena's professional meteorologist lens. The telescope as recurring object charges the closure when she "held the brass telescope against the brightening sky," reweighting her mission. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tree trunk library is vividly particular: "carved shelves...worn smooth by generations," "ladder marks in the bark," "gaps" for moonbeam entry. Spatial choreography remains coherent across Lyra's movements from shelves to safe to mirror positioning. The setting constrains her final choice—she must work within the hollow's geometry to arrange light—and charges the closure image ("sky inside walls" becomes literal via the trunk's apertures). Sensory detail is weighted toward touch and sound ("wood's memory: whispered debates"), fitting the POV's professional filter. The 4:47 AM timestamp and demolition machines provide both urgency and a ticking environmental presence.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    The antique airship, brass hull, navigation chamber, and hopscotch board are vivid and purposeful anchors. The hopscotch board constrains the cipher-solving choice and charges the final understanding ("How to find your way home"). Sensory details—rust stains, tea leaves, creaking timbers, wind through rigging—are filtered through Elara's pattern-seeking POV and integrated into her observations. Spatial choreography (observation deck, porthole, wheel) remains coherent throughout, and the airship's winding engine subtly underscores isolation and physical labor.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    The frozen library's ice walls, frost-covered door, mirrors, and suspended-above-clouds placement create vivid sensory grounding with clear spatial anchors (northeastern corner, reading podium, hall of mirrors). Micro-setting qualification: the grandfather's gears function as tactile objects that hum and sing when touched by wind, and their interlocking pattern constrains Elara's final choice—she must learn their rhythm rather than force the vault. The library's transparency shift at the end (walls becoming transparent to show village below and vault above) charges the final image by making stakes visible. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through locksmith focus (feeling for tumblers, hearing gears hum, seeing reflections of past selves).

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.1)
    Pomona-7's floating stone arches, crimson sky, and orchard groves create a vivid micro-setting. The arches function spatially (Marina drifts among them, watches from the highest) and the networked fungi constrain the solution—only cross-property root systems cure the blight. Sensory details are selective (chalk dust, bell chime, brass butterflies catching light) and the ending image of the bell mounted at the fountain charges the final beat. The piece stays within its established world rules and the floating arches recur meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse setting is rendered with strong sensory detail ("bruised plum and copper," "pane of hush") and the lens apparatus becomes the instrument of closure, constraining Marcus's final action. Spatial choreography is clean (keeper's quarters → spiral stairs → lamp room ascent). The "pane of hush" recurs purposefully, and the lens refraction directly charges the ending image, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment shaping closure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, and inverted trees create a vivid, specific setting that pressures Mara's choices throughout. The environment actively shapes her path: the birds herd travelers back, the frost imposes a hard deadline, and the stone corridors provide spatial grounding. The walnut functions as micro-setting, a tactile anchor that charges the final image. The gauge on her wrist and the temperature tracking add embodied detail. The setting's constraint—touching the trees means joining them—directly shapes the stakes and her guidance method, and the final frost "sealing the labyrinth until dawn" reinforces the cyclical trap.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.1)
    The braided ravine is established early and returns at closure with thematic weight. Sensory detail (white foam helices, iridescent morpho wings) is selective and filtered through Marina's scientific gaze. The ravine's physical properties (converging streams, foam patterns) directly enable the insight that drives resolution. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting earns its keep but doesn't constrain a mid-story choice—it functions primarily as catalyst and mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Glass Orchard Library floating on clouds with transparent trunk, glass branches, crystalline leaves is vividly rendered and sustained. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Merrick's professional lens (memory jars, droplets forming on walls). The bottled moonlight returns with reweighted meaning at closure, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear; the child enters, Merrick works, she leaves. The setting does not constrain a tactical choice during the procedure itself—no environmental pressure forces adaptation—but the library's trembling when endings dissolve and apples filling with new light functionally reconfigure the conceptual stakes, meeting the micro-setting threshold for high-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    The desert fortress after rain is vividly rendered with specific detail: ancient depressions, geometric ridges carved by centuries, tidal pools reflecting constellations. The rain functionally constrains the narrative by awakening the coral pavilion and enabling Miran's discovery. The micro-setting of the tidal pool becomes the locus of the climactic choice, and spatial choreography remains clear throughout (kneeling, touching pools, standing). The pools as setting elements directly charge the final image when they turn "clear as glass" and reflect stars "without sorrow."

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    The astronomical clock tower and grain elevators are vividly rendered with purposeful detail (brass gears, corrugated walls as vocal cords, glass dome). Spatial choreography is clear throughout Marta's climb and descent, and the cuckoo clock weight's arc provides micro-setting constraint. However, the environment remains largely a stage rather than shaping choices: the tower amplifies sound, but Marta's plan proceeds without environmental complication or resource scarcity. Sensory selection leans heavily visual and auditory; touch, taste, and proprioception are absent even during the stair climb and weight-rigging.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.7)
    Moonlit canyon, submarine graveyard, and the broken periscope mirror provide vivid anchors. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric (silver spirals, fractured Fibonacci sequence). The mirror constrains Vera's project and charges the final image as a "rosetta stone," meeting the 9+ gate for setting participation. However, spatial choreography within the wreck remains impressionistic—exact proximity, posture, and movement through the space are not tracked, and the canyon's geology, while evocative, does not alter her tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    The serpentine grotto is vividly realized through mist, inverted gravity, and crystalline nodes that function as natural recording devices. Spatial choreography during the gravity shift is coherent (kicking off stalactites, navigating crawlways), and the grotto's threshold nature directly enables the climactic revelation. The recurring doodle object charges the final image when Orin replicates it with luminous ink. Micro-setting (body in zero-gravity, confined passages) constrains movement and choice throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    The porcelain insulator and the alder's stress cracks function as micro-setting, constraining Mira's method and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "scarred with stress cracks," "glazed surface," "warm in her hand." The grove itself remains mostly atmospheric; spatial choreography is minimal but legible. The insulator's evolving state (warm, then etched) crosses the gate for setting-as-constraint, elevating the score into the 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    The magnetic nexus functions as more than postcard: the iron-rich cliffs, compass confusion, and magnetite board constrain the chess game's mechanics and supply a physical correlate to Viktor's philosophy. The worry stone's dent is handled twice with tactile specificity, and the aurora's appearance charges the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout the single-location scene.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    The workshop is vivid and purposeful: tin roof, copper dials, military radios, singing bowls, and Victorian music boxes all constrain Mara's method and charge the final orchestral moment when the clasp sings. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—"dense quiet of snow at midnight, the hollow pause before thunder"—reflecting Mara's professional obsession. The fireworks' whistle and pause function as micro-setting that times and pressures the ending. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout; the diary on the workbench, the open door, and the cascading sensory catalog create a lived-in technical space that directly enables the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    The treetop village is vivid and functional: rope bridges, platforms around trunks, mist rising "like steam from a witch's cauldron," and the suspended garden with lightning-struck soil all ground the world in tactile specifics. The setting pressures Mira's choices—she must learn to "find stillness while perpetually swaying," and the canopy's motion becomes a metaphor that reappears at closure when she "swayed with it, rooted at last." Dew collected from spider webs at dawn, the highest platform, and the village's constant creak under wind are filtered through her olfactory focus and her need for serenity. Minor: spatial choreography of other apprentices and Master Thorne's exact proximity remains vague, and the village's social structure (how elders enforce patience, why mockery doesn't escalate) is under-explored, but the micro-setting of soil and suspended garden clearly constrains her cultivation work.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.1)
    Vivid, purposeful sensory work: "whirling silence," "water flows skyward," floating arches create a distinct micro-setting. The skiff's magnetic anchors and the Inversion's gravity flip constrain Kessa's moves and charge the grove discovery. The arrow tip—handled in soil yesterday, pressed into the monument at closure—functions as micro-setting that enables the final reveal. Spatial choreography (water split, spherical grove, monument at center) remains clear and stakes are altered by environment.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.1)
    The container labyrinth is vividly realized: steel canyons eight-high, metallic passages, containers leaning inward like steel flowers. Wind patterns bending at impossible angles and instruments screaming contradictory readings ground the anomaly in sensory texture. The setting directly shapes Maya's investigative path and device placement, and the convergence point's spatial logic constrains her approach. The final gold-painted containers charge the closing image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for environmental constraint at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ice cavern functions well: formations become instrument strings, trapped air bubbles are "frozen notes," and the natural amphitheater shapes the climactic performance. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Lyrian's synesthetic perception (turquoise sound tasting of cinnamon, magenta harmonies smelling of ozone). The amber sheet on its pedestal and the striker against ice walls constrain her method and charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting/object must constrain choice or charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Thunder-echo range's "avalanchingly quiet" silence and the canyon's sound-swallowing hush create coherent atmospheric pressure. The gilded reed flute functions as micro-setting, handled across beats and charged at closure. Driftwood markers appear twice with shifting meaning (safety/message). The shimmering air "where reality grew thin" grounds the threshold physically. Spatial choreography (descent, canyon floor, climb back) tracks cleanly. The mountains "leaning in" at the braiding moment charges the final image with environmental participation.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    The topaz workshop under vanishing stars is vivid and constrains Mira's work: "crystalline walls caught and refracted the diminishing starlight into prismatic patterns across her printing plates." The constellation Empatheia's erasure functions as both setting pressure and timeframe, narrowing from seven to four stars. The letterpress and halo fragment are handled concretely across beats. The final star "held on, defiant" charges the closure image with environmental resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.1)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway is vividly rendered with magnetic pulse, weathered stone vertebrae, and electromagnetic song, and it constrains Elara's choice to test the relic there. Sensory detail (iridescent pendant, gossamer robes, translucent figures) is selective and filtered through her courier's attention. The ridgeway's thinning boundary between physical and ephemeral directly enables the Convergence scene, charging the final image when the pendant catches "the last of the aurora's light." Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    The quartz arbor and prism are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail ("crystallized breath," "frost forming...in patterns"). The arbor's mist and pillars create atmospheric constraint—morning warmth will erase the frost, creating urgency. The prism's physical state (frost forming despite warmth) drives the key beat. However, spatial choreography within the arbor remains vague; Vera's body and movements lack tactile grounding beyond "pressed her palm" and "lifted...carefully."

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bamboo forest encroaching on the orchard functions as both atmosphere and constraint—it "conquered the orchard for good reason," creating the isolation necessary for the weaving work. The amber bead, loom, and silence operate as micro-setting elements that constrain choice. The "raveling silence" is sensory and purposeful, pulling apart sound to enable transmission. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting directly shapes the final choice by providing the necessary isolation and ancestral workspace.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    The floating arches and orchard planet provide a vivid frame; cherry blossoms falling upward charges the final image. The mine shafts supply access but their mechanics ("reality grew thin") remain vague. Spatial choreography is clean. The anvil of floating stone participates in the forging beat, and the twin suns are noticed. The setting pressures one choice (descent) and recurs at closure, meeting the 9+ test partially, but the world rules lack specificity when they matter most.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.1)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay is anchored early and recurs across parallel versions (bioluminescent fungi, sideways gravity, underwater), creating vivid sensory variety. The setting's final reframing as a place of restoration charges the ending image. However, the bay functions more as thematic backdrop than tactical constraint; Kira's navigation choices are not shaped by spatial access or resource scarcity within the bay itself. The green glass shard and nexus do more causal work than the repair bay's physical layout.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lighthouse, dock, beach, spiral stairs, and lantern room are anchored with purpose-driven detail. The sea glass functions as micro-setting (warmth, phosphorescence) and constrains the closure beat by symbolizing safety. Spatial choreography is clean; the climb and the lantern room's glass walls charge the final confrontation. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elsa's observant POV (phosphorescent foam, salt and cold). The stacked stones serve as both setting and communication system, directly shaping the plot and ending.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Emerald Lighthouse setting is vividly anchored early with strong sensory detail (spiral stairs, worn grooves, condensed starlight). The glass lantern wick's geometric properties return across beats and constrain Mira's method. However, spatial choreography during the climax becomes vague—the three ships "converge at the lighthouse's base" without clear blocking, and the mirror-twin's inverse world lacks concrete grounding. The stars rearranging into constellations at the end charges the final image but the wick's "new configuration" remains abstract rather than a tactile constraint on future choices.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating tea house, sun trails, and morpho wing constrain choices and charge the closure image. The wing is handled twice (Chen holds it, Kael lifts it) and returns in the final beat, reweighted from "first collection" to a working tool/reminder. Spatial choreography is clean (veranda, table, valley below) and the tea house's drift mirrors thematic motion. Sensory detail is purposeful—"tea that sparkled with suspended starlight," "chains of woven light"—and filtered through Kael's dye-master lens. The sun trails function as both navigation mechanic and atmospheric anchor, meeting the micro-setting standard.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    The storm-lit tower with broken dome, moonlight streaming through, and the labyrinth's mathematical carvings create a vivid, specific environment. Micro-setting excels: the sextant's mirrors projecting fragments, the ivy growing through the dome, and spatial choreography (spiral stairs, central chamber, observation deck) remains clean. The broken instrument becomes a tool that constrains and enables Marcus's final choice—realigning it to catch maximum moonlight—charging the closure image with the interplay of reflected light and shadow.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    The greenhouse setting is vivid and purposeful: iron framework, singing trees, mica window all recur and constrain action. The mica window resonates with sound, signaling the shift; the trees respond to song; the endless night frames urgency. Sensory detail is selective ("rattled like maracas filled with dead seeds") and filtered through Elara's memory-keeper role. The setting charges the final image—light generated by communal memory in an alchemical space—meeting the 9+ gate test. Minor slip: "mirror world" remains slightly generic as a larger frame.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.1)
    The library's impossible architecture ("defying the building's exterior dimensions") and liminal midnight moment constrain the encounter's tone and Ezra's teaching choice. The crumpled invitation functions as micro-setting, handled twice and charging the final image when matched by the woman's folded telegram. Sensory detail remains selective (clock chime, raised seal through paper) and filtered through Ezra's practiced calm. The train station below is mentioned but never pressures action; the third-floor perch stays ornamental rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    The overgrown palace courtyard and secret tea house are vivid and purposeful; jasmine vines, thornrose hedge, and midnight lettuce create a lived-in guerrilla space. The tea house's paper screens and the bread's waxed-paper wrapping constrain Lila's approach (she must notice, must follow). Spatial choreography is clean. The setting charges the final image (courtyard as sanctuary) and enables the closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.1)
    The frozen library is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (crystalline spires, breath crystallizing, ice cracking underfoot), and the vault's failing magic directly constrains Elara's choices—she can save only fifty slides. The quartz hush and luminous slides create a coherent atmosphere. However, the setting's physical mechanics (how a structure "hangs suspended" in clouds, how warmth "seeps from walls like blood from stone") remain metaphorical rather than tactile, and spatial choreography within the vault is generic. The final image of the library falling "in perfect silence" charges closure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    The pirate market beneath the rotting pier is vividly rendered with candlelit chaos, dripping beams, and contraband vendors. Spatial choreography is clear as Mae moves through the maze; the setting pressures her infiltration attempts and her father's old routes ground her access. The watch fob—a small recurring object—constrains the key choice when its hidden compartment reveals the badge, charging the final image on the beach. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mae's urgency without catalog-listing.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lavender bluff and aurora provide vivid atmospheric grounding, and the tin compass ring returns with reweighted sensory meaning (copper-sweet to iron-ozone). However, setting functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraint; the forest election and bluff location do not meaningfully narrow Marina's tactical options or shape her final realization. The micro-setting (ring on tongue) charges several beats but does not constrain the closure choice, capping high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    Cave setting actively constrains movement (narrowing passages) and supplies materials (crystal surface, moisture) that enable the climactic drawing. Sensory hierarchy filters through grief and artistic perception (cadmium yellow on purple, crystals humming). Spatial choreography tracks descent, discovery, creation, ascent without floating. The crystal surface itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final act: drawing directly on stone rather than sketchbook. Minor: "aurora of colors" at dawn generic rather than cave-specific reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.8)
    The greenhouse city under toxic sky, breathing leaves as communication medium, maintenance tunnel "sweating condensation that smelled of copper and regret," and crystallized messages in the dead zones create a coherent micro-ecology that constrains every choice. The ventilation system and temperature differential at the toxic barrier are not mere backdrop but enable the story's central mechanism (trapped sound crystallizing). The breathing leaves return at closure, anchoring Vera's transcription work and charging the final image with the wilting/truth trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tower setting is vivid and functional: the spiral stairs, cloud-sea, gimbals, and counterweights ground the action and enable Mariel's work. The iceberg fragment functions as micro-setting, constraining her timeline and charging the final moment when it melts completely against the bronze. Sensory details (turquoise threads, coral wisps, glististen effect) are filtered through Mariel's professional attention and the bells themselves act as both tool and environment, shaping the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glass dome and rose garden function as more than backdrop—synthetic soil, atmospheric pressure effects, and the refracted light through the dome all constrain the controlled burn's mechanics. The "strangely organic" roses with blood-like roots charge the final image when new shoots emerge from ash-enriched soil. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the ritual sequence. The setting pressures the central action: dome ecosystem fragility limits burn intensity, making M-47's precision tactically necessary.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    The courtyard is vividly rendered with sensory anchors (amber walls, basil, hopscotch) and recurs as a spatial frame that charges the closure ("this home"). The locket and mailbox function as micro-setting objects that constrain plot moves and enable the ending image. Dawn and the shelter exterior provide texture but do not alter tactics. The 9+ gate (environment/object constrains choice or charges final image) is satisfied by the locket and courtyard, though some description (sparrows, breadcrumbs) is decorative rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.1)
    The flooded laboratory supplies vivid, purposeful detail: green-filtered light, brackish water at knee-depth, submerged desks that allow the dice's impossible balance. The water's tidal rhythm and the spiral formation at closure charge the final image with spatial specificity. Sensory selection modulates appropriately (splashes are "deliberate," eddies "mirror" screen patterns) and the space constrains Maya's movement vocabulary. The sunken setting enables the convergence of grandmother's research, coded journal, and Maya's inherited dance, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping closure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.1)
    The salt crystal chamber, coffee grounds, and cemetery function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the translucent coffin's discovery drives the pivot, and the gravity pockets physically embody the weight of extracted grief. The final image—flames bending toward cemetery and whale—charges closure by making the city's architecture of forgetting visible. Spatial choreography (docks → chamber → cemetery → grave) tracks cleanly across moves.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    The nocturnal haven is vividly anchored: brook-mist, flat stone, reeds, and the water's murmur all constrain and enable her ritual. The brook itself becomes a tool—she maps silence across the glade, uses water to carry prophecy fragments, and the final image of footprints smoothed by the brook charges closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her decades of communion; the morning light's transformation of the space into "something altogether different—brighter but somehow less real" reweights the setting at closure. The environment supplies resources (water's white noise, moth-thoughts, owl-dreams) and the spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the night-long working.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    The rooftop garden, meteor shower, brownstone facade, and desk seal are vivid and purposeful. The seal appears in Elara's pocket, is examined by Marcus, and pressed into his palm, constraining the teaching moment at closure. Sensory detail is selective: Earl Grey steam, wrought-iron groan, meteor trails. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the rooftop and implied apartment below. The seal as micro-setting charges the final exchange, lifting the score into the 7-band despite the broader setting being largely atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.1)
    The velvet garden is vividly established with selective, mood-driven detail: purple blooms that "absorb the dying light," petals brushing ankles, dirt under fingernails. The garden constrains Marina's search spatially and supplies the buried shell half, directly enabling the climactic discovery. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency as the night progresses. The seashell itself functions as micro-setting, its "resonance structures" and "calcium carbonate lattices" grounding the memory mechanism in tactile, specific detail that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, and stalactites create a vivid, purposeful frame that charges the atmosphere and final image. Spatial choreography is clean (altar, lamp, stairs). The setting constrains Mei's solitude and provides the key's lock (the altar), meeting the 9+ gate requirement. However, much description remains postcard-level—"frost-glazed apertures," "jade shadows"—without altering tactics or choices. The rose thorn and key function more as talismanic objects than environmental constraints. Sensory hierarchy reflects contemplation rather than urgency, which fits the tone but limits pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    The serpentine nexus functions as more than backdrop: its acoustic properties constrain Senna's discovery and the canyon's "natural spiral" enables the transformation, directly shaping the closure. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—"red rock amphitheater," "weathered surfaces catching starlight like scales"—filtered through Senna's musician's perception. The shell fragment as tactile object charges multiple beats (warm in palm, dissolving into sound). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single location.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.4)
    The glacier shrine is vividly rendered with sensory specificity: candles carving rivulets, ice walls blooming with visions, candlelight refracting formulas. The melted snow globe's warped plastic edges are felt through diving gloves, anchoring tactile detail. The setting charges the closure by providing the constellation map, meeting the 9+ test for constraint. Minor deduction: the shrine's perpetual candles and Marina's fifteen-year career are told rather than shown affecting present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    The whispering parapet is vividly anchored: rain-scent, worn stones, jasmine vines, fireflies tracing routes. Sensory detail is filtered through the net-mender's philosophical attention, avoiding catalog description. Micro-setting note: the bamboo whisk and net function as object-setting, constraining her hands and charging the final image. The parapet's "stories thrumming beneath her palms" and the "frequency" of wingbeats, tidewaters, and grain-grinding create a resonant atmosphere that supports theme. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter her tactics—she climbs, works, descends as planned—limiting the score's reach into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    The orchard's stillpoint field and the Geiger counter's shifting clicks anchor the radioactive wasteland concretely. Dust storms bookend the piece (opening laziness, closing envelopment) and the ancient apple tree at the orchard's center becomes the spatial anchor for the climax. The diamond's physical flaw ("frozen lightning bolt") charges the final image when Marcus re-buries it. Spatial choreography is clear: tent outside orchard, fallen tree with metal box, center tree. Minor gap: the tent's exact location relative to the stillpoint boundary is vague, and the mechanics of how Marcus digs "multiple holes throughout the orchard" in the brief window before the dust storm aren't fully visualized.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cobalt glass portico and storm-lit observatory provide vivid, purposeful detail that constrains Marlowe's broadcast work and charges several beats. Sensory specificity is strong ("rain slash across her face," "cerulean shadows that bent impossibly"), though some details drift into ornamental register ("history's lungs," "tomorrow tastes like copper"). The portico's resonance at lightning strike opens the piece and its "dawn song" closes it, creating a purposeful frame. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    The feral loft beneath the dunes and the boardwalk setting are vivid and specific (warped boards, salt-stiffened blanket, rotting pier post). The music box physically moves through the story (wrapped in his shirt, wound by Elena) and the "sound jars" provide tactile detail. The beach walk and Elena's bench anchor spatial progression. The loft recurs at the ending and now houses visitors, demonstrating evolution tied to plot. However, the environment does not constrain a pivotal choice—it frames action but does not narrow options at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    The drift-ice marina, frozen metal door, spiral stairs, and vault are spatially coherent and charge the atmosphere. The crypt keeper's key (warm bronze against Arctic cold) and the artifact's suspension field function as micro-setting elements that constrain her final choice: she uses the key in its socket to initiate the ritual. The fleeting golden sunset paints the scene and subtly pressures her timeline. Sensory detail—vibrations through her skull, bioluminescent patterns—is filtered through her professional and mystical priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and moonlit ice are vividly rendered with selective, POV-filtered detail: "hexagonal faces glazed with ice," "magnetic pull…humming beneath centuries of volcanic rock." The copper rods placed in basalt cracks and the frozen lake's reflection guide Kira's perimeter walk, constraining her choices spatially. The moon's thirty-seven-degree position above the horizon anchors time and method. The setting charges the final image as dawn colors the frozen lake, reinforcing the quiet transformation theme. Sensory hierarchy reflects Kira's mapper focus: magnetic hum, cold stone, crystallizing breath.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    The subway tunnel is anchored early with vivid rain/grate acoustics and historical layering (natural caves, Underground Railroad passages). Margot handles the lantern twice (lift, set down), and the brass/glass details recur, but the tunnel never constrains a tactical choice—she exits freely at will. The fourteen-month drought bookends the piece and the rain functions symbolically, yet neither weather nor tunnel layout alters Margot's decision. Sensory hierarchy (echo, brass smoothness) reflects investigator precision, elevating description above postcard level.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.1)
    The shop's dust motes, fractured light beams, and shelves of frozen dancers anchor spatial grounding and charge the final image when "light caught every brass surface, every crystal window." The clockwork heart's gears "smaller than rice grains" constrain Eliza's repair attempts, and Marcus's settling onto a worn stool tracks body placement through the work session. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "vibrant hush, like the moment before a music box spring releases" reflects Eliza's professional idiom. The environment participates in the closure: "flooding the shop with light" as the mechanism ticks to life makes the physical space witness and instrument of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop on acid sea pontoons is vivid and consistent, with green phosphorescence and corroded wings establishing atmospheric pressure. The kaleidoscope apparatus built from salvaged lenses grounds Pioneer's transformation in tactile detail. The acid sea functions as both threat (seventeen dissolved predecessors) and eventual medium for Pioneer's luminescent equations. The arrow tip's physical presence anchors the conceptual work. However, the setting's constraint collapses at closure—the acid that should dissolve instead enables, undermining the established danger without explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archive setting is vivid and specific: "towers of obsolete servers," "substrata," "spaces between legitimate data packets." Micro-setting (the mission patch) recurs and charges the final moment. Setting constrains choice: the archive's structure guides her descent through layers, and the Apollo-X frequency link makes the discovery feel inevitable. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Minor gap: the "office between floors" detail could pressure one mid-scene choice more directly to reach the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse orchard above grinding ice floes is vividly established and the warmth-from-understanding conceit provides clear sensory contrast. The vintage store's mirrors and the apple trees are described with specificity. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop rather than constraining choice—Mira moves through the space without spatial obstacles or resource pressures. The orchard's impossibility is told more than felt through action.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail: "bobbing floe," "minus-forty air," "neural pathways or river deltas or the very cracks." The parasol tip functions as micro-setting, its lace edges cutting her palm in the final gesture. The ice's breaking song constrains her vigil choices and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean (observation post, supply tent, transport helicopter). The setting demonstrably shapes her stance and the ending's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.1)
    The amber pavilion recurs purposefully across time—meeting place, bonfire site, final teaching space—and "amber light" charges the closure image with continuity. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "honey crystallizing in air," "taillights dissolving into dusk," wine imagery throughout. The burned letter edge functions as micro-setting, handled twice (pocket, then fluttering between them), and the vineyard's intermingled rows ground the metaphor in spatial fact. The autumn season and fading light modulate tone and constrain the timeline (darkness gathering), pushing the encounter into intimacy. Minor slip: the pavilion's "worn bench" and "creaking door" are mentioned but not integrated into Marcus's physical choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.7)
    The murmuring pavilion, kinetic parapet, and whisperfield details create vivid atmosphere and the maps-of-light moment offers concrete spatial grounding. The parapet's "movements growing more purposeful" in response to consecration shows environment responding to action. However, micro-setting choices (fountain waters, spiral stairs, crystalline pillars) remain largely descriptive; none constrains a tactical choice at a peak beat. The 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is narrowly missed—the parapet participates thematically but does not force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lavender field behind rusted factory ruins is vividly anchored and the dove gray case functions as micro-setting with tactile specificity. The field constrains the exhibition design (coordinates, human arcs) and charges the final image where "dawn light caught the rusted factory bones." Sensory detail is purpose-driven—"purple blooms," "soot and steam," "worn smooth as river stones"—and the industrial-versus-botanical contrast threads through. The field reaches the 9+ gate test by shaping multiple choices and appearing in the closure image, but the space itself never imposes a surprise obstacle or alters tactics under pressure in the middle; it remains backdrop rather than active constraint across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.1)
    The library at dawn is vivid and purposeful: fogged glass, dust motes, shelves "breathing like sleeping animals" anchor the setting's alive-language theme. The crystal functions as micro-setting, refracting light into "impossible colors" and revealing hidden words, which charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (windows, reading room, door) and the dawn light progression tracks causally. However, the setting does not constrain Elena's choices—she could testify anywhere—so it operates more as thematic mirror than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.1)
    The fog sculpture garden, driftwood labyrinth, and television wall constrain navigation and choice throughout. Sensory detail—"salt-weathered wood," "electromagnetic ghosts flickered in the fog," "ocean pulled at the shore"—is filtered through Ezra's prophet-salvager lens. Micro-setting elements (chalk, static, VHS tapes) charge the final image: the chalk "wearing away like years" reweights the temporal theme. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (boardwalk → labyrinth center → television wall). The tidal rhythm mirrors the memory-decay dynamic without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lunar observatory tethered by carbon cables supplies concrete constraints—tremors threaten the station's position in space-time, and the observation dome's glass serves as both barrier and lens. The tuning fork "modified to resonate at the frequency of falling leaves" functions as a specific tool that enables the climactic recalibration. The spinning clock hand's silver blur casting "strange shadows across her workbench" integrates sensory detail with the escalating mechanical crisis, and the final image of Earth's blue curve overlaying her reflection charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    The rooftop garden—Radiant Haven, tenth floor, bamboo, fountain, clouds at eye level—is vividly rendered and recurs across the arc. The vinyl fragment and harp case anchor micro-setting. The rooftop's elevation and light charge the final gathering, and the glass walls create a spatial boundary between Maya and the morning shift. The framed vinyl mounted on the garden wall provides a concrete object that constrains the ending tableau. Sensory detail is selective (chamomile/honey scent, elevator ding, cart squeak) and filtered through Maya's professional ear for sound-as-music, though the hospice interior below remains generic.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    The floating isle, observatory machinery (brass gears, crystal lenses, silver threads), and the automaton are vividly drawn and purposefully used. The automaton's exposed clockwork heart and reversed writing directly shape Lyra's choices. Spatial choreography is clean (spiral stairs → dome → center). Small friction: the observatory's function could have been cued earlier; it arrives as a revelation rather than a constraint shaping tactics mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    The hedge maze, secret garden with jasmine/roses, moss-covered bench, and fountain with handprints create layered spatial anchors. The broken bird's nest becomes a micro-setting object that Thomas repairs with spider silk, demonstrating his philosophy and charging the closure theme. Sensory detail (dappled sunlight, twilight colors "belonging to neither day nor night") reflects POV priorities and supports tone. The garden's "both worlds could touch" function constrains Elara's presence and enables Thomas's healing work, meeting the 9+ gate for setting-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    The serpentine grotto with mist and limestone is vividly rendered and its acoustics amplify the light-painting moment. The sea glass functions as micro-setting: Marina handles it across multiple beats (weighing, polishing, angling to catch sun), and its properties constrain her method. Spatial choreography is clean—salt-slick steps, grotto mouth as natural amphitheater, harbor visibility. The grotto's role in the closure is present but passive; it hosts the teaching rather than forcing a harder trade-off. Sensory detail is selective ("liquid starlight," "pearl-soft illumination") and filtered through Marina's astronomer's eye, though the mist's metaphoric density borders on ornamental in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.8)
    The moss garden is richly specific (concentric circles from ice-drip, species differentiation by rack, cooling systems channeling rainwater) and constrains Kira's entire emotional geography. The server-rack-to-garden conversion is tactile and purposeful, each detail chosen through her priorities. Spatial choreography is clean (doorway, rack C-7, deeper corridors). The amber pendant and phone are handled with clear proximity. Minor cap: while the garden shapes the closure image, no single environmental constraint forces a tactical choice in the present scene.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.1)
    The feral nexus is vividly rendered—mist flowing upward, dewdrops traveling up grass blades, spiders' counterclockwise webs—and these reversals charge the "against the current" motif. The seashell's placement on the moss-covered rail and the ritual's spatial anchoring are purposeful. Setting details constrain the ceremony's staging and supply the spiral's light-casting properties that enable the character emergence. The recurring tree-through-switching-booth image integrates world and action cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.1)
    The arbor is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (dew, filtered light, green shadow) that reflects Elara's priorities and the ritual setting. The tendril functions as micro-setting, recurring across beats and charged at closure when it wraps her wrist and blooms. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. The arbor constrains the gathering and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion, but the setting does not force a difficult choice or alter tactics under pressure, capping higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.2)
    The withered orchard, inverted trees, and subarctic crater are vivid and purposefully strange; sensory detail (aurora lights, frozen apple cores, crater pulse every seventeen hours) filters through the alchemist's methodical attention. The environment constrains her work—she adjusts placements with each slow pulse, the flash-paper is prepared with tree sap—and the trees' shivering straightening charges the ending image. Minor constraint: spatial choreography of the pattern layout could be clearer, but the setting meaningfully shapes both tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    The marble cavern with its quartz veins, natural camera obscura effect, and shifting acoustics directly enables Mara's method—studying reflections at different angles and times. The pool of groundwater and eastern wall function as tools that constrain her observation technique. The cave's temporal properties create the pre-echoes that teach repair through future memory. Setting is not ornamental; it supplies the mechanism for the central action and charges the final image of leaving the timer "in its marble cradle."

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bronze grotto, starlight, lamp burner, and whale-rib fractal are vivid and purposefully filtered through Mara's craft-focused perception. The burner's weight (seventeen grams) recurs and the grotto's acoustics shape her weaving technique, constraining her to remain within its walls. Sensory hierarchy is strong: metallic chill, oxidation patterns, shingled hush, and the tactile warmth of the burner all ground the scene. The micro-setting (body, tool, grotto) does constrain her choice to stay, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    The rain-beaded skylight functions as micro-setting that charges both atmosphere and the final image: "casting shifting shadows across her hands" early, then "late sun broke through, painting everything in rust-hued peace" at closure. The ash wood's "sharp, clean scent" mixing with kettle steam creates sensory layering. The loft as shared workspace—"her botanical illustrations spread across one wall, his carvings crowding the shelves"—establishes spatial hierarchy that mirrors emotional stakes. The kettle on the hotplate serves as both timekeeper and tactile anchor, its whistle marking the carving's completion. Environment directly constrains the opening action: "perhaps four minutes before it whistled—enough time to make the first cuts."

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Kinetic Lagoon is vividly rendered with purposeful detail (thermal currents, waters in spirals, three miles above earth) and the carousel's frozen mechanisms anchor spatial choreography. The camera wheel functions as micro-setting, constraining Kira's investigative method and charging the final image when she winds it "one last click." Setting details (mist, condensation on brass, vapor) filter through Kira's scavenger priorities and the lagoon's resumed motion at the end reconfigures the environment in step with her internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.7)
    The spaceport setting is vivid early: "cracked terrazzo floors," "confetti," "carnival tickets" in the dry fountain. Spatial choreography remains clear as Maya traces pipes and opens valves. The sextant piece and fountain function as micro-setting objects that frame the closure image, and the arcing water charges the ending. However, the environment does not constrain Maya's choices—rust "flakes away" conveniently, and no tool or spatial limit alters her approach.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    The crystal forecourt is vivid, multi-sensory (visual shimmer, petrichor scent, whisper-hum), and purposefully filtered through Elara's professional attention to silence and time. Spatial choreography is clear; her movement deeper into the forecourt tracks her decision arc. The setting's silence operates as a persistent constraint and charges the final image of her turning back toward the scriptorium. Micro-setting (body, breath clouds, leather shoes) reinforces the "glacial hush" and integrates action with atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    The barge, canal, twilight, and Magere Brug are vivid and purposeful, filtered through Mara's archaeological attention ("trained instincts," "fingers to read surfaces like braille"). The sundial as micro-setting object constrains her discovery and charges the final moments when she pockets it. Sensory selection is strong: "mirror-black water," "bridge's reflection, creating an impossible shadow." The canal's "held breath" directly supports the serene upheaval tone. The setting does guide the contemplative frame, though it does not force a tactical choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    The golden dock under snow provides vivid anchoring with fog, cold, and the tactile rope work. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's professional lens—"seven loops over, three under"—and the fulgurite glass functions as both object and conceptual anchor. The dock and rope constrain her immediate action (kneeling, working with numbed fingers), and the fog charges the final image with "oceanic hush" that separates the moment. Environment pressure is present but modest; the setting enables rather than dramatically narrows choice.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    The shadowed garden—dry fountain, frost-edged roses, amber leaves—is rendered with lyric specificity and filters through Elara's elegiac lens. The crimson thread and topiary anchor spatial choreography; Marcus's translucent form "barely disturbing the fallen leaves" charges the atmosphere. The thread's warmth and pulse pressure her final winding gesture, meeting the micro-setting constraint test and elevating the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    The suspended palace and mechanical city below create vivid atmosphere through selective detail (chains groaning, tick-tick-tick of clockwork hearts, copper coils and glass tubes). The incubation chamber constrains Aldric's choices across multiple beats (assembly, temperature adjustments, vigil). The setting charges the final image when the bird's song echoes through the palace and reaches the mechanical citizens, though the effect on them is asserted rather than shown in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The obsidian lagoon, black volcanic sand, and kelp-drift detail create vivid, purposeful atmosphere. The sand's volcanic origin—"born from destruction but cooled into something that could nurture"—directly constrains her ritual choice and charges the closure. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling, moving through water, climbing dunes). The cloud migration provides temporal anchoring. Minor deduction: "hidden place where kelp drifted in from underground channels" introduces mechanical detail that doesn't recur or constrain later action.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.4)
    The city's dry fountains and crystallized time are vivid and purposeful, anchoring the central image. The stained glass box constrains Marcus's ritual at each basin, meeting the micro-setting test. Sensory detail is selective and supports tone. However, spatial choreography is thin—Marcus and the woman walk "to each fountain" without distinct geography or physical obstacles, and the geese above never complicate movement or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.4)
    The nebula garden, red giant photosphere, and stellar nursery are vivid and sensory-specific ("clouds of hydrogen and helium," "crimson light pulsing"). The calculating machine gear is handled twice (measure the red giant, catch virgin starlight), giving it tactile presence. However, setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—she moves freely, the garden remains static decoration. Spatial choreography is clear, but the environment functions as backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    The greenhouse anchors every beat with vivid, purposeful detail: salmon sky, cool glass, iron bones. The milkweed and monarchs create a live environmental clock that pressures Martha's timeline. The woven ribbon and granite workbench ground tactile action. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The setting's constraint (monarchs departing, November approaching) drives escalation and charges the final image of words released "when the wind was right."

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    The obsidian ridge, tidal rhythms, and tower's brass mechanisms are vividly rendered and integrated into Theodore's world. The pendulum bob's physical presence (three hundred pounds, polished brass, apex pause) constrains the ritual action and charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered throughout, with the saltwater mist and weathered stones grounding the opening and the tower's "hollow chamber" echoing Theodore's confession.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt silo functions as workspace and echo chamber, its hollow throat amplifying the chess clock's final click. Midnight roses, starlight pooling, and the pre-dawn blue paint anchor the sensory world without catalog excess. The cemetery's spatial layout remains clear (silo behind, graves spread before) and the magnifying lamp, workbench, and pruning needle ground the decoding work in tactile detail. The silo's "velveteen gloom" recurs to charge the final image. The chess clock as physical object constrains her ritual but doesn't alter a choice at closure; still, the setting's particulars (grain tower repurposed as tool shed, metal walls rattling) feel lived-in and specific to this POV.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Obsidian Spire and frozen lake anchor the frame vividly ("darkness cannot darken what already gleams black"). The kingfisher nib and the maps constrain Mira's method and return in the closure beat (cleaning the nib, beginning another map). Spatial choreography is clean across tower, meeting chamber, and window. The final image charges the Spire ("reflected nothing, but within its dark walls, everything became possible"), linking environment to theme.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ember alcove is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (warmth, mist, shortwave glow) that supports atmosphere and reflects the story-famine setting. The radio dial glow functions as both light source and symbolic charge, anchoring multiple beats and reappearing in the final gesture of gratitude. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout the single location, and the setting subtly enables Mariel's covert work by providing isolation and warmth. The alcove constrains her work (limited light, isolation) and charges the ending image when she steps into mist, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    The gallery's contested-borderland status and ventilation system that claims ash are both setting details that constrain Marlene's art and charge the transience theme. The antique rocking chair is handled across multiple beats (arrival, forty minutes of creaking, final stop) and its cessation marks Thomas's death, functioning as micro-setting that times the portrait's completion. Spatial choreography is clean (marble floor, track lighting, mantle, center chair), and the porcelain mask's jagged physicality recurs with bodily pressure at closure. Sensory detail is vivid and selective, filtered through Marlene's professional focus.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    The submerged city anchors early with vivid particulars: "barnacles creep across marble statues through green-tinted water," "sewer tunnel," "fifteen feet of seawater." The cog—a concrete, handled object—constrains Marcus's argument and charges the final image when paired with the journal's "mass of all the competing narratives." Spatial choreography is clear throughout the sewer encounter. Setting details are filtered through Marcus's survivalist POV: "water-damaged texts in flooded libraries" and "graffiti on the tunnel walls" reflect his lived-in relationship with the ruins.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    The velvet library is rendered with selective, purposeful detail: sound absorption, lamplight, the security guard's arrival. The zither's mother-of-pearl rosette with five cranes is introduced early, handled across multiple beats (traced, played, wrapped), and charges the final image when left exposed. The autumn setting recurs as a metaphor anchored in concrete perception ("autumn leaves absorb rain," "autumn air holds the memory of summer") and the timeframe (nine PM closing) subtly tightens the session. Spatial choreography is clear: students enter, set down instruments, and later pack up. The micro-setting (rosette, instruments, library acoustics) constrains and enables choices, particularly the final decision to pass the zither between them.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rusted greenhouse is vividly anchored with specific details (broken panes, violet sky, three moons, overgrown vines) and returns charged at closure when rust blooms into synaptic patterns. Sensory selection is strong—bioluminescent signals, translucent shoots, the taste of dying leaves—and the setting evolves causally as the seed spreads. However, the environment does not meaningfully constrain Mira's choices; she encounters no resistance, scarcity, or spatial challenge that alters her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tower's seven hundred steps, copper coils, and glass chamber ground the action with functional detail. The lacquer box and its bee imagery charge the final candlelight image effectively. Spatial choreography is clean through the climb and chamber scenes. However, the "nectar-sweet evening air" and "amber sky" trend decorative without filtering through Mira's toll-keeper priorities or constraining a choice. The vertical farms are mentioned but remain abstract stakes rather than sensory pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bay at dusk is rendered with strong sensory specificity ("held breath," waves that "whisper rather than crash") and the orris root functions as a micro-setting tool that transforms perception. The streetlights' liminal flicker constrains the temporal frame. The shard of orris root—translucent, violet-scented, plant-stone hybrid—acts as a lens that charges the final image by revealing the bay's collection. The setting pressures Marina's interpretive stance and supplies the resource (the bay as repository) that enables closure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.9)
    The underwater garden is vividly particular (kelp threading marble archways, algae-covered statue, collapsed wall) and constrains Marina's ascent maneuver through the gap. The foxglove ampoule functions as micro-setting, its purple glow anchoring both past (the poison) and present (Marina's discovery). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from descent to ascent. The drowned city supplies both literal pressure (depth, murky water) and thematic weight (advanced civilization's dark secret), charging the final image of Thessaly as monument.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    The infinite staircase is vividly established—stone steps, equations on walls, dice rolling upward. Spatial anchors are consistent (climbing, rolling, carving at step eight million). The chipped die functions as micro-setting, constraining his method and charging the final image. The perpetual-motion hum and the architecture obeying "ruthless logic" create coherent atmosphere. The piece could have grounded one more sensory detail (temperature, echo, fatigue) to fully inhabit the climb, but the staircase clearly shapes his choices and the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rooftop greenhouse supplies both isolation and eventual communal space, constraining Mira's creative process and later enabling the gathering. Saffron smog, tomato vines, moon through glass, and herb garden steam ground the setting in sensory particulars filtered through Mira's artistic attention. The moon-tipped brush as micro-object charges the final tableau ("rested in a place of honor"). Spatial choreography remains clear across the painter's workspace, online realm, and populated greenhouse.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto setting is vivid and purposeful: melting frost reveals frescoes, mineral water threatens to wash away history, the bakery alcove grounds the displaced families' tradition. Sensory details (rosewater scent, waterfall roar, ice crash) accumulate pressure and are filtered through Marta's preservationist lens. The opera glass lens functions as micro-setting, enabling her to see hidden notations. However, the environment does not visibly constrain a choice at closure—Marta works until the night ends, but no tactical trade-off (which section to save, what to abandon) is dramatized, limiting the setting's participation in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lighthouse, rocky island, and tide anchor the scene concretely. The lens assembly and copper wire constrain Elara's reversal work, and the "backward dripping water" charges atmosphere. The yoyo as micro-setting object shapes the closure: its encoded pattern directs the final act. Sensory detail is selective and serves pressure ("darker than absence, a void that pulled at her vision").

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.1)
    The funhouse's bioluminescent mold, mirrors, and olfactory signature (sweet rot/ozone) create vivid sensory grounding that constrains Mara's movement and charges her choices. Spatial choreography remains coherent across beats—entrance, interior mirrors, confrontation with Fear—and the abandoned carnival's seven-year decay provides a credible timeline anchor. The clasp as micro-setting (body-worn object) shifts meaning from cold/photographing fears to warm/photographing joys, directly shaping the closure image and earning the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    The floating orchard on interwoven driftwood is vivid and purposeful, with the wood's grain forming nodes that Kessa must strike—environment directly enables her action. The blue hour coloring, salt-kissed branches, and whales drawn by deep frequencies layer sensory detail that serves atmosphere and stakes. Spatial choreography is clear (orchard's edge, leeward side), and the driftwood platform's transformation into an instrument constrains her method. The setting charges the final image as the orchard "sailed on through the night," fulfilling the micro-setting test for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Carapace—city built on turtle shells with barnacle borders, calcified stairs, and the observatory in the central whorl—is vividly specific and the turtle-shell spirals directly shape Mira's cartographic method. The telescope constrains her discovery of the crack, and the maintenance hatch becomes the threshold she must cross. The sunlight "pressing down with warmth" and "pale gold that couldn't quite hide the spreading cracks" charges the final image effectively. Spatial choreography (edge of city, observatory, watchers beyond, hatch) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.1)
    The disused railway station overgrown with ivy anchors setting early and recurs (rosebush petal, ivy rustling, broken windows, telegraph room), charging the final image with decay/renewal motif. The telegraph key is handled and functional, constraining Elara's method of transmission. Spatial choreography remains clear across Marcus's entrance and movement toward the telegraph room. The setting does not pressure a choice directly but provides resources (the telegraph) and atmospheric reinforcement of the "forgotten truths" theme, meeting mid-high band for setting contribution.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sensory detail is vivid and selective: barnacles, seaweed as "funeral bunting," chandelier "just inches above the waterline." The submerged pavilion constrains Edmund's movement (wading, tide turning) and charges the final image (ripples, hidden archive). Micro-setting elements (cornerstone gap, orchestra pit) enable the bottle-sealing choice. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The physical environment drives both the conflict (rising water, structural decay) and the closure action (sealing the note before demolition).

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    The submerged library setting constrains choice throughout: algae light enables her verification method, electromagnetic interference from preservation systems blocks detection except during blackout, rising pressure signals time limit. Micro-setting (bone-conducting earpiece, vacuum-sealed volumes, preservation table) all shape tactics. The algae's wavelength-specific illumination directly enables her ink's function, charging the closure image of truth "written in honest ink" protected by eternal pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating tea garden, glass basilica, and dream-gem workshop create a coherent fantasy setting with purposeful verticality ("ascending descent") that mirrors the thematic movement. Sensory detail is selective and craft-focused: "colored glass that threw rainbows," "crystal notes carrying across the isle," "bridges of woven moonlight." The setting constrains choice minimally—Mei could perform this grief work anywhere—but the basilica's lantern-hanging function charges the final image by providing a public venue that transforms private memorial into communal guide. Spatial choreography between garden, basilica, and workshop remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    The floating observatory is established early and its elevation matters to the premise (boundary thinner). The geode is handled across multiple beats, grounding the abstract concept. Spatial choreography remains clear (scanner interface, observation deck windows). The setting constrains the window of opportunity (cooling cycle) and provides the quantum field tools, elevating it beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory setting is vivid and specific ("stone eye watching heaven," "copper light bleeding across worn limestone"). The thermal imaging mechanic—infrared revealing hidden matrices—constrains the recovery method and shapes middle action. The "brilliant dimness" twilight charges the final image, making the thermal trails visible. Spatial choreography (floor tiles, wall chambers, dome projection) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cobalt terrace and shore are established early with atmospheric specificity ("bruised purples," "salt-worn wood"). The driftwood carvings function as micro-setting that constrains Elias's discovery and charges the final image when he adds the watch hand to the collection. Spatial choreography is clean—Elias sorting, lifting, picking up pieces in sequence. Setting detail remains selective and purpose-driven throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    The storm-worn parapet functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the neutral ground's liminal status mirrors Elara's position between vengeance and mercy, and the mist's "furrowed hush" creates a sensory cocoon for the apology exchange. The brass drawer pull serves as tactile anchor across beats, its "familiar grooves" grounding her when she must decide how to respond to Thorne. Spatial choreography is clean (Thorne emerges, they stand together, he disappears back into mist). The wind and gathering darkness modulate pressure at key turns, and the parapet's witness to "a thousand such exchanges" supplies historical weight without exposition dump.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.1)
    The utility poles function as micro-setting that constrains navigation choices and charges the final image; their numbered progression creates spatial choreography and Marcus's professional filter (pole seventeen/current, twenty-three/rocks) reveals character-specific perception. The coastal launch and fog-lifting are vivid but largely atmospheric. The astronomical compass as recurring object shifts from failure witness to memory anchor, meeting the object-as-setting test by constraining the teaching decision at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bioluminescent lake is vivid and purposeful: organisms respond to Marcus's movement, making the labyrinth visible and charging the final image. The cave's phosphorescent moss and stone cathedral establish sensory grounding early. Spatial choreography is clean (limestone steps, tunnel, cathedral, stone bridges). The lake constrains choice by revealing paths and disappearing bridges, directly shaping Marcus's decision to step forward. Minor gap: the apartment above the flower shop is glimpsed but not used as micro-setting pressure within this scene.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Everbloom Orchard is vividly rendered with purpose-driven detail: pearl-white blossoms under permanent moonlight, petals that never fall, fruit that never ripens. The orchard's stasis mirrors Mira's frozen grief and then shifts during the transformation, with blossoms becoming "scales, becoming feathers, becoming pure light." Silverwhisper's moonlight coat and the spatial anchors (satchel, vial, hand) ground the scene. The permanent moonlight charges the final image, moving from "frozen moment" to "promise," satisfying the micro-setting gate for choice constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.1)
    The midnight glade is vivid and purposeful: silver grass that chimes, transparent leaf-pages, air tasting of lilacs and lightning. The saucer functions as micro-setting, constraining choice (the crack glows, becomes a divining dish, seals with starlight) and charging the final image. Spatial choreography within the glade is clear—Elara places her palm over the crack, calls out, lays cards—though the transition from hospital corridor to cloudbound space is elided. The glade's impossible physics (floating among clouds, accumulating lost time) remain internally consistent and shape the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.4)
    The monastery ship *Eternal Return* with its "patchwork of salvaged vessels stitched together across centuries" provides both history and constraint. The meditation chamber with photographs lines the walls, and Mei's gravitational fluctuation is tied to her emotional state, creating a micro-setting that shapes her method of finding the dimensional fracture. The vial at her throat, the shimmer of dried tears under special lights, and the ship's groaning transformation all anchor the final beats. The recycled-warship detail returns at closure ("warships becoming gardens"), charging the ending image with thematic weight and making the setting indispensable to the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.1)
    Black sand, volcanic heat, lava streams, and planetary alignment create vivid sensory anchors filtered through an elevated, somewhat detached POV. The bottles function as micro-setting and constrain the opening choice (arranging them); the beach setting pressures the transformation ritual at closure. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting charges the final image ("black sand held her imprint"), meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but some details (Jupiter-Mars alignment tugging the ocean) feel ornamental rather than causally decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    The fort's sandstone, bronze surfaces, and half-painted sundial constrain the signal method and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean: courtyard, sundial center, towers visible. The blackout functions as both atmosphere and tactical necessity, narrowing the window for coded placement. Sensory detail—bronze reflecting twilight, lamps flickering back—grounds the scene without catalog padding. The quill holder's hollow base and sundial angles serve as micro-setting anchors that enable the silent revolution's mechanics, pushing this into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tidal bluff under aurora provides vivid sensory anchors ("borrowed dawn—neither true sunrise nor honest darkness") and the painted rocks constrain Yann's ritual action across multiple beats. Spatial choreography remains clear through stone placement and eel emergence. The star dust pouch's warmth signals environmental response to the pattern. The final image of new stone-placing charges the setting with continuity. The aurora's descent and touch materially enable the eel revelation, linking environment to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observatory setting constrains choice throughout: altitude above the cloud line becomes both literal vantage and tactical advantage, the storm drives others away to create the isolation she needs, and the darkroom's absolute darkness enables her light-poems. The timer, photographic paper, and sealed envelope function as micro-setting objects that shape her resistance methods. Spatial choreography is clean (dome, window, darkroom, drying line). The storm's "electric kiss" charges the final atmosphere and ties directly to her conceptual breakthrough about grammar of storms.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glass atrium, brook, and mechanical arm anchor the scene with sensory specificity, and the needle card's perforations guide action across multiple beats. The brass fingers "leaving trails of light" that form geometric patterns integrates tool and environment into the philosophical duel. However, the setting functions more as atmospheric container than constraint—the brook and rainbows remain decorative, and no environmental detail narrows Marlowe's tactical options at the closure beat. The mechanical arm charges the final image but doesn't alter the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rusted library with its absent copper roof and open starlight is vivid and consistent, shaping the work environment throughout. The coffee tin appears twice with purpose, its "dented surface creating a pattern of luminous fractures" linking to the tone. Moon and starlight guide the work, providing concrete sensory anchors. Spatial choreography is clean; October crouches, lifts pages, presses them into the manuscript. The setting charges the final image ("under the stars in her rusted library") and the moon/tin details constrain the nocturnal timing, satisfying the micro-setting gate for high-7s eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tidal arbor's coral bones conduct musical resonance, directly enabling the climactic corridor; the projection booth and cinema supply the film reels that constrain Marion's method. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "calcified coral reaching down through cumulus layers," "silver halide emulsion," "condensation on celluloid." The broken clock functions as both micro-setting anchor and recurring object that charges the ending (11:47 → 11:48). Spatial choreography is clean (piano, projection booth, screen, terminal benches), and the setting's vertical isolation above the Pacific reinforces the stakes of being cut off from other colonies.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.2)
    The ancient ridge with ghost orchids and the approaching monsoon establish atmospheric pressure and a ticking clock. However, setting detail remains largely ornamental—neither the ridge's spatial properties nor the orchids constrain Mira's choices during the key memory-interpretation sequence. The monsoon's three-day deadline disappears once she swallows the seed; the climactic classification scene could occur anywhere. Micro-setting (the seed in her palm) recurs but does not materially alter tactics at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    The post-rain islet, weathered porch, and harbor provide grounding with selective sensory detail (salt, green moss, silver droplets). The juniper functions as micro-setting, its wild growth mirroring Kenji's scattered grief and enabling the teaching beat that parallels his unspoken reconciliation. The lace and compass are handled across multiple beats, anchoring choices. Spatial choreography remains clear. The breezy islet does not strongly constrain a key choice but charges the final teaching moment through proximity to the harbor where Yuki departed, holding it just below the 8.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    The greenhouse is richly realized—cracked glass, lingering rainwater, mud, mold, and fractal growth—and consistently filtered through Elena’s physicist’s eye. Environment meaningfully shapes choices: the damaged space, air currents, and structural weaknesses both enable her dust research and create demolition stakes. The butterfly dust functions as an object-as-setting, charging the final image and literally mapping the microclimate and structural fate. A bit more non-visual sensory texture (smell, temperature, sound) at key beats could deepen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    The canyon, frost, stars, and burned ledger are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through a glass artist’s eye, with the frost patterns and uranium glow echoing her medium in a non-labored way. Environmental specifics evolve with time—night to first light, frost forming and melting—and this shift meaningfully charges the final image of “brief, harmless luminescence.” The setting constrains options plausibly (she’s isolated, presumed dead) and is thematically yoked to transformation and transience. It’s very strong, though the canyon’s physical constraints don’t directly shape tactical choices beyond mood and implied isolation, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    The winterglass conservatory, aurora, frost-patterned plants, and thermal imaging system create a vivid, atmospheric setting that’s inseparable from the premise. Environmental specifics (62 Hz hum in the floor, winterglass ceiling, Arctic flora) are filtered through Mira’s scientific and sensory biases, not as tourist catalog. The space meaningfully charges the final image: the conservatory as “concert hall,” winterglass holding its breath as heat-signature music plays, is integral to the story’s final resonance. The only thing keeping this from the very top band is that setting constrains mood and perception more than concrete tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    The world-building is striking and economical: drowned cities stacked on drowned cities, a coral-encrusted library with books floating in preserved air, grief as a breathable medium. Setting is not just decorative; the underwater library and the lens-as-lighthouse literally and thematically shape what’s possible and what must be chosen at the end. The recurring physical environment and the lens object directly charge the final image of “rest” as shadow rather than light.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.3)
    The terra-cotta arbor, ridge, and settlement are vividly and economically evoked, and the bell functions as a charged recurring object that anchors both opening and closing images. Setting details (gardens, repaired roofs, “benevolent shadows”) are specific and tied to action rather than decorative. The environment shapes ritual—the ridge, arbor, and bell define the midnight exchange space—even if it doesn’t heavily constrain tactical options. Atmosphere matches theme well, but the world beyond “sanctions” remains somewhat generic politically and geographically.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    The viaduct, twilight, and wisteria are not just pretty: their arches, blooms, and the specific arch with thickest growth structurally determine where the door appears and how Mae moves. The setting’s specific textures—phosphorescent sparks, compressed starlight, night market provenance—create a coherent, atmospheric world that feels particular rather than generic. Environment and object-as-setting (camera, door, blossoms) all charge the final image of her walking back across the viaduct trailed by sparks. A slight risk of decorative lushness exists, but most details are doing thematic or structural work.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “living bridge garden” and its hyperbolic, vine-woven architecture are vivid and specific, with recurring material details (vines, moss, oaks) that are always filtered through Elara’s designer’s eye. Setting is not mere backdrop: the bridges “remember,” recognize her iterations, and structurally embody the story’s temporal logic, culminating in the final image of her as gardener of time. The environment constrains the kind of revelation possible and charges the closing stance. A slight overreliance on abstract description in later paragraphs is the only thing holding this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    The abandoned carnival redemption center repurposed as a seed vault is vivid, specific, and central to action: prizes as storage, chains limiting his reach, booths as resource caches. Details like teddy bears with grain bellies and nitrogen-sealed snow globes effectively merge world-building with stakes. The setting constrains and then enables choices (chains vs. reachable prizes), and the final image of the emptied-but-seeded center is thematically charged. A bit more sensory texture of the drought-ravaged exterior world could heighten contrast, but what’s here is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Arctic sunken greenhouse, drowned apple trees, and ring of shipwrecks are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elena’s perception, giving the story a distinct physical and atmospheric stamp. Environment and objects (the greenhouse, water, forge, aurora) do more than decorate: they mirror and charge the themes of submerged legacy, climate damage, and commercial betrayal, and the forge physically enables her main attempt. The final image recharges these elements (aurora “singing,” palm on ashen forge) as the setting that now houses understanding rather than only loss. The only minor limitation is that the physical constraints of the underwater, pressurized space do not sharply shape tactical choices beyond mood and access to the forge.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    The emerald-tiled, moonlit abandoned station and jade pillars are vividly drawn and tonally aligned with the story’s luminous-magic realism. Setting is filtered through Cassia’s professional eye (light, color, surfaces) and intertwined with action—the exhibition literally hangs in this eerie space, and the station walls catch the final silver patterns of the moonbeams.

The consistency of light, color, and underground decay creates a cohesive atmospheric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    The abandoned control room and thawing exclusion zone are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with Marina’s perceptions—the cold, ice, broken tiles, and dead panels all echo the plant’s history and her purpose. Tools and objects (torch, control panels, spheres, emergency shutdown button) are used physically and symbolically, especially when she places a sphere by the too-late shutdown switch. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain her options moment-to-moment, but it deeply charges the imagery and the final transformation of the room’s meaning. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.5)
    The rusted library under a star-pierced roof is vivid, with tactile and olfactory detail (“reeked of rust and rotting paper,” “stellar dust”) that builds a strong, decayed atmosphere.

However, beyond mood and symbolism, the library doesn’t significantly constrain tactics or alter choices; the confrontation could almost happen in any abandoned space. The seashell as micro-setting/object does more concrete work in charging the final image than the library itself.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    The storm-tossed ridge fort, cliff, crashing waves, and dimming sky are vividly rendered and tightly fused to mood and theme (between tempest and void, isolation as laboratory for silence). Details are filtered through her outlook—constellations, darkness, the decaying fort—which keeps the atmosphere purposeful rather than touristy. The environment conceptually supports her choices (she chose the fort for its isolation) but rarely constrains tactics in a concrete way. Still, it strongly charges the images and final sense of earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    The frozen courtyard under the dome and the ice-crystal violin are vividly rendered and tonally apt, with strong visual specificity (“like polished steel,” “carved entirely from a single piece of ice crystal so pure it seemed to bend light”). The environment mirrors the thematic concern with cycles and phase changes (ice → vapor → rain → ocean), neatly tying setting to the meditation on consciousness. While the cold and architecture don’t significantly constrain choices, the courtyard/violin ensemble functions as a charged micro-setting that frames and returns in the final image. This charged reprise at the end helps the setting carry thematic weight beyond postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    The crystal whispering forecourt, rain-filled puddles, and acoustics that turn whispers and breath into music are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Mira’s perspective. The environment is not mere backdrop; it’s the emotional chamber where their history is replayed and revised, and its properties (amplifying quiet, mirroring in puddles) thematically echo their struggle with disclosure and reflection. The old projector lens functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image, refracting the theme of clarity/ambiguity. The space doesn’t physically constrain tactics much, but it powerfully shapes tone and the charged final tableau.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    The garden maze, with its hedgerows, heart, and entrance, is richly evoked and clearly filtered through Marta’s professional, intimate eye. The Ministry/“luck index” layer creates a light speculative setting that feels internally consistent and doesn’t need over-explaining. Objects-as-setting (marbles, copper training wires, impossible tea leaves) are integrated and help charge the ending. The maze doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices in-scene, which is the only reason this doesn’t push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    The xenobiology station, Kepler-442b’s amber glow, and details like frost on glowing surfaces create a vivid and specific environment. Setting is well integrated with action: the planet’s pulses, twilight alignment, and lab hardware (workstation, containment fields) are not just decor but part of the experiment’s conditions. However, the environment rarely constrains choices beyond “this can only happen at twilight,” so it stops just short of feeling fully indispensable to the final beat. Atmosphere is strong, even if pressure from environment could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    The flooded opera house with lanterns is vividly rendered and consistently used: the water both reveals the score and alters the acoustics, and its rising depth physically constrains Marcus’s final choice. Details like the “shallow lake” of the pit, lantern reflections, and trembling water that shows ghostly figures are specific and purposeful, not decorative. The environment meaningfully shapes tactics (he must step into chest-deep water, hold the violin above the surface) and charges the final image of him dry with the restored program. A small further use of non-visual senses (sound, cold, smell) at peak moments could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mountain weather station and its instruments are vivid and lived-in, not just scenery: logs, magnetometer calibration, and window margins all channel how truth can be recorded or hidden. Altitude, cold, and aurora behavior meaningfully shape both phenomena (the flowers) and available actions (what can be observed, when, and by whom). The final image—aurora light on taped illustrations in the window margin—depends on this specific environment to carry thematic weight. Detail is selective and character-filtered, avoiding tourist catalog syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tunnel, mill, and equipment are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Marcus’s professional eye (dust, “sweating brick walls,” pipes as “circulatory system”). Setting is not postcard background: the tunnel’s history and physical layout motivate the search path and make the hiding place for the valve plausible, while the environment’s hush and decay deepen the ghost-shift atmosphere. The beaded valve wheel functions as an object-as-setting, charging the final image and constraining his choice not to touch it. This is just shy of 9-band because the environment doesn’t quite impose a concrete physical constraint at the peak, functioning more as tone and resonance than tactical obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is rich, specific, and thematically embedded: roots through marble, book-trees, phosphorescent moss, mushroom-words all enact knowledge decomposing and regenerating. The underground river and overgrown library clearly charge the final image of archaeologists finding an ecosystem instead of archives. Environment shapes what’s possible—she’s underground, cut off, listening to the river instead of the world. A slight excess of lush description in places keeps it just short of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sage Ridge, the eclipse phenomena, and the “dreaming roots” create a vivid, specific atmosphere that dovetails nicely with the music and generational themes. Environmental cues (temperature drop, shadow bands, corona) are well-observed and support tone and stakes. The setting charges the final images (roots carrying the song, the curl vanishing into shadow) more than it constrains concrete choices. Strongly atmospheric and thematically integrated, but the environment doesn’t quite function as a hard constraint on action.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    The reclaimed silo library is richly and specifically rendered—curved walls, spiral stairs, fireplaces of half-burned diaries—and consistently filtered through Thrain’s tactile, echo-based perception. The environment meaningfully charges the story: walls literally hold confessions, stairs become the metaphor for time, the fireplace yields key artifacts. Setting and atmosphere are deeply integrated with concept and theme, though they stop just short of constraining concrete physical choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the salt-stained windows, sweeping beam, Skeleton Rock economy of smugglers and intelligence officers all feel lived-in and tonally precise. The lighthouse beam’s three-seconds-on/off rhythm, the rocks, and the open door meaningfully charge the final image and constrain the form his “transcendence” can take. Details are integrated through Chen’s professional lens (music, codes, slips) rather than as neutral description. The piece could perhaps employ one or two tactile/aural specifics under peak pressure, but what’s there already does substantial work.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cathedral, its acoustics, the nave’s center as a “dimensional anchor,” and the palette are all vivid and integral to how the exorcism functions. Setting is strongly filtered through Marcus’s sensibility (silence as architecture, stones confessing tensions), and the environment literally and conceptually holds and focuses the ritual. The final image of the humming stones and fallen palette recharges earlier details without feeling like postcard description. This is one of the story’s most publication-ready dimensions.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.0)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, and mirrored horizon are vivid, integrated images that reinforce the time-fracture conceit and the mood. The environment feels consistent and is filtered through Mei’s sensibility (reflections as temporal multiplicity, resonance of the spire). The nautilus and fortunes act as micro-setting elements, especially in the final conducting image. However, the setting rarely constrains choices or tactics; it’s more atmospheric than operative, which limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.0)
    The glowing viaduct, bioluminescent moss, and post-rain atmosphere are vivid and specific, with details like shifting light (amber to sickly green) mirroring Kira’s arc. World rules around the bridge as “constructor” and the moss feeding on moisture feel internally consistent and integrated into the action rather than museum-tour description. The environment does exert some conceptual pressure (endless, dissolving bridge; fading structure once integrated), though mostly as a metaphysical landscape rather than a concrete physical constraint. A slightly stronger use of the setting to force tactical choices—beyond symbolic resonance—would lift this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    The drum maker’s cavern is vivid and integral: its remembered vibrations and legendary acoustics justify Lucia’s tactic and shape how the backward music affects her. Details like “stone walls remembering the vibrations” and “ghosts of instruments” are specific and thematically pointed without reading as a tourist catalog. The environment constrains and enables the method (natural amplification, stone conduction) and charges the final image of her leaving with music “beneath her feet.” Seasonal framing (autumn yielding to winter) is atmospheric and thematically aligned, though it doesn’t quite reach the same level of functional pressure as the cavern itself.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    The courtyard at dusk, the instruments, the quarantine wall, and the weather all feel tactile and filtered through Elena’s professional eye, creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. Tools and objects (anemometer, journal, pigeons, wall) recur and charge the final image, where her lamplit calibrations become acts of resistance. The world-building around the quarantine and storm manipulation is suggestive yet efficient. It stops just short of 9+ because the environment constrains less than it frames; we feel mood and theme more than tactical pressure from setting.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    The greenhouse of extinct plants, the labeled beds like tombstones, and the ultraviolet-lit root traces create a vivid, thematically loaded environment. Setting is not mere backdrop: the extinct garden and crystal lanterns directly charge the final image of Elara as an invisible, blooming archive. The professional details (lantern broker, dying stars, pressed flowers in glass) feel integrated and selective rather than touristic. This is very strong work; the only thing keeping it from higher is that the space rarely constrains physical options so much as it frames emotional meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    The terra-cotta grotto, the rope, and the altered starlight are all concrete, recurring anchors, and they’re filtered through Marcus’s poetic perception rather than described generically. The grotto walls and rope are not just backdrop but functional instruments: they store the layered carvings, evidence, and moral residue that Marcus reads. The final image of starlight and the waiting rope recharges the setting with thematic weight, clearly charging the ending. The only thing keeping this from an even higher band is that the environment constrains choice more conceptually than physically.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse, ash, seawater, and ring of shipwrecks are vividly particular and continually active: they shape acoustics, gather light, and literally add percussive and rhythmic elements to the music. Setting is tightly filtered through Mara’s sensibility as a musician, so environmental detail always does character or thematic work rather than sitting as postcard description. The same physical space carries family history, disaster aftermath, and present rebirth, and the final image of music and fire within this ruin is strongly charged. This is near top-tier atmospheric integration for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    The amber grotto at dusk is vivid and sensorial, with consistent rules (permeability window, absorbed confessions) that directly shape action. Details like static crackle, carved steps, and “liquid gold” walls feel particular to Vera’s perception and profession. The environment constrains choices via the narrow dusk window and supplies the raw material for her work, rather than serving as a mere backdrop. A touch more interaction between her body and space under pressure could push it higher, but it’s already richly functional.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.3)
    The harbor town, roofless library, and symphony across the water create a vivid, coherent atmosphere, and the details (“weatherproofed books,” tarps after storms, columns framing shelves under the open sky) feel purposeful rather than decorative. Setting is strongly filtered through Margot’s routines and priorities—she walks past shuttered shops, knows the routes to Whitmore, and leverages shipping ties—which grounds the world in her expertise. The library under stars directly charges the final image and the story’s emotional logic. If anything, the town’s physical and social constraints could push decisions a bit harder, but what’s on the page is rich and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    The crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, crater, and cave behind the waterfall are vivid, sensorial, and integrated into action rather than mere backdrop. The environment constrains and shapes the narrative: the tags spiral physically toward the crater’s heart, the descent is communal, and the completed arbor as mirror is the charged final image. World rules (crystal fruit, extinct dialects living on here) feel internally consistent and color the stakes. The setting strongly supports tone and theme, though it could exert a bit more tactical pressure in the search itself.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and specific—rooftop canals running upward, Morteus integrated into architecture, temporal residue in the water, and the chamber of suspended extinctions—and all of these are filtered through Marina’s professional eye. Environment and object-as-setting (pendant, canals, giant’s breathing gap) meaningfully constrain and enable action, particularly the need to reach the throat canal and dive through the temporal shear. The final image of clear rooftop canals and a newly awake giant directly reweights the earlier, more enchanted but ethically compromised cityscape.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cavern orchard is vivid and sensorial—stalactites, mineral water, bioluminescent fungi, and impossible apple trees—and consistently filtered through Morrow’s conjurer’s gaze. Setting is not just decorative: the orchard’s secrecy, the dripping stopping at night, and the limestone-filtered, memory-rich water are integral to why Elias’s transformation can persist here. The mosaic stone and fungi patterning function as micro-settings that directly enable the magic and charge the final image of her leaving the eyes in place. Environment, objects, and atmosphere all contribute meaningfully to tone and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    The library, crawl spaces, pipes, and dawn light are concretely evoked and consistently filtered through Edgar’s lived familiarity, avoiding white-room syndrome. Environment meaningfully constrains tactics: his ability to move unseen in pipe chases and lower objects through gaps defines how he can help and why he’s invisible. The dawn and flickering city lights reinforce the liminal, “between floors” existence that charges the final image. While not maximal in scope, the setting is tightly integrated with character and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    The nursery, trellis, moss, rain, and transforming plants are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Marcus’s botanical sensibility. Setting functions as more than backdrop: storm season is the activating condition and the mossy trellis explicitly frames the threshold he crosses. Details like ferns reverting to something prehistoric and DNA-helix thorns deepen both atmosphere and world rules without feeling like a catalog. The final image under the trellis in the storm recharges earlier environmental cues in a resonant way.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: the tidal causeway, barnacled stones, rain trails, rusting desalination towers, and acidic post-war atmosphere all feel specific and lived-in. Environmental constraints actively shape the story—the tide clock, the exposed seabed, and the island’s periodic solitude all frame the meeting as liminal and necessary. Objects as micro-setting (amber brooch, jar of pre-war rain) are deeply charged and explicitly shape choices and the final image. World rules about water scarcity and weaponized weather are sketched with economical but potent detail and never contradict themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    The musical crystal cave is vividly evoked—singing formations, phosphorescent veins, bioluminescent “constellations,” and bright darkness all build a strong, immersive atmosphere. Setting is not just decorative: the cave’s resonance, crystals, and shadows are the mechanism that strips and reconfigures her sight, and the pearl is explicitly tied to this environment. Details are well-filtered through Vera’s perception as a seer learning to look differently. The outside-world glimpse at the end is briefer and less concrete, but it’s thematically functional.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.1)
    Ivory Harbor after rain feels vivid and specific, with weather, light, and salt literally shaping Kessa’s method (different times of day revealing different layers) rather than serving as backdrop. The archives, harbor, and the trumpet valve are all tactically used, not just described, and the environment’s properties (light, damp, corrosion) constrain what can be seen or sounded. The setting’s mood—washed, crystalline, liminal—perfectly matches the themes of return and absence. The final image of her in the rain-fractured harbor charges everything that came before.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is the piece’s strongest asset: the liminal 3 a.m. city, crack-arrows, impossible alleys, and the starlit vault feel vivid and coherently strange. Details are filtered through a cartographer’s eye—arrows, geometry, undocumented connections—which grounds the surrealism. The Terminal Lines punch and the mist wall function as tactile environmental interfaces rather than mere ornaments. The only brake on a higher score is that the fortress environment doesn’t significantly constrain her choices once entered; it’s more tableau than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.5)
    The clifftop observatory, the stone tower, and the ocean below are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through Elena’s scientific yet uneasy gaze. The tower and the tile both function as charged recurring objects/places, especially at the end when the tower becomes a “sanctuary” and the tile reveals its “true pattern.” The environment (wind, cold stone, whale songs vibrating up through rock) is not just backdrop; it shapes her perception and charges the final image. A small limitation is that the physical constraints of the tower don’t quite force tactical choices, but they do strongly frame the thematic ones.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prismatic escondite and solar storm are vividly realized and integrated into action—the crystalline walls, impossible colors, and warped magnetic fields all matter to how Vex sees and acts. World rules (folded space, dimensional awareness, magnetic fields as bridges) feel consistent and are mostly shown through use rather than exposition. The final image of the empty escondite with light bending through impossible angles recharges the opening setting details with thematic weight. A slight cap comes from the fact that the environment rarely constrains choices harshly; it’s more a rich enabler than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prep room is vivid and specific—fluorescent light, “chemical-sweet” air, tools, and embalming procedures are integrated into action rather than set-dressing. The setting’s macabre, clinical atmosphere underpins the theme that death is the one place deception fails. It doesn’t tightly constrain tactics beyond keeping Maya at the table, but the way she works on the body while negotiating charges the imagery at the end. The ink pot as a charged micro-setting element amplifies the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is rich, specific, and integrated: the “blooming labyrinth of bonsai forests,” the fountain stones like “sleeping birds,” and the valley’s throat all create a cohesive atmosphere. Environment is not just backdrop; trees as memory-storage and the fountain’s spray actively mediate her method (refracting the hum), and the bonsai’s “temporal signatures” conceptually charge the ending. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful rather than touristic, with a strong visual and tactile bias that fits a stationer’s eye. The world feels both fantastical and precise, though it constrains mood and meaning more than tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    The port’s container labyrinth is vivid and sensorial—rust, dawn light, echo-navigation, and tide levels all feel tangible and lived-in. Environment meaningfully constrains choice (low tide for eavesdropping, high tide for private reading; spring tide as climax), and Container 47-B is a specific, charged micro-setting. The final image of groaning metal harmonizing with “testimonies of the nameless” beautifully fuses place and theme. A small push toward how the physical precarity (e.g., flooding, instability) might bodily endanger her could heighten the already strong atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory on Sorrow’s Cliff, the corroded dome, and the unfinished cello create a strong, specific atmosphere that meshes with the story’s concern with echoes and abandonment. Environmental details (salt spray, waves, dust, dying-moth papers) are vivid and filtered through Marina’s perspective. The setting doesn’t heavily constrain tactical options but it does charge the final image of waves “keeping time” and makes the observatory feel like a natural repository for regrets. Objects-as-setting (shell, cello) are integrated both physically and thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    The raft-city carnival is vividly rendered through selective, purposeful details—wave generators, oil-drum fires, neon games—filtered through Maya’s familiarity rather than tourist cataloguing. Setting is not mere backdrop: the floating, ungoverned, liminal environment and the graffiti-laced surfaces directly shape communication, stakes, and the final legal tactic. The foundation stone chip, as a recurring object, meaningfully charges the final image when embedded in the community center, linking lost land to this precarious home. A bit more physical constraint from the water itself under pressure could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    The lunar setting is vividly rendered—Tycho’s bowl, regolith, earthlight, vacuum silence—and consistently filtered through Vera’s professional gaze. Environmental facts (airlessness, footprints’ permanence, sublimating ice, horizon line) meaningfully shape what is possible and how she acts. The recurring spatial relationship Earth/Moon/Tycho/hourglass charges the final image of the hourglass on the crater floor. The “dawning hush” and terminator sweep are not mere backdrop; they frame time, tone, and the sense of a patient Moon awaiting humanity’s return.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mist-coated rail depot, prismatic tubes, and harbor with the Meridian are vivid, specific, and tightly bound to Maya’s non-visual perception. The environment isn’t decorative: mist, water, and industrial vibrations directly enable her diagnostic method and charge the final image of departure. Details are filtered through her sensory priorities (sound, vibration, droplets) rather than generic scenic cataloging. The only limit is that the rail aspect of the depot plays more for ambiance than for consequential choice, but overall integration is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    The outpost and frozen lake are vivid and lived-in; details like pressure ridges, rusted metal, and the groaning structure create a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting actively shapes the problem (hidden subglacial rivers, convergence point) and the options (isolation, approach across the ice). The lake and ice recur as charged images, culminating in the final line about the lake “waiting,” which powerfully reframes the world’s latent dynamism. Environmental detail is purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    Millhaven’s physicality—cobblestones, archway, fountain, cracking bell towers—is economical yet precise, and environment directly responds to human action (stones humming, cracks sealing, water returning). The setting is tightly tied to the magic system, so place is not mere backdrop but an active participant in stakes and outcome. The archway and market square act as charged nodes where key turns occur. This integration gives the final image of the town’s continuing dance strong atmospheric weight.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    The underwater temple is vivid, specific, and integral: corridors that “spiraled into themselves,” water-form architecture, and bioluminescent light all feel distinctive and not generic. The environment directly constrains choices—pressure, interference with the distress signal, impossible geometry—and the final chamber’s light and drifting memory-threads charge the ending image. Details are filtered through Maya’s professional, spatially-attuned perspective, which keeps the description purposeful. A bit more tactile/kinesthetic sensation (cold, pressure, suit feel) under stress could deepen the atmosphere further.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.3)
    The lighthouse prison on Devil’s Tooth Reef, the salt-corroded brass plates, and the copper light all create a vivid, tonally unified environment. The setting constrains choices (isolation, the monthly supply boat, sealed basement, the narrow door) and charges the final image of Marcus hovering in copper light. The confessional lattice as a salvaged shipwreck artifact feels organically embedded rather than decorative. World rules (hovering, the lattice sustaining impossibilities) are consistent for this slightly uncanny reality.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse and endless night are vividly drawn and tightly integrated: mercury pools, philosopher’s stone soil, and phosphorescent fruit all feed directly into the world’s rules. The environment is not mere backdrop—the curse is literally embedded in the setting, and the final transformation into ordinary apples/pears is the closure image. Specific sensory details (luminescent fruits, crystalline frost laugh, winter-cracked fields) are purposeful. A slight increase in how the physical space constrains Marlow’s movement or options under pressure could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral: a centuries-old red canyon labyrinth turned tidal sanctuary, where barnacles grow on petroglyphs and tide pools etch time into stone. Environmental specifics (overlapping paths, golden spiral pattern, empty tide pools, succulents in salt-crusted crevices) are filtered through Calla’s perception and directly shape what’s possible (where she can sew, how ocean relics appear). The canyon walls become both canvas and archive, charging the final image of children dancing on rock “permanent as petroglyphs, ephemeral as tide.” This is rich, lived-in worldbuilding whose rules remain stable and meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid and original—roots “embracing skulls and femurs,” fruit falling into crypt-caves, bees in an ossuary—and it’s constantly filtered through Miriam’s perceptions. Setting is not mere backdrop; it encodes the theme (life growing through death) and charges key beats, especially the sundial’s placement in the grandmother’s tomb and the final image of olives ripening above “patient” bones. Environment and object (the sundial/orchard) meaningfully charge the ending, though they rarely impose concrete obstacles. The balance of descriptive density and narrative motion is strong, pushing toward literary-publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    The golden arcade is striking and specific, with skylights, brass fixtures, silent escalators, and the adjacent depot all woven through action and mood rather than static description. Worldbuilding details (failed holographic storefronts, neural-link boutiques, copper-stamped trucks) feel organically filtered through Mira’s perspective and support the tone of futuristic nostalgia. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain her options, it does meaningfully charge the final image—the arcade as witness to a replaced future and her fragile practice. Sensory balance and spatial clarity are consistently strong.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is vivid, economical, and integrated with character: the cobalt dome, autumn light, and “eternal flame” are both atmospheric and functional. The observatory and candle directly shape tactics—only its light reveals the secret patterns, and Vera must work there before access closes. Details feel particular rather than generic, with the autumn wind and rattling dome echoing the precariousness of the moment. The worldbuilding around the Academy, navigation charts, and military use is lightly sketched yet coherent, though a touch more sensory variety beyond visual would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mangrove labyrinth, brackish water, and singing spirits create a vivid, atmospheric setting that feels particular rather than generic, and the Notre-Dame shard gives a strong, concrete anchor. Environment and object do participate in the action—the labyrinth marks the ritual space, the spirits breathe onto the “windows,” the shard channels fear away at the end—but they mostly support mood and symbolism rather than hard constraints on choice. Still, the final image of the shard crumbling after its purpose is fulfilled effectively charges the setting details with thematic weight. Some sensory variety beyond sight and sound (e.g., touch of roots, smell) is present but could be slightly deepened under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.1)
    The atrium greenhouse, mist, and twilight are vividly particular and filtered through Maya’s fatigued, morphine-softened perception. Setting and object-as-setting (the coral) do real work: the conservatory frames the scene as sanctuary, the misters’ “manufactured rain” deepen the closing image, and the coral’s physicality and history charge the final gesture. Details like multilingual graffiti on the cast, the glass ceiling, and “mist-dampened glass” avoid generic hospital imagery. Environment and recurring object clearly charge the final image, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting and atmosphere are a major strength: the fog, ruined orchard district, and studio-cave are rendered with rich, purposeful sensory detail that consistently reflects Marina’s priorities. The contrast between gray present and luminous reconstructed orchard deeply charges the imagery, especially in the final beat where the faintly glowing fragment opposes the dark cave and pervasive fog. World rules (fog, ruin, knowledge network, light-painting) feel internally consistent and are learned through action rather than dumped. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactical choices, but it meaningfully shapes tone and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Sound Wave Garden is vividly realized and functionally integrated—its acoustic panels, reflective sound, and heartbeat-like rhythms are not just decoration but mechanisms of the magic and temporal distortion. The mural and coin operate as charged micro-settings/objects that constrain options and shape the final image (the coin behind the paint, “dreaming of the next awakening”). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, especially in the auditory dimension, creating a distinctive atmosphere that supports theme and action.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse and insect ecology are vivid and integral, not decorative: wing-beats scrambling scanners, mantises creating false positives, moths crashing translation software, and locusts registering as “rain” all directly shape tactics. The broader city of gardens and the Cognition Tax regime are sketched economically yet feel coherent. The final image of Marcus amid wing-beats and glass while vegetables elsewhere will spell forbidden truths shows the environment charging closure. A hair below 9 only because the external city never quite gains the same textured specificity as the greenhouse itself.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, idiosyncratic, and thematically fused to the story: the gargantuan shell’s spirals, acoustics, and pinholes of light all materially shape events (how songs travel, how damage becomes constellations). The shell functions as both environment and instrument, directly enabling the armistice’s mechanism. World details like “crystallized music” and “fossilized forgiveness” feel organic to the logic rather than decorative. The final image of light through worn shell and dissolving postcard is strongly charged by the accumulated setting work.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    The opal library, glass orchids, and sky-bound setting are vivid and tightly integrated with the premise of preserving extinct sensations and names. Setting is filtered through Mira’s work—orchids as tools, the bamboo chime as instrument—rather than as static backdrop, and these objects materially shape action. The “above the clouds” aspect is more atmospheric than constraining; physical environment rarely pressures choices beyond indicating isolation and sanctity. Still, specificity and mood are consistently strong and support the final image of the glowing orchid constellation.

    The extinct language archive under Prague, the lamplight, dust, and pearl-infused ink create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s strongly filtered through Elena’s scholarly focus. The glass ink well and its glow function as a micro-setting/tool that charges the final image and reinforces the world’s rules. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain her options, but it meaningfully shapes tone and the sense of antiquity and stakes. Specificity is high without lapsing into tourist-catalog description.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is distinctive and deeply integrated: the breathing amphitheater within a dormant volcano shapes tone, frames the town’s water politics, and physically hosts her secret carvings. Environmental details (“stone lungs,” “star-drunk night”) are selectively vivid and consistently filtered through a machinist’s and mediator’s eye. The amphitheater and volcano conceptually charge the final image with stored, patient power and balance, so the world is doing real thematic work. The only thing holding this just below 9 is that the environment constrains mood and symbolism more than concrete tactical options in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    The attic of Bellweather’s Books, with its skylight, dust motes, ledgers, and piano music seeping up from below, is vivid and tightly integrated with Margot’s interior life. Environmental elements aren’t postcard details: the dust motes become her meditation and mapping practice, the attic is literal sanctuary, and the shop’s piano charges the final image of messages “returning home.” The meteorite and music box also operate as micro-settings/objects that shape how she handles memory and meaning. The piece could push even further by letting the physical constraints of the attic affect a concrete choice, but as-is the setting strongly charges tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the seventeen-acre corn maze, pneumatic prism terrace, spiraling wood grain, and cooler soil at the center create a tactile, coherent world. Details are filtered through Marina’s sensibility as a weather/sacred-geometry heir, so even numbers and measurements feel character-driven rather than touristic. The environment meaningfully charges the final image (the terrace casting rainbow shadows, the sacred cool circle), though it constrains emotional and conceptual stakes more than concrete tactics. World rules around the quasi-mystical meteorology remain internally consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    The underwater research station and drowned city are richly and specifically realized—glass dome, bacterial light, impossible minerals, bioluminescent creatures—and always filtered through Mira’s professional gaze. Setting is not just backdrop; the star-correlated coral geometries and the observation dome literally define what the characters can perceive and understand. The burnt feather and the glowing city together charge the final image of “shadowseam wonder,” satisfying the object-as-setting and environment-charging-closure tests. A slight bias toward the visual is the only minor limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    The iridescent cave/geode is vividly realized and integrated: crystal floors casting rainbows, pulsing walls, and later the sprouts in the mineral cracks all feel tactile and purposeful. The environment is filtered through her sensibility (“watching joy through frosted glass”), tying setting directly to emotional stakes. The cave’s dimming and its nature as a place “where forgetting was stronger than remembering” constrain her time and choices. The final image of seedlings in crystal charged by the cave context gives the setting real thematic weight rather than postcard prettiness.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tidal arcade under the boardwalk is vivid, tactile, and integral: acoustics, tourist flows, darkness pools, and the returning water all shape Marcus’s tactics and time horizon. The tide clock and encroaching waves function as a quiet but real constraint and charge the final image of footprints erased. Details like the marine layer, “foam fingers,” and the carved arcade feel observed rather than generic, and they’re consistently filtered through Marcus’s professional eye. The setting both mirrors and materially supports the theme of a “calculated wilderness” of human behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    The twilight garden under alien constellations, dew-slick stones, marble statues, and pulsing wisteria are vivid and consistently integrated into action and mood. Setting meaningfully charges the ending: the garden becomes the repository of her imprint and the soil that seeds future rebellions. World rules around the nostalgia ban and contraband memory are sketched efficiently and stay consistent. A slight tilt toward visual and conceptual imagery over other senses keeps this just below the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    The harbor, mist, dawn light, and atrium architecture are vivid and tightly filtered through Marcus’s glazier sensibility, with weather and time-of-day directly shaping what he can see. The prism atrium, noctilucent clouds, and rippling pool are not postcard backdrops but active agents in the thematic work, culminating in the final charged image of light, water, and rings. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrict physical choices, it absolutely charges the closure—this lesson could not be told in a generic room. The selective focus on glass, water, and light keeps the atmosphere coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.0)
    The mountain ridge, moonlight, and the celestial conjunction are vivid and tonally aligned with the story’s contemplative mode, and the porcelain box functions as a powerful micro-setting object. Details are filtered through Marcus’s dual lens as firefighter and guilty mentor, grounding both the night and the remembered fires. The environment mostly provides atmosphere and solitude rather than hard constraints on choice, so it charges theme more than tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tide-polished grotto, limestone spirals, and incoming high tide are vividly rendered and strongly thematized, mirroring equations and thinning boundaries between worlds. Setting is integrated with function: the grotto is where timelines leak artifacts, where measurements are possible, and where the tidal moment triggers confluence. The recurring use of the gauge in this place, with light, shadows, and spirals, charges the final images. The environment could constrain choices more concretely, but it already does substantial work for mood, concept, and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ivy-choked university, green corridors, and ash-strewn fireplace are vivid and specific, filtered through Mira’s professional attention to acoustics. Setting and premise are tightly fused: walls as memory devices, ivy as the new architecture, climate ruins as the frame for human echoes. Environmental details (narrowed passage, vegetation-choked doorway) modestly constrain movement and choices, not just decorate. The final image of her disappearing back into the green architecture elegantly charges the atmosphere with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    The terrace, prism parapet, and dawn city are richly rendered and always tied to action: the echoing space amplifies her song, the parapet refracts light into “possibilities,” and the cathedral/bells create a live temporal constraint. The weather and light aren’t mere wallpaper—they encode the story’s rules about bending reality and directly inform her method. The setting meaningfully charges the final image as the terrace “blooms with doors” and the sparrow lands on the prism, making environment inseparable from the story’s premise. A slight overindulgence in atmospheric description at times keeps it just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the ancient terrace, twin suns, crystalline and heavy-bodied species, and the memory-glass clipboard all feel specific and integrated. Environmental details (no shadows during alignment, the border-tree wood, stones remembering ceremonies) directly charge theme and mood without feeling like a tour. The clipboard and the alignment function as micro-settings that constrain ritual and choices, especially in the final image of the light changing. World rules feel consistent and are learned through action and perception, not exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    The salt flat environment is vivid, tactile, and inextricable from the logic of the story: the drought-sculpted map, the acoustic fossil beds, and the salt’s preservative and resonant properties all constrain what Vera can do and why she does it here. Weather and landscape (thunder that won’t arrive, redirected monsoon, heat wave) are active forces, not backdrop, and they bear directly on the preservation method. The recurring objects—salt, egg, fissures, case—are tightly bound to place and recharged at the end. The worldbuilding around climate manipulation and agribusiness reads plausible within the speculative frame and supports theme without feeling like an info-dump.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    The silver courtyard, snow, and prism sanctuary are vividly rendered and carry consistent atmosphere that matches the story’s austerity and quiet rebellion. Setting details are filtered through Lyralei’s aesthetic training, which helps them feel lived rather than merely scenic. The final image of melted circles in the snow reflecting her authentic self meaningfully reweights earlier visual motifs. The environment does not strongly constrain tactics beyond hosting the sanctuary and threads, so it functions more as charged backdrop than active obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    The decommissioned radar dome, the gaps showing meteors, and the campfire story stick form a vivid, coherent atmosphere that strongly mirrors and amplifies the concerns with echo, tracking, and narrative responsibility. Details are selective and purposeful (the dome’s acoustic properties; the notches catching shadow; grinding ink in that vast husk). The environment charges the final image—the meteor hush outside the dome and the stick as baton—but it doesn’t substantially constrain his choices, keeping this just below top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto above the clouds is vividly rendered and integral: moisture dissolves the signals, heightening impermanence; moss, ferns, and dew are not wallpaper but the medium of the ritual. Environmental rules (bowl catching seeds, altitude, constant damp) are consistent and directly shape tactics (temporary plant structures, spores as memory carriers). The final image of the grotto reclaiming her work charges the theme powerfully. This is publishable-level setting work in both texture and functional constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    The icebound sanctum, aurora-lit ceiling, sweating ice walls, and Svalbard setting are vivid and consistently threaded through the action. Environment actively shapes choices: she uses “fragments of the sanctum’s ice as her investment material,” and the melting walls and dawn aurora charge the final image with temporal and emotional stakes. Details are economical yet specific, with the Victorian cache and hair rope feeling of a piece with the cold, archival atmosphere. The setting isn’t just backdrop; it underwrites tone and the thematic concern with preservation under warming, unstable conditions.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bunker, bioluminescent moss, rust-bleeding directive, storm, and forest are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Kira’s attention, creating a strong, eerie atmosphere. Environmental elements aren’t mere backdrop: the flooding bunker, humming processors, and wafer seal all intersect with her actions and the closing image. Weather and rewilded forest shape tone more than tactical choice, but they still weight the journey and final emergence into light. The setting feels specific and lived-in, not a generic sci-fi bunker.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    The palace is vivid, specific, and functionally integral: architectural ratios, constellations in the walls, phosphorescent mortar, and the observatory all shape what she can do and how contact occurs. Setting is never postcard; it is the mechanism of the plot and the thematic vehicle (belief encoded in measurable stone, a building as encryption device). The final image of the palace “awakened” as a meeting place between minds is charged directly by its environment. This depth and integration make the setting a standout strength.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Soundless Sanctuary is sharply defined—silence as a never-having-been, touch as language, walls as memory—so the environment clearly constrains tactics and enables Marcus’ method. The music box and the stones function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image and make the world feel conceptually coherent. World rules (no sound, cellular memory, between-heartbeats liminality) are consistent and learned through action rather than infodump. A bit more tactile or spatial grounding of the Magistrate’s entrance and physicality could have pushed this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ruined orchard district and sentient-feeling fog are vividly realized and tightly tied to the magic system (mirrors “remembering intentions,” chemicals derived from the fog). Environment and objects (workshop, salvaged mirrors, dead trees turned galaxy pillars) actively charge the central ritual and the final image in the hand mirror. Setting is filtered through Elara’s craft-minded eye, avoiding generic fantasy texture. This is a standout strength and could edge into truly exceptional territory with one more concrete way the setting constrained a choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cathedral-turned-orchard is vivid and original—trees through broken rafters, roots like “determined fingers,” quartz eyes hanging like fruit—and consistently filtered through Elara’s perspective. The environment shapes action (rope ladder, canopy work among branches) and heavily charges the final image of a glowing “orchard cathedral” watched over by mended eyes. Details are economical yet lush, and the religious/natural juxtaposition underpins the thematic shift from rigid structure to organic growth. The only minor limitation is that environmental constraints don’t strongly alter tactics beyond basic staging.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    The astral orchard, metallic asteroid, and bark-grown bathroom fixtures are vivid, specific, and thematically integrated rather than decorative. The environment actively shapes experience: the bathroom as a liminal refuge where thought can unfold, the orchard as a place where time “grows like fruit,” and the final apple bite as a charged reconfiguration of understanding. Recurring objects (shell, trees, blossoms, apple) strongly charge the final image. World rules are surreal but internally consistent and always filtered through the curator’s perceptual logic.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and tightly integrated: the mountain bookstore that rearranges itself, the singing books, and the amber-frozen seekers all shape both atmosphere and concrete obstacles. Environmental rules (reconfiguring corridors, logic-trap room, the mountain as a negotiating entity) are consistent and drive choices. The final image of the labyrinth becoming a “garden of knowledge” is thematically and spatially charged by the earlier botanical and architectural details. A slight limitation is that physical navigation feels largely summary-solved; the space rarely constrains real-time tactical decisions under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned carnival ship and foggy bay are vividly and specifically rendered—the calliope, salt-crusted machines, peeling backdrops, and carousel horses all feel lived-in and thematically apt. Details are seen through Marina’s scientific and mnemonic obsessions (paint samples, swatches, cellular memory), which keeps them from feeling like a mere haunted-carnival catalog. The ship and fog charge the mood and the final image, and the recurring emerald swatch functions as a micro-setting object that constrains and guides her last choice. Setting could exert a bit more concrete tactical constraint, but its atmospheric and symbolic integration is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    The clock tower mechanism room is vivid and integral: gears overhead, the impossible thirteenth chime, and the liminal door all shape what Elara can do and when. The rope and mechanism function as a micro-setting that constrains access to forbidden histories and the merged space. World rules about time and institutional secrecy are introduced through action and remain consistent. The final image of the clock resuming its “normal” hours without ever chiming thirteen sharply charges the story’s atmosphere of official denial.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    The harmonic caves, frozen pool, crack-pattern “manuscript,” and echo stone form a tightly integrated environment that constrains tactics (listening for stress, not brute force) and shapes the logic of the ritual. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, especially in how sound and silence are made spatial and almost tactile. World rules feel consistent and are revealed through action rather than exposition. The setting also charges the final image, with the transformed symphony below her dwelling tying place directly to the story’s thematic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glass humming pavilion, transparent dome, beacon tower, and anti-light are vivid, coherent, and strongly filtered through Mira’s sensory bias toward harmonics. Setting is not decorative: the humming detects the shard’s impact, the star paths and navigation ring dictate tactics, and the final image is literally the pavilion “singing its new-old song.” The world’s rules around silence, darkness, and navigation stay consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integral: stormlit observatory above a petrified world, crystal pillars humming with stored experiences, fog-stone oceans, all tightly filtered through Lyra’s archivist gaze. Environmental elements directly shape the premise and final image—the observatory as one of the last “islands,” the lightning illuminating survivors as they begin to “become.” Details like the summer-quill and crystal forecourt feel specific, not generic, and are meaningfully tied to action. The only slight limitation is that some description serves mood more than constraint, but overall this is a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: phosphorescent moss, the fortress, and the rearranged star-map mosaic are all integrated into character perception and tactics (e.g., grinding minerals from stones and moss for colors). World rules around the Dimming and the fortress-as-refuge are conveyed through concrete detail rather than exposition, creating a strong atmospheric frame. The environment directly supplies the resources for hope (materials for fireworks) and charges the final image of the fortress “blooming differently that night.” This intertwining of world, action, and theme is a notable strength.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    The grotto and tidal pools are exquisitely rendered, with specific, sensorial detail (barnacles, hermit crabs, bioluminescent plankton) that feels both scientifically grounded and thematically charged. The environment is not just a backdrop but a living analog for the story’s meditation on time and transition, and the jade cicada as a recurring object charges the final image. The setting does not heavily constrain concrete physical choice, but it deeply shapes perception, stakes, and meaning. This is near top-tier atmospheric work for the story’s quiet aims.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    The trellis above the clouds, the golden lattice, and the inversion physics are vivid and integrated into action rather than offered as backdrop; gravity’s inversion and the glass wall materially shape Mira’s experience. The crystallizing silence garden makes the environment feel dynamically alive, not decorative, and the setting meaningfully mirrors the thematic move from compression to airy expansion. World rules (inversion cycle, trellis as guesthouse) are sketched economically yet feel internally consistent. A slight sense of “luxury SF postcard” lingers—the xenial infrastructure and its broader implications stay suggestive rather than deeply inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.5)
    The drifting prism terraces and their acoustic properties are vividly specific and consistently rule-driven, with each named platform altering sound in a distinct way that matters to Marcus’s tactics. Setting is filtered through his professional ear, which keeps the detail purposeful rather than touristic. The environment constrains action—his route and speed choices depend on how each terrace shapes sound—and charges the final hush at the Prism Crown. The storm glass and train-whistle landscape recur to good effect, though the city’s social texture remains mostly implied rather than inhabited.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and thematically charged: the kaleidoscopic waterfall as threshold, bio-luminescent orchard, glitching smart-paint shed, and binary sunrise all feel integral rather than decorative. Environmental elements meaningfully shape action (she must pass through the waterfall, use the shed’s layered paint, and wait for sunrise to unlock the song). The orchard’s singing trees strongly charge the final image and deepen the sense of “futuristic nostalgia.” A slight excess of descriptive gloss in places is the only minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ashen sanctuary, charcoal pillars "like burnt fingers," and absent roof under starlight are vivid and thematically aligned with burned bridges and thresholds. Setting is consistently filtered through her vocation—shadows as wounded animals, scars of light, the sanctuary as both ruin and workspace—so atmosphere feels lived-in rather than decorative. The recurring doorknocker ring functions as a micro-setting/object that meaningfully charges the final image. Environment doesn’t much constrain her choices moment-to-moment, but it strongly shapes tone and the conceptual frame of endings and thresholds.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm and promise-crystals are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the story’s logic—this place is the only arena where “quantum promises” can ripen into light-diamonds. The setting details are not postcard; the mushrooms’ field and cavern pressure directly enable and shape Marina’s actions and the final image. The bolt as a micro-setting/object also charges the closure when turned at the pressure peak. World rules feel consistent for this surreal premise, and atmosphere strongly supports theme.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.3)
    The sepia reading room, mahogany shelves, amber-tinted air, and broken window create a cohesive, textured environment that mirrors the story’s themes of curated history and shattering legacy. Setting is filtered through Victoria’s gaze and is not mere backdrop: the room holds ancestral actions, the gramophone is embedded in it, and the shattered window plus mockingbird reconfigure the space in the final image. While the environment doesn’t sharply constrain physical options, it does meaningfully charge the emotional and thematic stakes at closure. A slight deepening of how the estate’s geography constrains or tempts her could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is rich, precise, and integral: silver-barked trees as living equations, liquid starlight, obsidian floor, endless night—all filtered through Aldric’s practiced, almost mathematical gaze. Environment shapes the narrative, not just decorates it: the trees “calculating the architecture of what might be” and later sprouting from his blood directly charge the climax and final image. The greenhouse’s boundaries physically expand against the night as a concrete expression of the story’s stakes. This is high-level atmospheric and functional worldbuilding, just shy of truly transcendent innovation.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    The foster care file room and its dust are vividly and economically rendered, with details like “dust had its own language” and “dust patterns on that particular file were disturbed, recent” doing symbolic and functional work. The environment shapes knowledge and options: his job and the physical state of files enable his search and reveal others’ prior searching. The recurring micro-setting of dust and motes charges the final image of him leaving the archives “to their patient dust,” tying place directly to theme. It stops short of 9+ because the setting constrains mood and access more than it forces a concrete, pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    The auric lagoon, starlit reflections, and decayed urban infrastructure are vivid and specific, with the lagoon and puddles doing real story work as both tool and atmosphere. The hidden lock behind false coral and the fluorescent-lit archive concretize the world’s strata of forgotten history. The setting coheres tonally with the Ministry’s revisionism and underpins the magic-like reflection mechanic. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain movement, it meaningfully frames and charges key choices and images, especially in the opening and closing.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    The radiant grotto, prism atrium, bioluminescent moss, and dewdrops are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the story’s mechanics and mood. The atrium’s strange acoustics and the weight of silence directly shape the tactic used against the prophecy, and the dewdrops physically “carry away” syllables, then return in the final image. Environment and recurring objects constrain what is possible here—this precise place allows negative-space performance to have world-scale impact. The ending’s dewdrop rainbows function as a charged, reweighted reprise that fuses setting, theme, and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Ashen Skyborne Arbor, upward-falling leaves, cloud-drinking roots, and singing seeds create a striking, cohesive atmosphere that’s strongly filtered through Mira’s work and heritage. Setting details are economical and purposeful—branches like “bridges of bone” and veins forming letters directly support the story’s thematic concerns with language, memory, and verticality. The arbor also charges the final image, with ash-gray transformed by moss into something “altogether more alive,” tying environment to resolution. What’s slightly missing at elite level is the setting acting as a tangible constraint on choice, rather than primarily as a symbolic and tonal field.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and thematically charged: the subterranean waterfall, damp workshop, and perpetual-autumn greenhouse are all sensorially grounded and recur as functional constraints. The waterfall is not mere backdrop—it powers tools, ruins precision, vibrates the compass, and supplies the mist that animates the greenhouse leaves; the greenhouse in turn becomes the stage where the system’s rules are revealed. These environmental elements directly shape Marcus’s tactics and the story’s magic logic. A touch more embodied navigation of space under pressure could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Drowning Forge is vivid and specific—the rain-dripped skylights, slick floor, cold iron, and dormant furnace all serve mood and theme. The environment meaningfully echoes the characters’ states (ruin and remaking) and is woven into action rather than dumped. It doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, but it powerfully charges images like the furnace and the final “chrysalis” re-seeing of the foundry.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    Echo Gorge and the “hidden sunrise” are vividly rendered and meaningfully functional: the acoustics amplify both music and confession, and the timing of the light shapes Mara’s tactics. Details like the harp-sounds becoming “weeping made of music” and the gorge turning into a “cathedral of gold” tie atmosphere directly to the emotional arc. The crocodile tooth operates as a micro-setting object that constrains knowledge and charges the final image. This is rich, economical scene-building that feels lived-in rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is rich and specific: the UV forest, bioluminescent canopy, and recovery station are integrated through Lyra’s altered perception rather than as static backdrop. Environmental detail (UV-visible moss in Fibonacci spirals, glass walls, infrared heat signatures) both reflects her interior state and grounds the speculative world. The recurring object (pewter mask strap) and the body as micro-setting constrain sensation and charge the final image of leaving it behind. A slight sense of “tour” description early on is outweighed by how consistently the environment shapes perception and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.4)
    The alchemist’s market suspended above rooftops, rope bridges, pigment details, and the harbor/fog ecology are vivid and integrated into action rather than static backdrop. World rules around paintings and light as language feel consistent and are learned through Mira’s interaction with the canvas. The environment contributes to the charged final image (fog as projection surface, lighthouse as locus) even if it doesn’t tightly constrain choices. Sensory and conceptual specificity are strong without tipping into museum-tour excess.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned circus ticket office and elevator shaft are textured, specific, and consistently filtered through Marcus’s mechanical and spectral awareness (buzzing fluorescent, “cables singing,” dust as map). Setting constrains action in meaningful ways: the dust patterns reveal the hidden cache, the ceiling space literally hides the evidence, and the decrepit building embodies the systemic neglect under investigation. The mainspring barrel as a tool-object and the fluorescent’s final flicker both charge the closing image. Atmosphere supports theme without lapsing into museum-tour description.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Glass Orchard Library, crystalline apple trees, bottled whispers, and frost-maps create a striking, coherent setting that feels inseparable from the premise. Environment shapes tactics: she reads and transcribes frost patterns, works the press among glass trees “shedding pages,” and ultimately dissolves into the same frost imagery that has guided her. The floating-above-clouds image, and later the library sinking into that cloud sea, charges the stakes and the final cadence. Description remains purposeful rather than touristic; nearly every detail participates in mood or mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Versailles-on-an-asteroid setting and visible timestreams are richly specific and consistently filtered through Cassia’s sensibility. Details like cherubs weeping gold, black-draped mirrors, and rivers of amber time do more than decorate; they mirror the themes of opulence vs extinction and memory vs silence. The temporal storm and mirrors charge the atmosphere and Cassia’s argument, though they don’t strongly constrain immediate tactics. Overall the world feels coherent, distinctive, and integral to tone and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vividly imagined and tightly integrated: the resonance chamber’s acoustics, the copper walls, and the rust-on-lies rule all shape tactics and tone, not just ambience. Details like the thousand mended boxes, silver threads “sung into existence,” and the domed ceiling pierced by sunlight charge the final image and anchor the fantastical premise. The world’s perpetual dusk and rusting on deception consistently influence action and stakes. A bit more sensory variety beyond the visual and sonic might deepen immersion, but what’s here is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    The limestone cliffs, dead factory, spiraling passage, and phosphorescent lagoon are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Vera’s sensory priorities, especially smell and texture. The environment meaningfully constrains choice (she must wait for the factory to close; the cave’s depth and lagoon’s properties frame the threshold moment). Recurring objects-as-setting—the vial, the compass, the cliffs/factory contrast—charge the final image of her returning to moonlight with “impossible rain” hidden on her. A slight overreliance on visual description versus other senses in the climax is the only minor limit.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    The storm-tossed limestone archway, the van, and the driftwood are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Marina’s artisan eye. Weather and stone aren’t postcard backdrops; the storm’s soundscape and the arch’s threshold quality actively shape mood and choice, culminating in the “turbine-hum” becoming her new compass. The environment constrains options (shelter, pause) and charges the final image of the archway waiting for future storms. Detail is economical yet lush, with a strong sense of place and atmosphere that supports theme.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting work is richly textured: the amber pavilion, copper roof, cathedral glass, and seasonal weather all feel specific and atmospheric rather than generic. Environment meaningfully shapes choices—she works at night in an enclosed, resonant space, uses amber resin from the pavilion itself, and the winter closing sets a soft boundary on her project. The final image of the pavilion “holding summer and darkness in equal measure” directly charges the ending. This is nearly publish-ready at elite level, with just a hint of descriptive luxuriance that could be pared for even greater focus.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    The zeppelin-archive and obsidian lagoon are sharply imagined and consistently threaded, with the lagoon in particular functioning as both secret meeting ground and final mirror. Spatial relations (zeppelin above, lagoon below, shore work) remain clear and tactile. The setting’s tone—eerie, devotional, clandestine—supports the theme and charges the last image of “an infinity of floating libraries.” Setting could further constrain concrete choices, but even as-is it substantially shapes the story’s feel and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and particular—Paper-Lantern Cove, the jellyfish, the dry fountain—and filtered through Silas’s attention in ways that support mood. The jellyfish motif pays off nicely at the end, their heartbeat-like pulsing charging the final image and echoing the town’s “revival.” While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it does meaningfully charge the atmosphere and closure. A slightly more functional interaction between landscape and his method could raise this toward the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and thematically loaded: drowned streets, rooftop orchard from a ruined monastery, the silenced foghorn, engineered soil, and the sky that hasn’t been blue in his lifetime all accrue into a coherent, lived-in world. The garden, apples, and skyscraper height materially shape the story’s stakes (what survives when the tower cracks, where the manuscript will be found) and deeply charge the final image. Details consistently filter through Matthias’s priorities as a scribe and archivist, avoiding tourist-list description. The environment’s evolution—from foghorn expectation to silence, from potential collapse to surviving garden—mirrors and supports the conceptual shift about time and language.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    The icebound atrium under Cassiopeia’s light, the crystalline dome, living oak panels, and pocket-dimension garden are rendered with rich, specific, and consistent detail that feels integral rather than decorative. Setting elements are causally important—the starlight reveals the cap’s nature, the ice sublimates as entropy is reversed, and the oak at the center of the renewed garden charges the final image. World rules about time-bound seeds and temporal pockets are conveyed through action and perception, not infodumps. The environment strongly shapes tone and the sense of numinous, careful power.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sanctuary above a cloud sea, solstice hush, vanished animals, and humming stone create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s tightly tied to the stakes. Environment constrains options (bell vs siren, sound propagation, physical remoteness) and directly shapes the outcome through the hush that carries the warning. Weather, elevation, and stone vibration are all used as living pressures rather than postcard details. The final image of ice crystals chiming like bells effectively recharges the bell motif without feeling overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.3)
    The edge-of-known-space tracking station, meteor showers, and yellow lantern glass are vividly realized and tightly integrated with the mood. Details like “compressed stellar dust” and altered meteor trajectories feel particular to this world and the janitor’s vocation. The environment (obsolescence, isolation, the observation dome) meaningfully underpins the character’s options and the thematic stakes, even if it doesn’t overtly constrain physical choices. Overall, the atmosphere is strong, economical, and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned apiaries and scorched oasis are vivid and specific, with recurring images (white boxes like broken teeth, honeycomb, colored glass) that charge the atmosphere and final image. The environment meaningfully shapes the story: her isolation, the absence of bees, and the slow death of the oasis frame the ghosts’ return and the weight of preservation. The stained glass box as a micro-setting object anchors multiple beats and the ending. A bit more tactile interaction with the harsh environment (heat, thirst, physical discomfort) under pressure could make the constraints even more palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is striking and specific—the emerald silo, rust-colored sky, crystalline walls, and humming structure all filter cleanly through Marcus’s perceptions. The environment meaningfully charges the concept (a lighthouse of crystallized time, resonating with the fragment) and the final image of stepping back into the rust sky feels grounded. However, the silo and landscape rarely constrain choices or tactics; they are more symbolic than obstructive or enabling. The vividness and integration with theme are strong, but not yet structurally indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cobalt lagoon, storm aftermath, mangroves, and dawn light are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Mira’s sensibility (“hammered gold,” “burnished hush”). Setting and recurring objects (lagoon, feather, kite) meaningfully charge the final images, even if they seldom hard-constrain choices. Weather and water subtly mirror the thematic work of mending and revision without slipping into overt allegory. This is high-level atmospheric integration, just shy of 9+ because the environment doesn’t quite force tactical decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    The temple orchard, volcanic stone pillars, and copper wiring are vivid, specific, and integrated into action (wrapping branches, the humming pillars, the final glow under her palm). Setting is not backdrop but mechanism: the fused stone-root architecture enables the interspecies council and constrains how communication must occur. The final image—her hand on the pillar, feeling “ancient patience” through the copper network—directly charges the environment with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rainwashed tower, bronze quiet, overgrown sculpture path, and magnetic lines are vivid and tightly integrated with mood, giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine. Setting details are filtered through Elena’s scientific yet uneasy gaze, which keeps them from feeling like a tourist catalog. The environment does begin to constrain meaning (tower as convergence point, dampened sound as design), and the rain/footprints tie into the cyclical pilgrimage motif. Still, the tower and weather rarely affect tactics or options; they mainly charge the tone rather than forcing different choices, which holds this just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is a major strength: the jetty, dead reef, wild roses, and mirrored water are vivid, sensorially specific, and consistently filtered through the coachman’s history and work. Environmental details (phosphorus/nitrogen, shrapnel in soil, calcium reef bones) are not just decorative; they directly inform his tactics and charge the final image of seeds splitting into “calcium embrace.” The world’s quiet magic (bird languages, Akkadian labels) feels internally consistent and grounded. The only reason this doesn’t break higher is that the environment, while richly present, doesn’t physically constrain his choices beyond guiding where he plants.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Heap as a tower-stack scrapyard over a dead Mississippi is vivid, efficient, and firmly POV-filtered through smell and physical constraint. The glass craters, hidden green valley, and impossible autumn trees extend the world-building without feeling like a catalog, and the environment (crater, magnetic direction, valley) directly shapes what Sage can do and discover. The recurring object—the waxed leaf—functions as a micro-setting device, literally mapping space and charging the final image. Overall, setting meaningfully charges both tactics (navigation) and theme (scarred wasteland vs. sanctuary).

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observation deck, void of stars yet ringed by crystalline walls, is vivid and tonally apt, and the gilded compass rose functions as a charged micro-setting object that literally and thematically shapes the final act. Temporal dilation fields and the post-shutdown station rules are sketched with just enough specificity to feel consistent without exposition drag. The environment constrains choice—she is isolated on this deck, and the only working navigation system becomes the locus of her solution—so the final image of the pulsing compass and reappearing crewmates is strongly grounded. A slightly wider sensory range beyond visual/thermal (e.g., sound or bodily disorientation in the dilation fields) could deepen atmosphere further.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    The icebound spire, impossible sky, and living-ice chessboard are vivid, specific, and woven into Renn’s perceptions rather than feeling like static backdrop. The wrong sky and humming ice recur to charge both the opening and closing images, with the approving, intentionally wrong heavens reweighting the premise at the end. World rules (e.g., secrets embedded in pieces, liquid time, reality’s architecture) feel coherent within the story’s dream-logic. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical tactics, but it strongly shapes atmosphere and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    The whispering gallery, abandoned parliament, and pawnless chessboard are vivid and tightly integrated, with acoustics and absence doing thematic work. Setting is always seen through Marina’s priorities: the gallery as sanctuary, the board as a battlefield missing its dead. Environment and objects charge the final image—the “parliament of whispers” and remembered pawn-spaces—without becoming static backdrops. The only reason this doesn’t edge into 9+ is that the environment constrains mood and stance more than specific tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mountain-sized labyrinthine bookstore is vivid and particular—books of bark, shells, fabric—and always filtered through the seer’s tactile perception. The environment deeply shapes options: the maze of texts, the mercury pools, and finally the sole bookless chamber of soil that forces a shift from reading to planting. Recurring environmental elements (mercury, stone, soil, thunder in the mountain’s bones) directly charge the final images. The setting is rich enough for a longer work but is kept mostly in service to the character’s transformation here.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is rich and specific—suspended raindrops, “lightning painted permanent veins across the pewter sky,” the monumental chessboard, and the tapestry all reinforce a palpable atmosphere of frozen consequence. Details are strongly filtered through Kaspar’s chess-tutor sensibility, and the environment mirrors his stuckness without feeling like a mere allegorical overlay. The time-freeze and labyrinthine board conceptually constrain possibility (nothing here can move except understanding), which charges the final image of him walking back through the suspended rain unable to alter this world. It stops shy of 9+ because the physical environment rarely forces tactical compromise; it is more a powerful metaphorical container than an active constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    The towers of bone, morning mist, and echoing canyon are vivid, tactile, and specific, with acoustics tied directly to the plot (“Words are prisms” applied to sound). The resonance chamber and the ossuary design are not just décor; they constrain Kira’s tactics and enable the story’s central reversal. Environmental details evolve—quiet ossuary → swelling chorus → pulsing spire—charging the final image. A slight underuse of other senses beyond sight and sound keeps it just short of truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop over an acid sea is vivid, tactile, and immediately affects action (supports snapping, tools sliding, fumes burning her throat). Environmental detail is economical yet charged, with the sea and machinery constraining time and options while mirroring the theme of corrosive consequences of innovation. The statue and charm function as charged micro-setting objects, shaping how magic operates and what choices Mira can make. This is extremely strong, though not quite 9-band because the mechanics of the greater world (e.g., evacuation, acid transformation) remain slightly generalized rather than fully individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    The quay, narrow track, limestone cliffs, phosphorescent cave, and rock shelves are vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail. Setting is strongly filtered through Marina’s sensibility—her intimate knowledge of the harbor versus the eerie unfamiliarity of the cave. The cave network and its blue-green glow directly charge the final image as sanctuary and “brief forever,” not just backdrop. Environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, but it decisively shapes the emotional stakes and closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cobalt lighthouse, dawn light, and sea are vivid and specific, and the beam itself becomes functionally important when it “caught something impossible” and helps solidify Thomas. The night-jasmine scent as an impossible environmental intrusion is an effective micro-setting device linking inner state and world rules. Weather (heat wave breaking) and sea conditions are more atmospheric than constraining, but the isolation and vertical architecture (spiral stairs to lamp room) plausibly shape her actions. Description is selective and purposeful, rarely veering into mere postcard detail.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    The starlit signal station, poisoned corridor, sulfur fields, and the censer foot create a vivid, coherent world filtered through Marina’s sensibility as a navigator. Setting is never postcard-like; the broken hydraulics and array angle concretely constrain her options and tactics. The censer foot functions as micro-setting and tool, physically anchoring her and then charging the final image as the warm weight that holds her to this “place between worlds.” A small limitation is that non-visual senses (smell of toxins, sulfur, machinery) could be leveraged even more to heighten immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    The hanging orchard ravine is vivid, specific, and integrated into action (“truffle rake catching on storm-bent apple branches,” trees growing horizontally on cables). The environment meaningfully constrains the cure’s existence (truffle ecology) and colors the tone, especially in the lightning-lit image of “trees swaying like hanged men.” The recurring orchard-sideways-growth motif directly charges the final thematic statement about humanity learning to “speak sideways,” so setting clearly reweights the ending. Sensory detail is well-chosen and never lapses into static postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    The opal dock, mist, and lighthouse beam are vivid, specific, and recur with evolving function: the beam teaches the pattern of gaps; the dock bears the scratched temporal coordinates. Environment is not mere backdrop—it provides the mechanics for the investigation and charges the final image of a possible swimmer in the rotating light. The contrast between mountain chapel and sea’s edge deepens the thematic exile of the Edelweiss. This is near top-tier work; the only restraint is that environmental constraints operate more conceptually than through hard tactical limits.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vividly particular—from the dusty shop and rising creek to the kudzu curtain and the cavern “bloomed with impossible summer light.” The cavern and its light/topology logic are not just decorative; they directly host and shape the doorway of decisions and the stakes of the final choice. Recurring environmental elements (creek, ants, chip, cavern) all charge the final image as he follows the ants back out. The only minor limitation is that the town/warehouse district is more lightly sketched than the magical spaces.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the cobalt grotto, backward-blooming roses, and frozen fire crystals create a coherent, eerie world filtered through Seraphina’s perceptions. Environmental details actively charge the stakes: thin air, altitude, “bleeding starlight” and ember crystals all participate in the bargain’s revelation and the transformation. The final image—firefly-queens rising through the grotto’s mouth into crimson-painted sky—relies entirely on the established setting for its power. World rules are consistent enough to feel intentional without expository drag.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ember nexus, twilight, and the nautilus shell are vivid and tightly integrated into character psychology and theme. The lab environment and dying nexus directly frame Lyra’s urgency, while twilight and the shell’s spiral structure mirror the story’s concern with return and compression. The final image—lab dark, nexus cooled, shell-sun casting "new shadows"—clearly uses setting as a charged object to reweight the whole piece. The worldbuilding around pocket-sun alchemy is suggestive rather than detailed, but at this length that economy works in the story’s favor.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ranger cabin, mountains, birch trees, and wind are specific and sensorially grounded (“bark peeling from ancient trees,” “scent of birch sap”) and consistently filtered through Maya’s time-fractured perception. The setting is not just backdrop: the archive-cabin and mountain precipice shape the core actions of chronicling and stepping out to “fall.” Environmental elements recur to charge the ending (wind, wings, bark) in a satisfying way. Still, the world around the cabin rarely constrains options beyond providing a place to stand and jump, so the setting is evocative rather than fully tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and functionally integral: the fogged windows, steam, brass, and water channels are not just atmosphere but the medium through which grief and time are understood. The shop’s physical logic—water channels, mineral deposits, rust, the clamp screw’s placement—directly informs action and interpretation. Fog and condensation evolve through the scene and culminate in the ultrasound-like patterns on glass, beautifully charging the final image. This is very close to top-tier; a single, concrete constraint (e.g., a repair difficulty imposed by the cramped shop or humidity) would nudge it into truly indispensable-environment territory.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    The floating stone platform, between-storm sky, and tea ceremony details are vivid and tonally integrated, giving a strong sense of atmosphere. Setting and weather echo the liminal “breath between storms” state of Kira’s internal conflict. However, the environment rarely constrains or alters choices; the scene would largely function the same in another quiet exam space. The body (crystals) and object (quill) do more causal work than the broader environment, keeping this just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    The archive, cathedral, and doomed orchard are specific and sensorially vivid (the smell of yellowed paper, bergamot, roses; dust shaking with each falling tree). Setting actively pressures choices: the chainsaws and orchard’s impending destruction impose a ticking clock, and the archive’s scores and acoustics are necessary for the requiem’s completion. The perfume bottle functions as both world-building tool and charged micro-setting, literally mediating the boundary between worlds and constraining how the ritual must be done. Environment and objects clearly charge the final image (empty, uncorked bottle; vanished orchard; music remaining), satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.9)
    The temple library outside spacetime is vivid and specific—curving shelves, frozen dust motes, impossible geometry that later recontextualizes as higher-dimensional truth. Setting is tightly tied to theme: the architecture embodies paradox and the library transforms into a transparent “cosmic courtroom.” However, the environment rarely constrains concrete choices; it functions more as symbolic atmosphere than as a tactical obstacle. Still, for this lyric mode, the setting is integrated and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    The fjord, cliff-edge observatory, and carved hydraulic channels are vividly rendered and deeply integrated into how she thinks, notices, and works. The environment meaningfully shapes her role—she is literally stationed at the edge measuring curvature and horizon shift—and the recurring imagery of vertical drop and reflected stillness charges the final realization about razor edges and distances. Details like the gurgling system beneath her feet and the bell’s sound across the water are specific and purposeful. This setting feels inseparable from the story’s concept and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    The underground bioluminescent mushroom farm is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Maya’s professional eye and habits. Physical elements—the permeable barriers, spongy substrate, pulsing light—aren’t postcard garnish; they’re the means by which she detects the anomaly and the metaphoric frame for boundaries vs. connection. The final image of the farm glowing brighter as she changes charges the setting with thematic resonance. A slight bias toward visual detail over other senses is the only minor missed opportunity.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rainwashed library, storm, and power outage are specific and atmospheric, with the candle lantern and mica pane doing strong double duty as environment and symbol. Setting is filtered through Elena’s mathematical perception (rivulets as equations, panes casting probability curves), which deepens character and theme. The environment lightly constrains action (power failure, isolation, lanterns) and heavily charges the final image. A slightly stronger sense of the physical library space beyond “reading room” and windows could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.5)
    The subway utility tunnel, obsolete payphones, and the third rail’s “loneliest frequency” create a vivid, coherent micro-world that feels specific rather than generic urban noir. The environment and the glass disc’s interaction with electromagnetic fields charge the final image and embody the story’s liminal theme. Setting is consistently filtered through Marcus’s sensibility, maintaining tone and plausibility. The space doesn’t quite force tactical choices, but it deeply saturates atmosphere and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.1)
    The blooming jetty, wisteria, and twilight water are not postcard decor; they are tied to the locket photo and Eleanor’s memory, making the setting itself a palimpsest of past and present covenants. Mara’s archivist gaze filters details (ink, watermarks, light on paper) so the environment feels both sensual and occupationally specific. The wisteria’s repeated perfume releases track emotional beats (arrival, decision, closure), culminating in the final wave of scent that charges the last image with earned resonance. The jetty constraints—this exact place of the original photo and covenant—make it the only plausible site for her regenerative act, so the setting meaningfully shapes the story’s logic and ending.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ivy-choked station is concretely drawn and tonally apt, creating a liminal “green cathedral” that mirrors the story’s architecture/forest and order/anarchy tension. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it charges the final image: ivy whispering, station “holding its breath,” tying environment to the nascent network. Details like the pillar “wrapped in decades of green” feel selective and purposeful rather than touristic. This is strong atmospheric work, just shy of using the environment as an active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ultrasonic forest is vividly imagined and filtered through non-visual perception in specific, textured ways (trees speaking different languages, frequencies resonating with bones and blood). The platinum ring and the forest’s sonic architecture meaningfully shape how she moves and understands, rather than serving as backdrop. The “pause of shifting constellations” and the trees’ ultrasonic farewell charge the final image and link environment to theme. A bit more concrete environmental constraint (e.g., genuine navigational risk) could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    The station, observation chamber, and especially the gravitational anomaly are described with selective, purposeful detail that supports both atmosphere and concept. The anomaly’s behavior (bending/filtration of light, observer-specific displays) is consistently applied and integral to the rules of the world. The dried fountain pen works as a micro-setting object that charges the final image and anchors her timeline. A slightly broader use of non-visual sensory grounding in the chamber could further heighten immersion, but what’s here is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    The harbor and moonlit water are not mere backdrop; they actively charge the method (mapping light and position as “silence”) and the final image of a secret concert held by the environment itself. The Leica functions as a micro-setting/tool that constrains choice—no film, no sound—forcing a purely visual ritual. Weather, light, and space evolve from silver night to golden dawn in step with the emotional arc, and the harbor explicitly becomes their “concert hall,” directly shaping the closure image. Detail level is selective and purposeful, with no white-room gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    The archive and subterranean setting are sensually and atmospherically strong—“air tasted of copper and centuries,” limestone corridors, carved shelves of textiles all feel particular and lived-in. Prior settings (church, subway, cave) are efficiently evoked in summary while keeping focus on the present space. The environment supports theme (buried history, erasure) but doesn’t significantly constrain options or force different tactics. Still, the final image of her with the tapestry in this charged space is memorable and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integral: the sound wave garden, crystalline barrier, and auric lagoon are not postcards but mechanisms that absorb drumming, carry memories, and then overflow into the lab. Environmental elements evolve with the plot—waves fusing memories, flowers blooming into aurora, the lab ceiling painted with frequencies—so atmosphere and world-building are tightly meshed. The rules of this speculative environment are sketched economically yet consistently enough to support the climax. The setting also charges the final image, making the transformation feel spatially and sensorially concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    The port-city container labyrinth and geomagnetic storm are vividly rendered and tightly interwoven with action—aurora light on corrugated metal, spinning compasses, and acoustic corridors all shape what’s possible. Marcus’s maps, the amphitheater-like echo spot, and the tapped containers make the environment feel like an active partner in the story rather than backdrop. The setting directly constrains tactics and charges the thematic conflict between systems and embodied knowledge. A touch more sensory variety beyond visual and auditory might deepen texture further, but what’s here is already strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt dock, wet planks, shutters, canal house, and star-reflecting puddles are vivid and recur with purpose rather than as décor. Setting is functionally integrated: puddles enable the reflected constellations, shutters control light and shadow, and the canal with its carried stars charges the final image. Environmental details consistently mirror the emotional stakes without feeling arbitrary (e.g., “dark water carry[ing] reflected stars toward the sea”). This is strong, though the symbolic mirroring occasionally edges close to overstatement rather than trusting the already-rich imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt library in mist, the blue stone walls “breathing,” and the magnetic grotto are vivid, specific, and tonally unified, creating a memorable magical-realist enclave. Setting is filtered through Marcus’s sensibility and nicely entwined with theme (a sanctuary “where past meets prophecy” for forbidden thought). The environment does lightly constrain possibilities—the library is liminal, impermanent, and under surveillance—but mostly supplies mood and symbolism rather than hard tactical limits. The final star-revealing mist image effectively charges the closing sense of opened futures.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    The docks, sublittoral fringe, kelp forests, and bioluminescent Cetacea are sensuously and economically rendered, with water as a recurring, thematically apt texture. The scrimshaw functions as a charged object-as-setting, framing both opening and closing images. Environment constrains choice meaningfully: Mira must go to the literal fringe where shallow meets deep for the island to appear. A touch more tactile resistance from the physical environment under stress could push this into the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    The farmhouse interior, yellowed wallpaper, and especially the looming turbines create a strong, consistent atmosphere that mirrors the mandate’s oppressive cheer. The turbines’ sound and shadows are woven through the action and return at the end, charging the “remade hush” inside the farmhouse by contrast. The bouquet and wooden bird function as micro-setting objects that shape the final image as much as the room itself. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain physical choices, it deeply charges mood and meaning in a way that feels integral.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cobalt atrium, humming quartz columns, and scripture-carved frozen lake are vivid, specific, and tightly integrated with action: the columns respond to him, crescendo, and fall silent; the lake’s cracking is the central event. The environment meaningfully evolves with the plot, shifting from static monument to fluid gateway, and the sky of doors reflected in the dark water is a strong final image. While the setting doesn’t tightly constrain tactical choices (Silas never has to navigate a concrete obstacle), it decisively charges the stakes and closure. World rules are consistent and learned through interaction rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.3)
    The glassblower’s courtyard is vivid and purposeful—light, plants, kiln, and glass all shape what’s possible for Mira and Enzo. Setting details are filtered through Mira’s sensory priorities (texture, gray shades, light on glass) and the post-phoenix ruins orient the broader world. The environment materially charges the ending: the courtyard flowers form the message, the sculpture in that space produces the sound that draws the daughter back. A slightly wider sense of the city beyond the courtyard might deepen scale, but for this length the specificity is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    The laboratory is vividly particular—Victorian glass, acoustic chambers, extinct sounds—and always filtered through Vera’s sensibility. Environment and key objects (bells, acoustic chambers, carbide lens) don’t just decorate; they shape how she can act and what re-interpretation is possible. The lens especially charges both the mid-story perception shift and the final image. Sensory detail is rich yet purposeful, almost entirely avoiding static “museum tour” description.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory is vivid and purposeful: no clocks, only stars, and the candlelit workshop under the dome all mirror the story’s concern with non-linear, cosmic time and grief. Setting is not postcard: the building’s status as refuge and beacon directly enables the stranger’s arrival and justifies Elena’s rituals (unlocked door, visible glow). The crane with coordinates for the observatory itself tightens the integration by making the place a literal waypoint in her cartography of healing. A slight further use of physical constraint (e.g., architecture affecting her solitude or contact) could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rain-beaded skylight, abandoned servers, ghost data, and onyx-ink cards create a richly textured, coherent atmosphere that’s strongly filtered through Vera’s sensibility. The environment supports theme and tone (ruins of speculative finance repurposed as an archaeological lab of culture), even if it rarely constrains concrete choices. The physical space is clear and tactile, and weather is more than decorative, echoing the flow/persistence motif. Lack of direct tactical impact keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is richly imagined and tightly integrated: the crystalline walls, bronze prism pagoda, liquid amber tubes, and twilight light are all filtered through Mira’s task and constraints. Environmental rules (pattern-detecting defenses, tiers, containment vessels) directly shape her actions and possibilities. The final image of the emptied pagoda retroactively charges the earlier descriptions with a sense of completion and loss. Description flirts with the ornate but generally stays purposeful and grounded in action.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    The blooming library above the clouds, bio-glass petals, and eternal dusk are vivid and consistently filtered through Mira’s perspective and work. The setting is not mere backdrop; it literalizes her grandmother’s dream and makes the final realization—that this architecture is itself an inherited vision—hit harder. The river stone functions as a micro-setting object that charges the last image with quiet mystery. A slightly greater sense of how this space constrains her options in the moment (e.g., institutional pressures or physical protocols) could push it even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    The redwood-surrounded, misty workshop with a glass roof is vivid and grounded early, and the stars “like windows into judgment” become an atmospheric pressure throughout. Tools and micro-setting (workbench, terrarium, recovery tank, branch, glass barrier) are integrated into action rather than listed, culminating in the final image of her touching the glass while the ordinary chameleon rests. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactics, but it palpably charges the mood and closure, especially the dawn light and mist as she finds a new stasis. The recurring interplay of artificial glass/roof and natural canopy/sky subtly mirrors the story’s concern with artifice versus authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    The tower medical bay, narrow dawn-lit windows, wild rooftop garden, and city in “meteor hush” are vivid and tightly bound to Maya’s perception. Objects-as-setting (hourglass, coffee ring, scars) function as micro-environments where she reads meaning, and they recur to charge the ending. While the setting doesn’t materially constrain physical options, it convincingly shapes mood and the modes of insight available to her. The atmosphere feels both specific and thematically aligned without slipping into mere postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    The projection booth and theater are rendered with strong, economical specificity—the Art Deco brass, the “sleeping snake” of celluloid, the velvet seats like “closed mouths.” Setting is not postcard decoration; it’s the story’s engine, literally storing and channeling emotion, and the demolition deadline makes place and time part of the pressure. The mapping of emotions onto the room’s geography is a bold, memorable device that fuses environment and theme. The final image of her exiting with the film while the booth “held its breath” is charged by everything the setting has accrued.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    The aurora-lit archway, ancient stones, temperature drop, and ice crystals create a vivid, specific environment that feels integral rather than decorative. The setting functions as a true threshold and prison site: crossing it changes physics, perception, and options, and it literally disintegrates at closure. The astrolabe-as-tool is well integrated into the setting, with its warmth and weight countering the cold void. A touch more interaction with the physical danger (e.g., bodily risk from the cold) could further sharpen how the environment constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is strikingly original and specific—the phosphorescent dune, quantum blooms, probability fog, and divergent archives all feel coherent and lived-in. Environmental details are filtered through Kess’s role and needs, and the dune’s pulsing/singing actively participates in the climax and the final image. The frozen chess clock as a recurring object meaningfully charges the ending, tying time, setting, and theme together. World-rules stay consistent enough for this length, with the quantum weirdness taught early and used rather than just displayed.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Mechanical Rainforest is vivid, specific, and central: different metals map to frequencies and functions, and the Loom Tree’s machinery physically enacts the story’s premise of thoughts becoming things. Setting details are not mere backdrop; the gear socket, the willows’ songs, and the forest-wide shift in sound all drive the core revelation. The world rules are consistent and taught through action, giving the atmosphere both tactility and thematic charge.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vividly imagined—“limestone spine where mist clung like unspoken prayers,” twilight water pooling where it shouldn’t, stone arches, evening birds calling dream-coordinates. Details are filtered through the story’s liminal, ritual mood and align with Marina’s emotional passage. The ridgeway and lake don’t tightly constrain tactical choices, but they strongly charge the liminal nature of the crossing and the final threshold image. World rules (twilight-only crossings, vigil) feel internally consistent without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt fortress, ice, blizzard, and acoustic channels provide a vivid, tonally unified environment that feels specific rather than generic Gothic. Setting details are filtered through Marcus’s attention (the seventh step, the covered piano, the warming stones) and recur at the end to charge the closure image. Weather and architecture meaningfully inflect stakes—cold frostbite, empty years, sound-sculpted stone—but they don’t quite force on-page tactical decisions in the moment. Still, the fortress-as-character and the warming cobalt stones at the end effectively bind environment to theme.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ancient, dimension-drifting temple library with its crystalline dome and constellation-clock is vivid and specific, and it meaningfully shapes the story’s logic as a place “that touched all times.” The setting isn’t just decorative: the rune of drift, the stasis, and the books themselves enable the time-crossing messages and give Syln leverage in the climax when every book opens to bear witness. Details stay economical yet atmospheric, maintaining a mythic tone that fits the piece. The environment could constrain Syln’s tactical options even more explicitly under pressure, but it already does substantial work.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    The monitoring station, the suspended vantage, and the bleached reef are vividly realized and tightly integrated with Lena’s perceptions and choices. The elevation above supposed “solid ground” and the sightline to the coral-city directly frame the central mystery and the final image of her face over the coral below is striking. Environmental details (instruments humming, ventilation puffing the atlas page, different materials’ sounds) are economical yet textured, and the station’s ability to descend meaningfully constrains/permits action at the end. A slightly fuller sense of the broader seascape and physical risk of diving could further charge the setting’s pressure, but as is it strongly supports atmosphere and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the “cathedral of rust,” broken skylights, humming stone circle, and dormant machinery all feel tactile and integrated into Kira’s attention. Environment is not just backdrop: the circle’s vibration shapes her behavior (barefoot, timing at twilight) and the abandoned bay responds at the end with an engine coughing to life, charging the closure image. The opera glasses and the stones function as micro-setting/tools that constrain perception and enable the key discovery. World rules around “harmonic resonance” and pre-colonial markers are sketched economically but consistently enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    The volcanic hot springs, sulfur mist, and surrounding plant life are rendered with tactile, purposeful detail and are integral to both atmosphere and plot (the springs’ bacteria as the vector for the genetic pattern). Worldbuilding around the Resource Wars and Reconstruction Authority is efficient and coherent, sketched through Chen’s perspective. The environment meaningfully shapes what’s possible but could press a bit more directly on tactical choices in the moment (e.g., physical danger or constraints) to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    The arboretum on the cliff, the Mediterranean, the abandoned lighthouse, and the automated beacon are vividly realized and tightly woven into Amira’s perceptions. Setting isn’t decorative: the cliff’s erosion, the age of the cedar, and the automation of the lighthouse all mirror and charge her stance toward survival and guidance. Environmental elements constrain and enable her tactics (she grounds on trees, arranges succession plantings, drives under the beacon’s sweep). The final image of light crossing “arboretum and ruins, the living and the dead” powerfully charges the thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse library is vivid, specific, and integrated: waves, dust-breathing books, salt, and the dead beacon all filter through Marina’s artistic perception and collapsing reality. Setting elements actively reconfigure meaning—the walls’ movement is reinterpreted, the library’s books shift language, and the tower’s beacon reignites to charge the final image. The tarot box and cards function as micro-setting objects that shape tactics (sketching on them, using beacon charcoal) rather than remaining mere props. This is rich, purposeful atmosphere rather than postcard description, though the physical precariousness of the cliffside could be tied even more tightly to immediate choice.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and particular—obsidian pool, wind-carved encampment, tents mapping gravitational fluctuations—and consistently filtered through her scientific-wild perspective. These details create a strong atmosphere that supports the speculative premise. However, the environment rarely constrains or enables specific choices; it’s more backdrop than an active pressure or resource in the scene. The eclipse and landscape charge the mood but don’t quite shape tactics or the final cost.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cryogenic vault, snow-muted world above, and Damascus’s buried library are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Vera’s archival sensibility. Environmental features constrain and enable action—minus-196 storage, quantum-locked passages, and a cooling system she can sabotage are not just backdrop but mechanism. The recurring snow and ice imagery charges the final image of a “world about to change” under falling snow. A slightly wider sensory palette beyond visual/temperature would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glass dome, desert rose rows, and surrounding desert are vivid, specific, and tightly tied to mood and theme. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical options, but it does meaningfully charge choices—the dome as refuge vs outside harshness, the airship pad as intrusion, roses as disciplined fragility. The final contrast of fallen tower vs rising greenhouse, and desert vs “quiet revolution,” uses setting to reweight the entire piece. Detail is selective and POV-filtered rather than touristic, with just enough SF texture (airship, tower) to ground the world.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “sound wave garden” and sleepwalking constellations are vivid, specific, and tightly woven into action: emotions become physical hazards/resources she must move through, and the stars’ descent literally alters the garden’s blooms. The rail spike as tool/object-as-setting constrains her method, heating and burning as pressure rises and cooling in the denouement. Atmosphere is rich but also purposeful, consistently filtered through Kova’s professional mindset rather than a tourist catalog. The environment clearly charges the final image (her humming reshaping winter air), satisfying the object/setting constraint for high-band scores.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory above the clouds, the copper dome, brass instruments, and starfield are vivid and tightly interwoven with the theme of orbital truths. The setting meaningfully charges choices: the legacy-rich, secluded observatory makes concealment plausible and gives weight to her family’s pattern of hidden discoveries. The rosewood nib as a micro-setting object recurs and is crucially reweighted at the end when she locks it away. This is excellent atmospheric integration, though the environment constrains psychology more than it concretely alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Laboratory of Lost Sounds, “between heartbeats” during temporal folds, is striking and consistently exploited: it amplifies otherwise inaudible guilt, suspends light in the air, and ultimately houses the new exhibit. Objects-as-setting—the amber, the terminal, the meteor-dust ink, the needles—are all tactile and tied to action, not mere décor. The final image of the constellation pulsing in the fold strongly recharges the setting as a charged container for memory and conscience. The world feels specific and lived-in despite its surreal premise.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    The whispering grotto, mist, acoustic tiles, and lilac light are vivid, sensorial, and tightly integrated with action and theme. The space’s acoustic properties aren’t just pretty detail; they shape the mandala’s form and the very possibility of hearing “the memory of” a voice through sand and tile. Environmental evolution—the tile falling, the glowing limestone, mist that will scatter the mandala—charges the final image with ephemerality and constraint. This is near top-tier scene-setting; only a slight bias toward abstraction in a few lines keeps it from the absolute highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    The plaza, minaret ruins, frost, and shattered sky are vividly rendered and tightly interwoven with action—Sarai literally manipulates the environment to trigger visions and re-inscribe names. The mosaic and stepping stones are not just decorative; they constrain what she can do and charge the final image. World rules around the stones’ magic feel consistent and are learned through interaction rather than exposition. The only ceiling here is that the shattered sky, while striking, influences mood and imagery more than concrete tactical decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mystic orchard, hedge maze, and time-fractured apple trees are sensually and conceptually rich, and the amphitheater feels like a concrete, lived locus of history. Setting details are tightly integrated with the premise (seeds from futures, simultaneous performances) rather than decorative. The memorial bench and tarot coin recur and directly charge the final image of the transformed coin and new carvings. The maze’s nightly rearrangement and the garden’s rules promise future constraints for others more than they constrain Cornelius in this scene, but they still give the piece a memorable atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    The light painting studio, projectors, and muscovite geode are vividly rendered and feel integral to how the story works rather than decorative. The environment is used actively—the geode refracts, powdered pills hang in beams, corridors of light reshape the room—so setting and tool become the medium of conflict and revelation. Details are filtered through Maya’s sensibility (e.g., “dendrites of possibility”), linking the physical space to her altered perception. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, it does persuasively charge the final image of “illuminated architecture of human connection.”

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    The coastal cave network and limestone’s “memory” are vividly rendered and deeply integrated with the premise—emotions as thermal patterns absorbed and released in rhythm with the tides. Environmental details like bioluminescent “constellations” and tidal breathing create a strong, immersive atmosphere that aligns with the story’s liminal, post-hibernation mood. Crucially, the caves are not just backdrop; their geological properties enable Kira’s work and house the emergent entity, and the final “exhale” charges the ending image. This is rich, purposeful setting that earns its lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.0)
    The amber warehouse, sideways-moving time, and cliff setting are vivid, sensorial, and consistent, with strong, selective images (“amber-colored glass that caught and held light like frozen honey”). The environment is well integrated with the premise—time sideways, preserved moments, canyon echo in stone—so the world rules feel coherent. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain tactical choices, it clearly charges the final image as the echo spreads through the amber walls and cliff. The specificity and atmosphere are strong enough for publication-level work, if not quite transformative in terms of choice constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mountain setting, mist, and snow codes are vivid and integrated into action rather than offered as backdrop; Zephyr Bluff feels specific and tonally apt. The environment affects what can be seen/read (the codes, the mist obscuring Viktor), though it doesn’t heavily constrain physical tactics beyond mood. Recurring “silver hush,” dawn, and thaw toward spring supply a coherent atmospheric spine that echoes the thematic thaw. This is strong, economical scene-building, just shy of using the setting as a true tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    The fog-bound river, ticking gutters, bridge, and stars are vivid and tightly integrated with mood and premise—the fog literally holds promises, the river receives their residue, and the lifting mist/stars charge the final image. The setting constrains time (fog window) and enables Thomas’s work, so it’s more than backdrop. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with weather and light evolving alongside the emotional shift. This is strong, atmosphere-driven work that’s just a shade shy of utterly transformative in how it constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    The wasteland and oasis are vividly realized with selective, purposeful detail—the cracked earth, hexagonal hive layout, stone well, and flattening chimney smoke all feel concrete and atmospheric. Setting is not mere backdrop: the oasis’s physical arrangement and resistance to burning directly embody the temporal rules and thematic core. The recurring objects (wheel, lantern glass, hives, sun path) charge the final image of her walking away with “a faint golden tint” in the glass. World rules (fractured timelines, synchronization) are conveyed through setting rather than expository lecturing.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    The harbor, dock, and fire escape are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Marina’s sensibility (light on brass, “water like mercury,” barnacles as threshold). The recurring tool and the dock setting charge the final image: the gauge becomes a literal and symbolic fixture in place, marking transition. Environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical options but it does shape what kind of closure is possible (a nocturnal offering at a familial workplace). The specificity and integration are very close to top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Tidal Library above the clouds, glass floor, rolling clouds, and glowing stone circle create a distinctive, immersive environment filtered through Kira’s sensibility. Setting isn’t postcard-static; the rising/falling library and atmospheric pressure shifts echo her internal instability and literally reveal the stone circle at the crucial moment. The brass sundial as a recurring object and the “breathing” library in the final line both charge the closing image. World rules around the library and circle feel internally consistent and learned through interaction rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lotus temple, lily pond, and post-storm light are vividly rendered and recur with evolving charge: from glistening petals to reflective doubling to the final image of the installation glowing between water and sky. The environment doesn’t much constrain action, but it powerfully frames and amplifies theme and mood, especially through the reflection motif and “prismatic” quality of the quiet. The closing image of temple above and pond below explicitly reweights the whole story’s universality/particularity concern.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    The university radio booth is vivid (“burnt coffee and electromagnetic dust”) and functionally integrated: its analog decrepitude both protects Maya and provides the tools for her counter-attack. The setting’s physical tools (ancient receivers, emergency broadcast system, glowing equipment) actively constrain tactics. Atmospheric touches across campus are lighter but sufficient to situate the broader conflict. The final image of the station humming with protective frequencies charges the environment with ongoing stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: non-Euclidean chambers, starlight on the compass point, and stars seen through stone all mirror the theme of spatial rebellion and charge the final image. Environment and tools constrain choices—his claustrophobia, the shifting corridors, and the nexus’s lack of up/down all matter to how he proceeds and what he realizes. A touch more tactile interaction with the environment under duress could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    The quarry and mist are concretely evoked and consistently filtered through Sarah’s tactile, visual-angles awareness (“drip of condensation from stone,” carved steps, silk ribbon), giving the piece a strong physical atmosphere. The circular arrangement of portraits in that hollow space, plus the ribbon pressed into the sketchbook, charges the final image. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but it does shape tone and method (she positions herself precisely where victims were found). Overall, setting and micro-objects feel lived-in and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    The experimental weather station, storm, and holographic map table are all vividly sketched and meaningfully constrain action (alarms, shuddering building, data feeds that only she can use in time). The copper nail serves as an object-as-setting, literally reconfiguring the projected geography and then aligning with the storm in the final image. A bit more tactile interaction with the storm environment (sound, pressure, physical risk) could deepen atmosphere, but what’s here is specific and well-filtered through her scientific lens. World rules about jet stream shifts and magnetic anomalies feel consistent and are conveyed with efficient detail.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mountain pullout, gorge bridge, and wind are well-evoked and feel lived-in via Marla’s musician’s eye—“reading the mountain winds like sheet music” is especially effective. Setting is integrated into action through the bridge-songs and scaffold wrap flutters, with the environment functioning almost as a secondary notation system. While the landscape doesn’t strictly constrain what she can do, it does charge the final image of music scattering “like silver light across the valley.” A slightly stronger sense of physical constraint or weather impact on choice would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned circus train is vividly specific (elephant car skylight, ringmaster’s car, fortune teller’s car) and more than decorative: its acoustics enable Marcus’s “haunting,” its cars shape spatial staging, and its liminal decay underpins the theme of worn-out illusions. The recurring wall of foreign bills and the hillside “sentinel” image charge the final paragraphs with environmental meaning. The setting actively constrains tactics and provides tools, satisfying the object-as-setting gate. Only a few lines verge on atmospheric overstatement, but they don’t blur geography or mood.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.3)
    The observatory, dome, telescope brass, and audio of V442 create a specific, moody environment that fits the story’s aims and is filtered through Mira’s professional attention. The daylily and telegram function as charged objects, returning at the end to frame the relay image. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, but it does shape what the characters can do—watch, listen, correlate dreams and light curves—rather than act on the cosmos. Atmosphere is consistent and purposeful, though the piece leans more on visual and conceptual detail than full sensory immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and thematically integrated: cursed lake, spiraling orchard vortex, and glass trees that reflect absences rather than images all reinforce the story’s obsession with unseen truths. Environment isn’t mere backdrop; the lake/vortex is the only route to the hidden garden, and the glass garden’s rules (absences instead of reflections) shape the revelation. Water, ice, and trees recur and charge the final “liquid truth” image. At times the description nears lushness for its own sake, but it mostly serves mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cobalt glade is vivid, textured, and specific, with the blue grass and root systems actively participating in the magic rather than serving as backdrop. Environment and recurring objects (grass, scars, roots) constrain the action and charge the final image of Mira as recognized “gardener.” World rules are consistent enough to feel lived-in despite the surrealism. This is a real strength of the piece and feels immediately publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid and specific—the ribcages, femurs, mossed ceilings, phosphorescent apples—and its rules are both legible and consistent. Crucially, the environment constrains choice: to access a bartered destiny she must descend here, select a fruit, and accept the binding terms; the bone-and-root cathedral framing Elena’s tree heightens the decision. The burned tarot card and apples operate as charged objects that shape the climax and closing image. Setting, mood, and mechanics are tightly integrated rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    The quarry office, trailer, wind, limestone walls, and green water pools form a vivid, thematically tuned environment that mirrors his emotional echo-chamber. Professional detail (speaker cloth, JBL D-series, stage lighting wear) and the quarry-as-amphitheater image integrate setting with character bias and history rather than read as postcard description. The setting meaningfully charges the final image (“The quarry office trailer held his words like an acoustic chamber”), making space itself part of the story’s logic. It doesn’t quite constrain physical choices, but it strongly shapes mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting of the magnetic arbor—metallic trees, humming branches, glowing fruits above the clouds—is vividly rendered and tightly linked to the story’s concepts of knowledge and consciousness. The environment is filtered through Sarah’s scientific and scholarly lens, which keeps the details purposeful rather than touristic. The arbor meaningfully charges the final image as a renewed laboratory and waiting threshold for future seekers. It could constrain her choice more directly (e.g., by limiting escape or emphasizing physical risk), but it already does strong atmospheric and thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Flux Archives, tidal atrium, and ocean-breathing glass are vividly drawn, with sensory and conceptual specificity that feel integral rather than ornamental. Setting rules (tides rewriting books, tomorrow having “disappeared”) are consistent and infuse each beat with a convincing strangeness. The environment charges the final image—Kaine watching the ocean breathe, wintersun shadows like different stories—so the world is felt as an active frame for the theme of flux and identity. More direct constraint of choices by the physical environment could push this even higher, but as lyric worldbuilding this is already very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    The crystal caves and luxury bunker are vivid, functional, and filtered through Mara’s professional gaze (e.g., the final “unsuitable” report). The pearl, shell, and cave phosphorescence work as a micro-setting triad that literally and thematically charge the climax, with the luminosity weakening walls both physically and symbolically. Environmental detail is selective yet rich—the crystals turning into a “constellation of reflected possibilities” is specific and earned by the earlier visual groundwork. Setting is not mere backdrop; it shapes options and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    The station “hunched beneath its coat of ivy” and the layered graffiti create a vivid, tactile environment that reflects and intensifies Marcus’s internal state without feeling like a mere backdrop. Details like the bellows, cracked brick, and tapping ivy are filtered through his scientific and guilty gaze, maintaining POV specificity. The setting meaningfully charges the final image—“green overtaking gray, nature reclaiming what humans had abandoned”—so the place isn’t swappable without losing thematic force. It doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, but as a chosen forgotten space for reckoning it exerts clear psychological pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: mist, amber windows, humming shelves, and the “between moments” library all filter directly through her task of decoding delays. Environmental rules (between letters, propagation delays, glowing walls turning transparent) shape what’s possible and charge the final image of her “coming home.” The specificity feels integrated rather than touristic. It stops just short of 9-band because the environment rarely forces hard choices; it mainly reveals.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.3)
    The observatory with velvet drapes, constellation charts, jasmine vine, and ice-crystal violin produces a vivid, cohesive atmosphere that feels chosen rather than generic. Objects in the setting meaningfully charge the climax and ending—the violin sublimating into a star-reflecting puddle, the jasmine’s psychic chorus, the coffee cup as divinatory tool. Environment doesn’t much constrain physical action, skewing toward mood rather than logistics, but it does inflect perception and the final image with precision. The consistency of tone between “bruised twilight,” velvet purple, and mulberry hues helps the space act as an emotional container.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    The skyborne grotto, crystallized cloud, and aurora are vividly rendered and feel particular, not generic. Setting isn’t just backdrop; the aurora’s movement explicitly shelters Mira’s own motions, and the grotto’s freezing into a “cathedral of frozen aurora” charges the final image. World rules around the Silence and crystallization are consistent and legible. Occasionally the imagery leans toward decorative lushness, but it mostly remains purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    The grotto above the clouds, the oak, the spiral floor, and the “vineyard hush” create a vivid, coherent atmosphere filtered through Mara’s long familiarity. Setting is not mere backdrop: the climb, the vantage that reveals the spiral, and the charged objects (tree, pin, stone) all shape her realization and the final image. The environment meaningfully charges the ending, where the spiral and grotto reframe as possibility rather than static history.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    The lighthouse, October wind, dawn light, and wind chimes create a vivid, coherent micro-world that is consistently filtered through the Arbiter’s moral and professional lens. The setting supports theme (guiding light, fog, gray dawn) without becoming static wallpaper, and the beam interacting with the mirror shard at the end is a strong charged image. The environment doesn’t quite constrain physical options or tactics—it’s more atmospheric than functional—but its integration is still above-average.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the magnetic grotto, levitating granite, and ringed pond are all integrated into action and concept rather than mere backdrop. Environmental details (magnetic pull on blood, starlight spiraling to mirror the water) clearly support the time-spiral theme and charge the final image of the last ring. World rules for the grotto’s anomaly are sketched lightly but remain consistent. The space feels coherent and lived-in as a “classroom,” even in this brief window.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integral: bone towers, the canyon of endless echoes, and the acoustic “library” of death songs all directly underpin the premise of time navigation through sound. Environmental rules (echoes as moments, bones as archives) are consistent and used to shape Yula’s method and limitations. The recurring arrowhead and layered dust function as micro-setting details that charge the final image with deep time. Description occasionally leans lush, but it remains purposeful and anchored to Yula’s perception.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    The icebound spire, cloud sea, and mist path are vivid and specific, with strong image-systems (crystalline walls, “gardens of ice flowers,” lingering luminance) that shape what’s possible. Setting is not a postcard; being above the clouds makes mist walking both necessary and transformative, while the machines below provide a constant atmospheric counterpoint. The keystone functions as a charged object-as-setting, reappearing at closure and constraining meaning, which cleanly meets the 9-gate test even if not quite at that band.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.5)
    The harbor, barnacle-crusted hatch, and sunken library are vividly realized and integrated into action rather than presented as static scenery. The recurring objects—the brass lantern, the glowing masts, the hotel key—charge the atmosphere and return in the final image, and the drowned-places motif is thematically tied to liminal senses. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactics (there’s little concrete jeopardy from being in a wreck), it absolutely shapes the story’s mood and the discovery mechanics. The setting’s specificity and the way light, water, and decay are filtered through Marlow’s perception push this into a very strong band.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “ambered observatory deck” in nothing-space, with crystallized walls and static bursts, is vivid and distinctive, and it meaningfully shapes what’s possible: it’s both prison and instrument, a “massive tuning fork” that defines her function. The coins, matrix, and amber walls recur and are all recharged in the final image, clearly qualifying as object/setting-as-closure devices. World rules (post-contraction, outside of time) are conveyed through setting details rather than dry exposition. A slight expansion of tactile/sensory experience beyond the visual and conceptual would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ancient observatory at dusk, the brass instruments, the great lens, and the sea/atlas imagery are vividly rendered and tightly interwoven with theme and action. Setting details are always filtered through her role and history (e.g., “dusk paint the sky in bruises,” “scientists had whispered hypotheses here”), creating a strong atmospheric throughline. The observatory’s lens and the atlas page materially shape the central turn, not just mood. The only thing holding this just shy of top-tier is that the physical environment doesn’t significantly constrain her options beyond enabling the crystallization event.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sapphire viaduct, dead sea, and dawn conditions are vividly drawn and deeply integrated: the bridge as tuning fork, the perfectly pure water, and humidity/temperature equilibrium all constrain what Mira can do and when. Setting is never mere backdrop; it is the apparatus of the plot, with the bell, dew, and stone forming a coherent physical-mystical system that charges the final humming-bell image. Sensory specificity is strong and POV-filtered through her acoustic obsession. Excellent atmospheric and functional use of environment.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    The drowned town resurfacing is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail—the “rooftops…like ancient teeth,” the pharmacy interior, silted fountain, and ridgeway vantage all build a strong, eerie atmosphere. Setting is consistently filtered through Marcus’s professional and personal eye, and the reservoir’s retreat is thematically tied to submerged memory. The sapphire bottle and wind chimes recur as charged objects that color the final image, even if they don’t quite constrain tactical choices. Overall, place feels specific and lived, not generic.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, original, and fully integrated: the kaleidoscopic waterfall, spiral pear trees, and “air that tasted of centuries and morning” are more than ornament—they define the liminal space where her stance can change. The orchard’s rules (spiraling trees, crystallized dew, murmuring birds) are consistent and learned through action, and the recurring waterfall/orchard imagery charges the final image. The environment functionally constrains choice: only here can she access the crystal’s origin, the birds’ patterns, and her grandfather’s legacy in one crucible. This strong micro-world is a major reason the ending resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    The nocturnal arbor above the clouds is vividly imagined—bioluminescent moss, aerial roots, fungal networks—and feels specific to Maya’s professional eye. Setting and atmosphere are tightly woven into her work and the planetary stakes, not a postcard backdrop. The environment could constrain her physical choices a bit more explicitly in-scene to push this into the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    The floating rock dojo, crystalline walls, neural-tech weapons, and Earth turning below create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that suits the philosophical SF tone. The brain-in-jar as micro-setting object is tightly integrated and strongly charges the final image. However, the dojo’s physical properties and the orbiting context rarely constrain tactics or choices—they signal mood and genre more than they shape what can or must happen. The “history rewriting itself below” is evocative but operates almost entirely as backdrop rather than as an active environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    The nocturnal haven, the brook, and the sliver of wilderness between office buildings are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Mira’s sensibility as a designer of impossible spaces. The environment isn’t just backdrop: its fertility, the geometric roots, and the shimmering boundary all materially shape what is possible and how the space protects itself. The repeated attention to the brook’s song and the “forgotten” pocket of wildness effectively charge the final image. A slight overreliance on lyrical description in places is the only thing keeping this below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    The echo chamber tunnel and the houses above are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the story’s mechanics and theme. The tunnel’s acoustics, ventilation shafts, and limestone pores directly shape how Marcus can act, and the leaf blowers function as tools that charge both the ritual and the final image (cords clinking like a quieter aftersong). Atmospheric details (“foundation cracked from the absence of joy,” dust motes forming shadow puppets) deepen mood without drifting into generic description. Environment and object are inseparable from the story’s logic, meeting the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    The frozen garden, ice-glazed topiaries, and impossible-geometry library are sharply rendered, consistently filtered through her feral, freezing body and mind. Weather and architecture are not just decorative; winter, mist, and sealed walls reinforce her entrapment and duty, and the garden’s thaw at the end charges the final image. The world’s rules (dimensional tears, text-parasites, Codex, pendant) hang together without clunky exposition. The environment constrains her options conceptually more than tactically, but at this length that still feels robust.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Ember Nexus and the crozier function as a micro-setting that constrains and enables choice: its heat forces destruction, its proximity makes his method possible, and the living staff at the end is literally forged from this environment. Details like “crystalline formations pulsing with heat” and ash swirling in superheated air are vivid and tied to action rather than decorative. The monastery and Church remain more sketched than embodied, but at this length that economy mostly works. The setting charges the final image of him turning away, though the outside world’s texture is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned radio towers over Whisper Gorge, swaying cables, mineral mist, and looming perigee moon create a vivid, specific environment that’s strongly filtered through Maya’s professional gaze. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the suspension over the gorge, the old Frequency Wars city, and perigee’s gravitational distortions all justify why this has to happen here and now, and they charge the final image of the city “singing again.” Details are selective and purposeful rather than touristic. The environment meaningfully shapes the premise and the closure image, not only the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    The worldbuilding is vivid and economical: the vanishing ferry, spectral grotto, and sideways clocks all feel specific and internally coherent. Setting is filtered through Marcus’s professional familiarity, which avoids tourist listing and keeps the environment functional, especially in the grotto convergence scene. The hourglass and later compass work as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactical choices, it strongly shapes the story’s logic and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.3)
    The optical illusion gallery is vivid and specific—Penrose stairs, impossible triangle, breathing walls—and tightly interwoven with the premise. Setting is not static backdrop: the environment responds to her weaving and becomes the primary arena of change, culminating in the gallery itself turning into a labyrinth. Details stay within a coherent visual and conceptual palette, and the “realistically imaginary” quality of the space is well realized. The setting could constrain choice a bit more explicitly to reach the highest tier, but it already feels integral.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    The benthic city and deep-ocean environment are vividly realized—bioluminescent domes, crushing pressure, and alien bodies refracting light—providing a strong atmospheric frame that feels specific rather than generic. Setting is not just backdrop: the depth and pressure are woven into the navigation concept (water as stellar lens, pressure folds as dimensional edges), integrating world rules with the premise. The recurring classroom and observation window give spatial coherence and support the final image of Elara watching the abyss as a gateway to stars. The environment could constrain concrete choices more sharply under pressure, but it already meaningfully charges the concept and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.3)
    The mist-clad glass atrium, trembling orchids, amber light, and “copper on her tongue” create a rich, coherent atmosphere filtered through an audiologist’s sensibility. Setting details are selective and thematically aligned with liminality, silence, and intrusion. The environment mostly supports tone rather than constraining choices; Mara could plausibly do similar work in another charged locale. Even so, the atrium and mist strongly shape the story’s sensory identity and are well integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    The underwater station and Arctic surface are vividly and efficiently rendered—the “amber preservative” water, crystalline phase chamber, and “clean emptiness” of the wind feel tactile and charged. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the flooded corridors, pressure, and damaged cables constrain movement and justify the tech and stakes. The recurrent undersea cables as “neural pathways” and the final contrast between the silent waste and humming unseen network meaningfully charge the ending. A slightly fuller sense of physical risk from the environment could raise the tension, but atmosphere and specificity are already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    The opal observatory, snow, green monitor glow, and ink-stained antique desk create a vivid, coherent space that matches the story’s liminal concerns. Details are filtered through Marcus’s state (cold, isolation, cosmos outside vs. data inside), and recurring objects (shard, ink, screens) are spatially clear. While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain his options, it does charge the final image: “opal observatory,” snow, and shard all reinforce the boundary theme. The specificity and atmosphere are strong enough for high-band even without hard physical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    The canyon, bone towers, and starlings are richly specific and fully integrated into action, not just backdrop—the towers hum, store voices, and later literally incorporate her body, while the canyon’s echoes are the mechanism of preservation. The flawed diamond and copper veins function as micro-setting that constrain tactics (curse, pattern-matching) and charge the final image. World rules for this fantastical space are internally consistent and learned through her use of them. Environment directly shapes choices and the ending, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    The underground garden with phosphorescent fungi, floating soil, spiral moss, and gravity pockets is vivid, distinctive, and filtered through Marina’s investigative eye. Setting rules (playful gravity, bent physics) remain consistent and help teach the weirdness rather than feeling like a backdrop. The environment charges key actions, like the arrowhead’s defiance of gravity and Marina feeling the gravity pocket laugh in her bones at the turning point. It could constrain tactics even more, but as-is it strongly anchors atmosphere and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the iron sky-bridge, enchanted-but-industrial orchard, and clockwork statues all feel specific and rule-consistent. Environmental elements constrain and shape action—her vantage on the bridge, patrol patterns, and the orchard’s later physical upheaval all matter to how the scene unfolds. The locust shell and the orchard’s reanimation charge the final images rather than functioning as postcard backdrop. A slight bias toward visual and conceptual detail over other senses is the only minor limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cobalt arcade is vivid and consistently evoked—the neon, broken roof, and abandoned machines all filter through Ezra’s professional, wary gaze in a way that feels lived-in rather than touristic. The setting meaningfully shapes action (roof hole for drones, rusted mail drop, twilight border zone as liminal and dangerous), and the bottled storm visually charges the space. World rules around the border and smuggling drones feel internally consistent and are shown through practice rather than exposition dumps. The environment strongly charges the final image but doesn’t quite constrain a concrete choice in the climax, which keeps it just under the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    The abandoned circus train, rusting cars, fog, and impossible garden are vividly particular and consistently filtered through Emil’s sensibility as a carpenter and survivor. Setting motifs (fog, rust, train cars, garden, carousel figures) recur and culminate in the final image of the train “holding its breath,” charging the world around his change. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactics, it deeply informs mood and theme and feels indispensable to the story’s identity.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Scientific Poetry Library is vividly realized—non-Euclidean staircases, breathing shelves, specialized aisles—and these details are filtered through Marcus’s mathematical-poetic sensibility. Setting is not mere backdrop: the architecture’s hyperbolic qualities and the analog nature of books directly enable his revelation and charge the final image. The scarf also functions as a micro-setting object, constraining his movement (catching on a shelf) and emotionally anchoring his connection to the space. A minor limitation is that the library never quite forces a concrete choice under pressure, but it richly shapes perception and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    The archipelago, molten-copper water, and floating library are vivid, economical, and consistently filtered through Mara’s habits and work. Setting is not mere backdrop; the islands’ differing “memories” and the dawn window concretely structure her quest and constrain when vitalization is possible. The colored-glass palette and light/mist interplay charge both the process and the final non-act. The only thing holding it just below 9 is that the environment doesn’t impose additional tactical constraints in the climax beyond the time-of-day window; pressure is more metaphysical than spatial.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    The shadowed nexus, seven alleyways, impossible starlight angles, and the archway create a vivid, specific, and tonally consistent environment. The setting materially shapes the story—the nexus’s disorientation, the converging passages, and the impossible shadow are the mechanism by which Vera finds and accesses the true lock. World rules around the place (between spaces, nightly transformation) feel coherent within the piece’s logic. The final image of starlight through impossible angles carrying “liberated possibility” is strongly charged by all that prior environmental work.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is rich and particular: barnacled walls, ambered fruit jars, shipwrecks as a ring of memorials, and shattered-glass constellations filtered through her folklorist eye. The environment isn’t just decorative; the fairy ring, greenhouse, and broken panes are the mechanisms of magic and orientation, and the ship names carved into the frame charge the stakes. Sensory detail is selective and integrated into action rather than pausing it. While the physical environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical options, it does decisively charge the premise and final images.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    The forgotten library between worlds, the shards of reflected souls, the crystalline prison, and the playground-swing hush form a vivid, coherent atmospheric lattice that feels specific rather than generic fantasy décor. Setting details (mirror shards, ledgers, tea leaves, afternoon light, the stilling swing) are tightly integrated with the magic system and thematic work, not postcard description. The recurring objects—the shard, the cup of leaves, the ledger, the swing—charge the final image and underline the shift from suspended time to active beginning. The only thing holding this slightly below the top band is that the environment rarely constrains physical options; it mostly frames and inflects the conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vividly realized and integral: the verdant parapet at the boundary, the waterfall mist as literal thread, and the between-worlds geography all directly enable Mira’s tactics. Details like “light from the other world spilled like honey” and roots drinking from a waterfall that flows through both worlds charge the final image and would be impossible to swap out without breaking the logic. The environment constrains options (she must work at this liminal ledge, at this veil-thin moment) rather than functioning as a backdrop. Occasionally, description edges toward lush excess, but it remains purposeful rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Prism Sanctuary, crystalline walls, starlight, and humming prisms are richly rendered and tightly integrated with the ritual and closure—starlight focuses to illuminate masks, and the sanctuary “holds” living and dead. Setting details feel selective and purposeful rather than touristic, constantly refracting Mira’s work and the story’s themes of fracture/wholeness. The net, hemp, porcelain masks, and needle act as micro-setting objects with clear functional roles. It could edge even higher if the physical environment imposed more tangible constraints on action rather than mainly supplying atmosphere and charge.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    The monastery vault, frescoes, rain, skylights, and decaying religious art are vividly evoked and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a restorer and map-reader. The environment isn’t mere backdrop: the rain, peeling frescoes, torn map edge, and UV light all recur and charge the final image (“water transformed pigment into prophecy,” her palm on the tear). While the setting doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, it powerfully frames the thematic stakes and the liminal mood that closure depends on. The specificity and recurrence justify a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    The underwater library and air pocket are vividly rendered and tightly bound to Marina’s professional gaze—“darkness thick as centuries,” brass gone verdigris, books as tombstones. The environment shapes options (air pocket, imminent flooding, depth) and charges the final images of ascent and the turning snow globe. Detail selection is economical and purposeful, avoiding touristic cataloging. A slightly stronger sense of tactile constraint or physical difficulty under that depth could push it further.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Sky Archive—servers as a monastery above the cloudline, mist, storm-sea below, graffiti pulsing on walls and even fog droplets—feels vivid, specific, and tonally integrated. The environment is not just cosmetic: the altitude and storms enable the lightning/thunder window, and the courtyard surfaces host the ghost’s evolving messages and eventually the “encoded gardens.” Details are consistently filtered through Chorus’ sensibility, intertwining tech and organic imagery. This is excellent atmospheric worldbuilding, just shy of dominant constraint-level impact on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    The icebound spire, frosted elevator shaft, and clouded heights are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Mira’s work-worn familiarity and the physical cold. Environmental details (altitude stealing warmth, ice cracking from cables, narrow higher floors) shape the mood and subtly constrain her experience. The setting also charges the final image—clouds “no longer seemed quite so cold”—so atmosphere and theme interlock. A touch more tactile interaction with objects during the decoding could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sky gondola, thirty-thousand-foot altitude, and storm systems are vividly and economically rendered, with strong integration of meteorological and quasi-mystical detail (phantom mountains, ghosts of forests and lakes). The brass telescope as a recurring object-tool is strongly embedded in the setting and helps charge the final image. The environment meaningfully supports theme and mood, though it seldom constrains concrete choices beyond justifying her ability to observe these phenomena. World rules around “atmospheric memory” remain internally consistent and are conveyed through perception rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tree-trunk library is vividly rendered as a lived-in, sacred space—carved shelves, worn grooves, ladders—and the coming demolition reweights every detail. Environment constantly matters: the hollow trunk’s gaps, shelves, and nooks are all co-opted into Lyra’s mirror-and-light apparatus. The centuries-old oak, the coin, and the moonlight converge in the final image, charging the setting far beyond postcard description. A slightly stronger sense of larger surrounding world/era could push this even higher, but at this length it’s not required.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: antique airship, hopscotch-etched floor, brass hull, murmuring starlings and “stranded luminance” all interact with her vocation and methods. Details are filtered through her cartographic and linguistic bias, which sharpens specificity (constellations through the porthole, trade routes, marginalia about migration). Crucially, the hopscotch board and the airship’s vantage become functional tools for decoding the birds and lights, not mere backdrop, and the final image is charged by these recurring objects. There’s room to let the environment constrain her choices more overtly, but it already does strong conceptual work.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    The frozen library above the clouds, ice walls, mirrors of memory, and celestial vault are vividly drawn and integrated with Elara’s perceptions and choices. The mirrors actively shape her realization by showing multiple timelines of herself, and the vertical view of village below and vault above charges the final reorientation. Details like the gears singing in the wind and prophecy scraps “brown as driftwood” feel specific and purposeful rather than decorative. The only thing keeping this from an even higher band is that the environment seldom constrains her tactics in a concrete, physical way.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.6)
    The orchard planet with its crimson sky and floating stone arches is vivid and consistently woven into action (Marina manifesting among arches, chalk on walkways, fountain as meeting point). Setting elements do functional work: orchards and blight define stakes; property lines and groves structure the fungal network problem; arches and filtered light charge the bell’s final image. The world’s rules are sketched efficiently and feel internally consistent without bogging the story down in exposition. A slightly deeper tactile engagement with the environment under pressure could push this higher, but as written it’s strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse at the world’s edge, dusk light, and the lens apparatus are vividly realized and tightly integrated with the action—Marcus can only perform the climactic refracting/song act because of this specific machinery and location. The recurring motifs of bruised sky, “pane of hush,” and cupped light evolve across the piece and charge the final image of the lighthouse as an “instrument of infinite tenderness.” Setting is consistently filtered through Marcus’s time-obsessed perspective, avoiding tourist description. The environment constrains choices and is indispensable to the story’s logic and imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: mechanical birds, inverted trees, and frost are not mere decoration but constraints that shape tactics and mood. The labyrinth’s geography and the birds’ behavior directly motivate why travelers need Mara and why time matters. The cursed orchard and the walnut seed anchor the final image, charging the environment with thematic weight. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara’s practised familiarity, avoiding tourist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    The braided ravine, converging streams, and foam patterns are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Marina’s scientific and musical lenses, anchoring place and mood. The setting does crucial thematic work, mirroring neural pathways and fugue structure and charging the final image of the drifting chrysalis. While the environment doesn’t physically constrain action, it profoundly shapes perception and the insight that drives the turn. The recurrence of water, foam, and confluence gives the ending strong atmospheric charge.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Glass Orchard Library, cloud sea, glass roots, and dream condensation are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Merrick’s role and concerns. Setting details evolve with the action—the library trembles, apples fill with light, the final ambiguity of the sun—and they charge the thematic stakes around beginnings and endings. The environment doesn’t strictly constrain tactical options, but it substantially charges the final image and inflects how we read the procedure. This is a major strength of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The desert fortress after the first rain in seven years, the tidal pools, and the buried coral pavilion are all sharply imagined and filtered through Miran’s sensory bias. Setting is not backdrop: the rare rain reveals the pools and makes the entire encounter possible, and the final star-reflecting pools and wind carry the closure’s emotional charge. Environmental rules (desert scarcity, ancient sea, calcified coral) feel consistent and are learned through action. This is rich, economical worldbuilding that directly shapes choice and the last image.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: astronomical clock, prairie, grain elevators, and the cuckoo weight all interact to shape tactics and the final image. World rules—elevators as resonant bodies responding to languages, the tower as an acoustic amplifier—are consistent and learned through action, not exposition. Specific details like “borrowed starlight” and the monks designing acoustics deepen tone without becoming decorative clutter. The swinging weight between tower and elevator elegantly charges the final image with time, heritage, and connection.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting work is vivid, specific, and thematically charged: submarine graveyard, Fibonacci-shattered mirror, canyon walls “carved” by moonlight. Details are consistently filtered through Vera’s technical and helical preoccupations, which deepens both character and world. The canyon and wrecks meaningfully charge the final image as she “emerges into sunlight” with the graveyard inside her. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, but it does heavy symbolic and atmospheric lifting without feeling generic.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific: the inverted-gravity grotto, mist, stalactites as fangs, and crystalline nodes all feel tactile and strange. Environmental conditions (gravity reversal, water falling upward, narrow crawlways) actively shape how Orin moves and what is possible. World rules around gravity inversion and threshold effects stay consistent and legible. This atmosphere powerfully supports the piece, even if it just stops short of charging the final image with an inescapable environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    The siskin alder grove, the scarred bark, the hedgehog, and the salvaged telegraph insulator create a vivid, specific atmosphere that’s inseparable from the premise. World rules (the Great Silence; sound preserved in stress cracks) are conveyed through the environment and tools rather than abstract exposition. Setting details like the hedgehog’s schedule and the etched insulator recur and charge the final image without feeling ornamental. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain her choices, it does decisively shape what’s at stake (recovering birdsong from these particular trees).

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    The magnetic nexus, iron cliffs, aurora, and magnetite/quartz board are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Viktor’s chess-trained mind. Setting is not decorative: the magnetic field literally alters piece behavior and symbolically mirrors the “confused” yet meaningful exile, then charges the final image with the aurora’s “ancient dance.” The micro-setting (board, worry stone, aurora) constrains thought and choice and is tightly interwoven with theme. Line-level handling of atmosphere is strong without slipping into incoherence.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    The workshop, tin roof, salvaged equipment, and distant city together create a vivid, coherent atmosphere tightly bound to the sound/frequency motif. Setting details are filtered through her sonic priorities (snow quiet, hospital hush, fireworks gaps) and directly charge the final image of explosions bracketed by silences. The environment and objects (radios, music boxes, bowls, clasp) aren’t mere backdrop; they participate in the climax when they “sing” in resonance. The starry roof and open door also support the liminal, threshold feeling of the year-turn without feeling like a postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    The treetop village and suspended garden are vividly rendered, with specific, sensory details (mist, rope bridges, swaying platforms) filtered through Mira’s perceptions and profession. Setting is tightly braided with theme—“serenity within motion,” dew from spider webs, lightning-struck soil, and the wind carrying the corpse flower’s scent all charge the final image and constrain how she tends the plant. The environment feels integral rather than decorative. A few similes (e.g., “witch’s cauldron”) are slightly familiar, but they don’t significantly blunt the overall effect.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    The world-building is vivid, economical, and tightly integrated: upward rivers, floating arches, Inversion gravity, and echo pockets all feel specific to Verdance and consistently shape perception and movement. Setting actively constrains choices (following specific water flows, anchoring against gravity flips) and charges the final image of trees “ignoring” gravity. Details are filtered through Kessa’s professional lens, avoiding tourist-list description. The environment’s rules are learned through action rather than exposition dumps, giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    The port’s container “canyons” and rust-colored dust are vivid and specific, and the environment meaningfully shapes Maya’s movement and the eerie, funneled winds. The convergence deforms the setting (containers leaning inward, thickened air) in ways that both embody and explain the anomaly, and the closing vantage point—standing at the maze’s edge—charges the final image. Details feel filtered through a technical yet unsettled eye, not generic SF dressing. Setting isn’t just backdrop; it participates in the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ice cavern, aurora, and Crystal Basilica are rendered with rich, multi-sensory specificity that is tightly bound to character and action. The environment explicitly shapes tactics and possibility—the “sculpted hush” in the ice, the mountain as instrument, the aurora as intended orchestra. Setting details evolve with the plot (ice resonating, cracks releasing ancient notes) and charge the final image of a world painted in frequencies of wonder. This is elite-level atmosphere that’s both vivid and functionally integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Thunder-echo range, canyon hush, thin reality, and driftwood on the canyon floor create a vivid, specific environment that’s tightly bound to the magic system. The setting is not just decorative: the silence behaves as an active presence, the range “holds its breath,” and the thin place at the canyon floor is where she must act, so geography dictates what’s possible. The flute and canyon together charge the final image—the mountains’ whispered “approval” and the quiet as benediction—meeting the object-as-setting gate. A minor limitation is that the environment rarely constrains tactics under pressure because the pressure itself is low.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is striking and integrated: the topaz workshop, refracted starlight, and the open roof under Empatheia do more than decorate—they mirror and charge the emotional stakes. The letterpress, ink that changes color over time, and the constellation all function as environmental extensions of the story’s concerns with preservation, transformation, and fading selves. The last star of Empatheia “holding on, defiant” meaningfully charges the final image. While the environment doesn’t literally constrain Mira’s choices, it consistently frames and deepens them in a way that feels essential.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway, humming “like a spine of ancient stone,” is vividly realized and tightly integrated with the story’s mechanism: its magnetism and the aurora’s “song” directly enable the pendant’s activation and the Convergence. Worldbuilding details (Whispering Archive, Luminari robes, pendants as anchors) are selective yet rich, consistently filtered through Elara’s professional eye. The environment also charges the final image as she descends with the pendant still vibrating, so setting meaningfully frames both the opening and the closure. A slight tilt toward overtly poetic description at times doesn’t undercut its functional role.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    The quartz arbor, mist, and frost imagery create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that matches the story’s contemplative, liminal concerns; the opening line is especially strong in locating us in a charged, specific space. The setting is filtered through Vera’s sensibility (e.g., “each pillar humming with accumulated whispers”), which ties environment to concept and character. While the arbor doesn’t strongly constrain her choices in a practical sense, it does meaningfully charge the final image and the emotional archaeology premise. This is rich, economical world-building that supports tone and theme without bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    The forgotten orchard and encroaching bamboo are vivid and thematically apt, giving a tangible sense of a craft and place being swallowed by time. Details like “filtered light piercing the bamboo canopy” and rotting pears feel specific rather than generic, and the loom/amber bead function as charged micro-settings. The environment shapes the story conceptually more than tactically—the bamboo doesn’t materially constrain her options in the moment—keeping this just shy of the very top band. Still, the space feels lived-in, haunted, and integral to the premise.

    The orchard planet with floating stone arches, levitation ore, and chambers where reality thins is strikingly rendered and integrated into action (the mines, the floating anvil, apple trees in the arches). The environment informs the method of forging and the thematic logic (gravity as negotiable, falling as another form of flight). Specific recurring images—floating arches, blossoms drifting or falling upward—charge the final moments. A bit of description borders on ornamental, but most of it earns its place.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    The spaceport repair bay and its alternates (fungal, sideways gravity, underwater, pristine with drones) are vivid, specific, and filtered through Kira’s synesthetic sensibility in a way that feels character-particular. The recurring environment of the bay as “repair” site nicely mirrors and then reconfigures the thematic arc when it becomes a place of cosmic restoration. World rules about parallel universes are consistent enough for this length and mostly conveyed through sensory transformation rather than dry exposition. The setting shapes meaning more than tactical options, but it does charge the final image of the bay as “what it had always been meant to be.”

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lighthouse, rocky shore, phosphorescent foam, and lantern room are vividly evoked and tightly bound to Elsa’s professional gaze. The environment constrains action (climbing the spiral, the dead lamp, the gallery deck) and the recurring sea glass object charges both the turning-on of the lamp and the final emotional register. Atmosphere (“the stairs seemed to breathe,” “dead eye a wound”) consistently reinforces the haunted, melancholic mood without becoming cluttered. Spatial and sensory choreography remain clear despite the supernatural overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Emerald Lighthouse, glass lantern wick, and dimensional sea are vivid and specific, with technical detail (“total internal reflection”) integrated into the magic system. Setting is not just backdrop; the wick’s geometry and the lighthouse’s heart literally constrain and enable what Mira can do and charge the final reversal. The atmosphere—emerald walls, condensed starlight, headlines on hulls—supports the cosmic-mythic tone without losing clarity. It stops short of 9+ mainly because environmental constraints never force a painful choice; they serve more as elegant apparatus than adversarial pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is striking and specific—the floating rock tea house, chains of woven light, sun trails, and the dye workshop all feel tactile and visually fresh. Details are filtered through Kael’s sensibility as a dye master and emergent story-magnet, so color and light consistently carry meaning. The morpho wing, tea, and sun trails recur and charge the final image, functioning as micro-setting elements that support the ending’s resonance. The environment influences tone and symbolic charge more than literal constraints on choice, which keeps this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Observatory Labyrinth, storm, tower, ivy, and surrounding trees are vividly drawn and consistently filtered through Marcus’s practical, observant gaze. The environment is not just backdrop: the storm knocks out power, forcing reliance on moonlight, which in turn enables both his healing and the sextant’s projections; the labyrinth’s architecture and carvings are integral to the revelation about quantified sorrow. The final image—ivy through the broken dome, trees “whispering calculations,” and moonlight as a vector of healing—directly recharges earlier setting details and crystallizes theme. This integration of weather, architecture, and natural world as active constraints and carriers of meaning merits a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the alchemical greenhouse, singing trees, iron framework, and mica window are sensorially rich and conceptually tied to the magic system. Environment meaningfully shapes events—the greenhouse is the mechanism that channels communal memory into light, and the endless night gives the imagery stakes. Details are filtered through Elara’s knowledge and longing rather than generic cataloging, and the recurring mica window charges the final image. The world rules remain implicit but consistent, though the “mirror world” angle is more flavor than functional constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.0)
    The hidden library above a bustling train station is vivid and thematically apt, and details like “impossible architecture” and the clock tower chimes deepen atmosphere. Setting is consistently filtered through Ezra’s sensibility (watching from his corner, using the room’s tranquility as shelter) rather than feeling like a postcard. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain physical choices, it strongly charges the premise of paradox and invisibility. The final image of tranquility filling the room effectively fuses emotional and spatial setting.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and particular—the jasmine on the palace wall, midnight lettuce and moon radishes, and the impossible fountain all feel lived-in and tonally aligned. The tea house in the overgrown courtyard is not just decoration; it depends on the guerrilla gardens and in turn reframes them as portals. Environmental details like the birds flying south in the screens and the spreading plantings through the paper walls directly charge the final images. The world’s soft-rule magic is consistent and absorbed through observation rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Frozen Library above unmoving clouds, ice, and quartz hush is richly evoked through specific, sensorial detail that feels both beautiful and functional. The environment constrains and shapes events: its cold sustains the vows, its failing magic drives the crisis, and its literal fall charges the ending image. Objects like the glass slides, silver calipers, and prism are fully integrated into the space rather than feeling like decorative props. The final image of the library falling through the clouds powerfully recharges the established setting.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    The pirate market beneath the rotting pier is vividly realized—barnacle-crusted pilings, dripping beams, candlelit contraband, counterfeit bags as children’s beds—and filtered well through Mae’s history. The watch fob and the tide function as micro-setting elements that constrain choices and charge the final image (deadline, legacy, badge reveal). Environmental details seldom feel decorative; they work in concert with mood and stakes. The only slight limitation is that the physical maze of the market doesn’t meaningfully complicate her tactics beyond atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lavender bluff, aurora, and boreal forest elections are vividly rendered with multi-sensory detail and a strong SF-lyric atmosphere. Setting details are tightly integrated with the premise (trees voting, aurora responding like a neural network, the bluff as convergence point). The tin ring functions as a micro-setting tool, anchoring the “taste” mechanics. The environment charges the imagery and theme more than it constrains tactics, which keeps this just shy of the top band where setting would actively shape on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    The crystal cave is richly evoked (“opened before her like a geode’s heart”) and the sensory specificity (amethyst, cadmium yellow, humming crystals) feels both visual and tactile. Setting is not postcard: the crystals audibly respond to her drawing, making the environment an active partner in her change. The cave’s history as their childhood laboratory for synesthetic color also grounds the thematic work. A slight pullback in overtly gem-like metaphors could prevent the description from edging toward decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse city, toxic sky, breathing leaves, zinc plates, and crystallized sound in old pneumatic tubes form a vivid, coherent setting that feels both strange and inevitable. Environmental constraints (toxic barrier, dead zones, scarcity of paper, diverted water) meaningfully shape the plot and choices. The final image of the greenhouse peace “dissolv[ing] like morning condensation on glass” is charged by prior atmospheric detail, not tacked on. A very slight knock is that some worldbuilding is delivered as compact exposition rather than more fully embedded in Vera’s present-tense actions.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tower, the Bluff above the clouds, the kinetic bells, and the glacier fragment are vividly rendered and tightly woven into action rather than feeling like backdrop. Environmental specifics (gimbaled bells, cloud-sea, counterweights) directly shape what’s possible—only this architecture can capture and broadcast wonder at scale. The recurring object-as-setting (the bell that becomes a prism of wonder) strongly charges the final image. A slight sense of postcard grandeur remains—Whispering Bluff could be swapped for another high vantage—but the overall integration is very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dome, desert, synthetic soil, and rose garden are vivid and integrated into the stakes: fire must be controlled so as not to destroy the fragile ecosystem, and the dome’s atmosphere miniaturizes fears. Environmental details like cables as roots and roses channeling heat into the soil actively shape how the ritual can function. The setting rules remain consistent and are learned through action, not exposition dumps. The final image—android among roses under the dome’s refracted light—feels charged by everything we’ve learned about this place.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    The courtyard, thrift store, and shelter are rendered with economical but vivid detail that feels lived-in (morning routines, hopscotch squares, gray shelter against the light). The courtyard functions as more than backdrop: it’s where stories move “like morning birds” and becomes “mission control” and finally “this home,” clearly charging the final image. A few environmental effects (weather, physical constraints) could be used more tactically in moment-to-moment choices, but for this length the integration is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    The flooded laboratory is richly and economically evoked—the green-filtered light, brackish water, broken skylights, and spiraling eddies create a textured, lived environment. Setting is not postcard-static; water and light sync with her movements and the equipment’s awakening, culminating in the spiral around her feet that charges the final image. The recurring objects (console, skylight, water, dice) anchor both atmosphere and meaning. This satisfies the micro-setting/recurring object gate for high-band scores by constraining perception and deeply charging the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating city, gravity pockets, cemetery with drifting ashes, and salt crystal chamber are vivid, specific, and consistently rule-bound, all filtered through Marina’s utilitarian familiarity. Environment meaningfully shapes options: nausea zones, floating headstones, and altered gravity make the cemetery and whale feel dangerous and sacred, not backdrop. Recurring objects (salt, crystals, lanterns) charge the final images and are thematically aligned with preservation and suspended grief. A slight reason this doesn’t go higher is that the salt chamber itself, while striking, could pressure Marina’s immediate tactics more directly.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    The nocturnal haven, brook, mist, stones, and “small consciousnesses” of the place are vivid and tightly integrated into both magic system and resolution. Setting is not postcard: the brook-mist, water murmur, and silence-mapping directly enable her tactics and carry the prophecy away, and the final image of footprints smoothed by water recharges the theme. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her long familiarity with the place. The world’s rules around moonlight, origami, and natural noise remain internally consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rooftop garden during a meteor shower, the murmuring brick facade, and the groaning fire escape all operate as a lived-in, thematically resonant environment rather than backdrop. Details are filtered through Elara’s sensibility (architecture as language, meteors as less impressive than whispers), which tightens POV and mood. The building’s “midnight recitation” in the final line meaningfully charges the last image and fuses setting with the core concept. This integration of environment with premise and closure is strong enough to approach top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    The velvet garden and seashell are vivid, sensorially rich, and integrated with Marina’s perception (“velvet petals,” perfume of forgotten summers, dawn gold re-coloring the space). The garden isn’t just backdrop; it physically hides the other shell half and shifts with time, mirroring the internal journey. The shell as recurring object decisively charges the final image. A slight check is that the garden itself constrains tactics less than it could, functioning more as charged atmosphere than an active obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, stalactites, and altar are vivid, coherent, and recur with evolving resonance rather than feeling like a postcard tour. The key, thorn, altar, and frost-lit space function as a micro-setting that shapes how the choice is enacted (ritual, sacrifice, burning, leaving objects behind). Environmental details—aurora, pearl twilight, dripping stalactites—mirror the liminal moral state without becoming muddled. The setting could constrain concrete options a bit more explicitly, but it already meaningfully charges the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.5)
    The canyon and serpentine nexus are vivid, acoustically specific, and tightly bound to the premise: echoes, harmonics, and stone behavior concretely shape what’s possible. Setting is not postcard décor; the nexus is where the phenomenon is strongest and where the choice must happen, and the closing image (“The canyon remembered everything”) recharges the environment as participant, not backdrop. Details like red rock, starlight, and the canyon as instrument are selective but memorable. A touch more non-visual sensory texture (e.g., temperature, texture underfoot) at the peak could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glacier shrine, candles, ice walls, and frost-face manifestations are vivid and tightly integrated into action: candles melt ice, reveal ghosts, and determine how the globe’s pattern can be read. The environment charges the final image, with the ceiling constellations mapping future wrecks and “borrowed starlight” echoing the opening. Setting is filtered through Marina’s professional and psychic lens rather than as inert scenery. A minor limit is that non-visual senses are lightly used, though the visual motif is strong enough to carry the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting work is outstanding: the whispering parapet, post-rain stones, jasmine vines, and fireflies are vivid, sensory, and tightly integrated with her inner life. The tower’s avoidance by others, the “whispering” stones, and the height above the sleeping village all actively shape her solitude and capacity to perceive patterns. Objects-as-setting (the whisk, the net) are fully embedded in the spatial and atmospheric logic. The final image of her faint impression in the dew and the parapet resuming its whispering powerfully charges the environment as an ongoing witness.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    The orchard in a radioactive wasteland, glowing apples, and sweeping dust storms create a vivid, specific environment that’s tightly integrated with the premise. The stillpoint field and approaching storm meaningfully constrain action and frame the stakes of leaving or moving the diamond. Details are efficiently chosen and filtered through his investigative lens, avoiding touristy cataloguing. A touch more sensory variety (sound, touch, smell) in the final approach to the tree could push this toward a fully immersive high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory, cobalt glass, storm, altitude, and radio array are vividly specific and consistently filtered through Marlowe’s technical-mystical gaze. Weather and architecture aren’t mere backdrop: lightning, rain, and humming glass physically mediate her access to prophecy and charge the final image of the blue-lit dawn. World rules (ghost frequencies, dead channels) remain internally consistent and are learned through her practice rather than exposition. The setting meaningfully charges the closure even if it rarely forces tactical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    The boardwalk, dunes, and “feral loft” are vividly evoked with specific, lived-in details (salt-stiffened blanket, taffy cart unchanged since 1962, warped boards). Setting is filtered through Marcus’s sensibility, tying environment to his vocation as a sound-collector. The recurring objects—the music box and jars—function as micro-settings that charge the final image rather than mere décor. The physical environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but it does meaningfully shape mood and identity throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    The drift-ice marina, frozen metal, “collision of frozen waves,” and the sonic architecture of the lighthouse are vividly and economically rendered, with strong sensory layering beyond the visual. Setting constraints—Arctic cold, ice barriers fracturing, the marina’s anchoring covenant—directly shape stakes and tactics. The vault, the artifact’s suspension field, and the beam at the end all function as charged micro-settings that matter to the final image. The only small limitation is that the Collectors’ physical environment isn’t as instantiated as Mira’s, leaving the broader world slightly one-sided in texture.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    The basalt columns, frozen lake, and moonlit ice are evocative and consistent, with the environment concretely constraining the plot (the sanctuary is usable only when the lake is frozen after specific rains). Setting details are filtered through Kira’s professional and emotional lens (magnetic hums, lunar angles), and the frozen lake’s reflective surface meaningfully guides her movements. The final image of the brightening sky on the ice and the viaduct’s new hum recharges earlier environmental motifs. This is rich, economical worldbuilding that does purposeful work rather than ornamental description.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tunnel, rain, and historical layering of “these same tunnels, back when they were natural caves” create a strong, lived-in atmosphere that is tightly bound to the core concept of underground routes to freedom. The lantern functions as both object and micro-setting, focusing attention and anchoring the supernatural element in a tactile artifact; the storm above physically and thematically charges Margot’s emergence. Environmental details are selective and purposeful rather than touristic, and the final ascent into the rain uses setting to embody her internal shift. A bit more tactile interaction with the tunnel itself under pressure could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    The shop is vividly particular—dust motes, brass doorplate, rain-slicked street, shelves of frozen dancers—and consistently filtered through the emotional stakes. The recurring light through storm imagery and the clockwork environment both charge the final image of the music box playing and the heart “steady as absolution.” The setting is not mere wallpaper: it’s the only place where Thomas’s chosen form of apology can be enacted and understood. A slight restraint on description in a few lines would prevent the atmosphere from flirting with the ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop over an acid sea is vividly realized and consistently threaded through the prose, with tactile mechanical noises and the hungry green waves shaping atmosphere. Crucially, setting constrains choice: the ever-present acid threat makes Pioneer's plunge a real risk, and the final chemical luminescence depends on the specific interaction of acid and her modified wings. The recurring image of green phosphorescence and mechanical swaying reinforces tone and theme without lapsing into pure decoration. World rules around the acid and mechanical consciousness feel internally consistent at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    The corporate archive between floors, obsolete servers, and shadow SocialSync form a vivid, specific setting that is inseparable from the premise. World rules around backups, cached views, and deleted profiles are conveyed through Lila’s work rather than infodump. The Apollo-X patch functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image and links space mission to data afterlife. Atmosphere is consistently eerie and functional rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    The lighthouse orchard above grinding ice floes is vivid and memorable, with warm bark, copper apples, and trembling mirrors creating a strong sensory and conceptual atmosphere. The environment is thematically charged: warmth vs. ice and impossible growth all mirror the empathy/anomaly dynamic. The setting doesn’t much constrain physical choices, but it strongly charges the final images of her descent toward the ice and the orchard’s ongoing work. World rules (temporal fractures, absorbed empathy) are consistent enough at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    The drift-ice marina is extraordinarily vivid and sensorially grounded (“boats sat trapped like insects in amber,” “minus-forty air”), and it continuously shapes perception and mood. Setting isn’t postcard; the thinning ice, calving, and environmental extremity directly frame the work of evacuation and the music-of-endings motif. The parasol tip as micro-setting/object recurs and charges the final image with tactile cost (lace cutting into her palm). This environment and object are tightly woven into the story’s logic and closure, though we might see one more moment where the physical danger of the environment constrains immediate choices.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    The amber pavilion, vineyards, and October light are vivid and consistently filtered through Marcus’s history with the place. The pavilion is not just backdrop; it’s the shared meeting ground across time, directly charging the final bench scene. Details like bus taillights dissolving into dusk and the impossible hybrid wine root setting in both concrete reality and thematic metaphor. The recurring environmental elements (pavilion, vines, bus) evolve meaningfully between past and present rather than staying postcard-static.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and distinctive: the murmuring pavilion, kinetic parapet, crystalline pillars, fountain languages, and maps of light all feel specific and integrated with the world’s logic. These elements are not mere backdrop; the pavilion’s depths house the maps that motivate action, and the parapet’s responsiveness charges the final image with conceptual weight (defense against forgetting). Sensory selection—sound, light, and subtle vibration—supports the “whisperfield calm” tone well. The environment could constrain choices a bit more directly, but it already approaches publishable strength.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lavender field and rusted factory bones are vividly rendered and inextricable from the story’s meaning; the environment is not backdrop but the canvas and constraint for the intergenerational artwork. The dove gray case and photographs function as charged micro-settings, shaping perception and the final image where Elara cradles the case amid a living spiral. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (soot vs. lavender, rust vs. bloom), reinforcing the thematic contrast of industry and healing. This is exemplary scene-building, just shy of transcendent only because the environment rarely complicates tactics beyond providing a charged stage.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    The shadowed library at dawn, dust motes, tall windows, and the chandelier are all vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elena’s scholarly sensibility. The crystal as a recurring object-setting hybrid charges both the opening and closing and refracts the environment into conceptually meaningful fragments. The world rule about the “last dictionary” is efficiently embedded and never contradicted. Setting does more atmospheric and thematic work than tactical constraint, but it strongly supports tone and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    The fog sculpture garden, decaying boardwalk, static-filled TVs, and driftwood maze are vivid, original, and tightly integrated with meaning. Environment continually mirrors and shapes the action: fog as dissolving memory, static as temporal residue, the tide as time’s pull. The final images—fog sculptures reaching, tapes on vigil, chalk wearing down—are powerfully charged by the established setting. This is near top-tier work; a clearer way in which the physical environment constrains tactics (beyond mood and ritual) would nudge it even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    The lunar observatory, carbon cables, and glass dome are vivid and conceptually integrated, with the environment (tension in cables, tremors) directly implicated in the crisis. Objects-as-setting—the antique clock, modified camera, and tuning fork—are well woven into the atmospheric and physical stakes. The time-threads connecting the observatory to Earth elegantly charge the final understanding of the setting. A slightly broader sensorial range (beyond visual/auditory) in the peak beats could deepen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Radiant Haven, the rooftop garden, hospital sounds, and the vinyl frame are vividly rendered and tightly woven into action rather than sitting as backdrop. The environment and its sensory specifics (morning light, bamboo, fountain, glass walls, “scent of hope”) feel inseparable from the story’s meaning and from Maya’s methods. Crucially, the rooftop setting and the vinyl frame charge the final image: the haven above the clouds and the completed circle embody the thematic continuation. This integration of place, object, and closure is highly effective and near–publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle, with brass gears, crystal lenses, and self-shifting constellation maps, is vivid and tightly integrated with the plot. Setting directly shapes tactics: Lyra uses the telescopes to track upward-fleeing shadows and the observatory’s mechanisms to close loops. World rules (sealed awakenings, upward shadows, reality-prison) are consistent and conveyed through action rather than exposition dumps. Slightly more embodied sensory detail—physical sensation as the isle trembles, the feel/sound of machinery under strain—could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    The hedge maze and secret garden are vividly realized, with details (clouds not touching earth, impossible blooms, moss bench, fountain handprints) that feel lived-in and tonally apt. The setting is not mere backdrop: it’s a liminal space Mother planted “where both worlds could touch,” structurally enabling the meeting and charging the final image of a “healing ground for creatures caught between.” Environmental motifs—jasmine, roses, spider silk, the fountain—echo the themes of transformation and repair without feeling over-explicit. It stops just short of the 9-band because the garden frames and symbolizes the choice more than it directly constrains tactics in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    The serpentine grotto, mist, and harbor are vividly rendered and integrated with action: the stillness, acoustics, and amphitheater mouth all matter to how the light works and how it’s shared. Professional bias shows in Marina’s attention to light behavior, lenses, and angles. The recurring sea-glass and grotto setting tangibly charge the final image of communal instruction. A touch less lyric ornamentation in early description would better match the modest on-page pressure, but the spatial and sensory grounding are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    The abandoned data center turned moss garden is vivid and specific—melting icicles, green-draped racks, cooling systems channeling rainwater—and consistently filtered through Kira’s sensibility as an engineer-turned-gardener. The environment is not mere backdrop: it’s her sanctuary, her chosen tool of reclamation, and the very infrastructure of her quiet resistance. The final image of the “pattern the ice had left” spreading across hard surfaces ties setting directly to thematic closure. Strong as atmosphere and metaphor, it lightly constrains choice (why she hides here, why she rejects the buzzing phone) without full-on tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.0)
    The feral nexus is richly realized and specific—rails “twisting” into rust sculptures, mist moving against wind, water filling footprints uphill—creating a distinctive, charged atmosphere. Setting rules (everything moving against the current) are consistent and thematically fused to Marina’s backward-written novel. The seashell on the mossed rail in the final image is inseparable from the environment and meaningfully charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    The arbor, morning dew, and later harvest moon are vividly rendered and filtered through Elara’s attention, giving the piece a strong, coherent atmosphere. The environment supports tone and theme—the vine literally links branches and villagers—and the final image of the blooming arbor under moonlight is charged. However, the setting rarely constrains tactics or forces specific choices beyond providing ritual context and timing. It’s richly evoked but more as stage and symbol than as an active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and deeply integrated: inverted trees, subarctic crater, aurora, and debris all actively participate in the ritual (sap in the flash-paper, trees whispering swallowed stars, the crater’s heartbeat). The environment constrains and enables her tactics; she could not perform this work elsewhere. The final image of her holding the warm plate up to the subarctic stars is charged by all that environmental groundwork. This is near top-tier atmosphere with strong functional integration, just shy of utterly transformative stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    The marble cavern is vividly rendered and strongly functional: quartz “like frozen lightning,” natural camera obscura, reflective pools, and acoustics that deliver pre-echoes all matter to how she works. The setting is not a postcard; it directly enables her mirror method and the temporal anomalies that drive discovery. Environmental details evolve with time of day (dawn light vs. noon acoustics), reinforcing the time-based premise. The final ascent out of the cavern contrasts meaningfully with her cellar workshop, charging the last image with a sense of buried wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bronze grotto under starlight is exquisitely rendered and tightly integrated: metal, oxidation, starlight angles, and the echoing hush all shape what Mara can do and think. Setting is not just backdrop; the bronze walls actively contain and reflect her fractals, starlight angles determine which weights she can weave, and the grotto’s accumulated history becomes a burden she measures. The burner as a lived-in tool-object further grounds the space in tactile reality. A small ceiling on the score comes from the fact that the environment constrains more conceptually than via immediate tactical obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    The loft, rain-beaded skylight, and workbench are vivid and integrated into action rather than tacked-on description; the rain-softening and late sun materially charge the final mood. The tools, ash blank, and kettle feel tactile and lived-in, filtered through her combined identities as artist and carver’s widow. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain options, it subtly shapes the contemplative yet time-boxed atmosphere that makes the interior turn believable.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Kinetic Lagoon and suspended carnival are vividly realized, with selective, purposeful details (thermal currents, spiraling waters, brass poles, mist) that are filtered through Kira’s weary, professional gaze. The environment is not mere backdrop: time distortion, water-as-memory, and the halted carousel directly shape her role and possibilities. The final image—“The waters began to move again, slowly, as if learning how”—is charged by everything we’ve learned about the lagoon. A slight broadening of non-visual sensory detail could enrich it further, but as is, the setting meaningfully constrains and reweights the story.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    The abandoned spaceport—layered with carnival detritus and dormant hydraulics—is vivid, specific, and atmospherically strong. Setting is functionally integrated: the architecture as navigational instrument literally enables the plot and charges the final images of arcs and sextant. Details like cracked terrazzo, rusted valves, and dry fountain now erupting are well chosen and filtered through her engineer’s eye. The environment constrains what she can do and what she discovers rather than serving as generic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sanctuary and crystalline forecourt are rendered with vivid, multi-sensory specificity (light, texture, scent), and always filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The environment isn’t just decorative; the silence, crystal, and sunrise pattern actively frame her life choice and charge the ending image (“silence itself could sing”). The world-building is restrained but feels coherent and purposeful. Setting clearly shapes her available identities (scribe vs. musician), which gives the place thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Amsterdam canal at twilight is vividly evoked and consistently filtered through Mara’s sensibility, with the Magere Brug and “mirror-black water” reinforcing the theme of reflection. The environment supports mood and theme more than it constrains action, but the twilight, stillness, and water-as-mirror images do meaningful work in charging the final realization. It avoids tourist-catalog listing and feels lived-in.

    The harbor, golden dock under snow, fog, boats, and tidal plants are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Mara’s sensibility as a collector and decoder of patterns. Setting and atmosphere strongly support tone and theme—snow dissolving on wood, fulgurite, barnacles, and ropes all echo the idea of nature and craft as writing systems. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics beyond mild physical discomfort; it frames and enriches rather than pressures. Still, the specificity and integration with the story’s conceptual concerns are high.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting is lushly specific and integrated—the shadowed autumn garden, unraveling palace, empty observatory, and vanished harbor all filter through Elara’s sensibility. The crimson thread and the decaying palace function as recurring environmental objects that charge the final image and theme. Sensory detail (frost-edged roses, dry fountain, koi absence) is purposeful and tonal rather than ornamental. The setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices, but it deeply shapes emotional stakes and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    The suspended palace and mechanical city are vividly rendered, with strong tactile and auditory detail (“tick-tick-tick of clockwork hearts,” chains groaning, wind in the cavern). Setting is filtered well through Aldric’s sensibility—he reads mathematics as poetry and the palace as a swaying sanctuary, which aligns with the thematic conflict. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactical choices, it clearly charges the final image of the prince and bird singing above a slowly awakening city. The world rules (Great Conversion, extinct songbird, steam/clockwork) feel consistent and efficiently sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.7)
    The obsidian lagoon, volcanic sand, dunes, kelp, and migrating clouds form a vivid, coherent micro-world that strongly mirrors and contains Maya’s inner state. Setting details are purposeful and filtered through her sensibility (a firefighter reading wind and water), avoiding generic nature description. The lagoon and black sand actively charge the ritual and final image, functioning almost as a character and clearly reweighting the ending. While the environment doesn’t impose hard logistical constraints, it meaningfully shapes mood, symbolism, and the available transformative action.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and thematically integrated: “dry fountains yawning like mouths,” basins of “accumulated time,” and paused geese all feel particular and alive. The environment directly shapes the action—every key beat involves interacting with the fountains, the city’s temporal residue, and the sky. The city’s nature and the fountains’ history charge the final image of the fountains singing again. Sensory and conceptual details are well-filtered through the story’s mood without devolving into museum-tour description.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.3)
    The nebula garden, red giant, protostellar nursery, and gravitational “sonar pings” create a vivid, coherent cosmic environment that’s filtered through her caretaker’s gaze. The setting does more than decorate: the garden’s cyclical blooming and dying mirrors and undergirds the story’s meditation on generational patterns. Still, the environment primarily frames mood rather than constraining specific choices, which keeps it just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse, monarchs, glass, stone, and milkweed are vivid and specific, and they’re consistently filtered through Martha’s sensibility as carver and caretaker. The setting meaningfully shapes the piece: the greenhouse is both workshop and ritual space, the monarch migration provides a temporal and thematic frame, and the final image with wind carrying words south is charged by this environment. Details are economical yet textured, avoiding tourist-list description. The world rules stay realistic with a light touch of the supernatural.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    The obsidian ridge, tide, brass mechanisms, and pendulum bob are described with economical vividness and clear spatial logic. Setting isn’t mere backdrop: the ridge and tides ground the stakes (boats, docks, livelihood), and the tower interior and pendulum physically constrain what Theodore can do and how. The recurring clock/pedulum imagery charges the final image of the tower as “collective heartbeat,” tightening world, object, and theme. A slightly broader sensory range beyond sight and touch could make it even richer, but what’s here is highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and particular—the cobalt silo, midnight roses, starlight, and metal walls rattling like “distant applause” create a strong, unified atmosphere. Details are filtered convincingly through a gardener’s sensibility, with tools and plants integral to how she interacts with the world. The environment subtly charges the final image (silo as sentinel, cemetery as “planted intentions”) and echoes the theme of tending. It doesn’t strongly constrain choices, though, which keeps it just short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.5)
    The Obsidian Spire, frozen lake, and kingfisher create a distinctive, moody environment with strong visual specificity (“darkness cannot darken what already gleams black beneath winter’s grip” is memorable). Setting is filtered through concept and function—maps, walls, meeting chamber—rather than as a generic backdrop. However, the environment rarely constrains action or tactics; it’s thematically and atmospherically charged more than causally operative. The final image of footprints on the lake is lovely but again symbolic rather than a pressure-bearing constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ember alcove, mist-wrapped night, scarce light, and traumatized dust create a vivid, coherent world that feels lived-in and thematically loaded. Setting details are tightly tied to action: the alcove’s residual heat, the radio glow, and the dust/ink mixture directly shape Mariel’s methods. The final image of her leaving the alcove with luminous scores toward the misty city recharges these earlier details without feeling ornamental. This is rich, purposeful atmosphere that supports both stakes and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Vanishing Point Gallery is vivid and purposeful: borderland jurisdiction, marble floor, ash, ventilation system, the rocking chair, and the porcelain mask all shape mood and meaning. The legal gray zone and the physical ephemerality of the ash directly support the premise of illusory safety and disappearing identities. Environmental details (like the officers’ boots grinding the ash) are well-chosen and charged, especially in the final image. The story might have pushed one more tactile or spatial constraint into an actual choice, but what’s here is already strongly integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting of the drowned “Athens of the West” is vivid and specific—barnacled statues in green water, sewer tunnels, submerged plazas—and it’s filtered convincingly through Marcus’s familiarity and bitterness. The environment supports tone and theme (sediment, layers, ruins) rather than feeling like a postcard. While the physical setting doesn’t heavily constrain micro-tactics in the scene beyond defining that they’re in sewers and diving, it does conceptually charge the final descent into the ruins. A single additional moment where the physical conditions complicate or shape a choice under pressure would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “velvet library,” autumn, and “traveled stillness” are sensorially strong and thematically consonant with listening and vanishing arts. The zither, rosette, and instruments weave into the space so it feels lived-in rather than a backdrop, and the return to the library’s stillness at the end charges the final image. Environment doesn’t heavily constrain choices beyond the institutional context (closing time, storage), but it does shape tone and the sense of a hushed, transitional moment. Details remain selective and purposeful, avoiding cataloguing while still giving a textured sense of place.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rusted greenhouse, triple moons, and neural garden are richly evoked, with details filtered through Mira’s sensory/taste-driven perspective and her past as a chef. The environment meaningfully shapes tactics: she uses this abandoned restaurant/greenhouse precisely because it’s a ruin the Ministry ignores, and the greenhouse becomes the physical and conceptual vessel for rebellion at the end. The final image of memories painted across every surface depends on this setting’s specificity. A slightly greater sense of physical constraint or danger from the environment could push this higher, but as-is it’s a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lightning tower, amber sky, darkened city, and glass bee chamber create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s both tactile and thematically charged. Setting is not mere backdrop: the tower’s lightning collection literally powers the bees’ survival and enables the broadcast, and it reappears as a “lighthouse” in the final image. Objects like the lacquer box and the scattered drone carcasses ground the world and echo the organic/artificial contrast. This integration of environment with stakes and ending image is strong enough for high-band scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and tightly integrated, from the “streetlights flickered between waking and sleeping” to the bay “like a held breath,” with sensory specificity that serves the liminal, hushed mood. The bay and the shard work as micro-setting elements that charge the final image: the bay as a physical locus of offerings and hush, the shard as a filter that reveals temporal layers. Environmental rules stay consistent—the displaced objects congregate at the shoreline—and the details mirror internal states without feeling schematic. The one restraint against an even higher score is that the environment rarely constrains her choices; it mainly reveals and resonates rather than forcing alternate tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    The drowned garden and underwater city are vivid and economical—kelp through marble, coral-crusted statue, murky depth with a diving bell—without resorting to generic seascape. Setting matters to the history (seawalls, dolphins breaching, a city sinkable by tide) and to present constraints (Thessaly’s immobility, Marina’s limited dive window). The final image reframes the “forgotten” garden as a monument to moral complexity, so place charges theme as well as mood. A bit more tactile interaction with the environment in the present frame could further integrate setting with on-page choice.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    The infinite staircase is vividly and economically rendered as both architecture and mechanism: “each step a mathematical certainty” and the energy-conserving dice rolls concretize the rules of the world. The environment meaningfully constrains choice—he can only climb, calculate, and mark walls—so the setting is not window dressing but the prison and engine of the story. The chipped die works as a micro-setting object that directly charges the final image of anticipated rupture. A slight sensory narrowness (mostly visual/conceptual) keeps it just short of the very top band, but what’s here is sharply purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting work is a major strength: the smog-choked city versus the rooftop greenhouse, the saffron tint, and moonlight through glass create a charged, coherent atmosphere. Environment is not just backdrop; the greenhouse becomes the community hub and the smog outside throws its refuge role into relief, while the brush and moon function as micro-setting tools. Details stay selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira’s artistic gaze rather than reading like a tourist catalog. It stops just short of 9+ because physical constraints of setting don’t meaningfully limit choices beyond mood and gathering-place function.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.0)
    The grotto city behind the waterfall is vividly realized through sound (roar changing pitch), scent (rosewater), and tactile detail (melting frost, weeping walls), all filtered through Marta’s professional eye. Environment is not decorative: the thaw, waterfall, and mineralized ice directly constrain time and tactics, and the opera glass as tool is integrally bound to seeing what’s vanishing. The bakery alcove, ovens, and letter-prints feel specific and spatially coherent. The final image of her working through the night within this pressured space is strongly charged by the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lighthouse and rocky island are vividly realized, with strong, purposeful details like “water dripped backward up the walls” and the suspended hunger stone shaping both mood and action. The environment meaningfully constrains the story: the apex lamp room, the lens assembly, and the meteorite fragment all dictate what Elara must physically do. The recurring maritime/tide imagery effectively frames the temporal strangeness and the backward-facing beam at the end. This setting feels integral rather than interchangeable, though there is still some room to deepen how the sea/tide materially pressures her options.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned carnival funhouse is vividly realized—bioluminescent mold, lingering luminance, children’s screams at sub-audible frequencies—and all of it feels inherently tied to the emotional stakes. The environment constrains the story: mirrors as the only place Cornelius is visible, the funhouse as Fear’s prison and feeding ground, and the exit into ordinary daylight as a meaningful threshold. The opera clasp functions as a micro-setting object, charging the final image and literally containing the transformed Fear. Detail is lush but purposeful; nearly every environmental choice either echoes or pressures the core conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the floating orchard, driftwood raft, blue hour light, and whale-haunted sea are not mere backdrop but the medium and constraint of the action. The raft’s physical properties (interwoven logs, salt-worn grain) directly shape the harmonic strategy, and the mallet and clouds act as tools within that environment. Sensory detail is lush yet mostly purposeful, with sea, sky, and wood filtered through Kessa’s professional bias. The final image of the orchard sailing into night with the pulsing mallet charges both place and object with ongoing consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the turtles’ shells shape the city’s spirals, acoustics for the whistle, and the existential risk when they wake. Environmental details (salt-thick air, barnacle-crusted borders, observatory in the central whorl) are filtered through Mira’s cartographic and pattern-obsessed gaze. Crucially, the world itself constrains choices—the rusted gate forces the maintenance hatch, and the turtles’ awakening and watchers’ movement charge the final image. The atmosphere is rich without becoming a static postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    The station, ivy, and rosebush are vivid and consistently filtered through Elara’s perspective, giving the piece a strong atmosphere. Crucially, the setting is not just decorative: the abandoned station enables her hiding and provides the telegraph that makes her strategy possible. The rosebush/last petal motif frames both time and theme, charging the final image of “seeds of revelation.” A bit more tactile interaction with the decaying environment under pressure could further heighten the sense of constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    The submerged pavilion is vividly rendered—columns as “pale fingers,” barnacled walls, seaweed “funeral bunting,” chandelier just above the water—creating a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting is not merely decorative: water depth, tide, storm damage, and the exposed cornerstone directly shape his route, his hiding place, and the sense of urgency. The environment consistently mirrors Edmund’s interior (drowned culture, lingering music) without feeling over-literal. This is close to exemplary object-as-setting work, with the pavilion and its decay charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    The underwater library and phosphorescent algae are vividly and economically rendered, and they directly shape tactics: blackout and water silence the hum, algae light reveals ink, preservation fields scramble frequencies. The setting is not postcard dressing but an active constraint and resource, especially in the blackout/generator/EM interference cycle. The final image of algae guarding “honest ink” powerfully recharges earlier environmental details. This is strong enough to sit just below the very top band, where even more idiosyncratic or surprising environmental turns under peak pressure would be needed.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    The floating tea garden, glass basilica, and moonlight bridges are sensuously rendered and consistently filtered through Mei’s grief, with recurring images (lanterns, gems, basilica) accruing emotional weight. The final image of lanterns hung in the basilica, casting daughter-like shadows, recharges these settings powerfully. While the environment doesn’t materially constrain physical choices, it functions as a charged emotional and spiritual architecture for the story’s stakes. The specificity and integration are strong enough for high-band even without hard logistical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    The floating observatory, the quantum scanner, and the view of scarred Earth provide a specific, tonally apt environment that clearly links altitude to the thinning boundary between realities. The geode functions as a micro-setting object, grounding both grief and cosmological stakes and charging the final image. Environmental detail is selectively used rather than lush, but almost always purposeful (e.g., the blown breakers and cooling cycle as enabling constraint). A bit more tactile, embodied engagement with the lab and zero/low-gravity environment could deepen atmosphere further.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory is vivid and functional: the cracked dome, dusk light, and worn limestone are not postcard details but actively enable the discovery (pattern visible only from above in this specific light, star trails in the stone, dome as projection surface). Environmental specifics are consistently filtered through Kira’s professional gaze and the tools she uses, which helps anchor both mood and action. The setting meaningfully charges the final image—the glowing matrices and projected star trails in the dark dome. This could edge even higher if the environment pressed back with more constraint or friction.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    The physical setting—cobalt terrace, forgotten shore, bruised-purple dusk—is vivid and tonally precise, and the driftwood functions as both environment and charged object. The shore’s forgotten status and the terrace vantage subtly mirror erased histories and curated perspectives. The final image of leaving the carvings and watch hand there gives the place real narrative weight, not just postcard color. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful rather than cluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    The parapet, neutral territory, and mist are vividly rendered and consistently threaded through the piece, shaping tone and giving the negotiations a tactile, liminal stage. Weather and environment are not mere backdrop: the mist veiling Thorne’s emergence and eventual disappearance underscores the precariousness of peace. The recurring drawer pull functions as a powerful micro-setting object that charges both history and the final image. The only limit is that the environment constrains mood more than concrete tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    The coastal kayak launch, utility poles, and the sea are vivid and integrated: poles as “soldiers,” specific numbered markers, and the fog lifting all echo his inner state and tactics. The astronomical compass as object-setting is excellent, carrying generational, professional, and emotional weight and explicitly charging the final image. Environmental constraints (currents, rocks, daylight, rental shack) are present but remain mostly symbolic rather than truly limiting his options. Still, the setting feels lived-in and thematically synchronized without lapsing into postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cave and underground bioluminescent lake are vividly rendered and feel specific rather than generic-fantastical; details like “pressed flowers that refuse to crumble” and paths appearing with the organisms’ light are memorable. Crucially, the environment is not just backdrop: the labyrinth of bridges concretely shapes Marcus’s choices and the closure image. The setting’s internal logic (bioluminescence revealing options, glimpses of people on distant paths) is consistent and thematically aligned with moral navigation. A bit more tactile interaction with the environment underfoot could push this toward true top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Everbloom Orchard under permanent moonlight, the phoenix’s cosmic nest, and the spices are vividly, economically rendered and strongly tonal. Setting and atmosphere are tightly aligned with theme—the unfalling blossoms, permanent moon, and blank fortune transforming into a moth all echo stasis versus change and ongoing connection. The environment is more a charged stage than an active constraint on choice, which keeps it just below top-tier. Still, the specificity and integration into the final image are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is extraordinarily vivid and thematically fused: silver grass that chimes, transparent-leaf trees bearing unwritten apologies, and the cloudbound glade as a literal repository of squandered hours. The saucer and tea set function as micro-setting objects that constrain and shape action, especially in the closing image of the mended crack catching rain. World rules for this magical space are implied through action rather than exposition and stay consistent. A slight risk of over-lushness appears, but the imagery almost always serves emotional and thematic ends rather than ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    The monastery ship of salvaged vessels, the meditation chamber with walls of tear-streaked photographs, and the AI in her grandmother’s voice all build a vivid, coherent environment. Setting details are filtered through Mei’s ritual practice (floating, tracing dried tears, balancing gravity shifts), which ties atmosphere directly to action. The ship’s transformation at the end—“warships becoming gardens, prison walls transformed to shelters”—charges the closure image and makes the environment an active participant in the story’s change. A bit more tactile interaction with the ship during the central crisis could further anchor stakes, but what’s present is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    The black sand beach, active volcano, and celestial alignment are vividly rendered and integral to the story’s meaning and final image. Setting is not mere backdrop: volcanic breaths cue turning points, the beach receives her “imprint,” and the contrast between lava and bottled light sharpens the thematic focus on transformation. The world’s rules (bioluminescence, gravity tug) are consistent within this quasi-mythic frame. It falls just short of higher marks because the environment rarely constrains her choices beyond being the ritual stage.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fort, courtyard, sundial, and lamplit administrative wing are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Thorne’s professional familiarity. The quill holder and sundial function as micro-setting objects that shape action and the final image, especially the use of dawn light and reflections. Atmosphere (twilight, blackout, lamps reigniting) effectively supports the clandestine mood without feeling like a tourist catalog. Environment mostly frames rather than constraining choices, which keeps it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and particular: the tidal bluff, aurora, frictionless world, and eels as “beings of pure motion” are all tightly integrated into the action and metaphysics. The aurora and stones are not just scenic; they literally respond to and mediate the ritual, and the bluff is framed as the impact site where friction failed, charging the ending image. World rules around frictionlessness and eel-motion are consistently applied. The only slight limitation is that environmental constraints rarely force tactical choices beyond the ritual itself, keeping this just under the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stormlit observatory, darkroom, timer, lightning rod, and clouds below are vivid and tightly woven into action and theme rather than postcard description. The setting directly shapes tactics (storm empties the mountain, observatory gives solitude and vantage “above the cloud line,” darkroom and timer structure her clandestine work) and charges the final image of the dome tracking ancient star-messages. Weather isn’t decorative; lightning, thunder, and charged air mirror and enable the subversive “electric kiss” of her poems. The environment’s duality—storm vs. stars, weather vs. clarity—embeds the political dynamic in the physical world, powering the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glass atrium, prismed light, brook, and sundial create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels tailored to these characters and ideas. Environmental details are filtered through Marlowe’s philosophical/technical lens (angles, light, mechanical arm) and recur at the end to charge the final image. The brook’s “indifference” nicely counterpoints their quiet revolution. The setting rarely constrains action, but it does meaningfully frame and reweight the closing moment.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is richly particular and felt: the gutted shipping-container library, copper-scavenger damage, rail yard, and moonlight pooling through the cut roof all build a strong atmosphere. Details (water-damaged books, rust, train whistle, the coffee tin catching light) are filtered through October’s sensibility, reinforcing themes of salvage and fracture. The environment subtly shapes action—she can only work at night by moonlight in this abandoned place, and the openness to sky mirrors her illegibility. It stops just short of 9-band because the physical setting doesn’t materially constrain or alter a key choice; its role is mostly tonal and symbolic.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Celestial Terminal, coral “roots,” tidal arbor, and magnetic storms are not just pretty; they’re woven into action (music through coral bones, compasses aligning, stars as perforations in film) and meaningfully charge the final image. Setting details consistently reflect Marion’s priorities and loss while also framing what tactics are possible, though a few lush descriptions risk feeling decorative rather than strictly pressure-bearing.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and thematically entangled: floating islands, ghost orchids, purple lightning, and the clouded sea all feel particular rather than generic. The ancient ridge, orchids, and monsoon recur and charge the final image—orchid petals reflecting “not light but stories” neatly fuses environment and theme. World rules (islands dissolving with the monsoon, reality checking as bureaucratic function) are consistent and taught through action, not exposition dumps. The environment doesn’t force hard tactical shifts but does frame Mira’s choice and the closure with palpable atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    The islet after rain, harbor, and breathing sea are vivid, selective, and tied to Kenji’s perception as a bonsai master who reads weather, roots, and tides. Micro-setting via compass and lace strongly charges the final image and constrains his choices (reading the lace patterns, sensing the bell, standing at the shore to “speak” to Yuki). Environmental elements like the breeze, fog, and surf are not postcard decoration; they mirror and pressure his interior state. World rules—including the faintly uncanny behavior of the compass and bell—remain consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.0)
    The greenhouse atmosphere is vivid and sensory details like the rot and mud are effective. However, the specific visualization of how butterfly dust maps "air currents" to predict beam failure is difficult to picture concretely, bordering on metaphorical rather than physical. The setting serves the theme well but the mechanics remain vague.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    The frost and charred paper provide a specific, tactile micro-setting that grounds the epiphany. The interaction between the ice crystals and the burnt ledger effectively bridges the physical environment and the internal realization.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the interplay between the Arctic cold, the transparent glass, and the thermal imaging creates a vivid, distinct constraint that shapes the central metaphor. The specific mechanics of the conservatory ground the abstract concept well.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.1)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, melancholic imagery like "breathable grief" and "rainbow ghosts" grounding the magical realism. The library is realized with specific, sensory details (coral vaults, floating books) that effectively support the tone, though the mechanics of survival remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is anchored well by the terra-cotta arbor and the bell, providing a consistent physical stage for the ritual. The atmosphere of "amplified quiet" is established effectively, though some descriptions ("weathered columns," "dark paths") lean toward the generic.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting is vividly rendered with specific sensory details ("wisteria," "brass fittings"), establishing a strong atmospheric mood. However, the description occasionally drifts into abstraction ("prayer written in stone," "compressed starlight") that blurs the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with "hyperbolic geometry" and "living bridges" providing a vivid, specific constraint for the narrative's logic. The physical environment actively shapes the metaphysical inquiry.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.2)
    The sensory details of seeds hidden in carnival prizes are evocative and specific. However, the world-building collapses under scrutiny: the location cannot be simultaneously an "abandoned" secret vault and a place where Marcus is a "captive attraction" with weekly visitors. This contradiction destabilizes the scene's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, successfully merging the industrial (forge), the natural (aurora, apple trees), and the post-apocalyptic (sunken ruins). The environment actively constrains the protagonist—forcing her into the pressurized chamber—and provides the energy source (aurora) for the climax. The imagery of the underwater orchard is haunting and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and active; the emerald tiles and fading light directly interact with the magic system. The contrast between the battery-powered artificiality and the moonbeams grounds the fantasy in a tangible reality.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the juxtaposition of the sterile, ruined control room with the delicate, heated glasswork is vivid and distinct. Specific details like the ice dripping from ceiling tiles and the radiation signs effectively anchor the action and constrain the protagonist's workspace.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rusted library offers strong, atmospheric grounding with sensory details like the smell of rotting paper and the chill of the metal. The "stellar dust" image is evocative, though it borders on purple given the otherwise grounded setting.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is atmospheric and consistent, establishing the isolation well. However, the specific descriptors ("storm-tossed ridge fort," "pebble-shore") feel inserted as fixed phrases rather than organic details interwoven with action. The environment provides mood but barely constrains the character's physical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and integral to the narrative; the "ice violin" and the "frozen courtyard" anchor the abstract concepts in concrete sensory details. The imagery supports the "mundane mysticism" tone effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "whispering forecourt" and its acoustics are integrated beautifully into the plot mechanics and theme. The sensory details (acoustics, trapped moonlight, wet stone) are vivid, though the description occasionally verges on being overly lush ("puddle a mirror to questions").

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    The atmospheric contrast between the sterile "Luck Index" and the organic, defiant garden is excellent. Specific details like the clicking marbles and the copper wire monument ground the magical realism in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and well-integrated; the nexus and xenobiology specimens ground the abstract concept of "sideways time" in concrete physical details. The specific atmosphere of the station effectively mirrors the paradox of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and functional; the "shallow lake" in the orchestra pit acts as both atmosphere and physical constraint. The water's depth directly influences the escalation of the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is atmospheric and integral, moving beyond backdrop to become a participant in the bloom. Specific details like "curling from condensation" and "green-gold ribbons" anchor the supernatural elements in tactile reality. The station's isolation mirrors the "margins" theme perfectly, enhancing the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, meaningful details like "phosphorescent moss" and "book-trees" that effectively externalize the theme. The setting integration is high, though it serves more as a tableau than a source of constraints forcing specific tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sensory details regarding the eclipse ("shadow bands," "diamond ring," "temperature dropped") are vivid and effectively ground the moment. The setting of Sage Ridge is distinct, though the "dreaming roots" element feels like an imposed poetic abstraction rather than a tangible part of the environment. The atmosphere successfully mirrors the internal solemnity of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is integral; the "curved walls" and "spiral stairs" mirror the cyclical concept of time. The physical environment (fireplace, scattered books) constrains the investigation and charges the final realization about the spiral nature of reality.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is integral and active; the lighthouse beam functions not just as atmosphere but as a metronome that regulates the prose and delivers the inciting message ("TRANSCEND"). The "scarred wood" and "salt-stained windows" ground the noir aesthetic effectively, fulfilling the 9+ criterion of environment charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    The acoustic atmosphere is rendered with precision; the description of sound as architecture is vivid and immersive. The "artist's palette" and "indigo" serve as strong visual anchors. A minor tonal clash occurs with the "dimensional anchor," which feels like inserted technobabble that sits awkwardly within the otherwise gothic/theological setting.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting of the glass spire and frozen lake is vivid and atmospherically consistent, effectively mirroring the internal state of the protagonist. Sensory details like the cold window, breath fog, and the visual of the spiral fortunes ground the metaphysical concepts. The mirrored horizon is not just scenery but an active participant in the story's logic and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.3)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with vivid bioluminescent imagery and a strong framing device in the "drop and the ripple." However, the "procedural generation" aspect feels like visual window dressing rather than a tangible environmental constraint that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory details regarding vibration in bone and stone are vivid and ground the scene physically. However, the acoustics drift into unestablished magical realism ("bypassed the ear entirely") that clashes with the story's attempt at physical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is vividly rendered, with specific details like the "amber light" and "barometric pressure gauge" effectively grounding the abstract dystopian context. The atmosphere of "layered quiet" is maintained well, though the rogue zone remains a purely off-stage concept.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the use of the ultraviolet lamp to reveal "spectral root systems" is an inventive, grounding image. Specific botanical references (Silphium, Judean Balsam) add necessary texture to the atmospheric "crystal shadows."

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "terra-cotta grotto" and the interplay of amber light create a distinct, vivid atmosphere. The setting anchors the abstract concepts reasonably well. However, the "energy beings" feel somewhat generic visually ("pulsing light," "luminous presence") compared to the grit of the highway and the rope.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and integral; the "amphitheater of glass and brine" actively constrains the acoustics and shapes the central action. Sensory details—ash, rusted hulls, rising water—effectively ground the thematic shift in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is excellent, integrating sensory details (static, scent, taste) with physical constraints (the sealing grotto) that directly pressure the protagonist's actions. The amber grotto feels lived-in and functionally essential to the plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with specific, evocative details like the "limestone-filtered water" and "bioluminescent fungi" grounding the magical realism. The environment actively participates in the mechanism of the plot (the mosaic, the dripping water), though the focus on atmospheric description occasionally slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    The crawl space and ventilation grate function as active constraints that shape tactics, not just backdrop. While the atmosphere is vivid, the description of a voice carrying a "sapphire hush" strains the sensory logic slightly, feeling more ornamental than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is active and distinct, functioning as a catalyst for the metamorphosis rather than just a backdrop. Sensory details like "ferns unfurled in reverse" and "DNA helixes" effectively ground the fantastical premise in specific, tangible imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the tidal mechanics and "rain trails" dictate the protagonist's movement and constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    Atmospheric details like the "Terminal Lines" punch and the arrow-cracks effectively ground the surrealism, though names like "Meridian and Nowhere" lean into twee abstraction. The setting successfully constrains the climax (the mist wall), fulfilling the basic requirement for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    The atmospheric details of the tower and whale vibrations effectively ground the tone, though the descriptions of the scientific work ("mathematical proofs," "constellation maps") remain generic. The setting supports the mood well but functions largely as a backdrop rather than an active constraint on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.0)
    The "prismatic escondite" is visually established, but reliance on abstract descriptors like "impossible colors" and "geometry" keeps the setting feeling slightly ethereal rather than tactile. The environment functions as a backdrop rather than a constraining physical space.

    The funeral home setting is expertly utilized; tools like restoration cream and needles constrain the action and ground the abstract negotiation in visceral reality.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific imagery like "stones shaped like sleeping birds" and the "manuscript written in living wood." However, the setting functions more as a static backdrop than a source of constraint; the environment cooperates perfectly rather than pressuring the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    The environment actively constrains the protagonist—tides dictate physical access to the labyrinth—and charges the final image. Sensory details like "echo patterns" and the "drowned quiet" are vivid, purposeful, and tightly woven into the narrative logic rather than serving as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is rendered with evocative, textural detail ("copper dome green," "pale as driftwood") that supports the melancholic mood. The environment effectively grounds the fantastical elements, though it functions more as atmosphere than a constraint on choices.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory details ("oil-drum fires," "scattered prayers," "platforms bobbing on recycled bottles") that ground the speculative concept.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sensory details like the "gray-white regolith" and the sublimating ice are vivid and grounded in the specific physics of the setting. The props (tarnished brass hourglass, Hasselblad) effectively anchor the 1979 timeframe, though the description of Earth as "pregnant and blue" leans on a familiar cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is excellent, with the mist and rail depot integrated directly into the protagonist's diagnostic method rather than serving as mere backdrop. Sensory details are strictly filtered through Maya’s non-visual perspective, creating a vivid, distinct texture that grounds the "magic" of her craft.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with the "cataract eye" of the lake and the "rusted metal" establishing a strong atmosphere. The environment actively participates in the plot through the frost and condensation, integrating the physical world with the protagonist’s intellectual pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting relies on generic fable markers ("ancient archway," "cobblestone streets," "market square") that lack specific, lived-in texture. The environment functions as a backdrop for the magic system rather than a pressure cooker for choices.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    The atmosphere of the underwater temple is evocative, effectively blending bioluminescence with non-Euclidean geometry to create a sense of pressure. While some descriptions rely on telling ("defied logic," "mathematics of impossibility") rather than demonstrating the spatial distortion through action, the setting successfully acts as an antagonist that constrains the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with the "copper light" and "green brass" creating a strong sensory palette. The lighthouse prison serves as an excellent constraint that shapes the narrative tone and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.3)
    Exceptional integration of the alchemical greenhouse; the setting constraints (mercury, starless sky) effectively pressure the mood and tactics. The transformation of the setting at the end (magical fruit to mortal apples) carries the thematic weight of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.6)
    The setting imagery is vivid and specific, successfully grounding the "ocean meets desert" concept with details like barnacles on petroglyphs. However, the description occasionally drifts into static lists that stall momentum rather than driving the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    The "catacomb orchard" is vividly rendered, with specific details like roots lifting tombs and olives growing through ribcages. The setting actively constrains movement and charges the final image, integrating perfectly with the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the piece's strongest asset, offering vivid specificity with the "brass fixtures," "holographic storefronts," and "dust motes" of the arcade. The environment actively supports the tone, though it functions more as an atmospheric container than a source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is integral to the action; the Cobalt Dome and the eternal flame are not just backdrop but essential tools that constrain Vera's method (threading fire). The sensory details ("bruise against the sky," "midnight velvet") are vivid and create a cohesive atmosphere that supports the magical realism elements.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.5)
    The mangrove labyrinth provides a distinct atmospheric backdrop that physically constrains the character's movement (wading through water). However, the description leans on heavy-handed similes ("roots twisted like frozen screams") that occasionally obscure the immediacy of the setting with purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mist-clad atrium provides a distinct, claustrophobic atmosphere that mirrors the morphine haze. Specificity is generally good, though "mist-clad" leans into archaic description rather than sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    The atmospheric details ("crushed apple seeds," "centuries of fog-dampened decay") are vivid and specific, grounding the magical elements well. However, the setting's primary threat—the fog—remains a passive backdrop rather than an active constraint on the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "tidal arcade" and "weathered boardwalk" are rendered with specific, atmospheric detail that grounds the action. The environment actively shapes the pacing (tide clock) and the performance, creating a strong sense of place.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory details like "dew-slicked stones" and "wisteria hung heavy" grounding the scene. However, the juxtaposition of "unfamiliar constellations" with later references to Earth creates a slight world-building dissonance regarding the location.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is the story’s strongest asset; the prism atrium, mist, and dawn light actively constrain the protagonist’s realization.

The atmosphere is consistent, though it leans towards a static tableau.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.4)
    The atmosphere is consistent, blending the academic with the wild, though the "molecular structure" explanation clashes slightly with the mystical tone of "dreaming" walls. While vivid, the setting remains largely backdrop; the ivy and ruin do not actively constrain Mira's tactics or force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is vivid and colorful ("prism parapet," "violet shadows"), establishing a clear atmosphere. However, the descriptions lean toward the ornamental and crystalline, prioritizing visual beauty over tactile grounding or environmental resistance. The terrace functions as a stage, but the physical reality feels slightly ethereal, lacking the grit that would make the magical elements pop.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is vivid and functional, with the twin suns' alignment mirroring the negotiation's balance and the alien physiology (crystalline vs. dark-bodied) adding specific texture to the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting description is serviceable but relies on standard genre tropes ("crumbling ceiling," "filtered moonlight") without constraining the character's tactics. The environment yields to the protagonist immediately; the "abandoned palace" functions more as a backdrop than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "Soundless Sanctuary" is established with some atmospheric phrasing ("between heartbeats"), but the setting remains abstract and vague. The environment does not constrain the characters' choices or offer concrete resistance; it functions more as a metaphorical void than a grounded place where the action occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the fog-bound orchard and crystallized atmosphere creating a vivid, specific mood that grounds the magical elements. The detail of the fog being used as a chemical agent for silvering the mirrors is an excellent example of setting integration.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the juxtaposition of the quartz eyes hanging like fruit in an orchard-choked cathedral is vivid, specific, and thematically resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the "rain-washed foundry" and "liquid mercury" droplets creating a vivid, cohesive atmosphere. The environment effectively mirrors the internal state of the characters, though the specific geography of the foundry remains somewhat static during the alchemy.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.2)
    The ossuary canyon is an evocative setting that anchors the action, though the descriptions lean on standard fantasy tropes ("rose... like accusations"). The acoustic properties are established well enough to serve the plot, though the "refraction" is treated more as magic than physics.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting provides immediate, tangible pressure; the dissolving cables and tilting floor act as a functional clock that constrains Mira's actions. The imagery of the "acid sea" and "crystalline processors" is vivid, though the "gears and cogs" aesthetic leans heavily into genre standards without distinct particularity.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.3)
    The quay is established with grounded, lived-in details ("weathered rope," "every stone"), but the cave setting slips into stock imagery ("yawned like dark mouths," "phosphorescent algae") that lessens the atmosphere's specific impact.

Vivid sensory details ("salt-cracked palm," "churning gray waters") create a tactile reality that grounds the magical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    The initial setting of the dusty shop and the rising creek is tactile and atmospheric, grounding the stakes well. The transition to the "blooming cavern" leans on more generic fantasy descriptors ("impossible summer light," "crystalline pools") that lack the gritty specificity of the opening beats.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.3)
    Atmospheric detail is a standout strength, with specific imagery like "roses bloomed backwards" and "frozen fire" effectively externalizing the realm's unraveling. The contrasting environments of the cobalt and ember grottos create a vivid, tactile progression for the climb.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)

Details like the "green pools reflecting nothing" and the office acting as an "acoustic chamber" actively frame the character's internal state and the story's thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting consists of standard genre tropes ("silver branches," "glowing orbs," "strange, beautiful geometries") that lack sensory specificity or grit. While the "magnetic arbor" is a central concept, the description remains visual and abstract, missing the opportunity to ground the speculative elements in tactile or visceral details that would heighten the reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; details like the "titan-gear harness," "salt-metal tang," and the breathing atrium create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. The environment actively supports the metaphysical logic, though "metaphysical metals" leans slightly into abstract telling rather than sensory showing.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting effectively contrasts the sterile luxury bunker with the organic, mystical nature of the shell and cave. The environment directly enables the plot mechanics, though the "crystal cave" trope leans slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is atmospheric and purposeful; the "disused railway station" effectively mirrors Marcus's internal decay. Specific details like the "accordion bellows... more tape than leather" and the "Chronicle of Living Waters" add excellent texture. The sensory environment (ivy, dust, crumbling brick) consistently supports the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is atmospherically competent but relies on standard fantasy tropes (glowing amber light, mist, marble) that provide mood rather than constraint. The environment facilitates the protagonist's journey too easily, lacking the grit or specific resistance needed to ground the surrealism.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is atmospheric and specific, blending scientific instruments with "velvet" and "mulberry" sensory details effectively. The environment grounds the magical realism, though the "Thule" reference feels slightly generic compared to the specific observatory details.

    The setting is established with vivid, if slightly purple, imagery ("mist clung... like silk," "shadows pooled"). The verticality of the grotto and the spiraling floor are clear and grounding, though the atmosphere feels static and lacks interaction beyond the climbing.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.1)
    The lighthouse setting is well-integrated, particularly the use of the beam illuminating the shard to reveal the "gray spaces." The wind chimes serving as a divination tool is a strong, specific invention that bridges setting and plot, though phrases like "dawn threatens the horizon" lean toward standard description.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and functional; the magnetic grotto and floating platform physically constrain the characters (levitation, iron in blood) and mirror the thematic spiral. The environment actively shapes the "physics" of the lesson rather than serving merely as a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    The "canyon of endless echoes" and bone towers provide a distinct, physically constraining environment that is essential to the plot's acoustic logic. The sensory details—calcified remains, the warmth of the arrowhead—effectively ground the abstract premise of navigating time through sound.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and serves the theme well; the "automated creation engines" and "gardens of ice flowers" create a strong atmospheric contrast. The imagery of the "icebound spire" effectively grounds the surreal elements. Specific sensory details like the "frost-covered window" help anchor the more abstract magical concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.1)
    The atmospheric details of the sunken ship and the lantern-lit harbor are vivid and establish a specific mood. However, the spatial logic of a "sunken" library containing "ankle-deep brine" is slightly disorienting—it is unclear if the ship is surfaced, air-pocketed, or magical. The sensory work is strong but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("shades of copper and jade") rather than grounding the scene physically.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    The "ambered observatory" and "nothing-space" are vivid, specific constraints that ground the abstract premise. The sensory details—coins acting as anchors, crystallized walls—successfully externalize the metaphysical stakes and create a cohesive, distinct atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and integrates well with the plot, particularly the observatory lens and the atlas. Some descriptors trade physical grounding for abstract metaphor ("edges soft as grief"), which slightly diffuses the sensory immediacy of the object.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sapphire viaduct and the acoustic mechanics of the bell are rendered with distinct, grounded specificity. The setting actively enables the solution, moving beyond backdrop to become a necessary tool for the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    The atmospheric description of the "drowned town" is vivid and tactile ("rooftops emerged like ancient teeth," "silt"). The setting actively shapes the mood and serves as the primary antagonist to the official narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, establishing a strong mood of magical realism. However, descriptors like "defied botanical law" and "crystallize wonder" lean on abstraction rather than grounding the magic in concrete, sensory reality.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmospheric details are vivid, effectively blending the urban and the arcane ("whisper of paper," "scent of rain on hot pavement"). The setting acts as a thematic anchor, though the "magical pocket garden" trope is executed with somewhat standard imagery (glowing roots, ancient songs). Orientation is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sensory details like the "pull cord handles gleaming like teeth" and the acoustic frequencies establish a vivid, distinct atmosphere. However, the spatial logic—leaf blowers venting directly into a specific house's heating system via a tunnel—strains suspension of disbelief without establishing the rules of this reality early enough.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Atmospheric specificity is high; the "cherub's face cracked down the middle" and the "foreign architecture" of words create a vivid, cohesive world. The frozen environment effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal calcification, integrating setting with character state.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sensory details like "tears of mercury" and the superheated air establish a vivid atmosphere. The setting effectively pressures the protagonist physically, though the "crystalline formations" remain somewhat generic fantasy shorthand.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific sensory details like "rust dishes pointed skyward like a congregation of metal prophets" and "scent of mineral rain." The environment meaningfully constrains the action, as the perigee and the tower's height are physical necessities for the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "spectral grotto" and "sideways time" offer vivid, if slightly generic, speculative imagery. The setting provides atmosphere but does not meaningfully constrain the protagonist's tactical options or force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.5)
    The gallery setting is integral and used well to ground the abstract magic, with specific mentions of Penrose stairs and impossible triangles. However, descriptions occasionally drift into abstraction ("living equations") rather than remaining anchored in concrete, sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the piece's strongest asset, vividly integrating the physics of pressure with the navigation premise to constrain the method. Sensory details like the vibrating water and the "bioluminescent pearls" ground the abstract concept in concrete experience. The environment actively participates in the lesson, acting as more than a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.7)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with specific sensory details like the "copper taste" of interference and the "amber fragments" of light grounding the fantasy. The setting actively supports the tracking mechanics, though the description occasionally veers into purple prose ("cathedral of suspended gold").

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is rendered with excellent sensory specificity; "wan yellow pools" and "amber preservative" create a distinct, suffocating atmosphere. The environment actively constrains the protagonist, turning the ocean weight into a tangible antagonist that supports the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.3)
    The observatory setting is vivid and atmospherically rich, with the cold and snow palpably pressuring the scene. The use of the porcelain shard and spilled ink as essential tools grounds the abstract digital concept in specific, tactile reality, satisfying the micro-setting constraints effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptionally realized, with the "bone towers" and "tunnel of echoes" acting as essential constraints that shape the protagonist's method. The sensory details of the environment (wind in hollow chambers, metallic warmth) are inextricably bound to the plot's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, blending industrial and organic elements effectively (iron lattice, clockwork hearts). The locust shell functions beautifully as a micro-setting object that constrains and guides the protagonist's method. The atmosphere is consistent, though occasionally the description leans into abstraction ("translucent as forgotten summer") rather than concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "cobalt arcade" provides a vivid, if slightly static, atmospheric backdrop that anchors the mood effectively. However, the setting remains largely ornamental; it does not constrain Ezra’s choices or force a tactical shift, functioning more as a stage set for the "ruin porn" aesthetic than an active narrative force.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    The abandoned train setting is atmospheric and grounded in specific sensory details like "sawdust" and "warped boards." While the transition to the garden is vivid, the garden itself leans into generic magical imagery ("living willows," "trickling water") that feels less distinct than the train's rust and decay.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the non-Euclidean architecture actively constraining movement (aisle seven-and-a-half) and mirroring the theme. While the description occasionally drifts into abstraction ("smelled of... possibility"), the physical logic of the space is well-integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    The whispering archipelago and the specific light conditions at dawn are integral to the plot, constraining the magic effectively. The atmosphere is vivid, though relying occasionally on standard descriptors like "molten copper."

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting relies on generic magical realism tropes ("impossible angles," "ancient archway") that lack distinct sensory grounding. The atmosphere is disrupted by jarring anachronistic metaphors ("fiber optic cable," "DNA") that clash with the established fable-like tone of "forgotten quarters" and candlelight-era trades.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is excellent; the "broken constellations" etched into the greenhouse glass are a specific, high-concept detail that constrains the protagonist's investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.5)
    The "Sky Archive" is a vivid, high-concept setting that effectively grounds the story's fantastical elements. Sensory details like "digital static" and "luminescent graffiti" bridge the organic and digital realms well, though the setting functions more as a backdrop than a source of constraints that pressure the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the sensory details of the freezing elevator and the brass fixtures grounding the scene effectively. The environment pressures the physical experience (cold, altitude), though the transition to the "warm" interior of the ending feels slightly abrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integral to the plot; the "phantom geology" and the specific vantage of the tethered-then-untethered gondola ground the magical realist elements effectively. The environment actively shapes the protagonist's perspective and the story's mood.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmospheric detailing is the story's strength, effectively grounding the reader in the "antique airship" and the visual of the starlings. The sensory environment is vivid, though the "dusty hopscotch board" feels slightly too convenient a prop rather than a natural part of the vessel's geography.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.1)
    The frozen library is vividly rendered with specific sensory details like "crystalline cathedral" and "stellar frost," effectively establishing atmosphere. While immersive, the setting functions more as a static container for the quest than an active environment that constrains choices.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    Visuals are vivid ("crimson sky," "floating stone arches"), providing a distinct backdrop. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric; the "floating" nature of the arches does not constrain tactical choices or pressure the blight narrative in a mechanical way.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    The atmospheric work is excellent, effectively using the "bruised plum" lighting and the "edge of everything" location to ground the abstract concepts. The setting acts as a constraint, focusing the narrative on the lens and the light.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.4)
    The central image of the coral pavilion beneath the desert is distinct and memorable, grounding the surreal premise. However, description often leans into abstraction ("monument to stored remorse," "crystallized time") rather than concrete sensory details that anchor the reader in the physical moment. The setting drives the plot well, but the sensory execution is occasionally purple.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    The juxtaposition of an astronomical clock tower against a prairie landscape provides a distinct, vivid anchor. Sensory details are generally effective, though occasionally lean into purple prose ("hush of borrowed starlight"). The setting supports the fable-like tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with the "submarine graveyard" providing strong, specific imagery (rust, canyon walls, periscope). The environment anchors the tone effectively, though the focus remains visual; more tactile interaction with the harshness of the canyon could have grounded the ethereal sci-fi elements.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    The atmospheric details of the grotto and the "clandestinely luminous" ink are vivid, establishing a strong tone. However, spatial confusion arises during the gravity inversion: describing stalactites as "hung like fangs from what had become the floor" creates a contradictory image (things do not hang from a floor), which disrupts the otherwise immersive physics of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.5)
    The sensory details of the "frozen sound waves" and the porcelain insulator are vivid and grounding, effectively establishing the atmosphere. The "siskin alder grove" feels distinct and lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and picturesque, integrating the "floating stone" logic into the theme of memory and gravity. The imagery ("cherry blossoms fell upward") effectively supports the dream-like tone, though it occasionally feels more decorative than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sensory mapping concept effectively transforms the setting into a dynamic force, grounding abstract dimension-hopping in concrete, synesthetic details. The shifting states of the repair bay—fungal, pristine, underwater—are handled with excellent specificity and economy.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is atmospheric and consistent ("phosphorescent foam," "breathing stairs"), though it leans on standard lighthouse tropes. The sensory details effectively establish the mood, even if the "pulsing" sea glass veers into ungrounded magical realism.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Emerald Lighthouse and glass lantern wick are vivid, grounding anchors that support the abstract magical logic. The "newspaper ship" is a standout specific detail that successfully textures the setting. However, the reliance on abstract concepts ("dimensions," "frequencies") occasionally unmoors the scene from concrete sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and integrates well with the narrative logic; the "woven light" and "floating rock" establish the genre quickly. The tea house veranda serves as an effective, contained stage for the interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.7)
    The cave setting is rendered with vivid sensory details ("smell" of paint, "braille" of stone), effectively isolating the protagonist. However, descriptors like "cathedral of stone" and "geode's heart" lean toward familiar clichés that dampen the atmosphere's uniqueness.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    The "breathing leaves" as writing surface is an excellent, constraining detail that anchors the resource scarcity concretely. The atmospheric details of the "dead zones" and the greenhouse city effectively pressure the protagonist. The setting is not just backdrop but active in the logic of the communication breakdown.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, establishing the "stone finger" and the cloud-sea with strong sensory details. The environment feels cohesive, though the mechanics of the tower remain somewhat abstract in their interaction with the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting details are vivid and purposeful, particularly the visual descriptions of the burning fears ("amber," "silver," "violet"). The dome environment acts as a necessary pressure cooker for the events. The distinction between the synthetic soil and the pulsing, organic roots provides excellent texture.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.1)
    The courtyard setting is anchored well with sensory details like basil and hopscotch squares. However, the description serves as a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker that constrains the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)

The sensory environment effectively mirrors the thematic focus on the "living" nature of inanimate structures, grounding the metaphysical concept in concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "velvet garden" is established with consistent atmospheric details ("purple blooms," "perfume of forgotten summers"), anchoring the scene effectively. However, the description occasionally leans into abstraction ("dying light," "twilight's embrace") rather than concrete, tactile interaction that constrains the protagonist's movement.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is rendered with high sensory specificity ("frost-glazed apertures," "jade shadows") that effectively creates a hushed, reverent atmosphere.

    The setting is vivid and functionally constraining; the contrast between the radioactive dust storm and the orchard's stillness directly pressures the protagonist's choice. While effective, some descriptors (&quot;perpetual twilight,&quot; &quot;radioactive dust storms&quot;) rely on genre shorthand rather than specific, textured observation.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the cobalt glass portico is not just scenery but a filter that colors perception and action. The specific sensory details ("cerulean shadows," "clouds speaking binary") ground the high-concept premise effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "feral loft" and "sound jars" offer distinct, evocative imagery that grounds the opening effectively. However, the setting often dissolves into romanticized abstraction ("speechless tides") rather than maintaining tactile pressure on the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "drift-ice marina" is distinct, tactile, and integral to the plot. Sensory details like the "frozen metal" and the "honey and blood" sunset ground the ethereal elements effectively. The environment actively constrains the action and necessitates the specific solution.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is the story’s strongest asset; the specific geology of basalt and ice acts as a hard constraint on the ritual’s timing and method. Sensory details are vivid ("glazed with ice," "meteorite iron") and strictly filtered through the protagonist's technical expertise. The environment actively drives the plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sensory details of the tunnel and the lantern are vivid and specific; the environment effectively mirrors the thematic breakthrough (rain ending the drought) and grounds the spiritual elements.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is integral to the action; the tools, dust motes, and "gears smaller than rice grains" ground the abstract emotional work in physical labor. The atmosphere effectively mirrors the internal state, though the lighting effects are somewhat standard.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.5)
    The "gears-and-cogs workshop" and "acid sea" are rendered with vivid, specific imagery that grounds the mechanical fable effectively. The environment provides clear physical stakes (dissolution), though the climax slightly undercuts the established threat by neutralizing the acid's danger too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "between floors" setting effectively grounds the surreal premise, and the atmosphere of the server farm is rendered with sensory precision, though the "shadow network" remains spatially vague.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    The juxtaposition of the blooming orchard against the grinding ice floes is vivid and specifically rendered, grounding the magical realism effectively. The sensory details ("polished copper," "tarnished hand mirror") successfully anchor the abstract concepts in physical artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is atmospheric and impactful, with the "frozen cemetery" and the sonic details of the breaking ice creating strong immersion. The parasol tip functions excellently as a micro-setting object, though the "insects in amber" simile is a tired choice that detracts slightly from the otherwise specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.3)
    The "amber pavilion" and autumn vineyard are established with vivid, if slightly repetitive, sensory detail ("amber light" appears twice in key spots). The setting anchors the mood well, though it functions more as an atmospheric backdrop than a source of constraint or tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.0)
    The "kinetic parapet" and "murmuring pavilion" provide a distinct visual anchor, establishing a solid high-fantasy atmosphere. However, the reliance on repetitive proper nouns ("murmuring pavilion" appears three times) creates a static backdrop rather than an evolving environment that pressures choices.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sensory details like "rusted factory bones" and "soot and steam" establish a vivid atmosphere. However, the setting serves primarily as a backdrop rather than a constraint; the spatial logistics of the spiral and the ruins do not force difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is atmospheric and strictly controlled; the "shadowed library" and "breath fogging glass" create a vivid tactile constraint. The crystal functions as an excellent micro-setting, refracting the room and grounding the magical realism in specific sensory details like "impossible colors."

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and thematically integrated; the "fog sculptures" mirroring the protagonist's memory loss is a standout conceit. The environment feels tactile ("salt-weathered wood," "magnetic ribbons"), though the "driftwood labyrinth" functions more as set dressing than a true spatial constraint on the characters' movement.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptional; the observatory is not just a backdrop but a constrained physical system (cables, rotation, glass) that generates the conflict. The integration of the "time threads" into the physical space of the station anchors the metaphysical stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.5)
    The rooftop garden is established with effective sensory details like the "soft percussion of morning" and the rustling bamboo. However, the atmosphere relies partly on abstract labels like "the scent of hope," which weakens the physical specificity of the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, utilizing the "nocturnal observatory" and "floating isle" not just as backdrops but as essential tools for the plot. The imagery of shadows falling upward and the machinery of the automaton grounds the magical concepts in concrete sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    The garden is vividly realized, blending the physical (jasmine, moss) with the magical (shifting changeling features) to mirror the "impossible blooms." The setting effectively constrains the mood and reflects the hybrid nature of the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    The serpentine grotto is realized with vivid, if sometimes florid, sensory detail ("liquid starlight," "sparkled with moisture"). The setting meaningfully enables the solution through its acoustic/amplification properties, integrating environment with plot mechanics effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    The juxtaposition of the sterile server room and the organic moss is vivid and well-anchored, particularly the specific detail of the ice patterns on rack C-7. This environmental constraint grounds the metaphor in a tangible reality, elevating the atmospheric quality significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    The "feral nexus" is atmospherically strong, with vivid surrealist details like water flowing uphill establishing the rules of the world. The setting effectively mirrors the internal state. A weakness is the reliance on "poetic" abstractions ("sculptures of rust and rebellion") which distance the reader from the sensory reality of the place.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is vividly described with sensory details like "bruised" skies and "dried coils," establishing a clear atmosphere. However, the environment serves mostly as a passive backdrop for the ritual rather than providing constraints that force the protagonist to improvise or suffer.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptional, with the "inverted" orchard and subarctic crater acting as active constraints on the ritual rather than just backdrop. The specific physical details (frozen apple cores, downward branches) ground the magical elements convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the marble cavern and sunlight are not just backdrop but active tools in Mara's method (camera obscura). The physical properties of the space—light, acoustics, and mineral composition—meaningfully constrain and enable her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    The "bronze grotto" is excellent, integrating acoustics ("shingled hush") with the magic system to physically constrain Mara’s orientation. The specificity of "17 grams" grounds the metaphysical concept in a tactile, high-cost reality.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    "The tiger turned wrong" is a brilliant, economical backstory detail that instantly grounds the circus context. The sensory environment of the loft—rain, wood scent, boiling water—is vivid and constrains the moment well.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Kinetic Lagoon is a standout element, blending mechanical decay with atmospheric magic in a way that directly constrains the plot. The specific utility of the water memory and the disposable camera wheel anchors the abstract concept in tactile, scavenger-focused reality. The vertical orientation (three miles up) is maintained well.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is atmospheric with vivid details like the "neon afterglow" and "cracked terrazzo," establishing a strong mood. However, the mechanism of the setting relies on "telling" the complexity ("equations far more complex than mere plumbing") rather than showing how the environment physically constrains the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and active; the "whispering" crystals and light refraction effectively mirror Elara's internal state. The sensory detail is specific and purposeful, grounding the abstract emotional conflict in the physical environment.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is well-anchored, with the twilight and canal providing meaningful atmosphere. The use of the sundial as a micro-setting—catching the bridge’s reflection to create an "impossible shadow"—effectively charges the physical space with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with the "oceanic hush" and tactile details of the weathered rope grounding the reader effectively. The specific interplay of fog, snow, and the "golden dock" creates a cohesive, meditative mood.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.3)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with rich sensory details ("crimson weft," "incense smoke") firmly grounding the abstract concept. The "shadowed garden" serves as an effective, moody container for the projection mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.9)
    The suspended palace offers a striking visual anchor, but the description relies heavily on steampunk shorthand ("clockwork hearts," "pistons and gears") rather than fresh, specific sensory details. The setting serves the plot but feels like standard genre furniture.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with the "obsidian lagoon" and "black sand" providing strong tactile grounding for the ritual. However, the description occasionally drifts into abstraction ("breathed beneath the dunes") that distances the reader from the physical reality of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is imaginative and visually distinct, particularly the image of the frozen geese and the dry fountains. However, the description often relies on abstract "tell" metaphors ("viscous as amber," "temporal residue") rather than concrete, grounded sensory details that constrain the character's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "nebula garden" is established with vivid, if somewhat conventional, sensory details ("crimson light," "translucent form"). The use of the "calculating machine gear" as a specific, tactile anchor in an otherwise abstract setting is a strength, grounding the ethereal environment. However, the vastness of the setting dilutes spatial urgency, and the "cosmic gardener" trope relies heavily on familiar imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    The greenhouse setting is vivid and atmospheric, with details like "iron bones black against the salmon sky" and the clustering monarchs grounding the scene beautifully. The sensory details of the stone carving—grain, dust, temperature—are integrated well with the action, enhancing the "fiercely meditative" mood.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "obsidian ridge" and "saltwater mist" provide a distinct, atmospheric grounding. However, the physical description of "microscopic inscriptions" on a "splintered" rake handle strains credibility—splintered wood cannot hold microscopic detail, creating a jarring image artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cobalt silo and "midnight roses" establish a vivid, specific atmosphere that anchors the fable-like tone. The physical constraint of the silo and the lighting conditions (starlight, magnifying lamp) effectively shape the scene's intimacy.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting of the Obsidian Spire and the "ignorance maps" creates a distinct, atmospheric aesthetic that suits the fable-like tone. However, the meeting room itself is vague, and the physical environment ceases to pressure the characters once the Council arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.0)
    The "ember alcove" and the constraint of the radio dial's amber light create a vivid, intimate atmosphere that grounds the magical elements effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong atmospheric specificity anchors the piece; the charcoal ash, the ventilation system, and the "shattered porcelain" mask create a vivid, tactile environment. The borderland setting effectively frames the gallery's liminal nature, grounding the magical realism in concrete details.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integral; the "drowned ruins" and "green-tinted water" create a tangible atmosphere that pressures the characters. The physical details of the electrical tape and the brass cog ground the scene effectively, making the environment an active participant in the story.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "velvet library" and the specific tactility of the zither create a cohesive, atmospheric setting that suits the tone. While the "autumn/rain" simile is a touch ornamental, the physical grounding of the instruments and the fading light effectively mirrors the thematic decay and renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.1)
    The "rust blooming into synapses" is a striking, specific image that effectively grounds the neural metaphor in the setting. However, generic nomenclature like "Ministry of Forgetting" and "knowledge fruit" flattens the world-building into standard dystopian tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is excellent, with sensory details like "nectar-sweet air" and "warm copper" effectively grounding the speculative elements. The tower's verticality and isolation are well-utilized to constrain the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting details—specifically the migrating furniture and the hush of the bay—effectively ground the magical realism, though the "liminal hour" description feels slightly generic compared to the specific imagery of the objects.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with specific details like the "foxglove-stained glass ampoule" and "kelp forests thread" grounding the scene. The underwater environment actively constraints the interaction and charges the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting acts as both antagonist and constraint, satisfying the high-band requirement where environment dictates choice. The sensory details—from the "chip in the corner" to the specific "step eight million"—ground the abstract mathematical prison in tactile reality. The "pip bleeding into dimensional space" is a vivid, genre-appropriate image that bridges the physical and the theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sensory details are vivid ("saffron-tinted," "silver lattices"), creating a cohesive atmosphere. However, the setting serves as a backdrop rather than a pressure cooker; the "smog" and "greenhouse" contrast is static and does not force trade-offs or constrain the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset. The specificity of the bread initials and the olfactory cue of rosewater preceding destruction creates a vivid, tangible atmosphere that constrains the character's options effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and active; the "water dripping backward" and the "tide pulling away" effectively ground the surreal mechanics in physical reality. The lighthouse feels like a pressure cooker, and the atmospheric details actively support the theme of reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is a strong point; "bioluminescent mold" and "sweet rot mixed with ozone" create a vivid, repulsive allure that grounds the surreal logic. The setting actively pressures the protagonist via the mirrors and the sensory assault, effectively charging the final image of the closing eye.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is imaginatively integrated into the plot; the orchard is not just a backdrop but the instrument of salvation. Sensory details are vivid ("salt-kissed branches," "blue hour"), and the physical constraints of the driftwood raft directly shape the protagonist's actions and the story's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is rendered with specific, tactile details like "calcified stairs," "barnacle-crusted borders," and "acoustic architecture" that ground the high-fantasy concept. The physical reality of the shell-city effectively pressures the protagonist's movement and choices.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is evocative, with the ivy-wrapped station serving as a fitting backdrop for the themes of decay and hidden history. However, the functionality of the telegraph key within a ruin contradicts the established atmosphere of abandonment, creating a dissonance between atmosphere and plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and functions as an active constraint; the rising water and "dying" building directly pressure the protagonist's movement and access. Sensory details like "verdigris" and "brackish water" strongly ground the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is not just backdrop but an active participant; the acoustics of the "singing" books and the specific wavelength of the algae light act as essential tools that constrain and enable the protagonist's actions. The interplay between the "reclaimed stillness" and the protagonist's task is seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmosphere is evocative and consistent, effectively using light and glass imagery to support the theme. However, the setting relies on familiar high-fantasy tropes (floating isles, crystallized memories) without subverting them or adding gritty, tactile specificity beyond the visual.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    The observatory setting is functional and well-integrated, specifically the elevation detail justifying the "thinner boundary." However, the sensory experience of "floating" is told more than felt; the environment feels largely like a standard lab until the window view at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    The observatory setting is vivid and distinct, with the movable-type floor serving as an excellent, tactile integration of the "missing pieces" concept. The twilight atmosphere is rendered with specific sensory details ("copper light," "purple shadows") that support the tone, though the thermal imaging aspect stretches credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is atmospheric and specific, with the driftwood carvings serving as effective micro-setting elements that constrain attention. The "cobalt terrace" is vivid, though the name feels slightly abstract; the sensory details of the carvings ground the scene well.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is atmospheric and strictly functional, mirroring the internal state of the characters ("neutral territory," "mist"). The drawer pull acts as a strong micro-setting element that anchors the dialogue. The sensory details are evocative, though occasionally verge on purple ("furrowed hush").

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    The utility poles serve as a strong, specific micro-setting that constrains the navigation and grounds the concept. While the poles are effective, the "lifting fog" and general coastal descriptions lean on familiar pathetic fallacy tropes rather than sensory freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.1)
    The bioluminescent cathedral is vividly described and functional, though the imagery leans on familiar tropes ("alien light," "swallowed him whole"). The bridges responding to intention offers a nice integration of setting and character state.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is integral; the Everbloom Orchard and the specific, rare spices ("void-pepper," "temporal saffron") function as tools that constrain and enable the ritual. The sensory details are vivid and specific, grounding the cosmic concepts in tactile experience.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    The atmospheric details of the "midnight glade" and "silver grass" are vivid and consistent, effectively establishing a distinct magical reality. The saucer serves as an excellent micro-setting/tool, grounding the ethereal concepts in a tangible object.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.5)
    The specific imagery of the tears on photographs and the patchwork hull establishes a strong, melancholic atmosphere. The physical mechanics of the ship (gravity linked to emotion) ground the metaphysical concepts effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sensory details are vivid and specific (orange veins of lava, crunching black sand), grounding the metaphysical transformation in physical texture. The setting actively pressures the climax, serving as the crucible for the protagonist's change.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.8)
    There is a distracting inconsistency in lighting logic. The opening describes the object reflecting "luminous fort... walls like captured fire" in "twilight," yet the premise relies on a "blackout" and "moonless dark" where the sundial casts "no shadow." This creates spatial disorientation regarding visibility and the passage of time within the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    Atmospherically strong, but the central premise ("frictionless age") lacks tactile consistency. Yann manipulates stones and stands on a bluff without addressing the immense physical difficulty of doing so without friction (traction, grip). The setting feels more like a magical backdrop than a world governed by the stated physical change.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.2)
    Exceptional integration of setting; the observatory is not just a backdrop but the engine of the story's central metaphor and physical action (light-writing). The contrast between the storm below and the stars above actively charges the final image, meeting the high-band criteria for setting utility.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "danish tin sewing needle card" offers nice specificity, but the "light trails" drawn by the mechanical arm clash with the established low-tech, tactile aesthetic. The setting describes rather than pressures the action.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.3)
    The rusted shipping container library provides a vivid, atmospheric backdrop ("open to stars," "water-damaged books") that suits the tone. However, the setting functions primarily as set dressing; it does not constrain the protagonist's choices or offer tactical resources beyond the books themselves. Sensory details are specific but occasionally lean toward cliché ("liquid silver").

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    The "tidal arbor" with calcified coral roots is a strikingly original setting that grounds the surrealism physically. Sensory details like the "yellowed key" and "silver halide emulsion" are specific and vivid, effectively building the atmosphere required for the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is atmospheric, with the ghost orchids serving as a functional micro-setting that mirrors the theme of ephemeral reality. While the atmosphere is strong, specific cultural details (starlight tea, whale-bone harps) lean toward generic fantasy tropes rather than unique, gritty particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    The atmosphere is vivid and specific, effectively using the "rain-washed" islet and the "green smell" to ground the scene. The sensory details of the lace and the "weathered porch" create a strong tactile sense of place that supports the melancholic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Storm-wrecked greenhouse is vivid, selective, and evolves: cracked glass drips, mold advances, seeds sprout. The butterfly dust functions as micro-setting—its accumulating patterns constrain her methodology and charge the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean as contractors and scientists arrive.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Canyon walls, frost crystals, burnt paper edges, and starlight are filtered through glass-maker’s eye—each tactile detail later constrains her choice to forsake radioactive glow for transient frost-light. The micro-setting (charred ledger against stone) doubles as tool and mirror. Spatial choreography is clean; frost patterns track logically from night to dawn. One demerit: “luminous glass” is referenced but not physically handled in the scene, keeping it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Winterglass walls refract aurora into “prismatic symphonies,” a visual metaphor that replaces unheard music; the 62 Hz floor hum is felt, not heard, keeping sensory balance. Conservatory layout stays coherent—monitor, vines, cloudberry cluster—each surface handled (fork pressed to glass, tablet keyed). The setting’s cold transparency literalizes her auditory void and supplies the thermal canvas that charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Sensory selection mirrors insomnia: brine reek, humming glass, “breathable grief” bubble—every detail is filtered through undertaker bias and occupation tools. The underwater library’s spatial logic (floating books, coral mausoleums) is tactile and consistent; bodies track cleanly as Silas installs funereal architecture. Lens and salt-water rituals constrain later tactics and charge the final “shadow of earned sleep” image. No static postcard lists; each descriptor advances stakes or mood.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    Terra-cotta arbor and silver bell function as micro-setting: they constrain when and how anonymity can occur; the ridge vantage frames both exposure and concealment. Sensory selection is urgent—weathered columns, gentle toll—never touristic. Spatial choreography is clean; the cart’s path and doorstep drops track across months. Final image recharges the arbor as marketplace of dignity, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    The twilight viaduct, wisteria, and brass-bound camera create a tactile micro-setting that constrains movement to one arch and dictates the breathing tempo. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a photographer notices inverted light, salt crystallised on glass, purple petals as “sparks.” The compressed-starlight door evolves logically from the camera’s ground-glass image—tool becomes portal—so the final image is charged by the environment itself. Occasional soft phrases (“like a prayer written in stone”) flirt with familiar grandeur, but most metaphors are specific to bridges, blooms, and lenses.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    The living bridge garden is not backdrop but active constraint: vines “recognize” her, walkways torque into 4-D passages, and the oldest oak roots physically cradle the halo shard. Hyperbolic geometry is rendered through tactile motion—she steps, the bridge pulses, gravity skews—so topology shapes tactics. The fragment’s micro-setting (palm-warm, sugar-dissolving) charges the final image when its residue lingers as “faint luminescence.” Environment, tool, and body converge to force her final renunciation; remove any one and the crystalline ending collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Redemption-center detritus is filtered through utilitarian attention: teddy-bear bellies as silos, snow-globes as nitrogen flasks. Micro-setting (the piano bench) doubles as both cipher-text and work-bench, constraining the single feasible tactic. Light, dust, and chain-sound layer economically; no tourist catalogue. The closing desert horizon evolves from prior concrete floor, sustaining spatial coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sunken greenhouse, salt-corroded forge, and hull-splitting wrecks are not backdrop but pressurizing tools: the forge heats, the ships groan against the frame, the waterlogged trees limit movement. Micro-setting (forge anvil) literally brands the aid with absence. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elena’s synesthetic bias—color always arrives as sound. Spatial choreography survives the vertical descent from glass roof to pressurized chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Emerald-tiled walls, moss, battery spotlights, and moonlit jar form tactile micro-setting that guides access and frames final silver splash on wall; constrains choice by limiting light sources. Sensory hierarchy favors visual texture, but scent of orchids and tactile coolness of tile slip through POV bias. World rule (light-bottling) learned via action, not dump. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible positions. Recurring object—moonbeam jar—charges closure image. Meets 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    The control-room-as-studio is rendered through tactile specifics: glass shards swept with “deliberate ceremony,” ice water pooling over toppled warning signs. The bookmark’s cracked leather and the torch’s blue heart constrain Marina’s choices—she must work slowly, one breath at a time, or the glass fractures. Micro-setting (the emergency shutdown button) charges the final image when a sphere rests there, trading catastrophe for second chances. Environmental mirroring (ice surrendering to warmth) tracks the heart’s thaw without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.6)
    Rusted library under star-holes is sketched with selective decay details (“rain eaten through steel and ambition”) that mirror interior corrosion. The shell as micro-setting constrains the final move, qualifying for 9+ gate, though spatial choreography is thin during the two-handed shell touch. Sensory hierarchy favors metallic chill and paper rot, keeping description tethered to Marcus’s tactile caution. Environment could have supplied one more obstacle (footing, falling shelf) to tighten escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Storm-tossed ridge fort, crumbling parapet, and flaking booklet are tactile, specific, and filter through the oracle’s monk-like attention. Weather and ruin directly shape her access to the sky and her isolation. Final image of descending worn steps echoes the booklet’s disintegration, charging the closure. Meets 9- gate: setting constrains her vigil and recharges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    The frozen courtyard functions as micro-setting: minus-twelve tiles constrain every motion, ice crystals dictate the violin’s physical logic, and the mop bucket becomes an extension of Seven’s body. Atmosphere is filtered through janitor priorities—temperature, surface friction, circular path—so environment actively shapes choice. The final image of sublimating violin crystallizes the reconfiguration. Gate satisfied: tool (violin) charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.6)
    The forecourt’s acoustic mirror and quartz pillars actively shape the scene: whispers become music, confessions resonate larger than voices. The projector lens functions as micro-setting; its scratched surface and light-catching flaws physically constrain how they view each other and the past. Rain puddles and mist droplets supply tactile immediacy and mirror motif. Final image—lens collecting equal rain and moonlight—charges closure by embodying the new transparent/distorted equilibrium.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    Garden maze is not backdrop; its copper-wire spiral physically commemorates victories and constrains Marta’s ritual path. Body-as-setting appears in “gnarled fingers,” tactile handling of marbles, and the act of polishing—objects that charge the final gift. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound: she hears hedgerows “whisper,” feels cracks “sharp,” ignores visual panorama. Weather is absent by deliberate selectivity—this is a woman who listens to leaves, not skies.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    Sensory triad—amber starlight, frost forming on warm metal, alien wings at rest—creates a vivid micro-setting that directly enables the holographic trick. The “magnetic nexus at twilight” functions as both tool and temporal key, constraining Ira’s single decisive action. Spatial choreography is clean: lever, workstation, containment fields track without drift. Economy flags only in repeated “icy warmth” phrases; otherwise detail is selective and filtered through Ira’s engineer gaze.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Flooded pit, lantern reflections, and floating violin case create tactile micro-setting that constrains every move—Marcus must play with instrument aloft, the water itself becomes resonator. Sensory hierarchy is violinist-specific: acoustics, bow weight, ink bleed. The final dry program is a re-weighted object that could only exist after immersion; setting directly charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mountain station functions as micro-setting: the magnetometer’s needle and condensation-curled paper directly constrain her choices. Sensory triangulation (thin air, frost, condensation) mirrors internal altitude-sickness of truth. Aurora as environment touches the final image, charging it. No spatial contradictions; tools (barometer, anemometer) are handled tactilely.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tunnel’s sweating brick, rusted junction box, and oxidized valve are tactile, selective, and filtered through Marcus’s explorer gaze. Radio static acts as a sonic extension of setting, tightening the space. The beaded valve wheel functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice; its oxidized surface and rosary DNA charge the closing image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible moves. Slight cap at 8.1 because environment could have pressed physically harder (air quality, claustrophobia) to raise stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is protagonist: book-soil, river-time, origami-map. Micro-objects (swan creases, basin, reed mat) constrain ritual action and resurface in the final reprise, passing 9+ gate. Sensory triage favours tactile and acoustic green darkness; visual data is rationed to match monkish focus. Space is stable, no geography drift; world rules (pages → soil → ferns) stay consistent and causally active.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sage Ridge functions as micro-setting: wind direction decides the curl’s upward spiral; temperature drop cues the flute note. Sensory hierarchy is mother-biased: she notices root-hum, copper sheen, child’s tear in that order. The sage scent and corona light mirror internal shift from clinging to open hand. Spatial choreography holds: envelope, flute, daughter’s hand track across eclipse phases without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Silo-library is tactile—fingers on scorched diary edges, breath misting cold paper-air—every detail filters through Thrain’s echo-navigation. The fireplace as micro-setting supplies the decisive diary fragment that triggers axis insight. Spatial choreography clean on spiral ascent. Environment constrains final choice: only within these walls can echoes survive the bronze quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    Skeleton Rock is rendered through salt-stained windows, lighthouse rhythm, and cookie dead-drops; every detail is filtered by Chen’s professional eye for hidden messages. The lighthouse beam functions as both tool and metronome, constraining his writing tempo and final exit. Spatial choreography is clean: corner table to open door, no drift. Micro-setting (microdot specs) charges the closing image, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cathedral acoustics, loop pedal, and palette function as micro-setting; the nave’s exact center literally constrains where Marcus can stand and where the woman floats. The stones’ resonance is returned in the final “ghost of loops,” charging the last image and meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Glass spire, frozen lake, and nautilus segment function as micro-setting that constrains—light frequencies force narrowed perception, shell chambers dictate memory mapping. Selective sensory hierarchy (visual glare, bone-level sound) mirrors POV bias. Mirror-horizon folds at closure, recharging every prior image. Minor slip: “beach that didn’t exist yet” is briefly disorienting before pattern is confirmed.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    Bioluminescent moss, anti-gravity pathway, and rain-smell ground the world in sensory specificity; the viaduct’s color shift from amber to sickly green mirrors Kira’s internal decay. The tablet’s impossible mass and the procedural bridge morphology act as kinetic setting-objects that constrain tactics—floating is obligatory until integration. Spatial choreography stays crisp across the dissolve-and-rebuild mechanic. The final footfall on stone gives the environment a conclusive role, clearing the 9-micro gate.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Drum-maker cavern is not postcard scenery: its acoustic properties and residue of “a thousand stretched skins” directly enable the reversed-song experiment. Stone temperature, copper-wire jury-rig, beeswax scent are filtered through Lucia’s professional priorities (vibration, material resonance). Micro-setting (broken needle) constrains every tactical choice; final image recharges it. Spatial choreography clean—no floating props; phonograph placement at center is referenced against floor and walls.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    The courtyard, fountain, and instruments function as micro-setting: the anemometer cups spinning “lazily” mirror her outward calm while the hidden compartment of the tube reweights the same space from sanctuary to espionage site. Weather tools constrain every choice—she calibrates by lamplight, decides on new stations—so the 9+ quick test is met. Selective sensory detail (amber light, pigeon body-warmth) keeps economy tight.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    The greenhouse is not backdrop but instrument: spectral root systems and lantern glass constrain every move; the ultraviolet lamp is a tool that literally reveals hidden stakes. Sensory selection is POV-driven—Elara notices light spectra, resinous molecules, dying-star photons—never tourist-catalog. The final image of crystal shadows lengthening charges closure by marrying setting body and object: she is the greenhouse now. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible distances or prop drift.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Terra-cotta grit, pulsing amber light, and hemp oil scent are filtered through Marcus’s synesthetic poet-sense, never tourist catalog. The grotto’s clay walls literally guide his palm and later vibrate, turning setting into tactile tool. Spatial choreography is clean: palm on wall → rope in hand → starlight at exit, all tracked without drift. Micro-setting triumphs: the rope’s fiber texture becomes the clock, the moral compass, and the final sacrament laid down.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sunken greenhouse plus shipwreck skeletons is not postcard scenery; the amphitheater of “glass and brine” literally shapes the music’s harmonic, constraining where notes can travel. Ash, seawater, cracked panes, and warped reeds return as tactile obstacles, charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mara’s ear-centric POV—she hears “melodies in the spaces between sounds” before she sees faces. Idiom is consistent and spatial choreography clear as people gather without crowding the acoustic pocket.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    The amber grotto is not backdrop; its daily liquefaction window literally enables the harvest and imposes the ticking clock. Static-charged air, crystalline walls, and the blotter petal’s color shifts are filtered through Vera’s dealer-eye, turning setting into tool. Micro-setting (the petal, her satchel, the carved steps) tracks cleanly across beats. Final image of the sealed grotto mirrors Vera’s self-sealed heart, charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    The roofless, star-lit library is the star: tarps, lanterns, shelves under open sky—concrete, atmospheric, and it literally frames the final image. Maritime details (Pier 74 vs 47, nautical charts) are accurate but briefly sketched. Weather is used (breeze, stars) to mirror emotional widening. Micro-setting (locket) charges closure; environment constrains choice when Martha teaches navigation beneath constellations. Texture is selective, never touristy.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Crystalline fruit catching fire, obsidian dust on fingers, and marsh reeds bending like lullabies create tactile micro-setting that charges the final arbor image. The crater lake’s moonlit pool is returned to at closure, spatial choreography is flawless, and the orchard constrains movement (slippery glass under bare feet). Environment is not just backdrop; it supplies the very material of art and reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rooftop canals, temporal residue thickness, and Morteus’s architecture constrain every move; canal directionality reversal in final paragraph recharges the setting image. Micro-objects—pendant, pencil, crystalline tubes—are handled, not merely observed. Sensory hierarchy obeys illustrator’s eye: color of extinct wings, snore-ripples in water. Spatial choreography survives rooftop parkour; no floating rooms.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Cavern orchard constrains every move: mineral darkness dictates nocturnal timing, limestone water feeds memory-laden apples, stalactite drip sets the sub-audible hum that signals activation. The mosaic stepping stone’s chipped constellations are the literal interface for the equation—remove it and the climax collapses.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    The copper pipe and ventilation grate micro-setting constrain every tactical move; the library’s dawn light and failing fluorescents charge the final sapphire hush image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Edgar hears sighs through ducts, feels pipe warmth fade, sees oxide glint—selection mirrors his attenuated world. Spatial choreography is flawless across grate, shelf, and crawl space.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mossy trellis and rain act as micro-setting: the glowing moss conducts electricity that enables the final merge, charging the last image. Sensory detail is selective (glistening leaf, sparking moss) and filtered through Marcus’s botanist gaze. Meets 9+ gate; only minor over-description of gravel droplets keeps it sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tidal causeway itself—appearing only twice daily—forces the transaction into a lethal window; its barnacled stones bruise Mara’s sleepless feet, body-level feedback. Rain trails function as micro-map and clock: silver veins that “blur as moisture seeps upward,” cueing the returning tide. The glass jar’s clarity against her chest in the last paragraph recharges the earlier image of “clear as forgotten sky,” bonding object to final stance. Threshold Island’s solitude is not scenic; it literally strips the characters down to one bartered relic and one future painting, so environment charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.5)
    The cave is not backdrop; its vibrating crystals and breathing shadows actively constrain Vera’s perceptual tactics—she must learn to inhabit them rather than foresee past them. The cave pearl functions as micro-setting/tool hybrid: handled in multiple beats, its dissolution into her skin charges the final image. Spatial choreography is immaculate—footsteps, chiming response, shadow coalescence all tracked without drift. Sensory hierarchy obeys her psychic bias: sound and felt vibration dominate over visual detail, mirroring the shift from sight to inhabitation.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Salt-crystal towers, rain-washed windows, and the seized valve create a tactile micro-setting that constrains action: the corroded valve literally limits announcement, shaping Kessa’s archival ritual. Sensory hierarchy mirrors her cataloguer’s gaze—light angles reveal hidden ink, never touristic excess. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drift. Weather and salt accretion evolve with story time. Setting could edge into 9+ if one environmental detail forced a costlier choice on her.

    Tower, body, and tile form a micro-setting trilogy that constrain choice: chill stone prompts palm contact; tile warmth directs transcription posture; highest platform wind forces the final stance. Sensory hierarchy (vibration, temperature, wind) is filtered through astronomer bias. The environment literally charges the final image—tile revealed against wind—meeting 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prismatic escondite is more than wallpaper: its light-bending walls supply the very medium through which Vex threads magnetic field lines, enabling the mutineers’ arrival. Sensory triage is POV-loyal—Vex catalogs gravity “suggestions” and crystalline auroras with the brevity of someone who has seen it all. The final image of “light bending through impossible angles” recharges the opening setting, now emptied of its immortal tenant, giving the locale an Earned Stasis resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prep-room micro-setting is vividly specified—embalming fluid catching fluorescents like “liquid mercury,” cream worked into joints—details that constrain how long Maya can stall and where objects (ink pot, envelope) must sit. Spatial choreography stays coherent as bodies and props change hands. The environment does not charge the final image as pot and ashes already did, so the 9+ gate is missed, but selective sensory triage under mortician bias is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bonsai labyrinth is not backdrop but instrument: root-scars, lean-to-light, and dew-caught hum constrain how and what she can record. Fountain stones shaped as sleeping birds, unlit lanterns waiting for dawn—each detail is filtered through her cataloguing gaze and later refracts the lamp’s data. Spatial choreography is immaculate; we never lose her crouch, the moss, the monk’s distant silhouette. Environment, tool, and body converge in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    Container maze functions as micro-setting: shifting walls force Mari to navigate by echo, dictate when she can safely enter 47-B, and supply the metal groan that harmonizes with the nameless chorus at closure. Tide rhythm tracks time and stakes; rust, salt, and dawn-light selectivity mirror internal corrosion and fleeting clarity. Spatial choreography clean across beats. Environment directly constrains final image.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.1)
    The copper-domed observatory, salt-sprayed cliff, and half-carved cello body function as micro-setting—every tactile detail (dust motes, rusted stairs, sympathetic string vibration) constrains or enables the sound experiment. Salt-green corrosion mirrors emotional decay; the unfinished sound-hole literally shapes where the shell must be placed. Environment and tool together charge the final image; no static tourism. Enough specificity to flirt with the 9-band, but one fewer sensory echo would have left space for the reader’s own vibration.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.1)
    The raft city is sensuously alive: black water mirroring carnival lights, oil-drum fires, wave generators, puppet theaters that developers eye for boutique hotels. Spatial choreography stays clean—Maya moves “between platforms,” children thread booths, artists paint “every available surface.” Selective detail keeps economy: “recycled bottles and sealed drums” labels the physics without exposition. The perpetual-motion carnival functions as micro-setting that constrains tactics—its legal limbo is the loophole they weaponize—so environment materially shapes the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    The crater, regolith chemistry, and hourglass each constrain tactics: only lunar vacuum allows the silver-regolith reaction to serve as clock; only Tycho’s fissure yields the vapor; only the ancient grain can be “returned.” Sensory selection is filtered through Vera’s professional eye—she notices seismic thresholds, sublimation rates, earthlight wavelengths—never a tourist catalogue. The final image of earthlight painting the abandoned hourglass crystallizes the setting-as-character.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Mist-coated depot is not backdrop but sensory interface: droplets act as pixels, skylight tubes as prisms, corrugated eaves as metronome. Micro-setting (drone wing, bench surface) constrains the final patch pressure and is recharged in last image. Spatial choreography is clean: drone under skylight → exit door → Meridian chain rising; no impossible positions. Weather (mist) actively guides choice rather than decorating scene.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Frost asymmetry on wings, cataract-eye lake, rusted desk acreage: every visual is filtered through Margot’s cartographer gaze and guides her next cognitive leap. The outpost itself—groaning metal, condensation on glass—functions as micro-setting that literally supplies the watershed map, constraining her revelation and later her choice to collaborate. Sensory hierarchy stays disciplined; cold is tactile, sound is wind-groan, no tourist catalog. Final image of the lake “keeping its secrets” recharges the opening frost pattern, earning the high band.</question>
    
    <question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—exclusive knowledge of the subglacial rivers—is signaled by word three (“empty”) and tightens when official eyes arrive. The single meaningful turn: secrecy → shared risk; the price is immediate and legible—she hands over the phrasebook, losing informational monopoly. Pressure stays coherent under situational lens; no false escalation loops. Could edge higher if the inspector’s threat felt sharper on the page, but the foreclosed option is unmistakable.

    Cobblestone, fountain, archway, and bakery attic are economically anchored and filtered through communal ritual. The ebony fork’s tactile return at the end charges the image, meeting the 9+ gate. A touch more sensory specificity mid-story—weather, seasonal shift—would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment is micro-setting perfection: the vial, the compound, the stone that breathes prayers—each constrains choice. Temple architecture is rendered through paradox felt in muscle: corridors that “spiral into themselves” dictate Maya’s navigation tactics. Final image of bioluminescent chamber recharges every prior sensory thread. One hairline slip: “crushing depths” is cliché amid otherwise fresh phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.9)
    Copper light, salt-green brass, and scuffed fingernail trails are selective, sensory, and motive—every detail either bars escape or enables inscription. The lattice salvaged from shipwreck layers history into the wood’s grain, making setting a recording device. Micro-setting qualifies: the confessional’s carved maze is the tool that both channels and preserves voice, directly enabling closure. Spatial choreography is clean—Marcus threads, hovers, palms the screen—no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Greenhouse-as-micro-setting is masterfully textured: glass catching no light, mercury pools, carnivorous vines feeding thieves, luminescent fruit pulsing like hearts. Each sensory layer (visual, haptic, olfactory from nocturnal blooms) constrains Marlow’s harvesting moves and charges the final reversion to “ordinary apples” with conceptual cost. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies and tools track cleanly. The environment is not backdrop but agent—soil mixed with philosopher’s stone literally digests the ghost’s essence—satisfying the 9+ gate that setting must shape tactics or final image.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    Red sandstone, barnacled petroglyphs, and salt-bleached illustration plate act as micro-setting that constrains each stitch Calla can or cannot make. Sensory hierarchy skews to touch and color—cool sandstone, bleeding pigments—mirroring her haptic obsession. Spatial choreography stays clean across the spiral overlap zone; no floating bodies. The canyon’s “breathing” rule (tide pools in desert stone) is learned through action, not lecture, and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    The catacomb-orchard is not backdrop but hydraulic pressure: roots “embracing skulls and femurs with equal tenderness” dictates where feet can step and where oil will be pressed. The sundial base itself functions as micro-setting, its inscribed names constraining the final choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Miriam notices bronze green, root tension, olive ripeness, not tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions as they traverse the grove. The final image of shadow crossing names recharges the setting’s living-dead fusion.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    The golden arcade functions as micro-setting: its derelict glamor constrains Mira’s ritual—open marble for twenty-foot chalk canvas, skylight for dawn gold that times her exit. Brass fixtures, copper postal trucks, and resin-smelling chalk are tactile tools that charge the final photograph. Spatial choreography is flawless: we track her knees on marble, chalk arcs, camera click, gate lock. Weather (impending rain) is an environmental clock that narrows options and prices her ephemeral art.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt dome, autumn bruise-light, and eternal candle are not backdrop but tool: the dome’s acoustics let Vera overhear, the candle’s angle-dependent glow is the decryption key. Micro-setting (her needle, the velvet stretched across the table) constrains every stitch-timing under surveillance eyes. Sensory hierarchy obeys her astronomer’s training—she notices star-angle before blood. Final image recharges the setting: wind rattling the dome above the silent, glowing map.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mangrove labyrinth is not backdrop but pressure system: knee-deep water slows steps, roots snag, spirits sing directions. Shard-as-micro-setting constrains the final act—only its edge can etch the apology onto mist. Sensory economy is exact: brackish air, moonlight like mercury, no tourist cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    The atrium’s manufactured rain and twilight glass actively reweight the stake—healing is as curated as the mist. Coral-as-micro-setting constrains the final gift; its “convolutions” mirror both neural and archipelagic routes, charging the closure image. Sensory hierarchy obeys medicated perception: morphine blurs edges, tightens focus on tactile ridges and humid breath. No static postcarding; every environmental detail is filtered through Maya’s body-in-recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Fog-damp fresco, studio-cave, crushed apple-seed plaster provide tactile micro-setting that constrains her technique (must paint with light, not pigment). Spatial choreography clean: fragment → palms → cave walls → orchard memory. Environment mirrors internal thaw: gray cave blooms into luminous orchard. Sensory economy favors touch/taste over visual catalog, keeping detail purposeful for 725-word count.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    The garden’s acoustic panels are not backdrop but instrument: the coin’s shadow bends sound pitch, the walls replay Elena’s future answer, and the “heartbeat” rhythm forces her brush to synchronize. This micro-setting (coin, spiral, reflected beam) is irreplaceable—remove any piece and the sonic mechanic collapses. Sensory hierarchy is biased to Elena’s restorer eye (she sees layers) and ear (she hears echo-previews), anchoring description in goal-directed action. Only minor overture: “symphony” and “dreams breathe” flirt with abstraction, but are justified by the garden’s literal sound design.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.8)
    Greenhouse functions as micro-setting: humid glass, condensation-fogged door, chlorophyll scent—details filter through Marcus’s entomologist gaze and directly enable his scanner-jamming tactic. Spatial choreography is clean—bench, tunnel, doorway distances track across beats. Insect inventory (mantises, moths, locusts) is handled tactilely, not listed. No externality cap applies; environment constrains choice and charges the final “rain” image.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    The shell’s mother-of-pirl corridors, wind-tuned acoustics, and reef-shadow twilight constrain every creative act; the postcard’s fraying paper literally filters starlight to cast new constellations that charge the final image. Specificity is selective—no tourist catalog—yet tactile handling of charcoal, crystallized music, and fossilized forgiveness keeps the world lived-in. Environment materially shapes tactics and final illumination, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.1)
    Crystalline airborne library, glass orchids, and the sundered bamboo function as micro-setting: each constrains action (fragile blooms demand slow hands, cracked bamboo imposes countdown).

    Pacific Bell key, verdigris plaque, and fluorescent maintenance tunnel give tactile pre-revision texture; auric lagoon sheens from industrial spill quietly link ecology to informational pollution. The key’s metallic warmth against skin is the micro-setting that charges the final sunrise image. Spatial choreography is flawless through Pier 47 descent. Missing 9-band gate only because environment does not literally constrain final upload tactics—those occur off-page on servers.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prism atrium is not backdrop; its acoustic rule—silence has weight—directly shapes the tactic and is recharged in the closing rain-bow droplets. Dew-beaded sax keys, bioluminescent moss, and vested hush are filtered through Marcus’s jazz-tuned perception; sensory economy favors touch and kinetics over visual glut. Spatial choreography is clean: entrance → atrium → dispersal, no impossible moves. Environment constrains choice (sound = substance), satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Ashen Skyborne Arbor is evoked through kinetic sensory filters—petrified branches “like bridges of bone,” roots that “drank from clouds”—and the micro-setting of Mira’s workbench becomes a crucible when moss fractals erupt across it, directly constraining her future choices. Every detail is filtered through her professional attention to “size, shimmer, and song,” so the world rules are learned by action, not exposition. The final image of moss colonizing ash-gray bark recharges the opening palette, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is filtered through Marcus’s tool-centric eye; the subterranean waterfall’s mist and rust govern tactile choice (“precision hated”). The greenhouse micro-setting supplies the decisive constraint: the potting bench becomes the pivot where compass and clocks synchronize. Spatial choreography stays clean—“suspended it from the ceiling,” “carried in out of pure instinct.” The final image recharges the waterfall song and compass spin, meeting the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rain-washed foundry acts as micro-setting: slick rust underfoot narrows Vera’s stride, dripping skylights meter tension, and the dark furnace mouth becomes the literal site of transformation. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and metallic taste, filtered through alchemist bias. The coin and Vera’s gold-seamed face function as embedded tools that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is tight; no floating rooms.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    The gorge’s acoustic logic (echoes amplify, distort, fold) constrains every beat: speech returns “sevenfold,” music becomes “weeping made of music.” Tool-as-setting: the harp’s misalignment literally shapes Thomas’s spectral tether. Sunrise moisture turns stone to “cathedral of gold,” charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no geography drift.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.1)
    The UV forest is not backdrop; its Fibonacci moss supplies the literal footing for Lyra’s first free step and the child’s lesson. Pewter strap functions as micro-setting—its 47 g mass and pressure-map constrain every cranial angle until the inversion releases them. Spatial choreography is immaculate: vertebrae announce positions, distances to the child are calculated for safety. Environment, body, and tool jointly charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    The swaying rope bridges, indigo-stained hands, and mercury-silver spells are tactile and selective, never tourist-catalog. The painting-as-map object is micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy tightens under urgency: only the glint of crystalline light matters until Mira’s blade lifts paint. Environment and tool charge the closing image; meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dust-maps, sequined costume catching non-existent light, and the mainspring’s warmth are highly specific. The ticket counter as micro-setting constrains the discovery beat. Ceiling cavity and journals tumble provide spatial coherence. Environment charges the final image when Marcus kills the fluorescent, embracing darkness that once hid the evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glass orchard library is not backdrop; its floating fragility and frost-governed shelving directly constrain Moth’s choices and supply the printing method that triggers collapse. Micro-setting—letterpress, bottled whispers, crystalline apples—functions as tactile tools that charge the final page. Spatial choreography stays clean as books fall and trees chime; only the cloud-sea geography remains lightly sketched, capping the score just under 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    The asteroid-Versailles is more than postcard: its mirrors (draped because they show possibilities) directly feed Cassia’s closing argument and supply the rule that reflections reveal branching selves. Spatial choreography is clean—shard on table, storm outside, mirrors lining the hall, bodies tracked. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: she notices gold weeping cherubs because she’s alert to imperial decadence; temporal ribbons register as tactical data. The shard itself functions as micro-setting—handled, rotated, warmed—so environment, tool, and choice intersect in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    The resonance chamber functions as micro-setting: its copper walls, hidden mirrors, and harmonic rails directly enable the climactic light-cascade. Selective detail—"gears frozen mid-turn," "threads of pure silver sung into existence"—root us in tactile process. Weather is absent but irrelevant; the chamber’s acoustic property substitutes for sky. Spatial choreography is flawless: Elias at bench, Vex beyond door, rust advancing across tools—every object tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    The subterranean lagoon is not backdrop; its phosphorescent algae dictates the only light Vera sees and therefore what she can decide (“mirror-still surface” vs. “shimmering wall”). Spatial choreography is exact: descent → narrow throat → sudden chamber → kneel → fill vial; no impossible positions. Sensory hierarchy is collector-biased: scent > sight > touch; the air is “mineral dampness,” the vial “warm against her chest,” the rain-memory “cosmic.” Factory-above / cave-below polarity lends social context to her eccentric profession without exposition. The lagoon’s glow literally charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    The archway’s limestone throat, the van’s metal drum, and the storm’s turbine-hum constrain every cut; the sculpture’s spiral is literally carved under that acoustic roof. Driftwood’s tactile memory replaces generic seaside postcard with palpable grain. Future shards are anchored in present sensory cues—slide warmth, rain shift—so setting evolves rather than repeats. Micro-setting triumph: the dashboard groove where the slide rests becomes the decision altar.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    The amber pavilion, copper roof, and snow-on-snow details are selective and body-scaled; the postcards function as micro-setting that constrains every brushstroke. Weather and season evolve causally, tightening the commission’s deadline and finally sealing the pavilion. The cathedral window glass is mentioned but never physically handled on-stage, so it does not quite charge the final image, keeping the score just below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    Obsidian lagoon is not backdrop but crucible—its mirrored surface literally reconfigures the zeppelin into “infinity of floating libraries,” charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Amara’s archivist gaze: she notes paper-wrapped diary, wind-exposed water, bleached wood as “letters” before touching them. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from gondola window to shoreline to simultaneous 1961 overlay. Micro-setting (diary pages, black water) constrains every micro-choice; no descriptor feels touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.1)
    Jellyfish lanterns, cracked fountain, amber walls—each object is tactile and eventually charges the final image. Micro-setting (the bottle against his forehead) literally constrains the climax. Spatial choreography stays coherent as Silas moves from shoreline to square. One slip: “weathered hands” is stock; a more particular carpenter’s callus or salt-stiff knuckle would sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Garden-as-micro-setting constrains every move: roots in engineered soil limit escape, height above water measures rising doom, apple sweetness counterpoints salt-death. The Edison shaving is handled twice—discovery and immersion—its grooves literalize the “patterns” motif. Spatial choreography holds: forty-story drop, northern tower in sight-line, basin on ledge. Final image of ripe apples “with knowledge” reweights the orchard from refuge to ark.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    The icebound atrium is more than postcard: its sublimation reveals living oak that “had been growing for a thousand years,” directly constraining the reopening action. Micro-objects—acorn cap, suspended seeds—function as setting-extensions that charge the final image when the cap is planted. Sensory detail is selective (ridged texture, starlight glitter) and filtered through Mira’s seed-saver expertise; no tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean: spiral floats, seeds self-plant, Mira’s body remains centered; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Windblown sanctuary above clouds is not backdrop but instrument: thin air stills sound, bell note travels farther, height equals isolation. Micro-setting objects—weather station, glue-dried acrylic seal, hemp rope—constrain timing and tactics. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mara’s vocation: pressure in bones before eyes see storm. Final image of ice crystals chiming reprises acoustic motif, charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    Yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting: its warmth and hum constrain Kepler-9’s perceptual choices and charge the final image. Compressed stellar dust lens is specific, recurrent, and alters tactics—without it, the impossible star is invisible. Meets 9+ gate; only micro-setting, but it decisively shapes closure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stained-glass box functions as micro-setting: it warms in shadow, constrains Mara to lift it, and recharges the ending image of “captured sunset.” Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV—she notices bleached hive frames, translucent panes, the hum that isn’t bees. Spatial choreography is clean: ghosts circle, she steps between hives, box sits among rotting frames. Desert scorch and dawn light that “shouldn't exist” are economical, purposeful, and charge the final tableau.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.9)
    The emerald silo’s “crystalline walls” and the urn fragment’s “porcelain surface etched with equations that seemed to shift and breathe” are tactile, charged objects that constrain Marcus’s understanding and final purpose. Micro-setting dominates—no broader geography—yet the silo’s resonance and the fragment’s warmth directly shape the closing image. Sensory hierarchy stays tight: touch > sight > sound, matching the POV’s synesthetic time-sense. The objects earn the 9+ gate by charging the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt lagoon’s post-storm textures—trickling mangrove roots, tidepool spirals, light through kite tears—are filtered through Mira’s synesthetic attention and directly constrain her choice to intervene; the same torn paper later becomes the literal material for closure, so setting charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    Temple orchard fuses with Mira’s body—copper against bark, tumor against stone—so the setting literally channels her final choice. Living stone pillars return as the glowing mineral interface; environment constrains the closure image. Sensory hierarchy obediently narrows to electromagnetic vibration under dying perception.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rain-washed limestone, bronze-quiet chamber, and overgrown sculpture path are filtered through Elena’s skeptical eye, each detail doing double duty as clue and atmosphere. The tower’s damp stone and magnetic footprint lines are concrete tools that constrain how she moves and where she places the amber. Micro-settings (scanner, amber, tower wall) act as extensions of her body and decision space. One minor slip: “bronze quiet” is repeated without sensory evolution, a static epithet rather than an evolving texture.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Jetty, tide, roses, gulls, and dissolved phosphorus form a living micro-setting that actively feeds the action; every sensory note is also nutrient data for the seeds. Stillness of mirror-bright water and night-hunting sounds narrow and widen scale in one breath, creating the titular “narrow vastness.” Shrapnel under soil and calcium reef skeleton act as tactile constraints the plants will exploit. Environment is not backdrop but collaborator, charging the final image of star-lit shoots.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Heap’s crushed-car mountains, rust-motor-oil air, and the amber-wax leaf pressed to a phonograph horn are tactile, non-generic. Spatial choreography is clean: den → outside → cratered valley. Environment constrains choice—scrap alleys channel her route; the valley’s impossible autumn charges the final image. Weather is implied through dawn timing, supporting the hush.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observation deck is rendered through Kira’s navigator’s eye—void swallowing starlight, recycled air carrying grandmother’s voice, gold that “remembers photons.” Micro-setting (compass rose) literally constrains her choices: touching it stretches others, so she must keep touching. Spatial choreography stays clean as she presses paper to metal and watches crew drift toward her. Final image recharges the deck itself as living constellation.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.1)
    Icebound spire, crystalline staircase, and “constellations swimming backward” are sensory and specific; the spire’s ice is not just scenery—it sings and hums, guiding Renn’s tactile discovery. Spatial choreography keeps summit, staircase, and chessboard coherent. Pocket sundial lid functions as micro-setting; its mirrored reveal inside the cracked king charges the final image. No factual drift; “impossible geometries” signals rule-set early, paid off when sky stays wrong.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Whispering gallery is not backdrop but physics: the dome’s acoustic arc forces Marina to whisper yet be heard, turning her footfall graffiti into a parliament no coup can dissolve. Chessboard’s absent pawns constrain her historiography—she can only crown absence. Micro-setting (her own body pacing letters) and recurring object (echo) together charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is character-bound: she catalogs angles of shoulders, not marble cherubs, because grief has trained her to read people’s exit postures.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mountain bookstore is not backdrop but tool: book-spines she reads by touch, soil-floor that finally accepts the stone, skylight that delivers starlight she hasn’t “seen in decades.” Micro-setting (the stone’s feather-soft surface) literally guides her down unmapped passages and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—fingers, soil, skylight track without drift. The environment constrains the final choice: only the dark earth chamber can receive the seeds of language, making setting indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    Frozen village, suspended rain, and platinum labyrinth are filtered through Kaspar’s chess-tutor eye: he reads the board as text, feels time-friction under fingers, smells ozone that never releases. The monumental pieces serve as both setting and tool—reflection surfaces that force self-recognition—meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains clean across one continuous scene; no visual cataloging, every detail either pressures choice (the frayed tapestry) or charges final image (copper piece left on board).

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bone towers function as both landscape and tool: handholds, resonance chamber, and acoustic prism constrain every tactic. Mist and canyon acoustics are filtered through Kira’s artist ear—she notices harmonics, not geology—satisfying the POV-bias test. Spatial choreography is flawless; bodies, distances, and sound paths track cleanly. The pale spire reappears in the final image, reweighted from accusation to transmitter, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    Workshop-as-body: the groaning gears and hissing condensation act as external lungs, dictating Mira’s tempo. Brass charm’s three dents and statue’s pockmarks are micro-setting details that constrain the only workable ritual. Acid sea’s rising fumes narrow perception to “burning throat” and tilting floor, mirroring internal desperation. Final image—crystal blazing in falling darkness—recharges every prior gear and droplet.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Phosphorescent algae and tide-smoothed passages are economically selected, never catalogued. The cave walls act as both archive and constraint—shelves determine where shells rest, charging the final placement. Body-as-setting appears in trembling fingers opening the journal. No spatial drift; geography remains coherent as Marina back-tracks the same path out.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    Cobalt lighthouse paint peeling after merciless heat, cool stone pulse under palm, salt-crisp dawn air—selective, urgent, POV-filtered. The cork’s warmth and the jasmine molecules function as micro-setting that literally bends dimensional barriers. Spatial choreography is clean: stone → spiral stairs → lamp room; no floating bodies. The lighthouse beam’s rotation synchronizes with Thomas’s solidification, charging the final image. One minor slip—“weeks of merciless heat” floats unanchored in calendar time, but the heat-wave-break is concrete enough to pass.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting pressure is live: immobilized radio array forces hand-cranking; poisoned corridor dictates nocturnal timing; waning moon saps strength. Bronze censer foot operates as micro-setting/tool hybrid—its weight, patina, inherited prayer constrain each crank. Sensory triage (metallic scrape, satellite shadow, sulfur stench) filters through POV bias. Final image of bronze held like “living thing” reweights prior temple lore.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Storm-bent apple branches “like broken arms” and horizontally grafted trunks are not picturesque—they block rake strokes and force her sideways gait, physically shaping the search pattern. The verdigris tin wedged under the same root system that produces the truffle embeds setting as resource. Final image of glass eye clicking against remaining truffles inside pocket compresses body-tool-environment into one haptic beat. One notch below 9 only because atmospheric prose briefly over-seasons (“older than copper”) in an already dense paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    The opal dock, moonstone mist, and lighthouse beam function as micro-setting that literally constrains perception: Magnus can only see during the twelve-degree nautical twilight and only decipher scratches when the beam hits at the exact angle. Weathered planks, salt-cracked palm, and the transparency of the dried flower against light are tactile anchors that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless—distance from lantern to dock to waterline is tracked through footfalls and sweep timing. The mountain/sea exile tension is evoked through the wrongness of an Alpine bloom beside tidal pools, making environment a character.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is selective and POV-filtered: dust, brass, kudzu, limestone, crystalline pools register only as Marcus’s attention grazes them. The blooming cavern’s impossible midsummer light functions as micro-setting that reweights choices; its luminescence mirrors the internal shift without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean—doorstep to warehouse district to cliff opening tracks believably. A hairline slip: “scenes that weren’t there—or weren’t there yet” edges toward abstraction before the chip re-anchors perception.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    The cobalt grotto is tactile—“stone glowed blue-black… pulsing like a bruised heart”—and the bleeding starlight drips onto ember crystals, re-weighting their meaning from memory to payment. Micro-setting (the crystallized flames) constrains the final choice: touch = understanding = transformation. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating bodies. One minor over-index on visual metaphor; still, the environment charges the closure image and therefore satisfies the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Micro-setting (shell, nexus surface, dying light) constrains every move; twilight’s color shift times the beats and supplies the final palette image. Sensory hierarchy obeys alchemist gaze—veins, warmth, calcium curve—none feel touristic. Spatial choreography clean across hand/ shell/ nexus contact. Environment mirrors internal fade-to-glow arc without overt symbol declarations. No credibility hits.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    Cabin, wind-scent, and cold glass are filtered through obsessive archivist attention; birch bark as micro-setting constrains the act of writing and recurs with reweighted meaning at closure. Spatial choreography is clean—window, scroll, charcoal tracked without drift. Weather affects action: wind shift triggers the final step outside. The mountain range is named only when it becomes the launch site, satisfying proper-noun economy. One moss-thin slip: “pines that hadn’t existed” stays abstract; no sensory hook anchors the impossible forest.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Steam-fogged windows, brass channels, and the green-tinged screw create a micro-setting that literally steers Mara’s tactile method and the final image of fog meeting water like ultrasound. The shop’s perpetual condensation externalizes the theme of softened grief and constrains visibility, forcing reliance on touch that charges the ending. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: no smell, so sound and texture dominate. One hairline slip: “towering buildings” is generic, but it’s outside the focal object and does not blunt closure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    The floating tea-platform is more than postcard: its sway under her held breath tightens the stakes, and the crow quill is handled in multiple beats, reweighted when it delivers her self-portrait in ink. Selective sensory economy—jade-green leaves, velvet hush, crystalline dust—keeps description purposeful and filtered through Kira’s stress-narrowed perception. Micro-setting (her own skin as geography) constrains the final choice and charges the closure. Environment and tool both qualify for 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    The archive’s paper-dust and rose-oil air supply the only “current” that allows spirit collaboration; this micro-setting literally enables the plot.

Final image—empty corked bottle—crystallizes both orchard loss and spirit departure, charging the requiem’s completion.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.8)
    The impossible library geometry is not backdrop but tactical instrument: the helix corridors literally guide Kaia’s footfalls and decide when the pedestal appears. “Dust motes froze mid-air” is sensory, selective, and stakes time dilation. Dictionary as micro-setting object alters later tactics—its blanking triggers the ultimate reprice. Spatial choreography survives seven-fold superposition because each location is anchored to her body’s spiral walk.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Brass teeth, mercury fjord, and bedrock channels are tactile micro-settings that constrain every action; remove them and the ritual collapses. Spatial choreography is immaculate: whistle → stone rim → vertical drop → reservoir tone, a vertical score the body must ascend/descend. The “razor edge” functions as both physical ledge and conceptual blade, weaponizing the setting into the final image. Weather absence is deliberate—stillness becomes an environmental character that enforces stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bioluminescent farm is evoked with selective sensory detail (“soft blue-green light that seemed to breathe”) and functions as micro-setting: the permeable membranes and quantum tunnels directly enable the climax. Laser pointer and mushrooms act as handled objects that constrain choice; the final image of “light pass through” recharges the membrane motif.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    Rainwashed library glass, mica-pane lantern fractals, and amber refractions are vividly selective, mirroring probability vs. chaos without overt symbolism. The micro-objects—lantern panes—literally overlay her equations in the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate that setting must charge closure. Quiet, economical, atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tunnel, rusted ladder, phantom phone bank, and glass disc function as micro-setting objects that literally constrain Marcus’s movements and supply his only tools. Sensory detail is selective (loneliest frequency of third rail, sparse fluorescent light catching rim of disc) and filtered through his technician’s ear. Spatial choreography stays consistent as he walks past booths; no impossible geography. The environment’s acoustic haunt both mirrors and enables his emotional project, charging the final harmonica note that “teaches silence how to speak.”

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Wisteria perfume and amber light are not backdrop but instruments: their sweetness steeps through Mara’s lungs, guiding her decision to sweeten Eleanor’s last days while preserving bitterness for posterity. The portable ink set and locket function as micro-setting, constraining the final codicil act. Spatial choreography across the jetty is immaculate; bodies and boats stay tracked. One notch below 9 only because weather never quite turns against her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    Ivy-choked platform isn’t backdrop; its green cathedral acoustics amplify the illicit whispered trade and echo Sadie’s “between architecture and forest” liminality. The thermos, vial, and satellite phone function as micro-settings that constrain exchange protocols. Final image—Marcus alone on the breathing platform—recharges the station as living conduit, not relic. Specificity is irreplaceable: lunar mineral scent, illegal retirement gift, union raccoons.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.0)
    Ultrasonic forest is lived-in: bark under fingernails, soil whispering directions, ring vibration against bone. Micro-setting (ring) charges closure; forest silence constrains her final stance. Sensory economy skips visual junk, favors bone-resonant diction. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly; no physics drift. Weather absent but irrelevant.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    The station chamber, osmium-iridium pen, and lensed starlight are returned to in every beat; the pen’s weight literally steadies her micro-gravity drift before the fatal keystroke. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through her interpreter priorities—wavelength gaps, biosignature ghosts—so setting guides choice. Spatial choreography is clean: anchor straps release, pen drifts, alarm chimes, she floats to the panel. Environment and tool jointly constrain the final dual transmission.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    The luminous harbor is never mere postcard: moonlight carves silver paths that guide camera angles, water texture changes the quality of shadow Maya must capture, and the shoreline distance constrains how far the two women can physically walk while mapping. The vintage Leica’s weight, click, and empty chamber function as micro-setting; its mechanical resistance shapes the rhythm of every beat. Spatial choreography is immaculate—Chen steps closer mid-gesture, Maya frames her profile against water, footprints left behind—so environment and body charge the final image without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    Limestone corridor and copper air are sharply sensed; the tapestry as micro-setting constrains her next action (memorizing pattern). Spatial anchoring is late (~140 words) but serves the accumulative reveal, so orientation penalty waived.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    Crystalline barrier, auric lagoon, acoustic flowers—each is handled in action (Mira presses, waters rise, flowers bloom from her pattern). The garden’s resonant lattice constrains the climax: it physically broadcasts the inversion. Micro-setting (injection site, drum surfaces) tightly fused to POV sensory filter.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Container walls become an acoustic amphitheater, a micro-setting that literally channels whispers into authority’s ear; this constraint shapes tactics and charges the final image. Geomagnetic storm paints aurora on corrugated steel, turning industrial bleak into sensory overload without dropping momentum. Spatial choreography is flawless: we track three-container sightline, heel-echo intervals, brass-key taps that reveal hollow versus loaded boxes. Environment is not backdrop; it is the board on which the power game plays.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.1)
    Cobalt dock, rain-puddle mirror, and shuttered canal house constrain every beat: the puddles host star reflections, the shutters are the physical tool Mira wields to teach. Dental mirror doubles as micro-setting and charged object; its final surrender reweights the closing image. Sensory economy is strict—only star-glint, wet planks, creaking wood—mirroring Thomas’s narrowed grief attention. No world-rule inconsistency; spatial choreography clean as Mira circles, kneels, opens/closes shutters in trackable sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mist-breathing cobalt library functions as micro-setting that constrains visibility and time; the hovering chess pieces under magnetic starlight charge the final image. Selective sensory triage—pulse, thrum, glow—keeps momentum. Spatial choreography is clean: Marcus sets Elena down, pawn advances, windows ignite in sequence. Environment is not backdrop but accomplice.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    Kelp, whale-call vibration, phosphorescent surf are selective and body-filtered. Sublittoral fringe acts as micro-setting that gates the final crossing; discarded bindings on rocks reify the cost. Weather and tide stay coherent, never stall momentum. Could use one more sensory anchor to dock life to sharpen what is left behind.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Farmhouse kitchen, turbine blades, yellowed wallpaper, and the bouquet form a micro-setting that constrains every move: the perpetual roar is the regime’s metronome, the brittle petals a banned archive. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—visual shadows and tactile curls dominate, scent denied. The wooden bird emerges from this crucible; its final placement among flowers makes the setting charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no floating props or impossible reaches.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    Colonnade hum, cobalt light, and frozen lake are never backdrop: the quartz frequency literally changes pitch under Silas’s touch, guiding his choreography; the lake’s scripture fractures along lines his dance reveals. Spatial choreography clean—feet track from atrium to lake without jump-cuts. Micro-setting triumvirate (body-robe-column) constrains every spiral; the final image of sky-doors reflected in dark water recalibrates the whole space.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    Glass kiln heat, dew-weighted chrysanthemum petals, and the shard-caught light of the destroyed bank are filtered through Mira’s tone-based sight, making setting an active constraint—Enzo’s “clear glass” rule emerges from it. Spatial choreography is immaculate: herbs shift, reed placed, gate arrangement tracked. The courtyard itself becomes the tool that mediates reunion. Micro-setting (reed tongue inside glass) literally shapes the final sound that lures the daughter.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    Selective, urgent detail—golden motes, Victorian glass, the scratched lens catching splinters—roots us inside Vera’s selective attention. The lab itself acts: dust motes angle light that hits the lens that reframes her vision, so environment forces perceptual shift. Spatial choreography is clean; reader always knows where bells, chambers, doorway stand. Minor gap: we never feel acoustic texture (echo, dampening) that would sell “lost sounds”; visual dominates.

    Observatory dome, jeweler’s bench, and tray of candle stubs recur as micro-setting that constrains choice: only star-time, no mechanical clocks, dictates pace. Vellum stencil and rice-paper cranes are tactile objects whose handling advances beats; candle array literally guides the stranger inside. Sensory hierarchy narrows to glinting wire, hot wax scent, and wheeling stars—details filtered through artisan-grief attention. Final image of fresh candle recharges earlier beacon motif, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    The loft’s rain-beaded skylight, coiled tape-measure, and server-hum are tactile micro-settings that constrain Vera’s method; the ultraviolet lamp is the tool that literally reveals the final map. Sensory hierarchy obeys Vera’s vocation—she hears fiber-optic ghosts before she notices Marcus’s wet coat. Spatial choreography is tight: cards, tape, lamp, stairs tracked without drift. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Bronze prism pagoda functions as micro-setting: its seven tiers sequentially constrain access and supply the toxic resource; twilight light is recharged in final image. Sensory triage—amber tubes, impossible geometries—narrows to touch/taste of dust. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography tracks cleanly up the tiers. Crystal walls and dying light return in closure, now refracted through Mira’s transformed iris, charging the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.0)
    The blooming library’s bio-glass petals refract sunset into “colors that had no names, only feelings,” a detail that literally colors the final image.

Body-as-setting appears when tears “caught the library’s prismatic light,” fusing environment and emotion. Spatial choreography is flawless across sixty years of shifting frames; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glass-roof star panels, mist between redwoods, and the workbench’s surgical lamp form a micro-setting that literally throws light on her crimes and later spotlights the re-wired tail. The moonlit tail tip itself functions as a recurring object whose color-shift loss charges the final image once it reverts to plain green. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible hand or tool positions during micro-surgery. Environment constrains choice: isolation plus visible heavens force the confession to be posted online rather than delivered in person.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    Tower medical bay, dawn light strips, frosted hourglass, and rooftop garden are economically anchored; hourglass and glass pane function as micro-settings that constrain her final gesture. Sensory selection stays urgent—anesthesia fade, chlorophyll dream, coffee ring texture—mirroring her narrowing/widening perception. No spatial drift; transitions from bed to window to garden are cleanly tracked. Cold coffee ring reappears in final paragraph to charge closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    The booth’s brass, dust, and celluloid are handled, not catalogued; the northwest corner, ceiling, and floor are mapped as emotional coordinates that later justify her decision. The film strip itself functions as micro-setting—its brittleness constrains her gentle touch and motivates the theft. Sensory hierarchy obeys Vera’s psychometric bias: temperature and taste over visuals. Spatial choreography remains coherent across her slow rotation in the booth.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    The archway, astrolabe, and aurora are not backdrop but instruments: the astrolabe’s warming pull literally steers her forward; the archway’s temperature drop forces the “rest” beat. Selective sensory hierarchy mirrors POV—she notices prism-split eyelash frost, not Viking graffiti. Micro-setting (astrolabe as tether) charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. One minor slip: “velvet darkness that seemed to breathe” hovers close to atmospheric cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    Quantum-bloom dune is not backdrop—it supplies the very medium Kess weaponizes with song; grains become “tiny suns” that re-light in the closing cadence, directly charging image.

    The cobalt stone’s acoustic channels, the ice-glaze, and the bell-tower carvings all constrain the central conflict—sound vs. silence—so the fortress is not backdrop but instrument. Micro-setting objects (piano bench bolt, stair discoloration) function as geography inside 700 words; they are handled, tracked, and charge the climax. Spatial choreography is clean: staircase ascent, music-room entry, bell-tower search all stay oriented. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV: Marcus notices cold, dust, numb fingertips; Elena’s first gesture is touching the worn stone—familiar, not tourist. One minor lapse: “perpetually glazed with ice” is stated twice in similar phrasing; since it doesn’t stall momentum, only −0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    The library is not backdrop; its starlight, whispering robes, and stone that remembers songs constrain every tactic—only here can ink drink starlight, only here can truth be written. Micro-setting objects—ink pellets, crystalline dome, genealogical tome—are handled, stored, shattered; their materiality drives the plot. Spatial choreography is clean: Syln moves from shelves to dome to door, pellet traveling from palm to stone. The final image of constellations resuming their dance recharges the opening epochal clock, locking setting to theme.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    Station floor panels, ventilation breeze, and coral-as-architecture constrain her choice to dive; environment literally shapes the final image.

Setting evolves causally: the crystal harvested here returns here to be unmade, completing a loop.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    The arbor is not backdrop: bioluminescent moss, aerial roots, and thinning oxygen constrain every move and hide the data cache. The parachute buckle micro-setting returns as talisman in the final beat, charging the image. Selective sensory hierarchy—chemical signals, fungal networks—mirrors Maya’s scientific gaze without tourist excess. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating bodies.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    Crystalline walls and gravity generators are skim-named yet tactilely used—swords drift, bodies hover, forcing deliberate movement. The jar’s amber fluid catches light twice, becoming a micro-setting that constrains choice: to vivify or not. Spatial choreography precise: blades never occupy impossible angles. Earth glimpsed through floor reweights the stakes—home, daughter, history being rewritten below.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    The nocturnal brook-pocket is richly filtered through Mira’s puzzle-designer eye—its ‘orthogonal’ geometry, mis-aligning surveyors’ tools, becomes a living trap. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: hot seed, whispering paper, soil that ‘pulses.’ This micro-setting directly constrains the final tactic—obfuscation through spatial paradox—so it charges the closure image and meets the 9- gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tunnel is not backdrop but instrument: its limestone pores, ventilation shafts, and acoustic curve literally transmit wind-borne memory into living-room dust motes. Leaf blower specs (middle-C drone, F-sharp) are accurate and choice-constraining—Marcus must tune them or fail. Spatial choreography is clean: semicircle → upward shafts → house floorboards. Final image of cords clinking as he walks recharges the tool-as-setting rule. Meets 9-gate but for a hairline lack of body-scale tactile detail inside the tunnel.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    The frozen fountain with the cracked cherub, the mist that swallows footprints, the sideways-only shelf—these are not backdrop but tools that constrain movement and perception. The pendant’s obsidian weight and the frost that “crunches like broken glass” return in the final thaw, recharging the same sensory register. Micro-setting qualifies: the pendant itself is the portal and the prison key; its cold against her sternum is the physical seat of exile. Environment directly shapes the climax—garden thaws only when the pendant is relinquished.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.9)
    Ember Nexus is sketched with heat, pulsing crystal, molten core—enough to anchor danger but never drifts into travelogue. The broken crozier functions as micro-setting: its splintered state is handled in every beat, guiding choice (burn, not mend). Spatial choreography is clean—he steps, thrusts, bleeds; no impossible positions. Sensory hierarchy narrows to heat and the smell of his own singed blood, matching crisis urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment and tool are inseparable: the swaying tower, copper filaments, and mineral-scented mist literally constrain where she can step and how she wires the fragment. Hollywood fragment functions as micro-setting—its weight and glow charge every decision beat. Sensory economy is POV-filtered (“rusted dishes pointed skyward like a congregation of metal prophets”) yet never stalls momentum. Final image of dawn-gilt towers reuses the established visual palette, crystallizing the Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ferry, grotto, and sideways clocks are sketched with selective sensory strokes—rust on rail, phased limestone, starlight that “spells different stories.” These images constrain nothing tactically yet charge the final image of “every story at once.” Spatial anchoring is airy but consistent; the spectral geography mirrors the conceptual stakes without clutter. The environment functions as metaphorical chorus rather than physical obstacle, acceptable under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    The optical illusion gallery is not backdrop but instrument: Penrose stairs become climbable, the triangle rotates through impossible dimensions. The sinew thread itself functions as micro-setting—its pulse felt in her palms, its texture rewriting space. Spatial choreography is immaculate; the reader can track the patterns spilling across floor to wall. Environment directly constrains the final image: the transformed gallery is the visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    The benthic city is vividly embodied—“cluster of bioluminescent pearls,” transparent corridors pulsing with alien prismatic light. Pressure and darkness are returned to as tactile filters for every beat. The chain link serves as micro-setting/tool that constrains the final pedagogical act. Spatial choreography stays clean; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    The atrium is not backdrop but instrument: mist density modulates visibility, orchid-lean creates spatial dread, amber light fragments become the cathedral that licenses her to listen. The hearing-aid circuits and copper-taste interference are micro-setting objects that constrain how she can gather evidence. Spatial choreography is clean: we track her distance from glass ceiling to green-shadow caves to exit without jump-cuts. One notch off: “dying light into amber fragments” is gorgeous but repeated in adjacent clauses, a micro-loop that dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Arctic shelf, flooded corridors, phase chamber, and tide clock are all tactile and choice-limiting. The body-as-setting (Marcus suspended between states) directly charges the final image. One micro-slippage: “telecommunications cables snaked… like neural pathways” is apt but reused near-identically later; still, the cable network’s hum is kept present throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Observatory dome, antique ink-stained desk, and porcelain shard form a micro-setting triad that directly constrains the ritual mechanics; snow-muted radio supplies live environmental pressure. “Galaxy wheel” and green monitor glow collapse cosmic/photonic scale into tactile objects that charge the final dual-self image. Spatial choreography is immaculate: no impossible reaches or teleporting props across the single continuous scene. Cold, glass, ink, and shard all evolve state (frosting, spilling, reflecting) in lockstep with beats.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is not backdrop but instrument: the bone towers’ hollowness literally supplies phonemes, the starlings’ negative space becomes tuning fork, the copper veins threading canyon walls after her death constrain future travelers’ experience. Micro-setting (cracked diamond, cracked bird formation) fuses with macro to dictate tactical choices. Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV—sound-as-texture over sight—keeping detail selective. Final image of “copper sealed crack” recharges the very object that initiated the pattern, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    Gravity-pocket cavern is economically taught through floating soil/lavender and constrains the final ascension. Micro-setting (arrowhead, fungi towers) doubles as tool and mirror. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV priorities—physics anomalies first, sentiment second. The underground garden directly shapes the acceptance ritual, earning 9-band use.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Environment (bridge lattice, welded tree angles, compacted soil grids) actively constrains every tactic and is reweighted in closure as the ground literally cracks under musical pressure. Micro-setting objects—locust shell pressed to light, warm seed pressed back into Lira’s palm—function as tactile pivots that charge the final image. Sensory economy is disciplined: industrial hum, translucent amber shell, root-legs seeking light—each detail either enables a choice or mirrors internal split. Tonal glow of “tarnished wonder” remains consistent, tensioning gritty mechanization against translucent memory without slipping into ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Cobalt arcade functions as micro-setting: its roof hole choreographs drone flight and the neutral-ground history sharpens the stake of illegal post. Sensory pick is selective (neon flicker, rusted drop-box, whisper rotors). The bottled storm re-illuminates the space at climax, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting that charges final image. Could ascend higher if weather or architecture physically constrained Ezra’s tactics rather than merely mood.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.0)
    Every descriptive bullet is filtered through Emil’s carpenter eye: sawdust “drifts through shafts,” fog “rolls like memories refusing to settle,” moss “covers painted bodies.” The third car, the warped boards, and the trickle of hidden water all constrain movement and later choice—he can only reach the angel by crossing this reclaimed space. That specificity plus the micro-setting of the shard itself (a tool-bit of light) satisfy the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.0)
    The library’s non-Euclidean geometry is continuously filtered through Marcus’s map-making gaze; shelves “breathe like lungs” and aisle seven-and-a-half appears only in peripheral vision, constraining how patrons move and how Marcus guides them. Sensory selection favors texture (smell of old paper, warmth of silk) over cataloguing. Grandmother’s handwriting in a posthumous book provides a micro-setting object that charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean—scarf catching on shelf, staircase ascended—tracking body-to-environment relation without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    The archipelago-as-memory-cipher is evoked through selective sensory filters (molten copper water, salt-stained pages) that constrain Mara’s ritual path. Palette and sunrise mechanics are grounded in tactile detail; space tracks cleanly from skiff to island. The world rule—light through ground glass can vitalize memory—is taught early and paid off at closure. Setting charges the final image: the dissolving figure redefines the islands from scattered fragments to a completed constellation of acknowledged longing.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)
    The nexus is not backdrop but instrument: its impossible angles narrow Vera’s path to the single upward shadow, a literal constraint that determines tactics. Starlight, ribbon, and shifting alleys are filtered through her locksmith’s bias for “tumblers” and “tension,” keeping description instrumental. Spatial choreography is seamless—seven passages blur yet her body and the hair’s glow remain trackable. Micro-setting (the hair as fiber-optic conduit) charges the final release, qualifying for the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    The greenhouse is not backdrop but apparatus: broken panes, salt-crystalized benches, barnacle tide-lines all constrain footing, visibility, and the implicit timeline of twice-daily floods. The fairy ring itself acts as micro-setting—an animated arena that literally rewrites Margaret’s neural map. Specificity is selective (mason-jar “amber shadows,” Orion’s curved belt) and never stalls momentum. Because the ring charges the final image and forces the choice, the 9+ gate is satisfied; the 0.1 reserve is for a lone sentence that lists ship names without integrating their crews into the tactile space.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Shard-glass and tea-cup function as micro-setting that constrains every beat; dust-speckled light and marble footstep sound anchor immediacy. Playground swing exterior re-enters at closure to mirror stasis, meeting 9+ gate. Spatial choreography clean—no floating bodies.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.1)
    Waterfall mist becomes thread, parapet stone becomes loom—setting actively constrains tactics. Micro-setting (pruning shears as needle) charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is pruner-specific: she notices branch angles first, scent of moss second, unnamed color last. Spatial choreography is airtight: seed placed in stone depression, droplets gathered clockwise, twin shoots spiral outward—impossible to mis-track. Environment supplies the literal soil for the closure beat; removing any detail would break the planting mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    Crystal walls that fracture moonlight into “ribbons of color” and starlight that funnels into “beams” are not ornamental: they provide the literal loom by which mask fragments cohere, so the setting charges the closure. The bronze needle’s worn smoothness and the hemp’s thunder-surrender are tactically specific, anchoring body and tool. Spatial choreography stays clean as fragments migrate from net to bench to circle. The harbor’s drowned history is economically evoked through sensory shorthand (“black with age and salt”), keeping exposition off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    The breached hull, green brass handles, and miniature snow-globe cathedral are tactile, selective, and POV-filtered; the library-as-micro-setting literally constrains her choice—she must decide what to preserve before the air pocket collapses. Sensory hierarchy narrows to visual+pressure+sound of her own breath, matching crisis urgency. Final image of the turning globe inside her sample box recharges earlier recursion with undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    The server-courtyard’s humming walls, fog droplets as screens, and the brass-etched bolt-plate micro-setting all constrain Chorus’s tactical options—she must stay within electromagnetic storm range and within arm’s reach of her tool. Specificity is selective: “luminescent graffiti pulsed with encoded messages” fuses visual and data registers without catalog bloat. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible teleporting of bolt-plate or petals. The final image of walls “bloomed with encoded gardens” recharges the earlier binary-botanical motif, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    The elevator cage itself functions as micro-setting: its swaying lamp literally projects the hidden ink, constraining her next move. Frost, brass gears, and altitude are filtered through servant priorities—she notices dirt she must polish, wind that chaps skin she cannot afford to chap. Spatial choreography is immaculate; no impossible body positions as she handles goggles in a rattling cage. Setting never décor; every ice crack is a clock tick toward the reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sky gondola functions as micro-setting: its sway, cramped deck, and severed cable directly constrain Elena’s mobility and force her continued drift. Brass telescope’s changing temperature cues significance; cloud architecture supplies both sensory wonder and tactical data. Spatial choreography is clean—no impossible shifts—and weather affects every beat. The telescope charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting, though the broader world (Federation, Academy) stays off-page, capping just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    The library-as-body is rendered through touch, scent, and acoustic memory; every shelf-groove and ladder-scar constrains Lyra’s finger-portrait method. Mirrors and coin operate as micro-setting objects whose physical placement alters the final image. The “mirror the sky inside walls” charter is not decoration—it motivates the light-craft and is recharged when the guild walks through the living projection. Spatial choreography is flawless: bodies track cleanly around the hollow, ladders, and projected beams.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    The antique airship’s creaking timbers, rust-stained deck, and dying-engine gasps act as micro-setting that constrains her winding schedule and steers attention to the observation deck. The hopscotch board itself becomes the pivotal environment-object, its numbered squares literally dictating her bodily movement and final course adjustment. One minor gap: spatial choreography inside the navigation chamber is never anchored—no walls, doors, or furniture—so the deck’s scale feels slightly floating.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is atmospheric engine: ice walls that refract dawn, mirrors that frost over to reveal truth—environment directly shapes her tactile choices and the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys POV bias—she notices gear-tooth details, mirror temperatures, not tourist vistas. Micro-objects (brass wheels, leather tube) act as mobile “setting” that constrains hand-position and pacing. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible body moves between ladders, podium, descent. Lacks only a live weather obstacle (wind, altitude effect) that could have raised stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.1)
    Floating stone arches, crimson sky, and the brass bell are rendered with sensory economy and reappear to charge the final image. The bell’s weight and warmth constrain the closing beat, satisfying the 9+ gate. Occasional orchard placeholders (“millions of fruit trees”) stay generic but never stall spatial clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse’s derelict lens, dusk-galvanized copper walls, and Atlantic that “dissolved into something older than oceans” are vivid, selective, and filtered through Marcus’s quantum-synesthetic perception. The broken puppet head functions as micro-setting: its cracks literally guide the final light refraction that reconfigures time, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is pristine—stairs spiral, lamp room opens to sky, puppet placed center of lens apparatus—every beat is materially anchored. Sensory economy favors metaphor that reveals character (bruised plum dusk = both world and emotional state) without checklist cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    The copper-winged birds, temperature gauge, and frost-slick stone are filtered through Mara’s utilitarian eye—every detail either pressures choice (three-hour clock) or supplies resource (luminous path).

Final image of “ghost of birdsong” reuses the grove’s earlier yellow-bird memory, charging the closure with prior specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    The magnetic nexus is not backdrop; its torque on metal knights directly shapes the impossible final position that justifies staying. Twilight aurora and magnetite/quartz board provide micro-setting that charges the closing image. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Viktor’s priorities—magnetic tug before visual spectacle—keeping detail purposeful. One hairline slip: “six miles every evening” is told, not felt, but does not mute the final resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    The workshop’s starlit tin roof and vibrating copper dials are not backdrop but instrument: their acoustic response constrains every tuning move Mara makes. Micro-setting (the diary’s brass clasp) doubles as antagonist—its resonance threshold literally blocks access until the city’s collective hush aligns. Spatial choreography is flawless; objects never teleport. The final gold-green firelight washes the pages, charging the image with conceptual cost: knowledge now demands dissemination. Slight over-description of Victorian music boxes stalls momentum for one beat, preventing 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.7)
    The treetop village is not backdrop but lived-in kinetic constraint: swaying bridges, lightning-scorched soil, dew-filled web cups—all handled in goal-directed motion. Micro-setting (the suspended garden pot) literally bears the corpse-flower and is charged in the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: olfactory channel dominates, visual stays mist-filtered. Only minus: “morning mist…like steam from a witch’s cauldron” is a stock simile that briefly drifts into generic fantasy boilerplate.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    The floating rock arches, upward rivers, and inverse orchard are not backdrop: they funnel every navigation choice and finally allow the trees to ignore gravity.

Economy dominates: a single lightning flash sketches the broken dome, then exits.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mirror-world physics obey dream-logic consistent inside the piece: lightless greenhouse, iron lattices that ring like bells, mica that answers to memory-frequency. The greenhouse itself acts as micro-setting/tool: its iron frame vibrates under song, forcing the communal stance. Tiny bobble—“endless night” never clarifies temperature, hunger, bodily urgency—but sensory hierarchy stays narrowed to touch and sound, so the lapse is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Library’s impossible third-floor scale is taught early and constrains the scene: the vast hush permits the “enlarged tranquility” tactic. Sensory triage favors hush and paper texture over visual clutter, matching POV bias. Midnight anchors time without telescoping. Micro-setting—the corner table—becomes the crucible; its distance rules shape every move. No object or space contradiction at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Greenhouse city under toxic sky is sketched with sensory economy (“copper-and-regret” condensation, crystallized conversations in pale green) yet always filtered through Vera’s calligrapher eye. The zinc plate, breathing leaves, and pneumatic tubes double as micro-setting that constrains action: only living tissue accepts ink, only metal shards survive the damp. Spatial choreography is clean as she crawls junction seven. Final image—“morning condensation on glass”—mirrors the dome’s fragility and recharges the motif.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tower’s gimbal mechanics are sketched just enough to let the kinetic sculpture constrain every adjustment; cloud-sea and bronze resonance act as environmental limits that shape the final transmission. Micro-setting (iceberg droplet, bell inner surface) is tactile and stakes-bearing. No spatial drift; geography stays consistent and POV-filtered. Slight cap because no environmental detail revises tactics after the absorption beat.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Ceramic hand-tool vs pulsing synthetic soil, glass dome refracting firelight into compass-spin—environment becomes body-tool circuitry. Micro-setting of rose roots doubling as cable-grid is specific, pressures the burn radius. Magnetic shift is learned through useless compasses, never lectured. Final ash-layer charging new shoots gives setting causal role in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.1)
    The courtyard’s dawn amber, basil scent, guitar tuning, and breadcrumb sparrows are filtered through Marta’s collector gaze; the mailbox itself becomes a micro-setting that physically constrains choice—its locked mouth creates Elena’s silence and the neighbors’ later撬撬撬动.
