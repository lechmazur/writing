Sensory specificity is vivid across modalities without losing spatial coherence. The library-at-dawn atmosphere charges the final image and the cache’s meaning. World texture evolves with action, not static description.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.1)
    The nursery, storm season, and “mossy trellis after rain” are tactile and POV‑filtered (plastic pots drumming, metronome ponytail). Environment constrains and enables choice: the storm catalyzes the metamorphosis and the trellis becomes the site/tool of reconstruction. World rules emerge through action (woody fibers knitting) without expository dumping. The final image is charged by place and weather logic.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal island, causeway clock, and chapel ruin are vivid and tactically relevant: low tide enables arrival, the returning tide hurries departure, and the chapel’s plankton pool focuses the ritual. Details filter through purpose (rain trails as map, barnacled statues as signposts), avoiding tourist catalog. The setting charges the final image (sunlight flash on spire; causeway erasure) and constrains choice. Sensory specificity is rich without derailing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.1)
    The musical crystal cave isn’t backdrop; it weighs steps, answers whistles, births doubles, and seals echoes—environment directly shapes options and the ending image.

The measuring tape functions as micro-setting, constraining card placement and later recharging the ending. Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and causally active.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    Archive of cedar, bone, and bronze perfume builds tactile pressure; the twilight pagoda returns as charged mirror re-configuring memory. Environment and object act as setting-constraint rather than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glass-rooted library, cloud veranda, and pollen-desk are not postcard backdrops; they constrain choices (no return once rain is touched) and supply tools (telescopes, ink-leaves). Sensory hierarchy is POV-biased: the narrator notices “perfumed pollen of paragraphs” and “stratosphere thermals.” The river stone’s glow charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; only a touch of floating geography during the descent keeps it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    The misty workshop, bone knife, brazier, and cedar-scented smoke are woven through action; the chameleon tail tip becomes a micro-setting that constrains Calder’s ritual and charges the final image when he vows to return it.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.3)
    The projection booth, film strip, and auditorium are rendered with tactile specificity; the projector itself becomes the constraint that unlocks the tune. Sensory hierarchy favors hush, glimmer, and mechanical hum, all filtered through Mira’s urgency. Setting evolves as the strip threads through sprockets and the screen awakens. One minor spatial drift: “downstairs” is mentioned before we know the booth is above.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.8)
    The aurora-lit archway, bronze heart, and frost-laced lichen are not mere backdrop; they constrain pacing (counting paces beneath curtains of fire) and charge the final image as the aurora bows in emerald reverence. Sensory selection narrows under exhaustion—raw cheeks, moth-wing skull pressure—keeping detail purposeful and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    Bioluminescent grains, frozen clock, and geothermal caverns are filtered through Silas’s guard-eye; each detail constrains movement and later charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, and the salt flats–cavern descent tracks without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mechanical rainforest and derelict observatory are rendered with tactile specificity; the gear and mirrored plates constrain Jonas’s final choice. Sensory hierarchy (oak gears vs. willow pistons) guides navigation and later memory-mapping. One minor spatial drift: the cliff of unanswered sentences appears without intermediate anchor, but the final image recharges the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    Harbor, inlet, ridgeway, and lantern are vivid and selective; the unlit lantern constrains the final choice and charges the closure image, satisfying the 9+ gate, though some mist descriptors verge on decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cobalt fortress, icicles on violins, and the piano lid sealed by a single screw all constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“vents exhaled the distant scent of axle grease”). Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    The temple library’s dust, chained atlases, and mirror dais constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered; “blue dusk between worlds” sets tone without stalling momentum. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from scroll corridors to glass hall.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sea-level station, hydrophone, atlas and labyrinth actively constrain tactics: negative elevation readings force the descent, rope marks map depth rings, laminated logbooks dictate route choice; final stone doorway is both literal architecture and metaphorical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    The repair bay’s ruptured doors, oily dust, and dead floodlights are not backdrop; they dictate barefoot pain and dictate stealth. The stone circle’s ink-black pillars vibrate, constraining Maris’s stance and later guiding her ascent. Even the satellite’s flick of thrusters is a setting detail that becomes a choice lever. Environment, body, and tool converge to charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.0)
    The crater’s heat, sinter cave, fumarole posts, and tamarisk raft all actively constrain tactics and anchor spatial logic; the ash-laden air and scalding springs are sensory, purposeful, and re-charged in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Glass corridor, salt wind, and trembling greenhouse wall act as micro-settings that constrain breath and choice; the shattered lighthouse lens reappears in the closing image, charging the pearl metaphor. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse-library-sea-cave triad is vivid, selective, and constrains tactics: shelves curve, mirror cracks leak tide, kelp ribbon pins the Moon. Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis—salt-burn, wet linen, blue fungus. Environment actively tilts and floods, forcing descent. Micro-setting (mirror shard, tarot card) charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    Wind-sculpted tents, plateau dust, and vanishing ink form a lived micro-setting that directly constrains options: the very ground becomes an unstable time door. Sensory selection sharpens crisis-time perceptions (ozone/cold iron), charging the final image without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Library’s breathing corridors, frost-bitten shelves, and camera-blind Alcove Seven actively constrain Ila’s choices; the carbon case and cracked pane function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Weather-buoy network is sketched with tactile specificity (capacitor solvent, green text complaining). Sensory hierarchy mirrors POV priorities: archival chill > auditory echoes > visual glare. Environment shapes tactics throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.0)
    The glass dome, thorn scars, and warm canvas scraps are tactile and selective. The roses-as-shields image constrains tactics during negotiation. Spatial choreography stays clean: debris scars the glass, vents are closed, petals form rings. Weather and light (peach dusk, dawn blaze) mirror emotional modulation without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sound-wave garden is not backdrop but instrument: vibrations pool, hedges shed UV petals, the rail spike anchors the net. Micro-setting (basin of pooled vibrations) constrains placement and choice. Final image recharges the opening “silver ripples” into gentle equilibrium. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    Observatory above clouds is more than postcard; its echoing stone and half-open dome physically amplify Amelia’s steps and final vow, constraining secrecy. Brass orrery functions as micro-setting that reweights meaning when she scars it with the nib. Sensory economy favors altitude chill and lightning flash over broad vistas.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    The laboratory of lost sounds, broken skylight, and meteor hush are vivid yet selective; the amber becomes micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Spatial anchors arrive early and hold. One minor drift: “meteor hush” is lovely but risks atmospheric repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    The grotto’s mineral breath and lilac dust are tactile constraints that guide Felicity’s micro-choices; the mist and salt air mirror the emergent hush.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    Plaza, ash, cracked minaret, and stepping-stone mosaic filter through Aarik’s retrocognitive sense; every tactile detail (barefoot on cracks, glaze half-peeled) constrains his empathy-forge ethic. Body-as-setting and tessera-as-tool both charge the final image when shard is pocketed beside his heart. Selective sensory economy—no tourist catalog—yet “shattered sky” silver-vein shift feels slightly convenient, not earned by prior physics. Otherwise spatial choreography clean; weather (wind, ash) directly modulates sound-experiment.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    The hedge-maze orchard is tactile, luminous, and directly constrains the climax: the velvet curtains materialize between pear trees, anchoring the final braid of realities.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    The light-painting studio is more than backdrop; shutter arrays and geode sliver actively constrain tactics and color the final ember.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.1)
    Cave humidity, floating water, and fossil glow are not backdrop but instruments that constrain movement and translate emotion into grammar. The obsidian corridor’s blank wall reweights all prior strata, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    Amber warehouse functions as micro-setting: glowing glass constraints (visibility, fragility) directly shape Lenra’s decision to open the doors and risk weather. Buttons, hourglass, canyon jar, and wind-buffeted cliffs are handled and navigated, guiding every on-page choice. Sensory palette (quartz dust, canyon resonance, moonlit gusts) is selective, urgent, and POV-filtered rather than scenic.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bluff’s thawing snow and silver mist constrain every move—footing, visibility, and the ephemeral cipher. The pillbox-as-micro-setting charges the final image when its ticking merges with pulse. Selective sensory detail (rime on coat, brass gear as “gold seed”) keeps economy tight. Weather never resolves conflict, only complicates it—meets situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Harbor, tower, and mirrored chamber are rendered with tactile specificity; moonlit water and algae-slick ladder constrain Milo’s movements. The prism itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room gaps. One minor over-description (“billions of captured moonbeams”) nudges it below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tidal library’s rocking marble aisles and mist-threaded footsteps are selective, sensuous, and tied to choice: the sundial’s reflective slide literally carves the descent path. Micro-setting (brass sundial, kelp-bound scrolls) constrains packing decisions. Only the stone circle’s pre-wind claim edges toward exposition rather than lived texture.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lotus temple, mirrored shards, and floating envelope stones constrain movement and echo theme; the pond receives the paper boat, charging the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful. Spatial choreography is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    The booth’s “blinking red LEDs like candles in a crypt” and the idle subwoofers at the amphitheater are not mere scenery; they supply the literal tools Mina weaponizes. Micro-setting (mixing board, antenna) constrains every tactical move, charging the final auroral image.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tower’s narrowing throat, the breathing walls, the star-choked dome—all constrain tactics and charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“tasted of iron,” “stone throat pressed her shoulders”). The organ’s acoustic architecture is both tool and setting, integrated into every move.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.9)
    The quarry shadows and misted acoustics cage the suspects while the mask ribbon doubles as micro-setting when it stains the pool, but the quarry itself never physically constrains action enough for 9-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    The weather station, buoy, and silt corridor constrain every tactical move; the copper nail functions as micro-setting that charges the final exchange. Sensory hierarchy (wet wool clouds, epileptic red sensors) filters through Marla’s urgency. One minor drift: “moth-eaten” smile is vivid but not leveraged later.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mountain pullout anchors time/place quickly; scaffold wrap becomes micro-tool that enables the pixelated corridor. Spatial logic stays tight; frost and wind pressure choices (catwalk emerges from music vibrating beams).

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    The abandoned circus train is tactile: “boxcar doors gaped like spent lions,” wind rattling trapeze chains. Dust-polished mahogany and straw underfoot constrain movement and mood. The kyat and krona left fluttering in the draft charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent; bodies and props track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observatory is no backdrop; the dome slit, red chart lamps, and phosphor screen constrain bodily movement and frame the decisive alignment. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira’s professional priorities—starlight before perfume. Final image of “spoken light” recharges the setting’s tools as instruments of communal healing. Slight excess of lyrical sky description in paragraph one nudges it down.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Expanding circles on water, spectral apples, ice mirror, and lake’s memory collectively shape tactics; orchard vortex itself blocks and then yields passage. Environment constrains choices, then charges the final image of bow loosened after battle.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cobalt glade’s “blue glow of dateless twilight” is more than postcard; its air density and root grip physically steady Lysander after the cut. Micro-setting (his own scarred skin) constrains the redesign. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Falls just short of 9.0 because the arboretum remains off-stage and thus less integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Catacomb orchard is no postcard: roots constrain movement, skull soil forces moral calculus, pale apples absorb confessed futures. Lantern beams and starlight bracket the single scene, their shifting glow charging the final image. Environment directly shapes the bargain mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Quarry’s limestone lungs and moonlit ladders constrain descent and echo, charging the final image. Selective sensory layering (dust motes like glitter, wind as fading chord) filters through Gideon’s roadie eye. Locker and reels function as micro-setting that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    The magnetic arbor is not backdrop but active constraint: magnetite vines guide motion, suspension fields lift platforms, lightning pauses mid-fork. Micro-setting (seed pod) constrains the final choice—its photon lattice literally maps childhood streets, forcing Aram to accept conservation over retrieval. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (iron-tasting air, ion dust). No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography is exact.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Crystal caves constrain movement and supply the resonant architecture that enables the crowning ritual; the pearl’s mirrored surface literally charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“torch revealed corridors tiled with quartz”). Only the ferry ride lacks tactile specificity, a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Station, tunnel, and rivulet are vivid, selective, and constrain choices (hatch location dictated by runoff). The patched accordion and dripping culvert reappear in the final image, charging closure. One minor spatial drift: accordion is slung over shoulder but later appears in Mara’s hands without transfer beat.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    The fog, glowing shelves, and silverleaf mirror are selective, sensory, and purposeful; the library itself constrains choice by demanding silence. Spatial choreography is coherent, and the setting charges the final image without ornamental drift.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    The velvet observatory, corridor seven’s muffled snow-walls, and the bronze door’s perforated constellations are tactile and selective. The violin itself functions as micro-setting, constraining the final choice by its refusal to melt. Spatial choreography is clean; distances and textures track. One minor slip—“dust that smelled of stars” leans poetic excess, but it does not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    The skyborne grotto, aurora, and bone-lined vaults are not backdrop; they narrow Lysandra’s tactics—radio static is mined for the admiral’s last syllable, the aurora’s green dictates pigment choice. The emerald chip functions as micro-setting that seals the circuit and becomes the coffin’s navigating light.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Mossy slab, clouded‐quartz skylight, limestone scalloped by earlier vows, and the ash tree are vivid micro-anchors; however, the grotto itself does not mechanically constrain Simeon’s climactic choice—only the ash does—thus capped just below 8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.0)
    Cedar smell, wet shale steps, and rising tide pressure each attempt to read the chimes. The hollow mirror shard becomes mini-setting: carried, dropped, then relinquished—each beat alters context. The lighthouse steam-lung metaphor constrains pacing and anchors visible stakes; specific sensory anchor remains throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    Floating platform, iron-singing grotto, and mirrored pond constrain every beat: magnetic tug on the pebble, chalk circle hovering with impossible geometry, still water that re-runs its own ripples. Sensory hierarchy is Mira’s—she reads rings as sentences. Final image recharges the pond-as-mirror, tying setting to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    The canyon’s towers of bone, wind-scripted dust, and spiraling birds are not backdrop but active agents: they test devotion, map hollows, and seal the pact.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ambered deck, burnt-helium air, and bruised nebulae are selective, urgent, and filtered through Ikram’s sensory hierarchy. The brass bowl’s resonance and the coin’s vibration constrain the casting ritual, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Just shy of 9 because the deck itself does not physically limit the exit—it’s more atmospheric than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    The brass floor and fractured prism actively constrain action: the fissure splits stone, forcing the protagonist to angle shards that scatter light into veins on the void, charging the final naming. Setting is character.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    The nocturnal arbor above clouds is no postcard; its sway and bark bite constrain her balance and timing, while the parachute buckle micro-setting anchors memory and present choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered and purposeful, though one or two phrases verge on silver-filigree excess.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.1)
    The floating rock dojo, brain-jar, and orchid-rainfall are vivid and selective; the jar constrains the final choice by opening itself. Spatial choreography is coherent. A sliver more tactile interaction with the dojo stones would have lifted this to 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.1)
    The workshop’s shelved gears and moonlit brook are filtered through Maren’s puzzle-maker eye; every object is potential mechanism.

One slip: “clockwork order” is slightly expository.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is not postcard; the cracked neon, beetle drones, and copper foil cloak constrain tactics. Micro-setting (mailbox as lighthouse) charges the final image when lightning welds envelopes. Ozone scent and cobalt dusk filter through Lorin’s courier priorities. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is never backdrop: the rusted circus train, mineral-sequined cavern, and wind-bell chimes constrain every move—the carousel’s gears, the hidden stair, the halo’s reflection in the pool. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—“misting hush,” “chrome rails,” “lunar calm”—each filtering through Marlo’s carpenter’s eye. The environment literally supplies the tools (copper pipe, cedar) that enable the final restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    The scientific poetry library is no postcard; its non-Euclidean shelving and bioluminescent footnotes actively shape Hollis’s tactics. The scarf-as-micro-setting constrains his final choice by storing memories that must be returned to the drawer. Sensory selection (fluorescent half-light, chalk dust like snowfall) is filtered through Hollis’s nocturnal priorities. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from stacks to chalk disk to corridor and back.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is anchored early and constrains choice: the luminous absence in the cliffs literally guides Callix to Isle Meridian and later bleeds into warm presence at closure.

Micro-setting (the cracked lantern globe) becomes the projection surface that enables the climax. Spatial choreography is clean; every object is handled and re-handled.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    The forgotten library reads as body-territory: “aisles were lit only by an afternoon shadow caught in glass” constrains the climactic weaponization of that same shadow; micro-objects—tea cups, rice-paper scrolls—are tactile tools whose geometries shape choices. Spatial choreography through backward motion is crisp. Only one hiccup: “elderly hull” is vague; hull implies buoyancy yet the library floats—micro-logic gnat that does not disturb closure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.8)
    The waterfall, mist, and moss function as micro-setting that constrains the ritual: the pool’s edge becomes loom, spray becomes shuttle. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered and purposeful. The pear sapling itself, charged with color, anchors the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
