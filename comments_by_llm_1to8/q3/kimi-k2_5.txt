  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.1)
    Canyon setting is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (frost silvering sandstone, red rock like frozen flame) and filtered through Mara's glass-artist lens. The frost patterns and charcoal crates anchor the plot, and the cave mouth's concealment by "fall of red rock" ties directly to the discovery beat. Spatial choreography is clean (rim → floor → cave), and the environment subtly mirrors the internal arc (burned studio → frozen morning → hidden preservation). The setting constrains the search and charges the final image of canyon falling away, meeting the 9+ test for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.1)
    The winterglass conservatory is vivid, specific, and functionally integrated: its translucent panels filter twilight into trauma-colored blues/violets, and the walls amplify heat-map projections, turning the space into a "luminous cathedral." The tuning fork case, frost-kissed bench, and thermal patterns constrain Mara's movements and choices. The environment charges the final image—her reflection "steady, whole, silently singing in colors"—making the setting indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underwater library's marble columns "without a hint of barnacle or rot" and books floating "like schools of silver fish" create vivid impossible-space texture. The broken lens heats in her hands, the spiral staircase corkscrews "through liquid stone," and the dome that "should not fit" all constrain and charge Marian's ascent. The lens fixture "that had waited centuries for exactly this breakage" makes the setting an active participant in closure. Micro-setting (the lens, her boots on impossible steps) drives the ending's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    The terra-cotta arbor anchors early and returns at closure, the ridge's scrub pines and needle-strewn path guide Maya's movements, and the ceramic pot placement ("where the terra-cotta met the crumbling mortar") constrains her tactic. Spatial choreography is coherent across the descent and deliveries. The arbor's tactile detail (cool bell surface, clay beams) and the amplified quiet of the ridge modulate with pressure, charging the final bell-strike image.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.1)
    The viaduct's "breathing" and wisteria-in-bloom are vivid, and the foggy twilight charges the atmosphere. However, the gorge, masonry, and iron rivets remain postcard descriptions without constraining Maya's choices. The camera obscura projects sparks but does not shape her tactics—she stands, looks, and presses the tear without environmental friction. Spatial choreography is thin; her collapse and the camera's fall are the only physical moves tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.4)
    The living bridge garden is vividly textured ("willow and wisteria," "hornbeam cathedral arch") and the hyperbolic geometry creates spatial specificity. However, the environment remains descriptive rather than constraining choices or altering tactics. Elias walks through the garden without encountering obstacles, resource limits, or spatial pressures that force micro-decisions. The setting charges the final image with atmosphere but does not materially shape the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned carnival prize redemption center is vividly rendered: rotting counter, water-damaged piano, dusty glass cases, scratches on the concrete pillar. The chain's worn circle in the floor and the hydraulic panel beside the piano supply concrete constraints that shape Elara's positioning and the vault's mechanics. The setting actively pressures the closure: her chain's length blocks the stairway, functioning as a living gate, and the descending darkness frames the final image of seeds waiting below.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sunken greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is vivid and purposeful: the "bell jar holding twelve dead trees," the "rusted crown" of wrecks, and the ashen forge all constrain Mara's work and charge the final image. The aurora's shifting pitch (G-sharp to "blue-gray chord that tasted of copper") filters through her synesthesia, grounding sensory detail in POV. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The forge's transition from "memory of heat" to instrument of imprinting to final cooling tracks causally and shapes the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    Emerald Station is vividly rendered: amber light, brass fixtures, emerald tiles glowing under moonlight. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, filtered through Elara's practiced thief's eye. The station's spatial layout (platform, customs office, corridor, bench) remains coherent across her moves. The jar of moonbeams and the portrait function as micro-setting that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement. Minor deduction: the station does not meaningfully constrain a tactical choice; it serves primarily as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned control room, radio mast, melting ice, and rusted hot plate supply concrete anchors early and recur with purpose. The glassblower's tools (blowpipe, glass spheres) constrain her craft and the ice core samples melting in their cases charge the thawing-heart metaphor with physical consequence. The final image of transparent spheres "glinting on the consoles like frozen prayers" transforms setting detail into closure resonance, meeting the 9+ gate criterion that environment charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rusted library, telescope array, and compromised railing are anchored early and constrain the final confrontation—Kai's knowledge of structural weakness enables the tactical choice. Sensory detail is selective (cold seashell, whispering stars, metal stairs echoing) and filtered through Kai's acrophobia. The setting functions as micro-setting that alters tactics, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Deduction: the "star-scattered void" and "indifferent stars" read generic; the plaster cast "half-buried beneath the telescope's base" lacks spatial grounding (how large is the base? how did Kai know to look there?), and the parking lot arrival feels like a postcard exit rather than lived choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    The storm-tossed ridge fort supplies vivid, purpose-driven detail: the flooded courtyard with black pebbles, arrow slits that channel wind frequency, and cold grooves worn by sentries all ground the oracle's methodology. The pebbles function as micro-setting that constrains her ritual and charges the closure image when they arrange themselves into patterns. Spatial choreography remains clear as she moves through colonnade to courtyard, and sensory detail—flaking gold leaf, wind texture, marbled hush—is filtered through her professional obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.1)
    The frozen courtyard is vividly rendered with specificity (crystalline tiles, arborescent ice structures, violet shadows). Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through Seven's sensors. The violin and fountain constrain the discovery beat and charge the final image by returning as the bow "turned to frost instantly." The setting's temporal liminal quality—"outside normal causality"—enables the loop mechanic and shapes the transformation, satisfying the micro-setting test.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    The crystal whispering forecourt after rain functions as both atmosphere and constraint: its acoustic resonance mirrors the theme of transparency, and the rain-soaked setting provides the cathedral of sound where "secrets had no mass." The projector lens is handled twice (examination, then pocketed by Julian), transforming from discovery tool to mirror. Spatial choreography is clean (desk, forecourt, east colonnade), and sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("quartzite pavers that hummed with acoustic memory"). The micro-setting (forecourt) charges the final image and constrains the emotional exchange, meeting the 9+ gate. Minor issue: "mahogany groove where thousands of tickets had been torn" is vivid but slightly ornamental, not revisited.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.4)
    The garden maze is vividly rendered with selective, purpose-driven detail: dual-state ivy (green and ash), hedges as remembered entities, the fountain of calcified promises. These elements reflect Elara's interiority and philosophy. The marbles constrain her ritual choices and charge the final image. However, spatial choreography within the maze remains vague—we do not track her movement through corridors in a way that alters tactics or creates friction. The body and tools (velvet pouch, nightshade oil) are present but do not visibly limit options.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.1)
    The frost-creped dome, violet-and-rust twilight, and permafrost ore deposits anchor the xenobiology station vividly. The "mechanically warm" air and titanium lever provide tactile detail. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—Kael could validate his theory in almost any lab. The spatial choreography (control room, observation dome, Drakes above) remains clear but largely decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    The flooded pit, submerged bench, and lantern-lit reflections are vivid and purposeful. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's musical profession (unstruck chords, liquid harmonies, resonating chamber). The setting constrains choice: lantern angles dictate her position, water depth signals progress. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The "in between space" motif charges the final image when it collapses into coherence. Minor limit: occupational detail (cellist, conductor's podium) remains atmospheric rather than technically specific in ways that test her skill.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mountain weather station is vividly rendered through triple-glazed window, anemometer shadow, satellite uplink hum, and steel struts contracting in cold—all filtered through Elara's professional attention. The setting constrains choice: she moves along margins, avoids the transmission console center, and the old logbooks yield the botanical illustration that becomes the story's pivot object. The auroral dawn and frost-rimed desk charge the final image. Micro-setting (the desk, the glass, the console) functions as purposeful constraint rather than postcard description, and the anemometer's closing presence reinforces her interpretive uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tunnel is not merely described but pressures choice: soot-blackened bricks, ballast that "hadn't felt maintenance in fifteen years," corroded pipes, and the "iron ribs of the ceiling arching overhead like the spine of some buried leviathan" all embody decay that constrains movement and discovery. The beaded valve wheel—a physical object—charges the final third: "hundreds of glass beads...creating a shimmering mandala that caught her light in fractured rainbows, each bead representing a prayer or a name." Sensory selection reflects Mara's investigative focus (clicking beads, static hiss, cool metal and smooth glass) and urgency narrows perception to evidence. The wheel's specificity (sixteen distinct colors, weathered beads, corroded pipe mount) makes it a tactile proof of grief and necessity. The tunnel's breath—air pressure through ventilation shafts—is filtered through her skepticism, anchoring setting in character perception rather than mysticism.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    Vivid sensory detail—vines on shelves, roots cracking masonry, obsidian absorbing sound—anchors the catacombs and refuge. The swan functions as a micro-setting object handled across multiple beats. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; it remains backdrop for contemplation. Spatial choreography is clear, and the world rules (library decay, river silt) stay consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sage Ridge is richly drawn with silver-green sage, rocky soil, exposed roots, and temperature drop during eclipse—all filtering through Elara's practiced awareness. The eastern slope's thin soil and exposed roots provide concrete setting detail that mirrors vulnerability. The eclipse physically alters the environment (temperature, light, shadow) and creates the therapeutic pocket. The locket functions as micro-setting, constraining the teaching moment and charging the final image when it catches returning sunlight. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    The silo library is vividly rendered with "bronze quiet," "concrete curves," and "shafts of amber light," and the fireplace on the third sub-level provides spatial specificity. Elara's action of pressing her palm against the wall and feeling stored memories shows the environment as an active constraint that shapes her method of excavation. The setting charges the final image when the silo "held its breath," making the micro-setting (wall, fireplace, archive) integral to the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.9)
    The lighthouse, rocky island, Atlantic crash, and iron table anchor the setting vividly and consistently. The rotating beam and microdot specs function as recurring objects, but they do not constrain a choice or alter tactics—they remain atmospheric rather than causal. The final image (Elias watching from the gallery as the boat departs) uses the setting to charge the moment, barely meeting the 9+ gate test. Sensory detail is selective and effective, filtered through Elias's reflective stance.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dimensional anchor, loop pedal, palette, and cathedral stonework are present and vivid. The "gray so absolute it seemed to drink the candlelight" and the "texture of unraveled stillness" offer strong sensory specificity. Yet spatial choreography remains vague—Elian kneels, traces a line, stands—without clear micro-setting constraints that alter his tactics. The palette returns at the end ("dried to dust"), but this reprise does not demonstrably narrow a choice or charge the closure image with environmental cost; it reads more as thematic echo than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.4)
    The frozen lake, glass spire, and dawn light are vividly rendered and anchor the single scene cleanly. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's perception. However, the nautilus shell and mapped memories remain symbolic props rather than environmental constraints that alter a choice or charge the final image in a tactical sense. Spatial choreography is coherent; micro-setting (shell in hand, condensation on glass) appears but does not constrain action meaningfully at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.1)
    The glowing viaduct and bioluminescent algae are vivid but remain postcard description; the procedurally generated architecture materializes without constraining a single choice. Spatial choreography (hovering, descending spiral) is legible but the environment never pressures tactics or the final moment. The tablet warms and crumbles, yet this is asserted effect rather than micro-setting that alters her path.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cavern's acoustic properties—"thick rock and hanging tapestries that swallowed every sharp sound"—directly enable the closure by creating the mirrored, backward-folding sound. The drum skin and phonograph are handled tactilely across multiple beats, constraining Elara's perception. Spatial choreography is clean (workbench, back chamber, horn positioned above drum). The autumn wind signal and "faint rustle of turning seasons" recur to frame the moment but remain decorative. The broken needle's physical state (broken tip "should have rendered it useless") charges the final touch without invoking symbolic convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    The courtyard at dusk is rendered with vivid, selective detail—jasmine vines, moss-covered flagstones, dry fountain—and functions as micro-setting: the lateral path along the trellis line mirrors her evasion method and constrains her movement under surveillance pressure. The copper antennas and amber safety lamp anchor her profession in tactile objects. The final image of rain falling equally on courtyard and quarantine zone charges the ending by embodying the theme that atmosphere recognizes no boundary. Spatial choreography (gate → trellis → fountain → workshop) tracks cleanly throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto's heat, clay texture, and fossilized strata constrain the poet's exploration and charge the final image. Micro-setting (the rope on clay, the poet's clay-filled nails) provides tactile anchors that focus attention. The terra-cotta grotto and energy beings shape the poet's meditation without becoming postcard description. Setting details recur purposefully and charge the closure ("terra-cotta shards").

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sunken greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is vivid and purposeful: glass walls "licking at the tide," barnacles on panes, rusted ribs creating "a cathedral of decay." The setting directly enables Mara's ritual—she gathers driftwood from the wrecks, uses their metal bones as resonant chambers, and the humid air transmits vibrations. The micro-setting (mendicant's bowl over fire) functions as both tool and resonator, constraining her method. Sensory detail is filtered through her acoustic perception (the bowl's hum matching her heartbeat, thermal currents singing). The final image shows the greenhouse "breathing with new resonance," charging closure with environmental transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    The amber grotto is vividly rendered ("resinous walls glowing with captured sunsets," static electricity as atmospheric whisper) and constrains Kael's sensing method. The blotter petal and vials are handled across beats. Spatial choreography is clear (altar, walls, client approach). The grotto actively participates in the closure by supplying what Kael's chemistry lacks, charging the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful, filtered through Kael's professional POV. The setting shapes the transformation outcome, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cliffside library under stars provides vivid sensory anchors (glass ceiling, constellations, salt air, spiral staircase). However, the setting remains ornamental; it does not constrain a choice or shape the closure. Spatial choreography is generally clear, though the relationship between harbor, cliffs, museum, and library could be tighter. The micro-setting (locket photo, catalog cards) appears but does not alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.1)
    The crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, and crater are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (fruit "like frozen starlight," air "tasted of copper and old songs"). The arbor appears in gatherings and the final dedication, charging the closure image. However, the setting does not constrain a choice—Kael's bridge-building proceeds without spatial obstacles or resource scarcity that alter tactics. The micro-setting (reeds, volcanic glass) enriches atmosphere but remains ornamental to the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rooftop canal system constrains Elara's journey: she can only navigate during the forty-minute window when gravity loosens, and the waterways drain as the giant wakes. The pendant's physical handling (held over water, rotated, pressed against the cage) grounds the fantastical mechanics in tactile action. Spatial choreography remains clear—gondola on canal, towers connected by waterways, highest tower with forked spires—and the draining silver waterfalls at closure charge the final image with urgency. The setting actively shapes the plot: without the canal's time limit and the tower's resonance chamber, the story's pressure dissolves.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cavern orchard is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: stalactite drips, mineral gleam, pale sunless pears, root-nets. The mosaic stepping stone with its chipped wren constrains Elian's ritual and charges the final recognition. Sensory selection is strong (damp air, cool spheres, limestone dust) and filtered through Elian's focus. The setting shapes the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion, but spatial choreography remains static—Elian kneels, stands, walks—without dynamic interaction that alters tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    Setting detail is specific and purposeful: rusted junction boxes, pipe chases, heating grates, and the rare books room all constrain Maya's movements and anchor her caching choices. The "sapphire hush of pre-dawn" and "fluorescent emergency lights" create a coherent sensory envelope. Spatial choreography is clean—crawl spaces, tool lockers, boiler room, third-floor carrel, rare books room—and the environment directly shapes Maya's tactics (she places fragments where vulnerable people shelter). The body and small objects (thermos, flashlight) function as micro-setting. This satisfies the 9+ quick test, but minor slips in occupational depth (no sign of actual maintenance duties or tool use beyond carrying fragments) and a slight postcard quality to "sapphire hush" keep it from the high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.1)
    The mossy trellis functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice: its survival through "circuitously sincere tangles" and the moss's absorption method model the release Maren adopts. The post-deluge atmosphere (dripping lattice, saturated soil, viscous air) charges the entire frame and mirrors her internal saturation point. Storm season provides both literal pressure and metaphoric weight, and the linden leaf's physical state (browned edges, stubborn veins) directly informs her realization. The greenhouse as "glass cathedral of domination" offers clear spatial contrast, though we never enter it on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tidal island, causeway, rain trails, and sinkhole constrain movement and choice: Elara must navigate by erosion syntax, time the exchange to the tide, and descend into the unearthed cavity. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("squelching clay that smelled of rust and ancient cellars"). The brooch, chamber, and convergence point all charge the final image of sketching from memory. The setting is not ornamental; it supplies the logic for discovery and the rhythm of exposure/submersion that mirrors the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    The musical crystal cave is richly detailed with purposeful sensory work: "harmonic overtones," "phosphorescent fungi," "stalactites contributing singular tones." The cave pearl's warmth and dimmed pulse at the end subtly shifts, and spatial choreography (shadows on three facets, levitation from pedestal) remains coherent. The setting pressures Elara's role as witness and anchor, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but the cave's agency (consciousness seeking a vessel) slightly blurs whether environment or unseen entity drives the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ivory harbor's post-rain textures (waterlogged planks, wet luminescence, pale stones like bones) are vivid and atmospheric. The valve—tarnished green, humming with residual purpose—functions as micro-setting that constrains Kael's archival choice and charges the ending image. Spatial choreography is clear (pier, customs house, archive tower), and the setting reflects Kael's focus on absence and reconstruction. However, the environment is more backdrop than active pressure; it does not significantly narrow his options or alter his tactics during the core scene.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    Cathedral Station's starlit vault and cracks are vividly rendered and anchor the scene early. The phantom punch and train exist as atmosphere more than constraint—Elara's choice to use the punch is unopposed, so the setting supplies spectacle rather than pressure. The cracks guide her feet but do not force a trade-off; she follows them without spatial friction. Micro-setting (the ticket, the punch) charges the final image but does not alter tactics. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory tower is vividly rendered with salt wind, copper-green comet, limestone bones conducting whale song, and the magic square tile embedded in mortar—concrete details that constrain Mara's late-night work and shape the renovation design. Spatial choreography is clean (dome, parapet, library, meditation niches). The tower functions as both setting and instrument, qualifying as micro-setting that charges the final image when visitors arrange cushions in the new acoustics.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prismatic escondite and solar storm are vivid and specific: walls refract possibilities, magnetic fields warp local physics, dimensions fold "like paper origami." Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though Kael's movement through "shifting corridors" remains somewhat abstract. The amulet fragment's warmth and final shattering constrain the climax moment, charging the ending image. Sensory selection leans heavily visual/conceptual; other senses are underdeveloped, and the environment functions more as backdrop than active constraint on tactics in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.4)
    The funeral home prep room is vividly rendered with specific sensory anchors—cobalt glass, chemical tanks, industrial refrigeration hum, casket storage. Spatial choreography is mostly clear. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image in a meaningful way; it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than pressure. The 2:17 AM guard rotation and server room remain abstract, lacking the micro-detail that would make the breach tactically legible.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bonsai labyrinth, fluorescent lamp, and gold leaf constrain Elias's ritual: the labyrinth's "corridors that led nowhere and everywhere" keeps him circling back, the lamp's 5:47 hum dictates his timing, and the gold's adherence properties shape his restraint. Micro-setting (the bench, the lamp, the battered notepad) functions as the operative environment. The final image charges these elements—dawn light through miniature pines strikes gilded pages, throwing prisms—making the setting indispensable to closure. Spatial choreography (workshop enclosed by bonsai, valley below in dusk) remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.1)
    The container labyrinth is vividly rendered with rust, corrugated steel, salt wind erosion, and spatial choreography (seventh stack from crane, blue container, gaps between stacks). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the archivist's textural perception. The poison-label object and container setting charge the final image and recur with shifting weight. The port environment constrains the archivist's movement and supplies the fragments they collect, meeting the micro-setting test for choice constraint and closure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    The abandoned observatory, shattered telescopes, and half-finished cello supply vivid, selective detail that coheres with the elegiac tone. The cello's maple body and the cliff's granite anchor micro-setting choices. The shell warming in her pocket and the resonant hums shaking dust from telescopes demonstrate that objects constrain and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate criterion for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    The raft city's sensory texture is vivid and purposeful: "damp wall," "rusted steel," "neon-drenched corridors," "layered graffiti that covered every surface like barnacles." The carnival's spatial logic is coherent—aerialists above gambling dens, central promenade, lower decks—and the graffiti-covered walls serve as both setting and tactical medium. The foundation stone chip's "irregular edge" is used twice (once to authenticate, once to score a fresh glyph), constraining Maya's method. Micro-setting qualifier is met: the walls and their graffiti language directly enable her resistance strategy and charge the final image of messages spreading invisibly.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    The moonlit summit constrains multiple choices: extreme cold forces her to wrap heating coils and decide whether to retreat; the terminator line's movement dictates when she can photograph; regolith and fusion-glass veins provide the material for her chemical message. Micro-setting (titanium plaque, spectrograph, camera aperture) is handled tactilely and shapes tactical moves. The dawning light transformation—"cathedral of gold and obsidian"—charges the final image without tourist-catalog excess. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities: she notices stratigraphic data and interference patterns first.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mist-coated rail depot is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (steam blending with fog, iron beams, dripping water) and the examination basin becomes a functional micro-setting that constrains Mira's repair method. The harbor and departing ship provide spatial pressure that tracks throughout. The skylight, copper basin, and water medium are integrated into her working process rather than merely described. The environment successfully supports both atmosphere and the specialized repair technique, charging the final image when the drone ascends "toward the high window."

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.1)
    The rusted outpost and frozen lake are vividly rendered through corrugated skin shedding iron flakes, condensation fractals on glass, and the worrying stillness of ice. The condensation pattern constrains Marlow's method and charges the final image when the outpost "still weep[s] with the pattern" as he transmits. Spatial choreography is clean (outpost to lake center, falcon overhead). Sensory hierarchy reflects professional focus: thermal signatures, grid lines, coordinates. The environment is purposeful, not ornamental, and the phrasebook's dog-ear functions as micro-setting object that alters his interpretive tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archway constrains her choice (keystone dissonance forces the quickened pace) and charges the final image (singing, mortar flowing). Cobblestones produce distinct notes and glow amber—micro-setting details that enable her method. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional focus (tuning-fork vibration, stone dust, street hum). The ebony fork and cobblestones function as setting elements at this scale, directly shaping tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.1)
    The underwater temple is vividly rendered with bioluminescent algae, coral spires, and preservation fields. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout descent and escape. The crystal vial and altar function as micro-setting that charges the final sequence. Oxygen gauge and thermocline ground the dive in plausible detail, and the body's antique suit anchors historical depth. The setting constrains Elara's choices (forty-minute limit, sealing defenses) and the distant surface in the final image reweights the lonesome splendor motif.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse's vertical spiral, copper light, and reef shadow create spatial pressure and recur with shifted meaning at closure. The confessional lattice functions as tool and constraint (breaking wind into "manageable fictions"), charging the final descent. The cellar and lantern-room anchor the vertical stakes. Micro-setting (lattice, precipice platform) constrains the hover choice and charges the ending image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion, but sensory hierarchy under stress is thin—perception remains lyric-catalog rather than urgency-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse with mercury-rich soils, phosphorescent fruits, and iron ribs supplies vivid, specific anchors that distinguish this setting from generic gothic backdrops. The carved stone bead and the winter-cracked fields function as micro-settings that constrain Julian's final action (he must bury it "where the frost splits the earth"), meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Minor orientation slip: "endless night" and "starless void" are described early but the mechanism (is this supernatural stasis or a natural polar winter?) remains vague, reducing the sense of lived-in constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.4)
    The red canyon labyrinth is vivid and specific—tide pool depressions, sleepwalking paths polished into sinuous channels, vertical shafts, a natural amphitheater around a dry well. These details are filtered through Maren's poetic attention and recur across the narrative, charging the final image when she sits "among the tide pool depressions, now filling with morning mist." The setting constrains her method (she must step where sleepwalkers stepped) and the final seam occurs at the heart-chamber, giving spatial choreography a role in the closure. However, the labyrinth's constraints feel more atmospheric than tactical; the story does not show how a wrong step or missed path would alter her options in a given beat.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered with skeletal architecture, roots snaking through bones, and pale apples fed by tragedy. The sundial base and its carved hours function as micro-setting, constraining Elara's reconstruction choices and charging the final shadow-fall image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the excavation frame (myrrh, turned earth, dusty beams), and the environment evolves causally as she clears bone and loam. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the orchard grid, and the setting's logic (trees marking interrupted journeys) integrates tightly with theme and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    The golden arcade at dawn supplies vivid, purpose-driven detail: chrome girders, amber light, dormant pinball machines, CRT glow used to reveal indentations. The setting constrains choice—Kael must use the vintage racing game's screen and the sidewalk chalk left by children. Sensory hierarchy (chrome turning to mirrors, rainbow dust on ebony) is filtered through Kael's focused attention. The arcade's "shared obsolescence" charges the final image when it "seemed to sigh," directly supporting the thematic repricing of dying traditions.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt observatory is sensuously rendered ("autumn sunlight into something deep and marine") and the space actively shapes Mira's method: the dome "held sounds like a shell holds ocean," the eternal candle provides constancy for her calculations. Spatial choreography is clean (alcove, workbench, spiral stairs). The autumn timeframe and falling copper leaves supply recurring atmospheric pressure. The observatory as both literal workspace and resonance chamber charges the final image of "silence still intact."

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mangrove setting is vivid and specific ("aerial roots tangled in salt and phosphorescent shadow"), but it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint: the labyrinth guides Elara forward via spiritual corridor without forcing navigation choice. The gargoyle shard's "holy water residue" reacting to spirit vibrations offers one micro-setting beat, and moonlight triggering healing provides another, yet neither materially alters her tactics—she proceeds as planned. Sensory detail is dense but often ornamental (e.g., "drowned cathedral walls" is metaphor for mood, not spatial grounding), and the hospital-room vision at the end lacks concrete anchors (beeping monitors and antiseptic smell are stock). The cabin, deck, and clearing remain spatially vague; the reader cannot map her movement or understand why "this clearing" is where the barrier thins.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vividly rendered and frames the entire piece; sensory detail (vapor, copper light, glass walls) is filtered through Mara's translator's gaze. The brain coral fragment functions as micro-setting: held, turned, warmed in her palm, then placed on the windowsill to charge the final image. The cast itself—plaster with smudged notes—constrains her decryption work and anchors the scene's central action, meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-setting constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fog functions as both atmosphere and canvas, constraining visibility while enabling the light-paint gallery; the fresco fragment grounds the orchard's history and charges the final sun-beam moment. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "taste of silver and rain," "fog curled like stale wool," "ceramic with a hollow chime." Spatial choreography remains clear across Mara's movement from walking to kneeling to hanging film to painting. The environment actively participates—root systems pulse bioluminescence, trees serve as witnesses—meeting the Q3 9+ gate of environment constraining choice and charging the final image, though the daydream frame slightly softens the stakes' material weight.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sound wave garden is vividly detailed (parabolic hedges, seventeen reverberations, acoustic foam disguised as moss) and its mechanics constrain her listening setup. However, the eastern wall appears late without spatial grounding, and the garden's role shifts from passive echo chamber to active guide without clear transition. Micro-setting (the nickel, copper microphones) charges the final image modestly, lifting the score above functional.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.1)
    The greenhouse setting is vivid and multi-sensory—beetles, orchids, glass warped by the gourd seed—and directly shapes the resistance meeting's tactics by creating an optical blind spot. Spatial choreography remains mostly clear (garden plots, greenhouse door, specimen cabinets), though the transition from municipal gardens to Voss's separate greenhouse compresses geographic logic. The gourd seed functions as micro-setting, constraining the meeting's duration and contributing to the closure image when it snaps, yet the moth's final appearance feels more symbolic convenience than environmental consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    The gargantuan shell functions as micro-setting and constrains Elara's final choice: her bones fuse with mother-of-pearl, making departure impossible and ensconcing a tactical decision. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—"iridescent wall," "bioluminescence," "scent of jasmine rising through water"—and filtered through her insomniac poet's lens. The shell's spiral chambers actively carry her lullabies outward, shaping the mechanics of the blossom armistice. Spatial choreography remains coherent across centuries, and the final discovery by divers recharges the setting as cathedral-archive.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Opal Library is vividly rendered with purposeful specifics: cloud-mist floors, prismatic shelves, glass orchids suspended in geometric precision. The cracked bamboo tube functions as micro-setting, constraining the choice (its imperfection is the lens for sonic illumination) and charging the final image when it crumbles. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, filtered through the caretaker's professional priorities. Spatial choreography (spiral staircase, central atrium, lower levels) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    The extinct language archive is vividly rendered: "air here tasted of ochre and forgotten grammar, each scroll a coffin for meaning." The heptagon arrangement and semantic binding ("writing into the air itself") constrain Elara's method and charge the final image when Julian steps into the geometric structure. Spatial choreography is clear: Elara moves through stacks, arranges tablets, Julian appears in the doorway, then enters the heptagon. The glass ink well functions as micro-setting, handled twice (Elara places it, Julian touches it) and its transformation—liquid to chiming semantic medium—alters what's possible in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    The amphitheater-volcano setting is vivid, selective, and charged: geothermal breath, sulfur cracks, calcified aqueducts, and structural warnings all constrain access and underscore fragility. The surveyor's chain and brass fittings recur purposefully, grounding technical work in tactile specificity. The final image of the amphitheater "sighing with gratitude" edges toward overt symbolism but the prior spatial choreography (fluted columns, tiered seating, condemned sector) remains legible and pressure-supportive. Micro-setting (chain, gaskets, regulator housing) charges the ending gesture without becoming a postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    The attic setting—skylight, dust motes, card-catalog nests, crumbling books—constrains Elara's movements (she balances on a beam, maps air currents) and supplies the method she uses to understand navigation. The recurring dust-mote imagery charges the final spiral when Orion departs. Spatial choreography is clean (cross-legged beneath skylight, standing on beam, descending stairs). The "blooming withering" motif (mildew on first editions, eggs in catalogs) is vivid and purposeful, reinforcing the thematic tension between decay and renewal without becoming checklist ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    The drifting prism terrace charges the final image through its seventeen sunsets and crystalline facets that multiply Elara's reflection, and the oak grain becomes a tactile map that constrains her interpretive method. Spatial choreography within the terrace remains clear—drafting table, floorboard, eastern wall exit—and sensory details (glass vibration, knot indentation) anchor perception. Geothermal currents and "folded space" read as purposeful metaphysical setting rather than realist anchors, consistent with the post-butterfly-effect premise, so plausibility standards bend appropriately. The terrace's rotating light and the maze's vegetative geometry recur with escalating charge at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.1)
    The underwater facility is vividly rendered with selective detail (observation dome, hydrostatic chambers, emergency bioluminescence) and the environment constrains choice when the pressure seals groan, forcing the need for a biological signal. The bioluminescence outside functions as micro-setting that charges the final image, and spatial choreography remains coherent across moves. Diction ("shadowseam," "softly ingenious") reads purpose-driven and POV-colored, though "forgotten underwater city research facility" front-loads exposition without spatial immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.1)
    The iridescent cave and crater glass are vivid and recur across beats, but they function as backdrop rather than constraint—Elara's choices are not shaped by access, proximity, or environmental pressure. The "cheerful gloom" and "warm crystal wall" establish atmosphere but do not alter tactics or charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, yet the setting remains postcard-descriptive rather than a lever for decision.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tidal arcade is vividly rendered—salt spray, marble columns, water-carved corridors, jasmine vines triggered by frequency—and its rhythmic invasion/retreat mirrors the orchestrated serendipity concept. Spatial choreography is coherent (northern arch, balustrade, broken window, vendor cart angles). However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint; Kael's plan succeeds without environmental resistance or spatial friction altering his tactics. The micro-setting (arcade acoustics, prism reflection) enables his design but does not pressure or complicate it, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.1)
    The twilight garden offers vivid sensory texture ("stars that shimmered like broken glass suspended in ink," "bioluminescent pollen") but remains a static backdrop. The fountain and flowers do not constrain her actions or enable tactics. Spatial choreography is loose—her position relative to the fountain and garden boundaries is unclear throughout. The setting functions as atmosphere rather than pressuring choice, though the consistent visual register and the final pools of luminescence offer modest thematic support.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prism atrium functions as micro-setting: its geometric panes catch "noctilucent reckonings of dawn light," and the protagonist removes boots to approach the tide pool beneath its foundation, grounding choice in spatial choreography. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"surface still as mercury," "mist...burn away," "spectral components"—filtered through a glazier's professional lens (pressure, density, accumulated experience). The pearl bay at dawn constrains the moment to that "fragile hour before everything shifts," tightening the temporal frame and charging the final image when "the sun struck its face." The environment does not merely backdrop; it supplies the physics of light and ripple that enable Elias's realization, meeting the 9+ gate criterion.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    The moonlit ridge, granite ledge, and valley below anchor the scene with selective detail. The porcelain box functions as micro-setting: its cracks catch starlight, and its physical presence (Maya opens it, places the marble in Elias's palm) constrains the gesture and charges the final image when she descends with it empty. The piece leans heavily on celestial imagery (stars wheeling, migrating, slow dance), which is thematically consistent but borders on ornamental when repeated without altering tactics. Spatial choreography is clear—two figures on a ridge, sitting, standing, descending—without floating-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.4)
    The grotto is vividly rendered with tide-polished walls, bioluminescent algae, and Fibonacci shell spirals. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's mathematical lens, lending thematic coherence. The environment does not, however, constrain a choice or alter tactics; it serves as stage dressing for abstract work. The single concrete object—the altitude gauge—reappears at the end but does not force a trade-off or limit options.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Setting details are vivid and purposeful: damp stone, broken windows, cracked marble tiles, collapsed ceiling, flooded basement. The ivy-veiled passage returns as a framing device that charges the opening and closing. Sensory selection reflects the cartographer's professional filter (vibrations, echoes, structural details) and the post-apocalyptic context (pooled rain, moldy darkness, water-damaged books). The film negative's interaction with flashlight and the terrace recognition ground the climactic discovery spatially. The physical environment constrains Mara's movement (descent through darkness, rusted cabinet) and the vault location shapes the discovery sequence, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain a choice or charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.9)
    The terrace, glass, and prism parapet supply recurring spatial anchors; the mirror constrains Elias's action (he must approach it, press his palm, trace symbols) and the "prism parapet after rain" feeds energy to stabilize visions, meeting the micro-setting standard. Sensory detail leans heavily visual ("spectral ladders," "clouded with humidity") with limited tactile or auditory specificity beyond bells. The final image—wet footprints evaporating, possibilities lingering in glass—charges closure by tying environment to thematic stakes, qualifying for the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    The terrace is vividly anchored: limestone worn smooth, Corinthian columns with titanium braces, cracked mosaic floor, blood-soaked valley below. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (midsummer, celestial convergence, orchids through cracks, soil smelling like rain). The setting constrains the ritual's significance—ancient stone and cosmic rarity frame the peace as both fragile and enduring—and charges the final image where flawed beauty (crumbling columns, ash-mixed soil) embodies the thematic argument. Micro-setting qualifies: the clipboard as portable garden and the terrace crack traced by the commander both pressure choices.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    The salt flat is vivid and specific: "cracked earth… sang like shattered glass," cracks forming wing-shapes, salt darkening "like a spreading bruise." The setting constrains Elias's ritual through the exposed riverbeds and charges the closure via the returning rain that will re-submerge the egg. Sensory selection is strong (salt crust, humid pause, thunder) and filtered through Elias's mission. Minor note: the thunder's seven-minute interval is set up but never used tactically.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.0)
    The silver courtyard under snow is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (flakes "like ash from a silent burning," starlight bouncing off snow to create "monochrome radiance"). The prism sanctuary's glass and quartz facets catch moonbeams and fracture them into spectral geometry, and the final image uses the sanctuary's refracted infinities to charge the closure. Spatial choreography is clear (courtyard to sanctuary heart to inside). The environment constrains choice: the temporal filaments must be untangled to unlock the sanctuary, and the snow-muffled night provides cover while also creating "alarming serenity." This crosses the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice and charges the final image). Minor deduction: the Empire's broader world rules are asserted but not shown through action; the "House of Twelve Sighs" and "lullaby of conformity" remain abstract without micro-setting texture.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    The decommissioned radar dome constrains choice—Marcus returns to it twice, uses its isolation for reflection, and builds the fire there. The campfire story stick (carved from antenna scrap) functions as micro-setting, handled across beats and charged at closure when fed to flames. Sensory detail is selective: chilled air, visible breath, geometric ribs, Edison bulb half-light, alley grime. The dome's history (Cold War relic, radar technician's fictions) enriches theme without becoming a tour. Spatial choreography is clean across the three locations (dome, bar alley, dome).

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    The verdant grotto above clouds is vividly anchored with sensory specificity (moss thicker than memory, blushing stillness, rose-gold dawn, emerald stone) and filtered through Elara's priorities (coordinates of grottos, milkweed, migration data). The environment constrains her work (thin oxygen, humid air affecting wing flutter, grotto's mouth as threshold) and charges the closure: her transient rootedness is spatial and conceptual. Micro-setting qualifies: the towers, grasses, spider silk, and hollow reeds are handled and their placement matters. Minor gap: occupational detail (esoteric realist methods) remains abstract; the mechanics of her signal-building lack the granular texture that would elevate spatial choreography further.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    The icebound sanctum is vividly anchored with selective sensory detail (aurora leaking through translucent ice, breath fogging, packed-ice workbench) that reflects Elara's craft priorities. The rope as conduit, the bronze cradle, and the light-as-instrument setup all constrain her method and charge the final image. The setting enables and pressures her work throughout. Minor issue: "glacial moraine where the old music-hall had collapsed decades past" introduces a past location that adds context but doesn't shape present choice, a small efficiency slip in a piece already dense with purposeful detail.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bunker setting is vivid and purposeful: rusted blast doors, Virginia creeper, maps of shifted rivers, and cooling ponds all ground the world and charge the atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered, avoiding catalog listing. The storm functions as a temporal marker and metaphor but doesn't constrain a tactical choice. The wafer seal and the forest pressure the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test (setting/object charges closure), but spatial choreography within the bunker remains somewhat abstract—her movements through the space lack tight blocking.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.1)
    The palace setting actively constrains and enables: the unguarded library allows access, the sundial/throne-room intersection determines tile placement, and the dripping hanging gardens frame the transitional atmosphere. Sensory detail—"scent of cedar and coming rain," obsidian "that drank the candlelight and exhaled constellations"—is vivid and filtered through Elior's astronomical priorities. The ziggurat, mosaic floor, and bronze instruments create a coherent spatial container, and the tile's physical transformation (warming, sweating silver) charges the final beat with tactile specificity that makes the covenant tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    The sanctuary is vividly particular: "vibrating wall," "translucent as cellular memory awakened," "soundless" space that "existed only while reality shifted." The setting supplies the central constraint—silence that writes words "directly into Elias's nervous system"—and the sanctuary's structural instability ("shuddered as reality shifted more violently") pressures the confrontation's timing. The broken music box pin functions as micro-setting, reappearing with tactile presence ("pricked his thumb") and enabling the climactic winding gesture. However, the sanctuary does not force a spatial choice or supply a resource Elias must trade; it frames the encounter but does not narrow his options at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ruined orchard, twilight frost, and fog create vivid atmosphere through selective sensory detail (ice teeth, spectral trees, fractal frost). The sextant and forge supply tactile micro-setting that Elias manipulates across beats. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or force a tactical shift—Elias works unimpeded. The final image of "spectral trees that existed in both memory and glass" charges the closure but the orchard itself remains backdrop rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cathedral-orchard hybrid is vivid and particular (apple trees through transept, pear branches in Gothic arches), and the setting constrains Mara's choices: she uses only the forgotten tools, the limestone corbels dictate her pruning moves, and the tree hollow becomes the contract repository. Spatial choreography is clear (northern tower ascent, eastern arcade, belfry). Quartz eyes as micro-setting charge the ending with the rainbow-across-nave image, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment shaping the final image, but line-level descriptor density occasionally stalls momentum ("green prayers" reads ornamental).

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.1)
    The astral orchard and crystallized-moonlight bathroom offer vivid images ("star-flowers that hummed with quantum uncertainty," "plumbing sang with the music of spheres"), but neither constrains a choice or charges the closure. Spatial choreography is coherent within the described space. The setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure, keeping the score mid-band despite descriptive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Bibliotheca Montis is vividly particular: "tunnels formed from stacked first editions," "corridors shifted around her," "lichen grew clockwise toward the vault." The mountain's organizational logic (linguistic exchange, books as compass/key) constrains Elara's path and forces her to renegotiate entry terms. The botanical diary's negative-space encoding and the fungal communication system function as micro-setting tools that shape her route. The final garden of crystallized errors—"each blade of grass a failed hypothesis"—charges the closure image with specificity. Minor deduction: the mountain's response mechanisms are described but not shown altering a specific tactical choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.2)
    The carnival ship and its decaying midway are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (candy-floss residue, calliope wheezing backwards, fog pressing with "weight of unkindled solace"), and these images recur to charge the ending. However, the setting never constrains a choice: Maya moves through the environment without spatial friction, props like the carousel and tilt-a-whirl are postcard mentions, and the garden materializes without prior anchoring. Micro-setting qualifies (emerald swatch card, crow's nest) but does not alter tactics. The fog and ship imagery support tone but do not pressure the protagonist's path.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    The clock tower mechanism room is vividly rendered with brass workbench, flywheel, escapement, and pendulum rhythm, and the spatial impossibility of the door adds conceptual charge. The rope itself functions as micro-setting, its braids encoding "temporal coordinates" that Elara must decode. However, the mechanics remain decorative during the closure—gears "groaned and shifted," but we don't see how spatial proximity, tool access, or the tower's architecture constrained Elara's choices or shaped the final act. The setting frames rather than pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    The harmonic caves constrain Mara's choices throughout: stalactites hum in D-minor, the Cathedral Chamber's acoustics enable the bloom, and the frozen pool's crack patterns serve as a living meter for pressure feedback. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (bioluminescent algae glow, trapped-bees vibration in the stone), and the echo chamber stone's calcium layers and porous surface directly enable the climactic act. The micro-setting (echo chamber stone, frozen pool) charges the final image where the ice cracks seal in new patterns, recording the victory. Environment, body/tool (stone as catalyst), and recurring object (ice cracks) all constrain on-page action and shape the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glass humming pavilion is richly rendered with "fractured panes vibrating with wind" and "characteristic hum" that modulates at the climax. Spatial choreography is clear: crater's rim, central console, interior spiral, beacon's heart. The prism functions as micro-setting object, constraining Elara's final choice (positioning it during alignment). Sensory detail is purposeful: vibration, silence bloom, gold threads stitching through glass. The "wind-scattered thistles growing through the cracked floor" in the final image charges the ending without symbolic overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stormlit observatory, fog-as-wall, and crystal forecourt constrain Elara's movements and charge the atmosphere. The quartz floor "hummed with residual thunder" and whispers voices, creating a micro-setting that shapes her ritual. The shadow measurements depend on storm-flash illumination, so environment enables the method. However, the setting does not force a choice with visible cost at closure; it serves as backdrop for the thematic merge rather than a crucible. Sensory hierarchy is consistent (Elara notices angles, light, resonance) and the spatial choreography is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.4)
    The blooming fortress at dusk, the ivy-covered walls with luminous flowers, and the mosaic floor with its ceramic formula are vivid and selective. The kerosene rag knot and the mosaic's central depression constrain Elian's ritual in two beats (ignition, chanting spiral), and the final ceramic-shard courtyard charges the ending image with specificity. However, spatial choreography weakens in the tower climb—how the mosaic "frequencies" interact with rainwater ignition and how the vibration shakes loose wall fragments remain mechanically unclear. The micro-setting (body, tool, mosaic) meets the 9+ gate test by constraining choice and charging the final image, but ambiguities in physical logic and the lack of pressure-driven sensory narrowing cap the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    The grotto is concretely anchored (limestone basin, open ceiling, starlight through jade) and constrains the conversation's intimacy. The jade cicada functions as micro-setting: its translucence and warmth are handled across beats and charge the final exchange. Sensory detail is purposeful—starlight casting emerald shadows, cool stone, the grotto's breathing air—and filtered through Maya's professional attention to margins. The water's edge as a spatial metaphor for their relationship is integrated without becoming overt.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.1)
    The trellis setting ("xenial trellis above the clouds," "wooden walkways," "flowers...blooming only during this sixty-minute reprieve") is vividly rendered with sensory specifics (air "tasted of ozone and impossibility," "inverted rain," "clouds began to churn in violent spirals"). Spatial choreography is coherent: ladder to trellis, movement along walkways, return to hatch. The trellis constrains choice by imposing the sixty-minute time limit—lingering past the hour means irretrievable ascent—and the flowers' brief blooming window mirrors Mara's survival strategy, charging the final insight. The bunker below (reinforced concrete, steel doors, fluorescent glare) contrasts texturally and emotionally with the open trellis, supporting the central tension. Micro-setting: the doll functions as a recurring object-as-setting element, handled in multiple beats and central to the closure image. No occupational or professional depth is required at this length; the world rules (gravity inversion, silence-trapping) remain internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.4)
    The drifting prism terrace, storm glass vial, and brass resonators are vividly described and filter perception through Mara's professional focus. The setting constrains movement (perpetual drift, thermal currents) and the storm glass signals the twelve-minute window, shaping the scene's rhythm. However, the architect's blueprints and the refracted sunlight feel ornamental rather than tactically decisive—Mara would perform the same acts without them. Sensory detail is textured but leans decorative in peak beats rather than constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.7)
    Futuristic detail (neural monocle, titanium plating, quantum superposition) creates vivid texture, and sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's archival focus (synthetic lavender, ozone, bioluminescent trees). The ruby flake's glow and the waterfall's "impossible geometries" guide her movements, qualifying as micro-setting that constrains choices. However, spatial choreography in the orchard and stairway remains postcard-static: no environmental obstacle forces a tactical trade-off or charges the final image beyond visual beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.7)
    The sanctuary's "walls standing like ribs around a hollow heart" and "starlight pooling in the hollows" provide vivid, purpose-driven images that support tone. The doorknocker ring and joined palms function as micro-setting elements that anchor key beats. The ashen, charred setting coheres with the theme of survival through destruction and charges the final image of Elias remaining in "loaded emptiness." Spatial choreography is clean (Mira at entrance, stepping inside, turning toward door), though the setting does not constrain a choice as much as reflect interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm grounds the opening with vivid sensory anchors—glowing caps, blue-green constellations, phosphorescent darkness—and the setting constrains Maya's final action: she plants the diamond among the mushrooms, directly charging the closure image when the farm's glow intensifies and fungal caps contain "microscopic prisms." The submarine porthole bolt is handled twice (recognition, transformation), serving as a recurring object that reweights meaning. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout the single-location scene. However, the farm itself never pressures a mid-scene choice; it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop until the ending reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sepia reading room and the gramophone are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail—"vanilla scent of aging deceit," dust motes forming letters. The resonator's brass throat and the standing waves constrain the final action: Kael must maintain the frequency to hold the truth aloft, and speaking would shatter the acoustic field. Spatial choreography is clean. Deduction: the room does not evolve with events; once the revelation begins, setting becomes static backdrop rather than evolving pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.2)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly rendered with concrete, purposeful details: glass leaves that chime, mercury fruit, crystallized shadow underfoot, cold-fire equations on bark. Sensory detail is dense and filtered through a mystical-scientific lens consistent with the setting's hybrid logic. The environment actively participates in the transformation—trees breathing with Valen's heartbeat, mercury rising to form spheres—and the central tree serves as the locus of the final gesture. However, spatial choreography becomes vague during the climactic sequence; Valen's movement "through the forgotten patterns" lacks clear blocking, and the tessellated floor appears only when armor falls, suggesting inconsistent attention to physical space under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    The file room functions as micro-setting that constrains Maya's discovery method and charges the final image. Dust patterns operate as both atmosphere and evidence, with "gray film coating" and "gradients" providing tactile specificity. The basement archives feel lived-in through concrete details (metal shelving, manila folders, brittleness of creases) filtered through Maya's professional lens. The dust's "ghostly evidence" and the button she photographs before cleaning demonstrate how environment supplies both resource and constraint. The sergeant's fingertip wearing circular patterns makes the setting's physical traces integral to plot revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    The auric lagoon is vivid and purposeful, constraining Elias's choice (he must reach this exact place) and charging the final image with bioluminescent projection of archives. Sensory detail—petrichor, oil-slicked puddles, salt and ozone, molten gold algae—is selective and filtered through urgency. The brass key and switchboard function as micro-setting objects that enable the climax. Spatial choreography (tunnel descent, wading, central pedestal) tracks cleanly, and the environment evolves with the transmission's light.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    The radiant grotto with phosphorescent algae, prism atrium, dewdrops, and morning fog creates a vivid, specific micro-environment that recurs across beats and charges the closure image (the final dewdrop suspended, light filtering through crystal). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "dewdrops formed on the rim of his instrument," "bioluminescent walls dimming in respect." The prism atrium functions as both setting and constraint—it refracts his "un-sound" and amplifies the absence, directly enabling his defense. The body and instrument (saxophone mouthpiece, keys, breath) act as micro-setting elements that shape his method throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.1)
    The Ashen Skyborne Arbor is vividly rendered with sideways-falling leaves and peculiar gravity, and the velvet-lined trays and miniature monuments supply tactile detail. The setting constrains Elias's work spatially and provides the heartwood/cambium as a target for the moonstone action, meeting the micro-setting test. However, the arbor's mechanics (floating garden, dead stars, living ash) remain atmospheric decoration rather than pressure that alters tactics. Sensory detail is balanced but occasionally generic ("charcoal sky," "slow-burning embers"), and the transformation sequence—leaves reversing, ribs becoming galleries—reads more as symbolic tableau than embodied environment.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    Setting constrains choice throughout: the greenhouse's thermal vortex guides her to the hidden stairs, the waterfall's chaotic pulse defeats her calculations and forces improvisation, and the stepping stones' irregular shifts require her to abandon measurements. The compass rose on its natural pedestal behind the veil is both obstacle and prize. The final beat—compass rose aligned with "gaps in the glass"—charges the closure image with geometry that reweights possibility. Micro-setting (stones, water pressure, mineral drip) drives tactics and the ending's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rain-washed foundry supplies concrete sensory detail—rainwater chiming on stone, furnaces steaming, broken skylights—and the zodiac coin, anvil, and copper sulfate solution anchor micro-setting work. Spatial choreography remains coherent; Elara's movements through the space track cleanly. The setting constrains one choice (she remains after the search party disbands) and charges the final image (rain evaporating from golden scars), meeting the 9+ gate requirement. However, the foundry does not pressure later choices or supply resources that alter tactics; it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than interactive constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Echo Gorge is vividly rendered with the violet sunrise, stone walls, and treacherous path. The crocodile's tooth and misaligned harp function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice—only distorted notes can pierce the veil—and the tooth's warmth and click at closure charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's priorities. The gorge's acoustics (echoes bouncing, amplifying) are integrated into the spectral mechanics rather than merely described.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ultraviolet forest supplies vivid sensory anchors (violet light, bioluminescent moss, equations etched in bark) and the pewter strap is handled physically. Spatial choreography is weak—Elena kneels, braces, stands, moves, reaches a clearing, but distances and layout remain unclear. The strap constrains movement (tightens when she swallows) and charges the ending when it falls, qualifying as micro-setting that affects tactics. Occupational/world systems (the facility, interrogations) are gestured at but not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.1)
    The alchemist's market on rope bridges above the city is vivid and anchored early. The lighthouse lens fragment returns multiple times with concrete handling (warmth, weight, refraction), and the painting itself structures the scene's action. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's professional priorities (brushstrokes, pigment, encoded lace). However, the environment does not constrain her choices—she moves through it without friction, and no spatial feature alters her tactics or charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.1)
    The abandoned circus ticket office provides vivid, purposeful detail: vintage ticket stubs, grime-coated windows, the elevator shaft behind the counter. Setting constrains Maya's search—the crack in the ceiling rosette, the shaft's vertical channel—and the mainspring's installation into the governor mechanism demonstrates tool-as-micro-setting. The dust accumulation patterns function as both atmosphere and plot driver, guiding her discovery. Spatial choreography is clean across ladder, ceiling, and shaft. The setting charges the final image of the humming elevator keeping time between worlds.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glass orchard library, cloud-sea, and letterpress are vividly rendered with specificity (compressed cloud-fiber paper, translucent branches, regimented rows of mathematical precision). The setting actively shapes Elara's actions: the frost patterns guide her plate-casting, the press bed constrains her method, and the central trunk becomes the rupture point. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven, filtered through Elara's professional and thematic priorities. The final image—books opening, cloud-sea churning—charges the closure by embodying the thematic shift from stasis to becoming.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.1)
    The baroque asteroid setting is vivid and purposeful, with "visible time" pooling like amber wine and architecture as temporal pressure valve. The crystal vase shard charges the final image and constrains Kaelen's methodology. Spatial choreography is clean across locations (chapel, orrery, council, chamber). The micro-setting (shard, mirrors, storms) shapes choices and the ending, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.1)
    The resonance chamber is vividly rendered with crystalline shelves, cherrywood case, and the amplified tick of music boxes creating a coherent micro-setting. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, filtered through the ritual's urgency. The chamber constrains Elias's action (he must complete the ritual here before midnight) and charges the closure when "vibrations through the earth" wake dormant mechanisms worldwide, satisfying the 9+ gate test for environment shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the sealed maintenance hatch, inverted temperature, falling breath-clouds, and weeping stalactites all constrain Elara's descent and charge the final lagoon image. The subterranean chamber's impossible petrichor—never touched by rain or sunlight—reweights the premise at closure. Micro-setting (respirator mask, geologist's hammer, glass vials) functions as equipment that matters to her method. Spatial choreography is coherent across the vertical descent, and the flowstone shelf where she sits anchors the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    The storm-tossed archway functions as shelter and teacher, its stone curves and turbine-hum creating atmosphere. Sensory details are selective (salt-crusted stones, wet walls, wind gaps as metronome) and the setting pressures Mara's work through the storm's relentless energy. The archway's medieval bones and compression mathematics charge the final understanding of structure. However, spatial choreography of her driftwood arranging remains abstract—we don't track her hands, the floor layout, or how specific pieces relate spatially. The coastal highway and return walk are generic; the archway does the heavy lifting but could be more tactilely grounded in her sculptor's perception.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    The amber pavilion, frost, melting snow, and cathedral window constrain Lyra's choices across beats: she returns daily, compares postcards, waits through winter. The sexton's hands "smelled of beeswax" and water "dripping from the eaves in a rhythm like the counting of rosary beads" are sensory and POV-filtered. The etched glass—three laminated sheets with air pockets—provides the technical specificity that charges the final image. Minor: the garden wall flowers are named but never shown growing or opening on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.1)
    The floating library and quartz dunes anchor early, and the obsidian lagoon returns at closure to "expose the evidence." The harness descent through "clouds that tasted of salt and static" offers vivid sensory texture, and the beach debris (vertebrae, obsidian shards) is handled on the page. However, the zeppelin and library remain postcard anchors—present but not constraining choice—and the setting's pressure is thematic rather than tactical; Elias's kneeling and arrangement could occur in any liminal space without altering his options.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    Paper-Lantern Cove anchors early with vivid particulars: "calcified shells that had once been wishes," "barnacled glass," "rotting dock." The amber bottle's "impossible geometry" and tide-smoothed stones ground the pivotal object. The cove's transformation at closure—buildings with "calculated tension," lanterns ignited by "chemical reaction"—charges the final image by reweighting prior ruins. Spatial choreography (laboratory, dock, shoreline) tracks cleanly and the setting constrains her solitude, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    The rooftop orchard is vividly anchored (gnarled apple trees, vapor lamps, seventy stories of steel), and the wax phonograph provides tactile micro-setting detail. The third-grade maritime-museum memory offers a concrete sensory cue (cool glass, pressure tank) that primes the immersion metaphor. However, the orchard does not constrain a choice at closure—Elias walks to the edge and dissolves into prophecy without the environment altering his options—so the 9+ gate is not met, capping this category at 8.8 even with strong descriptive work.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.1)
    The icebound atrium is vividly anchored with concrete sensory detail (frozen constellations, glass panes, terracotta pots, starlight filtering through clearing glass). Spatial choreography remains clear across Elara's movements from standing to placing the acorn cap to stepping onto the spiral staircase to kneeling. The setting directly constrains her action: the acorn cap fits a depression in the fountain's rim, the ice must be reversed, and the atrium's glass ceiling frames the final image. Environment charges the closure image when "starlight filtered through clearing glass, illuminating the first green shoot," making the space integral to the ending's visual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    The windblown sanctuary setting is vivid and consistent—altitude, thin air, cloud sea, brass instruments, stone walls—and the cathedral bell rope functions as a micro-setting element that constrains the final choice. Sensory detail (anemometer spin, barometer drop, hemp fiber vibration) is filtered through Elara's professional focus. The environment charges the closure: pulling the rope invokes centuries of monastic practice and the natural resonance of the bell against the cloud sea. However, spatial choreography between tower, belfry, and parapet could be tighter; the transitions feel atmospheric rather than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    The observatory, brass telescope, iron railing, and yellow lantern glass create a vivid, purpose-driven micro-setting. The glass constrains his perception (transforming the sky into "a cathedral of amber shadows") and charges the final image when he carries it as a compass. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elian's spiritual lens—"bone bleached clean by time," "sulfur-tinted surface"—without catalog excess. Spatial choreography is coherent: observation deck, main console, stepping outside. The station functions as both literal site and thematic anchor, meeting the 9+ gate by constraining choice and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.1)
    The beekeeping oasis is vividly rendered: empty hives, peeling paint, scorched earth, charred acacia trees. Sensory details (clover scent where no clover grows, humming in teeth, fractured rainbows) are selective and atmospheric. The northern quadrant avoidance by ghosts and the stained glass box's panels filtering light both subtly guide perception. Micro-setting (the box itself) and the hives function as spatial anchors. The setting constrains Elias's choice to remain and charges the final image of the box collecting "permanent stains upon air," satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.1)
    The emerald silo is vivid and charges the closure with its green-tinted darkness and the damaged capsule's fusion with architecture. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("oxidized into an impossible verdant hue," "crystallized grain"). The ceramic shard that "cut her palm without drawing blood" provides micro-setting constraint that colors the final touch. Spatial choreography inside the silo is coherent. However, the broader wasteland setting remains generic; no lived-in texture of how Elara navigates the fractured timeline daily before this encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt lagoon, dark sand, mangrove roots, and post-storm light create vivid sensory grounding filtered through the poet's attentive lens. The feather's iridescent barbs, the sodden kite, and the wet ribbon function as tactile objects that constrain the repair action. The setting pressures the boy's choice (too afraid to enter the water) and the poet must wade in, making environment an active element. The final image of the lopsided kite against sun and water charges the closure moment with the physical proof of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.1)
    The temple orchard and living stone pillars supply vivid, purposeful images (stone "breathing with subterranean tides," bioluminescent veins). Spatial choreography is clean across pruning, wire-wrapping, and final rest. The copper wire and oak branches constrain Elias's method and charge the closure image (wires gleaming, pillars singing). Sensory detail leans visual; touch, scent, and sound of orchard work remain generic. No occupational depth (arboriculture, grafting technique) pressures a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.0)
    Capped at 7.0 per the Orientation Test. The "rainwashed tower," "bronze quiet," "overgrown sculpture path," and Gothic arches are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through the spring storm's aftermath. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The fly amber and microscope are present, but neither object's physical properties shape tactics—they serve as thematic vessels rather than tools with mechanical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting detail is vivid and purposeful: calcified reef, jetty as "narrow vastness," rusting ordnance leaking iron. The blooming jetty and twilight light charge the final image, and the physical environment (gaps between boards, charred landscape) guides the planting ritual. Sensory hierarchy reflects the coachman's priestly focus on soil chemistry rather than emotional state. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    The scrapyard is vivid and purposeful: "crushed automobiles and radio towers bent like praying skeletons" establishes post-apocalyptic texture, and specific details (collapsed solar panel, tin box, red dust) ground the search. Sensory hierarchy reflects Ash's bloodhound perspective—copper oxidation becomes memory, settling steel becomes weather. The preserved leaf functions as micro-setting, constraining the final choice by embodying the lost world. Spatial choreography remains clear across the three-day search. Minor limitation: some figurative language ("labyrinth," "beads of forgotten technology") leans ornamental rather than strictly filtered through canine perception, though most description stays purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.1)
    Temporal distortion—breath crystals falling slowly, elastic time, stretched vision—constrains movement and enables the unique perception that reveals the exit hatch. The observation deck functions as micro-setting whose properties charge the final threshold crossing. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("echoed silence pressed against her eardrums"), though spatial choreography of the hatch itself remains vague. The compass rose and charcoal anchor tactile presence throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    The icebound spire, violet glaciers, and bleeding aurora are vivid and establish strong atmosphere. Spatial choreography is coherent (crampons, parapet, altar). The pocket sundial lid and chess pieces function as micro-setting objects that constrain the ritual exchange. However, the setting does not pressure a meaningful choice—the spire is backdrop to an uncontested exchange. For 9+, environment must constrain a choice or charge the final image; here it illustrates rather than pressures, capping the band.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    The whispering gallery is used functionally: it carries her voice to the crowd below, directly enabling the climactic act. The chessboard's empty pawn rows supply a concrete image that charges the ending when sunlight strikes. The nomadic penumbra anchors atmosphere and mirrors Mira's internal liminality. Spatial choreography is clear (gallery, altar, oculus), and the interregnum setting pressures the stakes by creating a leaderless moment. The setting does more than backdrop; it constrains and enables key choices, reaching the 7.0+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.6)
    The labyrinthine bookstore drilled into granite is vividly established with "mercury-glass skin rippling with reflections of ten thousand unread spines." The mountain breathes differently at the end, its contours shifted, and the stone recognizes Vey—environment actively responds to and validates the protagonist's final act. Spatial choreography (seventeen staircases, collapsed arch, summit) remains coherent throughout. The feather as micro-object constrains the translation method and charges the closure by enabling the seeding, qualifying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    The platinum labyrinth constrains Kaelen's hands throughout and charges the final image when it sits "empty in his pocket like a heart with room to beat again." The time-frozen village supplies concrete sensory anchors (suspended snowflake, arrested breath, fractured lightning) that pressure his choices and shift at closure when time resumes. Spatial choreography is clean (square, chapel, tapestry). The body and recurring object both constrain and charge, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bone towers and canyon return at multiple beats, constraining action (groaning structures, rib-cage outcroppings, flat vertebrae) and charging the final image (towers "singing with the voices"). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "porous surface," "curved walls," "heavy silence," "pale spire in the western mist." Spatial choreography is clear; Kael's movements (tracing, sitting, standing) track coherently. The pale spire functions as both setting anchor and timeframe device, tightening pressure as it rotates and glows. The micro-setting of bone—handled, climbed, and ultimately absorbing Kael's voice—materially shapes the closure by making the artist's dissolution literal and spatial.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop and acid sea constrain choice throughout: corroding hull forces speed, pontoons dissolving create the ticking clock. The memory-tank functions as micro-setting, a body-scale environment that enables the repair ritual. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"copper taste," "green froth hissed," "liquid light threading pockmarks"—and filtered through urgency. The statue itself acts as spatial anchor and object-as-setting, its topography of craters literally guiding Elara's hands and narrative choices. Environment charges the final image: acid rising as she dives into completion.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.1)
    The coastal cave is richly rendered (bioluminescent algae, black sand, sunbeam through fissure) and the wrong turn creates spatial consequence. The painted shell and the hidden pool constrain Elias's final choice—he places the shell where light meets water, enabling the painting act. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through his grief-laden perception. The micro-setting (pool, rock shelf, sunbeam) charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate test. However, some descriptions verge on catalog ("stalagmites rose like the masts of sunken ships") without always advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    Cobalt walls, slate-gray dawn, iron-tasting air, and the Fresnel lens are vivid and selective. The jasmine garden and vial cork function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography (spiral stairs, lamp room, Atlantic below) remains clear. The heat wave's aftermath subtly pressures Elias's timing, and the experimental brass receiver modification integrates setting into choice. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (sweating walls, salt-crusted lens) without catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    The starlit signal station is vivid and purposeful: "rusted deck," "defunct hydraulic lines," "floor grates" with corrosion all anchor the space concretely. The setting constrains choice (hydraulics failed three weeks ago, she remains anchored) and charges the final image (the station becomes her instrument). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through POV bias (verdigris matching corrosion, bronze humming through patchwork joints). The micro-setting approach—body, prosthetic leg, bronze censer foot—functions as terrain that pressures the protagonist's stance. Spatial choreography stays coherent (observation deck, chapel ruins below, rotary phone). The piece meets the 9+ gate test by having environment constrain choice and charge the closure, though some details lean ornamental ("starlit") rather than functionally pressuring.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    The hanging orchard is vividly rendered with purposeful constraints: thirty-meter suspension, harness creaking, wet cables, storm-battered cliffs. The setting pressures every choice—Maren measures soil acidity knowing storms will return, prepares the ritual as thunder cracks and trees sway, and the mycelium network becomes both biological resource and metaphorical shield. The storms occlude thought as effectively as any barrier, directly enabling her goal. The ravine's verticality and the fungal network constrain and charge the final image where she descends carrying "the first harvest of safety."

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    The opal dock, mist, and nautical twilight are vivid and purpose-driven, filtering Maren's perceptual priorities (the missing rust, unstained wood) and charging the final image. The "softly persistent fog" functions as micro-setting that constrains her investigation method and recurs to bracket the closure. Sensory detail modulates with urgency: crisis narrows to absences, the calmer ending admits the lighthouse beam and deeper night. The environment shapes both her method (observing gaps in the dock's surface) and the thematic weight of "witnessed isolation."

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    The blooming cavern is vivid and specific: foxfire moss pulsing like breath, solstice blooms dripping nectar that smells of "old paper and typewriter ribbon," ants carrying bioluminescent fungus. Spatial choreography is clear (mouth, fissure, stone floor, pivoting wall). The rising creek constrains Arthur's window and the chip's placement on the flat stone drives the opening mechanism. Corduroy trousers and red clay anchor Appalachian setting. The ghost-map chamber's mycelium rivers function as micro-setting that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cobalt grotto with bioluminescent walls and the breathing pool anchors the climactic sequence, and the fireflies provide a charged sensory contrast ("impossibly golden against the bleeding starlight"). Spatial choreography is mostly clear—base of ridge, above cloud line, shelf, interior—but the mountain's responsiveness to Elara's commands ("yield," "part") introduces a magical convenience that isn't grounded in prior world rules. The grotto's transformation from "lacy menace" to "workshop of creation" reweights the space at closure, meeting the micro-setting criterion for the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ember nexus is anchored through concrete sensory markers (coal, cinder, cooling stone, thermal currents meeting evening coolness) and the nautilus shell is handled across multiple beats, qualifying as micro-setting. The shell's logarithmic spiral and the palette of resolve constrain Elara's alchemical method, affecting her ritual choreography. However, spatial staging remains somewhat abstract—Mira "approached through the violet haze" but her position relative to Elara and the tools is unclear during the key whisper moment. The setting charges the final image (shell glowing beside pocket-suns in Elara's pocket) with purposeful warmth gradation, elevating closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mountain ranger cabin, birch bark scroll, and porch anchor the single location clearly; sensory detail (wind, pine, decomposition scents) is selective and filtered through POV. The scroll constrains Elias's choices—he returns to it twice, and its physical presence charges the final beat. Spatial choreography (cabin interior, porch, metaphorical ascent, return) remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)
    The water clock shop is vividly realized with selective, purposeful detail: the plink of falling water, loupe and gears, fog pressing against glass. Setting elements constrain attention and charge the atmosphere throughout. The midwife's screw and the water chamber's metronomic float function as micro-setting that pressures Mara's interpretive mode. The fog's lift at the end provides a subtle environmental shift that mirrors the thematic arc, though it does not directly alter a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.8)
    The floating rock tea ceremony platform functions as both setting and constraint: its isolation and altitude trigger the crystallization, the storm brackets the ritual with time pressure, and the platform itself becomes a "workshop of metamorphosis." The saturated hush, ozone scent, and bruised purple light are specific and consistently filtered through Elara's scholarly-turned-ritual perspective. The quill, inkwell, and tea elements integrate setting detail into action. The platform's ceremonial purpose charges the final image when she prepares tea "knowing that the ceremony would now include readings from the text of her own survival."

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sheet music archive is vividly rendered (dust motes as silver fish, stained glass, steel shelving groaning under parchment) and the setting constrains the ritual: the shelving becomes the circuit conduit, and the orchard's acoustic properties anchor the ghost. The perfume bottle, theremin, and spatial choreography (kneeling on concrete, sheet music whirlwind) are integrated into action. The orchard's impending destruction tightens the time window and charges the final image when the trees begin to fall. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elara's dual expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ancient temple library supplies vivid, specific images—obsidian shelves, vaulted ceilings, definitions crumbling to luminous dust—that recur and shift with each spiral circuit, charging the final image when "the library began to fold, shelves bending like pages." The softcover dictionary functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and reweighted at closure ("fell open to a blank page"). Spatial choreography is abstract but internally consistent (spiraling from center toward vanishing exit), and the setting constrains the protagonist's method. Sensory detail is selective and serves the conceptual design, though the voice's elevated register filters all perception uniformly without POV-specific bias.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.1)
    The fjord setting, hydraulic mechanisms, and granite platform constrain the shepherd's perception and charge the final image effectively. Sensory details (frosting breath, dripping water, falling snow) are selective and purposeful, filtered through the POV's philosophical frame. The horizon measurement station's function is integrated into the thematic question. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single location.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "rainwashed library," "books swollen with moisture," "mica pane casting striped shadows." The lantern's mica functions as micro-setting, refracting light into "four distinct ghosts" that embody the lucid contradiction theme. The subway scrawls and library stacks provide atmosphere but do not constrain a pivotal choice—Maya's evening unfolds in observation rather than navigation. The setting charges the final image (rain, candle, fractured light) and thus crosses into the 7.0+ band, though it stops short of altering tactics or options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    The subway utility tunnel, glass harmonica disc, and rotary phone booth are rendered with purposeful, vivid sensory detail—water drips in rhythm, streetlamp hum shifts pitch, the disc's crack inserts skips—that charge the atmosphere and anchor Mara's ritual. Spatial choreography is coherent within the booth; the third rail, grates above, and auxiliary player remain stable anchors. The setting constrains Mara's work (no trains run; the booth is isolated) and the streetlamp transition provides a recurring temporal marker that shapes her disconnection timing, reaching the gate for one choice constrained. However, the disc and booth do not evolve or alter tactics across calls; the environment is textural backdrop more than active pressure on this particular ending.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    The blooming jetty is vivid and purposeful: flowers from memory-cracks, salinity altered by grief, steep slope navigated with care. Setting details are filtered through Mara's archival POV and constrain her movement ("one misstep...and the entire...covenant might collapse"). The locket, inkwell, and concrete are handled tactilely, and the final image of closing blooms charges the ending. However, the environment primarily serves as symbolic backdrop rather than forcing a tactical choice at closure; the steep slope is noted but does not create a pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ivy-claimed station is vivid and purposeful: the moss bench, broken glass, and rusted fountain establish atmosphere and support the "polite anarchy" tone. The station functions as a crucible where social hierarchies dissolve, and the ivy "leaning closer" at peak moments charges the setting with metaphoric weight. Spatial choreography remains clear across the gathering crowd. The moon-rock fragment—handled, pressed into palms, finally held by the child—acts as micro-setting that constrains the reciprocity ritual and charges the final beat, meeting the 9+ gate criterion.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ultrasonic forest is vividly realized through high-frequency vibrations, moss that "sang of ancient patience," and roots gripping stone. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elara's skin-absorption ability, creating a distinct micro-setting. The environment actively constrains choice: the platinum ring pulls her through darkness, the stillpoint's "absolute quiet" becomes the discovery site. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The forest charges the final image by holding its breath during her self-mapping, meeting the 9+ gate requirement of environment shaping the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.1)
    The gravitational anomaly is vivid and specific ("time folded like origami," "light pooled like mercury"), and the exotic pen is handled on the page with textural detail (iridium nib, drinking starlight). The observatory's groaning and unbending metal grounds the climax physically. Yet much of the setting operates as metaphorical backdrop—the anomaly pulses and sighs without constraining Elara's tactics in a material way. Micro-setting (the pen, the observation glass) charges the final image and earns the score above ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.1)
    The luminous harbor is rendered with sensory specificity—bioluminescence tracing hulls, moonlight silvering boats, shadows pooling—and the setting charges the final image when the harbor "leans in" and boats creak in rhythm. The vintage camera and Elias's body (trembling hands, milky eyes) function as micro-setting elements that constrain his method. However, spatial choreography during the conducting sequence is vague; we lack concrete anchors for Elias's movement along the pier or the precise location of the final stand. The moonlight-on-mast click is vivid but arrives late without prior setup of that ship's position, slightly reducing coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    The limestone hollow, volcanic glass, and obsidian fragments supply vivid sensory anchors, and the archive's strata and dim chamber constrain Maya's movements enough to ground her actions. However, spatial choreography across "three continents" and multiple library ruins remains abstract; we never track her body through a single location with enough granularity to feel proximity or access shaping a choice. The micro-setting (charcoal from embers, easel in dim chamber) does charge the final image, lifting the score within its band despite the early orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sound wave garden functions as both setting and instrument: photosynthetic cells respond to cadence, seed pods ring like copper bells, and the auric lagoon bubbles in response to Kael's drumming—environment directly shapes his attempt and the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean (garden → spiral staircase → observation ledge → central chamber below). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (bioluminescent algae feeding on emotional residue, golden viscous water, harmonic mist), filtered through Kael's grief-driven perception. The recurring constraint (ventilation pause/exhale cycle) times the window of possibility and charges the ending when the systems roar back to life.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.1)
    Container labyrinth, auroras, corrugated steel, phosphorescent paint, and magnetic anomalies create a vivid, pressure-laden setting. The zodiac coin's magnetic resistance and the hidden passage constrain choices and charge the middle turn. Spatial choreography (footsteps three containers over, narrow passage, chamber) remains clear. The geomagnetic storm disables digital infrastructure, forcing reliance on folded maps and embodied navigation—environment directly shapes tactics and stakes. The port's soundscape (loudspeaker deaths, distinctive gaits) acts as micro-setting, elevating specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    Vivid, purposeful sensory detail: "cobalt vapors," "liquid glass," "obsidian surface," filtered through a consistent perceptual lens. The dental mirror and shutters function as micro-setting elements that constrain the guardian's method and charge the final image. Spatial choreography (dock, boathouse, canal) remains clear and the rain-slicked planks provide tactile grounding, though the setting does not force a choice or alter tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cobalt library, river-mist, and magnetic grotto are vivid and specific, with sensory detail filtered through an elevated, lyric register. The grotto's properties (compass needles spin, heartbeats sound like drums) constrain the final beat and charge the closure image. Spatial choreography across town and between library/grotto remains coherent. The setting satisfies the 9+ gate (grotto constrains the final action and charges the image), but the prose leans heavily on atmospheric catalog rather than selective detail that reflects urgency, preventing entry into the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sublittoral fringe setting is visceral and purposeful: barnacle-crusted pylons, tidal pools filling with "liquid silver," the spectral horizon shimmer. The setting constrains Elara's choice (she must step off the dock into cold water at a specific tidal moment) and charges the final image (the disappearing island, twenty yards out). Sensory detail is filtered through Elara's professional familiarity (mooring cables, dock master's payroll) and the micro-setting of the scrimshaw against her collarbone functions as tactile anchor throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    The turbines function as macro-setting (shadows chopping time, harvesting energy from air that carried mandatory songs) and micro-constraint (Elias sits with his back to them, the woman is framed by their sweep). The dried bouquet is handled twice (hung above stove, woman touches it and comes away dusted), supplying a tactile anchor. The porch, kitchen, and kettle ground spatial choreography. The turbines charge the final image by marking time "beyond happiness or grief." Gate met: environment constrains the final tableau and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.1)
    Cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and quartz colonnade are visually vivid but remain postcard anchors—no object constrains a choice or alters tactics. The "lantern-moth hush" appears three times as atmospheric phrase without affecting perception or action. Spatial choreography is unclear: Elara moves from "edge" to "central column" to "space between columns" without legible distances or orientations. The body as micro-setting is underused; her hand on quartz triggers transformation via mystical recognition rather than physical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glassblower's courtyard anchors spatial choreography: cooling silica, soil beds, kiln, stone altar, shed, furnace. The concertina reed and the furnace constrain the barter and enable the final awakening. Sensory detail—"perfume of cooling silica and scorched earth," "heat shimmer in degrees of silver and pewter"—is filtered through Elara's colorblind perception and tied to her stake. The courtyard's phoenix ash and soot-stained petals recur and charge the closure image of post-phoenix beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    The Laboratory is vividly rendered (glass cylinders, quartz pillars, electromagnetic suspension, amber light) and setting details drive key choices: the lens reveals architectural cracks, the pillar's fissure becomes the strike point, the activation plate responds to her modification. The miner's lens functions as micro-setting, constraining her perception and enabling the final act. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the golden-to-bronze light modulates with the arc, charging the ending image with purposeful atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.7)
    The observatory setting is vivid and purposeful—brass telescopes, copper dome, amber beam, vellum stencils—and anchors the central action. However, spatial choreography is loose (where exactly are the refractor, the bench, the threshold?) and the environment does not constrain a choice at closure; it functions as atmospheric backdrop. The micro-setting of vellum and magnets comes closest to shaping tactics, but the young man's transformation occurs through conversation and observation, not through a tool-constrained move. The setting charges the mood but does not pressure the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rain-beaded skylight and loft are vividly rendered and integrated into tone (camera obscura light, thunder rattling the glass). The measuring tape and cards function as micro-setting tools that constrain Mara's methodology. The post-crash cityscape of empty server farms and abandoned trading floors shapes the world convincingly. The final storm drumming creates atmospheric charge, but the environment doesn't force a choice or alter tactics—it remains backdrop rather than active constraint at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive's bioluminescent fungi, bronze pagoda tiers, and erratic spatial choreography ("stepping left then pausing, spinning once") create a vivid micro-setting. The pagoda's lowest tier opening "only to those who avoided patterns" directly constrains the historian's movement choices. However, much description is ornamental (saffron veil "billowing in shapes that defied geometry") without altering tactics, and the final walk home ("without repeating a single step") feels gestural rather than grounded in the archive's physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.1)
    The blooming library with bioluminescent shelves and glass walls creates a vivid, purposeful frame; the shelves "closing around her like protective hands" and "exhaling" starlight at dawn integrate setting with Elara's ritual and the story's tone. The archival controls and twin projection screens are present and used, grounding her method. The river stone functions as a recurring object that shifts meaning (hand → water → suspension), constraining the shadow's narrative and charging the closure image, which satisfies the micro-setting allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.1)
    The misty workshop, glass terrariums, jasmine scent, and recovery branch are vivid and filtered through Elara's professional attention. The chameleon's color shift (turquoise to green) functions as a micro-setting signal that tracks emotional state and constrains the final image, charging closure by embodying honest care versus distress. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The workshop reconstruction (organizing documents, verifying permits, securing habitats) integrates setting detail into action without tourism, and the recurring mist + stars frame provide atmospheric coherence. However, the setting does not meaningfully constrain a present choice—cleaning and organizing are chosen actions with no environmental pressure forcing alternate tactics—so the setting remains vivid but not mechanically essential to escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.7)
    The tower at dawn, frosted hourglass, and coffee rings are vivid and return with reweighted meaning at closure. The descent through roots and into the cavern provides spatial progression that guides Elias's choice to stop and witness. Sensory detail is selective (frost-rimed windows, cold coffee, roots brushing his face) and filtered through his focus. However, the meteor and cavern arrive late without prior spatial seeding, and the "geological coffee stains" metaphor stretches credibility without anchoring how he reads them or what they constrain.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.1)
    The vintage projection booth is vividly rendered with sensory specificity: "celluloid teeth biting softly," "ozone and dust," "iron ladder," "warped speakers." The film strip functions as both recurring object and tactile anchor, heating in her hand and coiling like a question mark. Spatial details (booth as skull, theater as body, beam between projector and screen) constrain Elara's psychometric reading and charge the final image of unused love stored in light. The micro-setting of the projection booth and the film strip materially shapes her discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.1)
    The aurora-lit archway and polar setting are vivid and specific, filtered through Elara's goal-driven perception. The sextant is handled across multiple beats and constrains her charting method. Spatial choreography (archway, frozen ground, stone curve) tracks cleanly. The environment charges the final image when the aurora dims and the archway returns to "ordinary stone," reweighting the transformation with a micro-setting shift that alters the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glowing dune in bloom is vivid and specific, its bioluminescence responding to Kael's voice and the clock's midnight, thus constraining the final act. The archive's "crystallized time" and "fractured lullaby" create a legible atmosphere. Spatial choreography is clean: dune to archive threshold to interior. The micro-setting (dune, clock) charges the closure image when midnight spreads in concentric rings. Sensory detail leans heavily visual/auditory; tactile and olfactory are absent, but the selection serves the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Mechanical Rainforest is vividly rendered with specificity: gearbox flowers, copper-wire mycelium, fiber-optic moss, clockwork fronds. The acoustic signature method (aluminum palms vs. iron oaks) provides a concrete navigation tool that shapes Kael's approach. The gear-tree nexus at closure supplies the mechanism for resolution, though the gear slot's existence is introduced only at the ending beat. Spatial choreography is clear across translocations.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    The veiled ridgeway, tide pools, driftwood archways, and bioluminescent grotto create a coherent dreamscape that constrains Mara's journey through "indirect routes" and "uneven terrain." The star stamp functions as body-setting (pressed to palm, then sternum) and charges the final image with its "steady warmth." The twilight/dawn transition provides temporal bracketing. Spatial choreography remains clear despite the surreal elements: shore → ridgeway climb → grotto → return path. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (mist at ankles, bioluminescence painting rocks, Atlas's nose tucked beneath tail), filtered through Mara's urgency and the guides' patient rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.1)
    The cobalt fortress, snow-buried corridors, and frost-rimed carpets create vivid sensory grounding filtered through the bellhop's mute perspective. The piano bench bolt—metallic, brass-threaded, cold—functions as a micro-setting object that constrains his choice to investigate and charges the final image when he re-seals it. Spatial choreography (east tower, arrow slits, refectory, staircase) tracks cleanly and the environment consistently pressures choices throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ancient temple library is vividly rendered with marble corridors, broken dome, mosaic floor, and Bronze Age columns, creating strong atmospheric texture. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; no spatial feature constrains a choice or tactic—the titan does not use the architecture, the ink-stained volumes, or the crumbling columns to solve a problem or force a decision. The library's "elegant dissolution" at the end is thematically resonant but does not charge the closure through environmental constraint. Sensory detail (moonlight, dust, cold marble) is selective and voice-filtered, but the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is not met; the dissolution is decorative consequence, not causal participant.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The converted oil rig / monitoring station, titanium console, crystalline drives, and Pacific setting are vivid and selective. The station "creaked," "moored yet drifting," and the tide's "periodically eternal motion" all constrain Elena's solitary watch and pressure her final transmission choice. Sensory hierarchy reflects her observer's lens (chemical signatures, acidity readings, the gray dawn). The atlas page's "edges soft with salt and age" functions as micro-setting that charges the closure image. Spatial choreography and prop-state tracking are clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    The spaceport repair bay is vividly anchored: rusted hull plates, scaffolds, broken gantries, fusion welders, cracked skylight. The ancient stone circle provides micro-setting that charges the final image and constrains Mira's ritual approach (barefoot contact required). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Mira's tactile priorities (dust motes, subsonic hum, grit underfoot). The environment directly enables the climactic act (pressing palms to monolith, dawn light through skylight).

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    The volcanic hot springs constrain the unsealing—only precisely calibrated temperature works—and the kite tangled in mineral deposits charges the middle beat. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "minerals crystallizing into alien gardens," "thermal vents hissed secrets." The body and tool (amber pendant, kite) function as micro-setting that shapes choice. The setting subtly mirrors Mira's internal state (toxic waters as nursery, roots knitting soil). Spatial choreography is clean; the pool, terraces, and ferns track coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.4)
    The arboretum-on-cliff setting constrains Elias's choices—he works here specifically because the trees "require human hands" unlike the automated lighthouse, creating a meaningful contrast. The photograph as micro-object charges the final image, and somatic details (soil moisture, mulch, alkaline soil) ground the work in tactile specificity. The empty lighthouse cottage provides spatial counterpoint. The cypress leaning into wind and the cliff edge function as both physical and thematic anchors. One small slip: "marine biology texts left in the lighthouse library" feels slightly convenient as exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse, library, and descending architecture are vivid and purpose-driven. Spatial choreography holds: shelves to floor to trapdoor to chamber. The threads function as micro-setting, constraining her method and charging the final lamp-ignition. The blue-white flame that "didn't burn" and the expanding walls deliver a clear sensory reconfiguration that supports the ending image, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.7)
    The wind-carved encampment's "spiraling formations" and "natural airstreams" are vivid and purposeful, anchoring the ink's behavior and the tracker's theory. Sensory detail is selective—"sound like tearing silk," "mercury sheen"—and filtered through the tracker's observational lens. The setting does not, however, constrain a choice or charge the final image with cost; it remains atmospheric backdrop. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the single-location scene.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cryogenic vault is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (frosting breath, ice-coated keys, permafrost hum) and the setting constrains action (subzero preservation, dormant networks, buried blizzard). The "echoing library under snow" recurs purposefully and charges the final image (tombs → seeds). Spatial choreography is clean (eastern terminal, cryo-pod, vault center) and the environment's isolation amplifies moral stakes. The micro-setting (preservation unit, fiber-optic veins) shapes Mara's tactical choices, meeting the 9+ test for constraint and closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glass dome and sandbag scraps constrain Maya's choices throughout: they anchor life in sterile sand, filter her etched words to roots, and the dome's fractured glass sings pressure changes she tracks. Spatial choreography is clean (eastern quadrant, wall-mounted pistol). The micro-setting qualifies—body, blade, and recurring sandbags charge the final image when the sunset illuminates her engravings. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Maya's perceptual bias (twin suns, spiderweb cracks, half-tone shift). The setting is indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sonic garden is vivid and purposeful: sound waves part to reveal soil, the echo pool acts as repository, and Kael's silence creates pockets the world rushes to fill. The rail spike constrains his final action (lightning rod, not weapon), and the garden's collapse after he extracts the spike charges the ending. Spatial choreography is clean, and the setting evolves causally with the protagonist's moves.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    The echoing observatory is vivid and purposeful—sound "bouncing between brass telescopes like accusations" physicalizes moral pressure, and the glass floor "turning into a lantern" at dawn marks closure. Sensory detail is filtered through Eleanor's focus (ink from depths, wax "color of dried blood"). The rosewood pen nib functions as micro-setting, constraining her proof and charging the final act when placed in the museum display. Spatial choreography (spiral staircase, elevator descent) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glass-dome laboratory, quantum equipment, amber scanning bed, and temporal breach mechanics are vividly rendered and internally consistent. The amber constrains her tether choice (micro-setting function). However, spatial choreography weakens during the climax: "walls became translucent, revealing overlapping timelines" and "etched a new constellation…across the surface of the folding air itself" sacrifice coherence for spectacle. The setting charges the final image but at the cost of legible physics.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.1)
    The grotto's parabolic symmetry and acoustic properties constrain Mara's approach; the mist, limestone texture, and calcite seam are purposefully filtered through her craft. The tile shard's vibration and the sand mandala function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean. The environment drives the diagnosis-and-cure structure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting must constrain choice or charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)
    Vitrified sand, shattered sky, dry fountain, and mosaic stepping stone are vividly rendered with sensory economy. The chipped mosaic constrains Kael's method and charges the final image when the tessera completes an unintended geometry. Spatial choreography (plaza, fountain, stepping stone, minaret site) remains legible and the retrocognitive layering creates temporal depth without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mystic orchard within the hedge maze supplies vivid, purposeful detail: apple trees humming with "violet resonance," jasmine scent in October, the central tree as the crisis locus. Synesthetic colors (amber, rust, turquoise, indigo, rose) filter through Julian's POV and charge the atmosphere. The garden constrains choice—Mara discovers it by scent, sits beneath the tree, and the setting's accumulated nostalgia becomes the vehicle for Julian's intervention. Spatial choreography is clean (back wall, maze, central tree, roots). The Rialto demolition crew anchors the dawn endpoint and provides consequence (the theater is gone, Julian remains). Minor: some details (the violet resonance, the hedge maze's forty-year cultivation) are vivid but slightly ornamental rather than tactically essential.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    The light painting studio anchors the opening and charges the final image as "sanctuary," and the muscovite geode sliver functions as a micro-setting object that constrains Maya's search method through somatic feedback. The radiator, darkroom curtain, floorboards, and ventilation shafts supply concrete hiding spots that shape her search path. The long-exposure camera rig is integrated into the method and payoff, documenting fractal spirals that reveal user intent at closure. However, the studio's physical layout and spatial choreography remain abstract; we never see Maya move through doorways, across distances, or navigate obstacles, only "trace the perimeter" and "move through the building."

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    Cave details are vivid and varied: brackish pools, bioluminescent fungi, seawater spray, starlight shaft. The elm leaf fossil in shale provides a concrete object, and the anti-grav vessel's three-inch hover adds sensory specificity. The environment supplies atmosphere and frames the journey but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Kael floats through without friction. The fossil charges the ending symbolically, meeting the micro-setting allowance, but spatial choreography remains smooth rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    The amber warehouse, canyon echo jar, and button collection supply vivid sensory anchors and constrain Elara's method (cataloging by resonance). The final image—cliffs shifting geometry, warehouse glowing—charges the closure by reweighting the physical space from threat to threshold. However, spatial choreography remains impressionistic (where exactly are the drawers, workbench, floor spiral?) and the micro-setting (buttons, jar) does more work than the macro-setting (cliffs, warehouse), which stays mostly atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    Zephyr Bluff is established early with mist, wind, skeletal pines, and snow; the codes in snow are handled on the page and guide Elena's movement. The pillbox is tactile ("silver and nicked," "engraved") and its weight is felt. However, the environment does not materially constrain a choice—Elena and Marcus meet without obstacle, and the final descent is unopposed. The micro-setting (snow as message surface) shapes one beat but does not charge the closure image beyond atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    The fog-bound crossing, rain gutters, and ferry cable are vividly rendered through selective sensory detail (spindrift, moss-slick pilings, metallic ticking). The yarn needle functions as micro-setting, handled twice and linking lineage to present task. Spatial choreography is clear (tollhouse to water's edge), and the environment directly constrains the coachman's choice—he cannot cross until the storm retreats. The final boarding is charged by the cable's hum and the mist's shift, satisfying the 9+ test narrowly.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned beekeeping oasis is vividly rendered with sensory specificity: cracked clay cylinders, dried lavender husks, comb, hive stand. The thrumming vibration anchors Kai's perception and constrains her final choice—she will not disturb what thrums. The lantern glass functions as micro-setting, refracting light and revealing fractured timelines, which directly charges the closure image when she leaves it as a beacon. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling, withdrawing from pack, raising glass, setting it on the hive stand, stepping back, sitting, standing, leaving). The scorched wasteland and three-day journey provide external pressure that makes the oasis's preservation meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    The harbor, fire escape garden, and lighthouse interior are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (rusted grating, silver light fracturing on waves, dust motes in moonbeams). The bitting gauge tooth functions as a micro-setting object that constrains and enables the climactic choice—Mara cannot restore the light without this specific tool. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (fire escape → rowboat → lighthouse ladder → adjustment panel). The moonlit harbor charges the final image by providing the reflected light source, making setting essential to the resolution rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tidal library, cloud-ocean, and stone circle are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (subsonic hum "vibrating in her teeth," coral shelves "breathing"). The sundial's atomically reflective surface and the basalt pillars constrain the climactic choice—she uses their interaction to reach the Sky-Singers' memory. Spatial choreography is clear (balcony to northern terrace to stone circle to descending stacks). However, some details ("living coral breathing in thin atmosphere") are decorative rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lotus temple on stilts and the lily pond supply vivid anchors; the thrush's nest and woven installation are rendered with specific geometry. The pond's "silver froth" and "prismatic quiet" modulate through the storm and aftermath, charging atmosphere. The courtyard setting enables the public installation and the pilgrims' recognition, constraining Elara's choice to work visibly rather than in private—micro-setting that alters tactics and supports the thematic shift from secrecy to exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    The radio station is vividly rendered with dust motes, sodium light, ancient equipment, and the mixing console covered in charts. Spatial choreography is clean throughout (boots, desk, window sightlines). The subsonic thrum vibrating through her boots and rattling coffee cups creates sensory specificity that constrains and enables her action. The equipment's grittier-era mechanics become essential to the counter-broadcast, charging the final image of flickering lights. The university campus exterior provides necessary witness-pressure but remains slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    The nexus as a "shifting labyrinth" where "corridors breathed and chambers contracted" directly constrains Maren's movement and drives the ticking-clock pressure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: damp limestone pulse, bass note through boots, skeletal shadows on tessellated floor. The compass point and iron gears are tactile and mechanically specific. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the descent and chamber action, and the twelve-hertz thrum matters causally.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.1)
    The quarry is vividly rendered—"wet shale that glittered like broken glass," "furrowed hush," mist thickening "in the bowl of the earth"—and the setting clearly constrains Elara's work (portable easel, charcoal smudging in humidity). The limestone and black pool recur to anchor the investigation spatially. The environment directly enables the closure: holding the ribbon "against the gray limestone" while sketching produces the pattern that breaks the case. Micro-setting (the ribbon, easel, charcoal) functions as active constraint and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.1)
    The experimental weather station is vividly rendered with spongey mold, dripping condensation, and bioluminescent fungal growth. Sensory detail is purposeful and atmospheric, filtered through Elara's perception. The copper nail is handled twice (unwrapped, then placed on the transmitter) and the station's decay mirrors thematic dread. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elara's climb and transmission proceed without spatial or environmental obstacle. The setting charges mood but does not pressure the plot at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mountain pullout, scaffold wrap, and wet-plate glass function as micro-setting that constrains Elias's path and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through his professional lens (bridge-song fiddler, frequencies, resonance). However, spatial choreography becomes vague in the middle third—"followed the fluttering guide" and "scaffold's terminus" lack concrete distance or physical effort, making the ascent feel abstractly symbolic rather than tactilely grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    The abandoned circus train supplies vivid, purposeful detail (corrugated steel lions, rust, twisted tent poles) that mirrors decay and transition. The foreign bills—"yen, pesos, deutsche marks"—anchor the father's history concretely. The train's spatial layout (conductor's table, dining car, engine car) tracks clearly and the coupling-between-cars final beat uses micro-setting to charge the departure image. The recurring "territorial markers" constrain Elias's daily routine and charge the closure when their function shifts from defense to cautionary tale.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.4)
    The observatory dome, brass eyepiece, and variable stars provide concrete sensory anchors, and the telescope work is tactile enough to ground the scene. The daylily-pressed telegram is handled physically (pressed against glass, placed in archive), which elevates it beyond mere symbol. However, the observatory functions more as backdrop than constraint—nothing about the physical space alters Elara's choices or limits her options. The "celestial mapping observatory" and "stellar Morse code" offer vivid specificity, but the environment never pressures a decision or supplies a resource that affects outcome, leaving it in the mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.9)
    The swirling orchard vortex is vivid and anchors spatial choreography throughout. Sensory detail (branches "like sabers drawn in slow motion," "steam," "ash") is selective and purposeful. The lake surface and vortex constrain Elara's approach, forcing her to adopt stillness rather than force. However, the flesh-eating plant's "voracious heat" and instant germination feel convenient rather than grounded in established world rules, and the final "gentle rows" lack tactile follow-through.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.1)
    The cobalt glade, maze topiary clipping, and roots provide sensory anchors, and the setting shifts (glade rotates, clearing within clearing) in response to their approach. However, spatial choreography is vague—"emerged from the blue-dark trees," "approached the center"—and the intersection's mechanics remain abstract. The roots constrain Elara early and release at a key beat, charging the final image minimally. Micro-setting (roots, clipping) does functional work but the broader environment is more backdrop than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered through selective, purposeful detail: foxfire fungus casting "amber of dying afternoon despite the eternal midnight," roots coiling through ribs "like a promise kept too long," fruit "pale as bone." The setting actively constrains Elias's final choice—the heart-tree's roots bind him, the bones form "a pattern too deliberate to be natural," and the barrier between what-was and what-could-be grows "thin as parchment." Spatial choreography is clear throughout (kneeling between ribs, moving deeper, reaching the heart-tree). The underground atmosphere charges the closure image: Elias becomes part of this place where "the dead fed the living trees."

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    The trailer setting is specific (fourteen by twenty feet, 1987, asbestos tiles) and the quarry's acoustic properties ("limestone swallowed sound and held it forever") charge the final image thematically. The speaker cloth is handled across multiple beats, tactile and causal. The photograph functions as a concrete object that shifts Marcus's stance. Spatial choreography is clear (Marcus at desk, kid enters, cloth passes between them). Strong setting-as-constraint work, though the quarry itself remains more atmospheric than tactically constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    The magnetic arbor is vividly rendered with specific details (iron-laden branches, graphite altar, visible auroras) that constrain the final action—the seed must be placed at the convergence point. The stratospheric setting enables the physics of transition. Micro-setting elements (obsidian shell, silver stylus, spores) charge the closure image. However, spatial choreography of Elias's position and movements within the arbor remains somewhat abstract during key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.4)
    The tidal atrium is anchored vividly with sensory particulars (marble floor, saltwater, glass dome, pale gold light) and the moon-phase mechanic is integrated into setting pressure. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. The bamboo creel and furnace chambers in the librarian's chest function as micro-setting that constrains the smelting process, lifting the score toward the 7.0 gate, though the creel's role is more vessel than active constraint that alters a key choice.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.2)
    The crystal caves supply vivid, layered sensory detail (calcite, rose quartz altar, hexagonal prisms, salt deposits) and the environment directly constrains Elara's final ritual—she must align shell aperture with pearl axis atop the stalagmite. The geode as luxury bunker embedded in cavern adds purposeful friction between survival architecture and natural growth. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves, and the setting charges the closure image when crystals respond in "sympathetic resonance."

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the disused station's decay mirrors Maya's internal state, and the accordion functions as a micro-setting object that constrains her final choice (she plays it, tests the patched bellows, and this physical act charges the closure). Sensory details are selective and filtered through her river-chronicler POV (rust scent, moss texture, ivy threading). The graffiti's map reference tightens spatial specificity and drives the ending decision. Minor: some details (starred ticket-booth window, burlap-wrapped bones) enrich atmosphere but don't constrain choices directly.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.8)
    The glowing library is vividly rendered with bioluminescent shelves, mist corridors, and books that "opened and closed like jellyfish." The watch and its living-script membrane constrain her documentation method and charge the final beats. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the dreamer's veil, creating a coherent atmosphere. However, spatial choreography of the three converging corridors and the "nexus" positioning remains abstract; the library does not materially block or enable a high-stakes choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.2)
    The velvet observatory at midsummer is vividly rendered (crimson draperies, greenhouse heat, dust motes, jasmine, fern, oaks) and setting actively constrains choice: the temperature breaches critical threshold, creating urgency. The ice violin's melting and the potted oaks as vessels for propagation make the micro-environment essential to the ending. Minor deduction: some details (mulberry jam simile, mahogany case) read decorative rather than pressure-driving, and the surrounding forest's mycorrhizal network is invoked late without prior spatial setup.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.1)
    The skyborne grotto, aurora, and quartz walls are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (frosting breath, ionized shimmer, crystal hum). The emerald chip functions as micro-setting, constraining Elara's method (she can only use this one tool). The grotto's inaccessibility ("by airship or faith") and the archive of chips in niches charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test. Minor deduction: the dancer's body and the worktable receive generic treatment; spatial choreography of Elara's movements (arranging hair, pressing the chip) lacks tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Umbral Grotto is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (vine-draped ceiling, silver clouds, scalloped soil) and the setting constrains Elias's movements—he climbs trees to escape memory's weight, descends to the root-ball to complete the ritual. The "vineyard hush" motif recurs and charges the closure beat. Spatial choreography remains clear across vertical movement (ceiling-rooted trees, cloud cover, grotto floor). The micro-setting (soil, digging knife, planting hole) directly enables the closure action, though some descriptive passages ("heavy silence of ripeness and completion that pressed against the eardrums like wine pressing against cork") occasionally prioritize lyricism over immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse catwalk, wind chimes, and northern rafter supply spatial choreography and recurring tactile anchors (coat snapping, hollow mirror shard between teeth). The cloak's weight and the chimes' pitch function as micro-setting that shapes the protagonist's choices. Dawn, Atlantic dampness, and maritime breeze are filtered through Elias's professional attention. Setting detail charges the final image (breeze takes the cloak) and constrains the unhooking action, meeting the 9+ gate requirement of environment affecting closure, though the integration is more atmospheric than decisively tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    The floating platform, magnetic grotto, and pond are vividly rendered with sensory specificity and voice-filtered detail. The stone and ripples function as both micro-setting and recurring object, constraining the researcher's method of reading truth. The grotto's magnetic pull subtly anchors his suspended state and charges the final image of wisdom "magnetized into the grotto's stone." Spatial choreography is clean, and the setting supplies the mechanism for his teaching across time.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.4)
    The canyon of bone towers and endless echoes is vividly rendered and recurs throughout, grounding the piece spatially. Sensory detail is selective—dust, echoes, bird patterns—and filtered through the skimmer's meditative focus. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop and symbolic resonance rather than constraining choice or supplying resources that alter outcome. The stone arrowhead and bird flock act as micro-setting/object-as-setting and do charge the final image, which lifts the score into mid-6s. Spatial choreography is minimal (single static figure) but clear.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Spire and its frost, gantries, mist, and keystone constrain Elias's final choice: he steps onto unsecured platforms and the gantry dissolves into frost as he embraces the stone. The mist-walking mechanics (buoyancy, negotiation) and the keystone's warmth are tactile and purposeful. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's priorities (irregular glow vs. steady machinery). Spatial choreography is clear across platforms and ice. The keystone charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    The flooded ballroom with air-pocket library is vivid and specific; the porthole view of ascending lanterns and the tuning fork's violet shimmer constrain the climactic discovery. Sensory hierarchy is strong—violet "like dust made of amethyst," mold-spotted volumes, brackish tide. The sheet-music cabinet's lock mechanism (key tag fits without a key) integrates setting into closure. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the descent.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ambered observatory and prismatic receiver constrain Elena's actions concretely: she adjusts equipment, reads coin patterns on the console's "viscous temporal medium." The setting's physical properties (amber suspension, parallax rails) are purposefully integrated into her wavelength-alignment task. The coins function as micro-setting objects that enable her decision method, and their warmth in the final beat charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint/charge.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    The observatory's cracked lens and brass telescope constrain the crystallization method (scattered light through aperture), and the dome's acoustic memory ("echoed forgotten phrases") charges the ending when her name appears in shadow-geometry. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"dust motes that danced like microscopic galaxies"—filtered through the reaper's cosmic frame. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (aperture, floorboards, telescope track, dome). The micro-setting (atlas page beneath beam) functions as the pivot object that enables the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sapphire viaduct and its seven-second drip rhythm are vivid and purposeful, directly constraining Elara's spell calibration and charging the final image of pooling water. Sensory detail is selective—"salt-crusted basin," "bronze clapper," "dried coral mallet"—and filtered through urgency. The setting's seepage increase as the sun warms stone supplies a critical variable for reconstruction, meeting the 9+ gate criterion of environment constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting is vivid and selective: "reservoir's surface becomes indistinguishable from the bruised sky," "viscous mud that had been Mrs. Callahan's prize-winning vegetable garden," the sapphire label matching "the deep October sky perfectly." The exposed foundations and retreating waterline constrain Elias's discovery and charge the final image of stars "trembling in the remaining water like memories trying to surface." Micro-setting (the mahogany floor, the embankment) shapes his physical descent and the trail's logic. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.4)
    The hidden orchard, waterfall, and silver tree are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (prismatic spray, petrichor, quicksilver roots). The orchard's "ancient freshness" and fruit existing "in multiple states simultaneously" charge the atmosphere and support the transformation theme. However, the environment remains largely scenic; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters Elara's tactics. The frozen dew crystal and wooden horse function as tokens rather than spatial anchors. Spatial choreography is clear (veil of water → through the curtain → central tree), but the setting acts as backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The nocturnal arbor, sulfuric mist, and stratospheric wind constrain Elara's choices (positioning, buckle adjustment) and charge the final image (collapse onto platform, landing lights). Sensory details—vapor walls, soundless echo through boots, cold metal teeth—are filtered through her professional attention. The parachute buckle functions as micro-setting, handled repeatedly and warming at closure. Minor gap: the "genetically engineered sequoia" and "salvaged glider wings" world-build but do not press a choice in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.1)
    The floating rock dojo and the rewriting-history sky supply vivid atmospheric detail and anchor the piece spatially. The jar as a recurring object is handled twice (arrival, opening) and charged at closure when it turns to dust. However, the setting functions more as backdrop than constraint: the rock's stability at the end mirrors Maya's resolution but does not pressure her choice. The body and the brain-in-jar micro-setting meet the minimum for this length, elevating the score slightly above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.1)
    The echo chamber tunnel is vividly rendered—obsidian walls, condensation, stalactites of grief—and constrains Elias's choices (he must macerate silence to reach the living). The pull cord handle is handled across multiple beats and charges the final image when it crumbles. Spatial choreography (tunnel walls, floorboards, living room, daughter's bedroom) tracks cleanly. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the phantom's urgency. The micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) qualifies and elevates the score into the 7-band.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.1)
    The frozen garden is richly rendered with selective, mood-congruent detail (crystallized roses, frost-covered branches, ice-locked peonies) and the mist functions as both atmosphere and metaphor. The interiorizing technique directly engages the setting—"the mist flowed into her lungs, the crystallized stems threaded through her ribs"—creating a micro-setting constraint that charges the protagonist's transformation. Spatial choreography is clean (thorny archway, frozen paths, sleeping oak root) and the cold, suspended environment mirrors the protagonist's liminal state, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain choice or charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ember nexus is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (geothermal vents, obsidian floor, violet and copper twilight) and the environment directly constrains Marcus's work—temperature thresholds matter, embers pulse in synchronization. The crucible functions as both tool and setting, shaping the successive attempts. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (workbench, crucible, positioning of broken pieces). The final image of twilight fracturing through carbon-glass facets charges the closure by making the transformation concrete and visible.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.2)
    The suspended city, gorge winds, iron catwalks, and transmission spire are vivid and specific. The "hollywood star fragment" warming in her hands supplies a tactile anchor that recurs and charges the final beat. Spatial choreography is clean: she climbs the spire, reaches the platform, places the fragment on the oscillator. The lunar perigee floods the gorge with silver light at the climax, directly shaping the moment of discovery and thus qualifying as constraint on the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional focus (resonance goggles, guy wires humming), though some phrases ("serenely electric") drift toward elevated diction without grounding in how she perceives electricity.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.2)
    The spectral grotto supplies vivid sensory anchors (bioluminescent constellations, memory-thick water, crystalline walls) and the hourglass appears in multiple beats. However, the environment never constrains a choice—Elias moves freely, tuning the radio without obstacle or scarcity. The setting functions as scenic backdrop rather than tactical pressure. Spatial choreography of forty-three passengers across "convergence points" remains vague; we never see him navigate physical limits or proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    The optical illusion gallery is vividly rendered with concrete, purposeful details—Penrose steps, Ames room, hollow mask—that charge the atmosphere and constrain Elara's work. Sensory selection (sinew thread "tasted of copper and salt," walls that "breathed") is filtered through the premise and supports the unsettling tone. The gallery participates in the closure image, unfolding "like origami" and spilling into the city, giving setting a causal role in the final transformation. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite the impossible geometry.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    The benthic city is vividly particular: "phosphor-lights," "bioluminescent glow," "pressurized glass and corroded steel" create a coherent sensory environment. The anchor chain link functions as micro-setting, constraining her navigation method and charging the final image as a "key to release." Spatial choreography (viewport, teaching chamber, observation glass) remains legible throughout. The setting pressures the dominant stake directly: oxygen limits and starvation drive the need to navigate through unfolded horizons.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mist-clad atrium is vivid and recurring, its glass ceiling and marble floor anchoring spatial choreography. The fog and twilight modulate with narrative beats, and the basement descent tracks clearly. The atrium's transformation from home to museum to conduit supplies atmospheric constraint. However, the basement itself—where the climax occurs—receives minimal sensory grounding; no smell, temperature shift, or tactile detail to charge Thomas's forty-year imprisonment.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    The facility's "ozone and stagnation," flooding lower levels, and dripping pipes effectively embody the claustrophobic pressure. The gold fleck functions as micro-setting, revealing invisible paths and charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent through the descent. The tidal causeway and quantum-flux state between submersion/dryness constrain access and enable the phase-transition corridors, directly shaping Mara's choices and the story's metaphysical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    The opal dome's fractures filter starlight into the spectrometer, the porcelain shard catches moonbeams, and the frozen ink lattice serves as both interface and constraint—all three constrain the defragmentation method and charge the final image. Sensory detail (opalescent fractures, dendritic ice patterns, frost on glass) is vivid and filtered through Elara's POV. The observatory functions as micro-setting that shapes the closure beat when the ghost dissolves "into her chest" beneath the dome.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bone towers, canyon acoustics, and whispering gallery are vividly specific and integral to the plot's mechanics. The diamond's placement in the hollow carved by ancient acousticians and the copper veins conducting reverberations embed setting in action. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the storyteller's professional priorities, and the environment directly enables the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.1)
    The underground garden supplies vivid sensory detail (bioluminescent fungi, tubers bursting into silver blooms, gravity-defying roots) and the arrowhead physically levitates to carve geometries, constraining the metamorphosis moment. However, spatial choreography remains vague—Elena's position relative to altar, phone, and garden features is unclear. The garden seals above her at the end, a choice-altering detail that charges closure. Micro-setting (arrowhead fused into chest) functions well, lifting the score despite the floating-room syndrome in the main cavern.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sky-bridge, orchard geometry, and living statues establish a vivid frame. The locust shell charges the final image (crumbles to dust, carried as offering), meeting the 9+ gate for object-as-micro-setting. However, spatial choreography wavers—Elara "stood upon," then "stepped forward," then "walked toward the east" without clear movement cost or bridge layout. Sensory detail skews visual and metaphoric ("bruised silver," "groaning wood") but rarely filters through professional violinist priorities (instrument care, acoustics, finger fatigue).

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cobalt arcade at twilight is vivid and recurring: "vaulted ceiling," "marble pillars," "scuff marks," "antique post boxes," "cracked marble" create a coherent space. Sensory selection is strong (ozone, rain scent, condensation, propeller wash) and the setting constrains choice—the lone mail drop window, the drone corridors overhead. The arcade's tiles and slots are woven into action (fingers tracing empty slots, depositing letters). The final image ("cobalt tiles reflecting the last light") charges the closure moment, though the metaphoric weight risks ornament over constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned circus train and improvised greenhouse (ferns, mist, shattered glass) anchor the scene with vivid, purpose-driven detail. The halo fragment on the marble pedestal and the wind bells supply recurring objects that constrain the sequence and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear: dining car → corridor → observation car → outside. The mist and birch forest modulate atmosphere in step with Elias's emotional arc. Minor cap applied per Q2 orientation debt would not trigger here; no debt was assessed.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    The hyperbolic library architecture is vividly rendered ("shelves curved inward like Pringles chips") and the scarf returns with physical specificity ("tattered silk," "frayed edges"). Spatial choreography of the non-Euclidean stacks is coherent and voice-filtered through Elena's mathematical understanding. However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics; Elena's trajectory is pre-calculated and unimpeded, so setting remains atmospheric rather than pressure-bearing at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.1)
    The whispering archipelago and watercolor palette constrain the final action: she must climb to the easternmost island and use the palette's "pools of yesterday's shadows" to bait the dream. Sensory detail is vivid ("salt-rimed doors," "green flash of approaching sun") and filtered through a lyric POV that prioritizes metaphor over tactile immediacy. Spatial choreography is clear (library → highest point → descent), though the "seven landmasses" and their voices remain abstract. The palette and sunrise setting charge the closure image, elevating the score despite ornamental passages.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.1)
    The shadowed nexus and starlight establish atmosphere, and "shadows deepening into geometries that hurt to observe" delivers vivid, POV-filtered sensory detail. However, the environment does not constrain Vey's choices—she moves freely through the void, and no spatial or material feature alters her tactics. The ribbon and hair function as tools but remain untethered to the nexus itself, limiting setting's causal role in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sunken greenhouse setting is vivid and constrains Elena's approach (wading through brine, using the headlamp, navigating the shipwrecks' geometry). The fairy ring's spatial relation to the broken constellation ceiling is clear and purposeful. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elena's folklorist lens ("salt-crusted floor," "barnacled timbers"). The compass placement at the ring's center uses micro-setting (the central grow-bed) to charge the closure. The shipwrecks lean closer in the final beat, a subtle atmospheric move that supports the threshold moment without overshadowing it.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    The forgotten library, brass table, samovar, and playground swing anchor space and recur with purpose. The swing's stillness at closure charges the final image and crystallizes the child's readiness. Micro-setting (shard on the table, hammer in hand) constrains the mentor's choices across multiple beats. Minor limit: the library's interior detail remains functional but does not deepen beyond initial anchors; no occupational depth is required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    The verdant parapet and waterfall anchor the scene vividly, with mist, moss, and spray-soaked air creating sensory texture. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the ritual. The setting charges the final image (the glade as "cathedral of preserved wonder"), meeting the micro-setting test. However, the environment does not constrain choice—Elian faces no material obstacle from the terrain or weather, and the waterfall functions as backdrop rather than tactical resource.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prism sanctuary is vividly rendered with spectral geometries, obsidian table, and prismatic walls that split starlight into unnamed colors. The tapestry needle and fisherman's net are handled tactilely across multiple beats, grounding the ritual in concrete objects. The broken mask functions as micro-setting, constraining her perception ("eyes exposed to the accumulated silence") and charging the final image when silence fills its cracks like dark kintsugi. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.8)
    Settings are vivid and varied: studio magnification, rain-scoured vault with limestone and vellum scent, turf-covered henge at dawn, acoustic chapel. The fresco vault's moisture-worn plaster and the chapel's drip-echo acoustics ground pivotal discoveries. The torn map at specific coordinates and the limestone lintel constrain her path and charge the closure image. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional focus (fiber cuts under magnification, shadow shifts in footage). Minor: the henge itself remains slightly generic in visual texture compared to the vault and chapel.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    The submerged library setting constrains choice: sixty-meter depth, decompression stops, and the pressurized environment all limit Julian's actions and shape his ascent. The snow globe as micro-setting charges the closure—its "eternal winter" and copper filament become the story's conceptual anchor. Sensory details are filtered through Julian's analytic POV ("light refracted through salt-preserved portholes," "surface tension and memory"). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the dive and ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.7)
    The misty courtyard, pneumatic tubes, and obelisk are vividly rendered and recur across beats. The flower press bolt plate's tactile detail (fossilized petals, microscopic gardens) anchors the encoding action. Spatial choreography is coherent—vapor, moss-covered stones, central obelisk, walls—and the mist's transformation into hand/face/mouth charges the ghost's presence. However, the environment does not meaningfully constrain Elara's choices; she moves through it without friction or resource limitation, functioning more as atmospheric backdrop than pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    The icebound spire functions as both macro-setting and constraint: frost-coated glass refracts light to enable the cipher, the elevator's ten-floor structure paces revelation, and the final observatory positions Elara between cloud ocean and stratospheric space. Sensory details—brass cage shuddering, cables singing, breath fogging goggles—are filtered through Elara's heightened attention. The "cathedral of frozen water and ambition" charges the final image where she becomes the next inhabitant of this indifferent geometry. The goggles as micro-setting object constrain her choices and charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.1)
    The gondola, telescope, and red twine are handled concretely and recur with purpose. The sky itself (cumulus, cirrus, anvil cloud formations) supplies a rich sensory palette filtered through Elara's professional lens. The brass telescope's patina and the frayed twine fibers are embodied details. However, the environment never constrains a choice—Elara does not navigate wind, cold, or altitude; the gondola simply "drifts" passively. The setting is vividly described but does not pressure tactics, keeping the piece in mid-7s rather than higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    The tree-trunk library is vividly realized ("tiers of bookshelves spiraling upward like ribosomes inside a cell") and constrains multiple choices: the hidden book safe in the restricted shelf, the spiral staircase she must climb, the eastern window admitting first light. The demolition crew's presence is felt as "a vibration in the wood rather than seen," filtering setting through Elara's tactile POV. The dome ceiling becomes the canvas that charges the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through professional priorities (fractals, grain, texture) and the rotting tree trunk's condemned status drives the temporal pressure, making the setting indispensable to both conflict and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.1)
    The antique airship, observation deck, teak deck with hopscotch board, and starling murmurations outside create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—brass railing, cold metal, engine soot, dust—and filtered through Elara's cartographic lens. The hopscotch board constrains her final decoding action and charges the closure image by mirroring the starling spiral, meeting the 9+ gate criterion. Idiom and register remain consistent; spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.1)
    The frozen library and hall of mirrors are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail—"frost-rimed door," "crystallized tomes," "permafrost," "mercury caught in invisible currents." The environment shapes the journey (three-day climb, thin air, groaning shelves) and the mirrors function as both constraint and teaching tool, showing "multiplied angles" that guide her hands. Spatial choreography is clean. The final beat ("ice retreating from the walls in rivulets") ties restoration to environmental change, charging the closure image. Micro-setting (the pedestal, the vial, the gears) all constrain or enable action.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    The floating rock arches and orchard provide a distinctive visual frame and anchor the nebula's formation mechanism. The watering bell's ceramic fragility and the butterfly garden's pollination role offer purposeful micro-setting. However, spatial choreography during the midnight assembly remains vague—seventy-three survivors position reflectors and collectors without legible movement or constraint. The nebula itself, though visually rendered, does not materially limit Mara's final choice; it appears as reward rather than constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.4)
    The hidden lighthouse at dusk is vividly rendered with "amber light," "spiral stairs," "cooling brass mechanism," and the beam that transforms from warning to melody-carrier. These details are filtered through Elara's POV and constrain her spatial ritual (climbing stairs, placing the puppet on the spindle). The lighthouse's isolation and the "pane of hush" create atmospheric pressure that charges the final image. The micro-setting (the central spindle, the puppet head as resonator) functionally shapes the closure beat, meeting the 9+ quick test for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, cursed orchard, and vibration plate all constrain Elara's tactics. The "offhandedly exact" nut placement and the vibration-plate gambit charge the ending image. Spatial choreography is clear: limestone cracks, ravine floor, eastern cave mouth, basalt pillar. The frost's sensory arrival—"sparkling layer"—directly shapes the closure timing and reinforces the world's rules.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.1)
    The braided ravine functions as more than backdrop: its physical structure (river splitting/rejoining, foam eddies, root system) directly enables Elena's insight and constrains her focus throughout. Sensory detail is POV-filtered through her chemist's vocabulary (schist, polymer chains, surface tension, chitin cross-linking). The chrysalis caught in roots is discovered through goal-directed movement and handled concretely. Spatial choreography is clear: edge→descent→waterline→flat stone→trail. The setting's divergent-convergent morphology charges the final image of her designing a polymer "that could stretch without breaking."

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.2)
    The glass orchard library and cloud-sea are vividly rendered but function as backdrop rather than constraint; no choice depends on spatial access or environmental pressure. The bottles appear on the cart and are scattered, but their placement doesn't alter Elara's access to the white room. Spatial choreography is coherent (cart, shelves, alcoves, threshold), and sensory detail is selective, but the setting remains ornamental to the core conflict. The cap from orientation debt (Q2 penalty applied) holds Q3 at 7.0 maximum.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.1)
    The desert fortress after rain and the coral-ice pavilion beneath the dunes supply vivid, purposeful detail that directly enables Kael's quest: tidal pools map the entrance, frozen coral becomes the medium she works. Sensory specificity—"red mud," "cold air upward," "humming with stored remorse"—filters through Kael's chef palate and alchemical purpose. The micro-setting (her hands on coral walls) constrains the climactic act of subsumption and charges the final image of salt stains as the desert resumes sovereignty.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.8)
    The astronomical clock tower and its brass mechanisms supply vivid, purpose-driven detail (stained-glass orrery, copper pipes, escapement wheel). The cuckoo clock weight's descent and the grain elevators' rusted arms provide spatial grounding that constrains Elara's single tactical move. However, the elevators respond "immediately" without friction, and the valley setting functions as backdrop rather than obstacle. The micro-setting (weight, pipes) shapes the one key turn but does not charge the final image with new meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.1)
    The moonlit canyon provides atmospheric backdrop but does not constrain Elena's choices or supply resources that affect outcome. Spatial details like "canyon's edge" and "canyon floor" remain abstract; we never learn scale, access routes, or physical obstacles. The mirror fragments are handled repeatedly, satisfying the object requirement for Q9, but the environment itself functions as postcard description rather than pressure. The body receives some attention (trembling hands, pressing glass to temple) but these gestures do not alter tactics or charge the final image in a way that makes the setting indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.7)
    The serpentine grotto, inverted gravity, and mist are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (chilled honey, latent blaze, bioluminescent seeds). Spatial choreography remains clear through the inversion sequence. The threshold effects and gravity mechanics constrain Elara's approach—she can only enter during the inversion hour—meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting must shape a choice or charge the closure. However, the grotto functions primarily as backdrop in the final beat; the combinations are revealed passively by alignment rather than through a tactile, lived-in interaction with the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    The porcelain insulator and stress cracks in the wood function as micro-setting, constraining Elara's method and charging the final image when the insulator trembles and amplifies the note. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (frost, bark texture, morning light on crazed glaze), filtered through Elara's symphonic perception. Spatial choreography is clean, and the alder's wounds serve as both map and instrument, directly shaping the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    The magnetic nexus is vivid and functionally constrains the chess moves—pieces trembling, compass needles spinning, iron filings standing. The basalt worry stone's dent and the "specific shade of violet" at twilight anchor sensory detail in POV. The nexus directly enables the curved knight trajectory and charges the final image when "the magnetic field stabilized around him." Spatial choreography (kneeling, pieces on bedrock grid) remains coherent throughout. Small dock: the "obsidian stones" setting and the carved grid could be more economically integrated earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    The workshop setting ("resonating table fashioned from salvaged piano soundboards and fossilized whale song") is vivid and purposeful, anchoring the frequency-tuning mechanics. Spatial choreography remains clear (Elio's hands, the diary, the table, peripheral fireworks). The workshop constrains the method—tuning requires the specialized tools—and charges the final image of cataloging beneath celebration. However, the setting does not shape a difficult choice or evolve causally across beats; it functions as a supportive stage rather than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.1)
    The treetop village is vividly rendered with concrete sensory anchors—woven bridge, rope ladders, moss-thick hollow, swaying platforms—and the setting constrains Elara's movement and approach to planting. The "turning of the tide's thought" provides both temporal marker and atmospheric texture, and the micro-setting (the hollow between platforms seven and eight) becomes functionally necessary for the planting choice. Sensory selection reflects Elara's olfactory bias effectively. The setting does not, however, charge the final image; the closing moment focuses on her internal detection of germination rather than an environmental detail that crystallizes cost.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The floating arches, inverted orchards, and upward-flowing rivers create a vivid, purpose-driven environment that constrains navigation and charges several images. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the rig's ascent and the magnetic clamp engagement. The broken arrow tip embedded in the keystone functions as micro-setting, anchoring the convergence point and charging the final image with temporal/geological weight. Sensory selection (bioluminescent groves, mossy underside, chromatic waves) reflects urgency and prioritizes the extraordinary physics of the inversion without postcard cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    The container labyrinth is vivid and selective: rust-red walls, scorch marks on HAZMAT 447, crystallized residue underfoot. Spatial choreography is clean (twelve-high stacks, ten-meter clearing, twenty-meter visibility into fog). The environment actively constrains choices—containers as baffles create wind shear that killed Chen—and charges the final image (fog swirling in predictable spirals confirms her calculations). The professional filter (anemometer readings, blast radius measurements) shapes what Maya notices without catalog bloat. Minor slip: "yellow-gray mist that seemed to breathe" edges toward stock personification.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.1)
    The ice cavern and aurora provide vivid sensory detail (emerald and rose curtains, crystalline walls, violet silence) but function primarily as backdrop. The seventeen crystal bells and central spire supply spatial choreography, and the cavern's "molecular memory" charges the final image with minor resonance. Setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; Elara's task proceeds without environmental friction. Micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) present but underutilized in pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Thunder-echo range is vividly rendered through selective detail: "avalanchingly quiet," trapped thunder in stone corridors, volcanic dust, bleached cottonwood. The canyon hush and driftwood markers constrain Mira's ritual—she must arrange them "with mathematical precision" to trace the topology of her mistake—and the setting's silence charges the final image when the range "stood whole, avalanchingly quiet in its gratitude." Spatial choreography is clear (talus slopes, fissure, canyon walls) and the body's interaction with the flute (teeth ache, hands grow warm) grounds the abstract weaving action.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    The topaz workshop, pneumatic tubes, Vandercook press, and halo fragment supply vivid, occupation-specific anchors that feel lived-in. The halo fragment constrains Elara's work (it powers the press, feeds on stolen pages) and charges the final image with its shift from warm glow to cold light. Spatial choreography is clean—amber walls, skylight, iron press, type drawers—and the vanishing stars function as both atmosphere and ticking clock, though their pressure remains more poetic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.1)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway and dragonfly pendant supply vivid sensory anchors that recur and shift meaning across beats. The frozen soil's impossible bloom is spatially coherent and charged at closure. The pendant's vibration constrains Elias's choice to stop and speak, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment/object shaping tactics. Spatial choreography (ridgeway, feet, soil, Observatory ahead) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.4)
    The quartz arbor, mist, and frost patterns are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Elara's mystic lens. The sedan's frost-bloomed windows and the prism's refraction constrain her method: she reads the fractal language to commune with the car's history. However, spatial choreography remains light—no body or tool detail that pressures a micro-choice. The setting charges the final image (quartz arbor sings, mist thickens) but does not materially narrow Elara's options mid-scene, keeping the score in the mid-6s.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.7)
    Setting details are vivid and purposeful: bamboo forest with "silver needles" of light, skeletal apple trees, dead leaves stirred into a cyclone. The loom, amber beads, and puzzle edges function as micro-setting objects that constrain Maya's work (she must recommence seven times; her blood provides adhesion). The orchard's decay mirrors the unraveling silence and charges the final image when Maya becomes transparent within it. However, spatial choreography inside the cottage is vague—where the loom sits relative to the puzzle box, how the beads are stored and selected—and the rummage sale intrusion (a village sale in a "forgotten orchard deep in a bamboo forest") jars plausibility without explanation. The body as micro-setting (bleeding fingers, trembling grasp) does constrain her weaving and supports the 9+ gate, but the unexplained village sale and thin interior geography prevent full integration.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.7)
    The floating rock arches, violet shadows, and magnetic ore create a vivid, fantastical setting with clear spatial anchors. The mine shafts and seed vault are grounded in tactile detail (crystallized seeds, rubble, lantern shadows). However, the environment remains largely ornamental—gravity "negotiable" in the shafts is asserted but never constrains a choice or complicates her movement. The forge-hammer's use with the silk is mentioned but not detailed enough to show how tool mechanics shape the outcome, preventing the setting from reaching the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.1)
    The repair bay is vivid and specific—rusted hull plates, eastern hangar door, ozone and copper variants across universes—and it constrains Elara's exploration (she was kept away from the eastern door, the convergence point matters tactically). The sensory catalogue is dense and POV-filtered through her mapping discipline. The green shard functions as micro-setting object, warming and pulsing, cutting the air to enable passage; it charges the final image by dissolving into her palm. The bay's transformation in the closing beats (no longer abandoned but "inhabited by the resonance of acceptance") reweights the space with thematic cost, pushing this into the 7-band despite the heavy reliance on abstract sensory metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    The haunted lantern room is vivid and specific (phosphorescent mist, iron stairs with rust, shadows pooling differently), and it constrains Elara's timing ("always came after dark, when failure of the lamp created sanctuary"). The widow's walk and gallery rail function as micro-settings that enable the cairn messages. Sensory details are selective and filtered through her professional gaze (wick, reservoir, lamp mechanism by memory). The ghost at the window holding the jar charges the final image, making the setting indispensable to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.4)
    The emerald lighthouse and glass lantern wick provide vivid, recurring anchors. Sensory detail (ozone, ink scent, starlight refraction) is selective and tied to the ritual. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or complicate tactics; it serves as stage dressing for the conceptual action. The micro-setting (wick in palm, emerald walls) does not alter the protagonist's options at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The floating rock tea house constrains the protagonist's perspective (height, rotation, mist-veiled isolation) and the wing's iridescence becomes a working tool that tracks light and charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects the dye master's craft (indigo, cochineal, fixing bath analogies) and her watchful priorities. Spatial choreography is coherent (eastern window, cedar floors, paper lanterns, valley below), and the environment's drift on magnetic ore subtly mirrors the protagonist's suspended state. The micro-setting (wing, sun trails, pavilion rotation) functionally charges the closure image when the wing is released and "became a star," satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    The labyrinth's petrified heartwood, amber vials, and moon-soaked tower create vivid, purposeful setting. The sextant catches dreams (micro-setting as tool), and moonlight enables Elara's healing, both constraining her nocturnal work pattern. The stormlit tower scene uses environment actively: lightning mixes with lunar light to charge the tree's response. Spatial choreography remains clear across corridors and tower climb, and sensory detail (bioluminescent bark hum "felt in her teeth") sharpens the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.1)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse, mica window, and inverted-time glass walls are vivid and purposefully strange. The mica window functions as a tool—Elara's loom—and returns at multiple beats, constraining her method and charging the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("cold fire," "translucent planes catching sonic threads"), and the environment shapes the ritual's possibility. The micro-setting (seeds, bark, luminous threads) alters tactics during the swaddling act, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Athenaeum's "vaulted library concealed behind what appeared to be a janitorial closet" provides a concrete micro-setting that constrains Elias's isolation and charges his choice to leave the door unlatched. The green glass lamps, peephole, marble floor, and rare books section supply spatial choreography; his retreat "into the shadows" where "no light reached" anchors the final image. The secret society detail remains atmospheric rather than plot-functional—we learn nothing of the society's operations or rules that would alter Elias's tactics. The threshold and the door mechanism matter at closure, elevating spatial specificity beyond postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    The overgrown palace courtyard is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: wisteria-consumed tea house, cracked marble, pumpkin vines trained up walls, winter wheat in the broken fountain. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the garden's evolution. The setting constrains choice (illicit planting requires "softness of a ghost") and charges the final image (scent of the garden carried into streets beyond). Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's priorities (anise and memory from bread, frost silvering vines). The tea house functions as both sanctuary and contested space, though the "secret but no longer hidden" paradox in the final paragraph introduces mild confusion about access and discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    The frozen library, brass apparatus, and magic lantern slide function as micro-setting that constrains and enables action: the resonator translates light to mathematics, calipers measure decay, the slide's warmth signals mnemonic release. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—"frost-rimed balustrade," "quartz hush," "prismatic shadows"—filtered through Elara's archival priorities. The apparatus directly charges the final image when the slide goes "clear, empty glass holding nothing but her own reflection," turning tool into mirror and completing the thematic loop. Spatial choreography (balustrade to obsidian table to ledger) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.1)
    The pirate market beneath the rotting pier is vivid: barnacles like rusted coins, lanterns swaying with tide, the smell of rain on ancient wood. Spatial choreography is clear—stalls, support beams, dripping infrastructure. The micro-setting (the fob as tool and the pier's tidal clock) constrains Mara's movements and charges the ending when she tucks it away as the waves rise. This lifts the score into the mid-6s. However, much of the description ("salt-rotted underworld," "curiously steadfast heartbeat") reads atmospheric rather than action-integrated, and the market's pressure on choice remains more backdrop than active constraint in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lavender bluff and aurora establish vivid atmosphere through sensory specificity ("crushed thyme and ozone," "terrestrially cosmic"). Spatial choreography of the four figures converging is clear. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; neither the bluff's purple stone nor the aurora constrain a choice or alter tactics—they frame rather than pressure. The forests below are mentioned as voting entities but never become a spatial resource or obstacle on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.2)
    The subterranean crystal cave supplies vivid sensory detail ("prismatic crystals catching stray photons," "violet crystals at this hour") that establishes tone. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the sudden appearance of "the back wall" and the safe behind a canvas feels under-anchored in initial spatial setup. The singing crystals in the hidden gallery function as discovery rather than constraint on prior choice, limiting score elevation. Micro-setting (canvas, safe, hairpins as tools) is present but the underground environment does not meaningfully pressure Elara's tactics until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.4)
    The greenhouse city under toxic sky is vivid and purposeful, shaping the sealed districts and postal collapse. Sensory detail is selective (ash, steam, condensation, vines) and filtered through the setting's logic. However, the northern quadrant itself—the destination that drives the plot—remains spatially vague; we never see or feel the flood Marcus mentions or the physical constraint it might impose. The zinc plates as keys is a nice touch but doesn't meaningfully constrain the vault approach.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    The whispering bluff, thin atmosphere, and iceberg fragment are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (prisms, thermal currents, altitude effects on fingers). The iceberg's refraction of sound into visible spectra is a purposeful detail that charges the final image. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—Elara's work proceeds without spatial friction or environmental complication, keeping the setting in mid-range rather than the 9+ band where constraint or crisis-driven detail would be required.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glass dome, desert roses with bio-luminescent circuitry, and eastern quadrant layout create a vivid micro-setting that constrains Kael-9's choices (burn protocol targets the most compromised zone). Sensory detail—iridescent blue-and-copper flames, smoke patterns resembling neural pathways—charges the final image without overwhelming momentum. The environment actively shapes the resolution: the dome's ventilation system enables the controlled burn, and the rootstock's resilience supports the ending's theme of regeneration.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.7)
    The courtyard at dawn is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (amber rays, dust motes, marigolds). Spatial choreography tracks clearly through the flower cart, bakery, and mailbox perimeter. The locket and mailbox function as charged objects that recur meaningfully. However, the construction crews remain a distant backdrop rather than a tangible constraint that alters Maya's tactics, and the fifty-pace distance feels postcard-staged rather than pressure-driven. The setting supports atmosphere but does not force a key choice.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sunken laboratory is vividly rendered—bioluminescent fungi, brass bowls, algae pipes—and the water motif threads through each beat (puddles, seawater, drip). Setting constrains movement choreography (weaving between centrifuges, shallow puddles) and the vault mechanism anchors the final image. Spatial coherence is maintained and sensory detail (cyan glow, drip, hum) filters through a POV aware of both ruin and beauty, lifting the category into solid territory.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The salt crystal chamber is vividly rendered with specific, embodied detail: gravity pockets that pull at boots, formations "like frozen lightning," the whale's subsonic hum in the marrow. The tin cup and coffee grounds function as micro-setting tools that constrain Mara's divination method. The ribcage formation and the barnacle-etched tin box both charge the final image, linking setting to closure. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sensory detail is vivid ("moonlight turned water into liquid mercury," "cricket song and the gurgle of currents") but remains postcard description—the brook, clearing, and nocturnal setting do not constrain any choice or supply resources that alter outcome. The crane's wing is handled across beats, yet its paper properties and starlight charge function as ornament rather than tactical constraint. Spatial choreography is clean but the environment exerts no pressure on the working itself.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.1)
    Art Deco crown molding, rooftop garden with lavender and jasmine, and the copper flashing are vivid and purposeful. The desk seal (brass handle, carnelian stone, house symbol) is specific and materially present across beats, constraining Maya's interpretive method and enabling the final gesture. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout; the building's architecture functions as micro-setting that charges the closure image when seals meet copper flashing. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maya's interpretive lens, though the meteor showers feel ornamental—mentioned three times but never pressuring a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.1)
    The velvet garden is vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (silver moss, flowers "heavy as tapestries," bioluminescence) and the environment actively participates in the archiving ritual. The garden's response to Elara's song and its absorption of the memory into roots provide purposeful interaction. The twilight-to-dawn progression tracks clearly and creates urgency. The setting charges the final image (flowers turned silver-white, glowing) and constrains the action through the time limit, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment shapes choice or charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.1)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, and stalactite drips are vivid and consistent, establishing a specific atmosphere. The setting constrains Elara's choices—seven years of isolation, reliance on melted snow, the altar hiding-place—and charges the final image with the pearl twilight dissolving into dawn. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The rose thorn and obsidian seal function as micro-setting objects that shape key moments (blood-mixing, wax-sealing), meeting the 9+ gate criterion of constraining choice and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    The serpentine nexus, starlight columns, and seashell anchor setting vividly and purposefully. The shell's positioning to "catch the starlight at the precise angle" constrains Mira's action and charges the climax. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("dust of centuries," "sandstone worn smooth"), and the spatial choreography of descent and convergence remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glacier shrine, obsidian altar, candle-lit ice walls, and melted snow globe are vivid and sensory; the shrine's physicality (candles guttering as temperature drops, glacier groaning outside) grounds the scene. The snow globe constrains Elara's interpretation twice—once as warped evidence, once as transformed artifact—and the shrine functions as both micro-setting and conceptual pressure. Spatial choreography is clean; the environment charges the final image of "borrowed starlight" filtering through ice, though the shrine itself does not alter a tactical choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    The parapet setting is vivid and selective: wet slate, spider webs between merlons, moon paths on puddles. The environment actively constrains and enables—Kaelen climbs for height to see hidden effort, the firefly lands on the net to reveal a tear, moonlight creates the "moon paths" that guide her vision. The bamboo whisk and net function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through her philosophical priorities (phosphorescent wings, damp earth, stone whisper) without postcard drift.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.1)
    The orchard, dust storms, and diamond constraint shape the central problem and recur across beats. Sensory detail is selective: amber dust, bioluminescent lantern, radiation burns on her fingers. The resonator and root cellar ground the climax spatially. The storms pausing and the buffer zone expanding at the end charge the final image with environmental consequence. Minor slip: "iron-skinned apple trees" and "trees bore fruit without seeds" are vivid but their tactile handling is not dramatized; they remain observed rather than touched or used.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    The observatory is vividly anchored: aluminum ribs, cobalt glass portico, hail drumming, spiral stairs, copper aerials. The storm and portico actively constrain Elian's ritual (storm timing, glass conductivity, aerial geometry), and the cobalt glass becomes the mechanism for seeding shadows into the rain. The mushroom beard and condensation trails add lived-in texture, and the final image—cobalt-tinted rain—charges the ending by making the setting's transformation literal and visible.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.1)
    The feral loft beneath the dunes functions as both physical setting and psychological container, with the jars creating a tactile archive. The music box's sand-choked mechanism and corroded brass handle ground the decay. Spatial choreography is clear (ladder, rafters, shelves, floorboard). The setting constrains choice by providing the jars and music box that enable the closure composition, and the departure from the loft charges the final image with the cost of leaving his "lonesome splendor."

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.7)
    The drift-ice marina, fleeting sunset, and lighthouse are rendered with vivid sensory detail (azure coat, amber icebergs, fresnel lens catching light). Spatial choreography is clean: Mara moves from marina to lighthouse base to lantern room without confusion. The setting supplies the tower as a resource and the sunset as a time constraint, both affecting outcome. However, the crypt keeper's key and resonant chambers function more as symbolic props than as physical tools that constrain choice through tactile engagement; the hidden slot and vibrational matching mechanics lack the grounded specificity needed to charge the final image beyond the ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (crystallizing breath, volcanic rock, spectral distortion in starlight). The lake's frozen state gates the escape and the basalt's iron content enables the viaduct, directly constraining the plan's timing and method. Spatial choreography across the ice is clear, and the setting charges the final image when the sanctuary recedes as "no longer a prison but a milestone."

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tunnel setting is vivid and specific: mud after eighteen months of drought, dripping concrete, Victorian-era forgotten station, rope and gravel details. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (body in runoff channel, lantern, telescope three feet away). The lantern's unbroken glass and the vibration traveling through rails to the empty chamber are strong micro-setting beats that charge the final moments. Minor issue: the "watchfully calm in death, eyes open to dripping concrete" image borders on ornamental observer description rather than a detail that alters Maya's choice in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    The shop is anchored early (antique repair, high windows, counter) and the storm pressures the atmosphere throughout. The clockwork heart—handled twice, unwrapped and examined—constrains the central choice by revealing the serial number. Sensory detail is selective (ozone, rain-soaked hush, golden light) and filtered through Elias's guilt-laden attention. However, the shop itself remains generic beyond "high windows" and "counter"; no tool, spatial constraint, or micro-setting detail alters tactics or charges the final image beyond the convenient shaft of light.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.8)
    The workshop's floating gears, rusted chains, acid sea vapor, and kaleidoscope decoder are all handled and constrain Kip's methods. The arrow tip's sharpness and weight serve dual functions (carving, pendulum), demonstrating purposeful micro-setting. The acid sea's color evolution ("blue to yellow to this aggressive chartreuse") and the hissing waves at closure charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear: suspended cart, overhead rails, central cogwheel below. The setting does more than backdrop; it supplies the tools and pressure that enable the transliteration work.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.1)
    The digital archive setting is evocative—"holographic interfaces," "quantum server core," "deletion vault"—but remains largely atmospheric rather than constraining choices. Spatial choreography is vague; we never learn how Elara physically navigates the facility or what tools she manipulates beyond generic "interfaces." The "flickering servers" and "cascade of deleted photographs" open with strong sensory detail, but the setting does not evolve or impose tactical limits. The patch photographed "against velvet" is a nice specific detail that adds texture without driving action.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lighthouse-orchard-ice composite is vivid and specific, but spatial choreography wobbles: roots drinking mist "above" grinding floes creates contradictory verticality. The vintage mirrors supply the solution's mechanics and anchor the closure image, charging the final beat. However, the mirrors appear suddenly at the one-third mark without prior cue, and their scavenged history is told rather than discovered through Elara's tactile engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered with sensory specificity: bergs groaning, ice clicking like glass bells, canvas tents snapping, snow that stings and cleanses. The parasol tip functions as both object and micro-setting, constraining her probing action and charging the final image when tucked against her heart. The setting shapes her search and the sound she hears, elevating it beyond postcard description. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the harbor trawling, and the frozen environment pressures her quest for "the sound of approaching endings."

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    The amber pavilion, skeletal vines, and rust-colored leaves anchor atmosphere and filter through Elena's professional lens (viticulture). The charred letter edge is handled twice (pocket, smoothed against palm) and charges the final image (composting into soil). Autumn's cycle—apparent death concealing root preparation—constrains her realization and the ending. Sensory detail is vivid and selective, though some passages (moon over vines, pavilion holding absence) drift toward postcard generality without urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.1)
    Setting elements—kinetic parapet, murmuring pavilion, conjured clearing—are named and described with vivid, purpose-driven detail. The parapet's mechanical stirring and the pavilion's murmuring voices supply atmospheric texture. However, these elements do not visibly constrain a tactical choice or alter the protagonist's options on the page; they respond to her actions (rising in a protective arc, sighing with new texture) rather than forcing her to adapt. The body (removing the mask) functions as micro-setting and charges one beat, but the closure image does not hinge on environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lavender field, ruined factory, and climbing vines create a vivid, purposeful setting that recurs across the season and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (gates, field, factory, spiral center), and the vines' ascent marks time while mirroring reclamation. The dove gray map case and photographs are handled multiple times, grounding action in tactile detail. The setting does not constrain a single pivotal choice, but it accumulates meaning and supports the accumulative design, lifting this into the 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.1)
    The shadowed library at dawn is vividly rendered with sonically reflective walls, lichen-covered books, and mycelium grammars. Sensory detail is dense and POV-filtered through Elara's scholarly perspective. The crystal and library space participate in the final image, charging it with motif cohesion. The setting pressures the concept (language decay/growth) but does not constrain a tactical choice in a high-stakes moment.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The fog sculptures function as both setting and constraint, their shifting forms mirroring memory erosion and creating navigational pressure. The chalk and driftwood markers are micro-setting elements that directly enable tactics (writing notations, spiral navigation). The final image—Elias drawing new arrows in dust—recharges the garden's function. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered (rust taste, magnetic ghosts, chalk squeaking), though spatial choreography within the spiral could be slightly clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lunar observatory above clouds, the chronometer room with spinning brass hand, oxygen gardens, and the old reel-to-reel anchor the setting vividly. The spinning clock hand constrains Elara's choice—she must stabilize it to capture the ephemeral—and the final image of moon's light pooling in her hands charges the closure. Sensory hierarchy remains consistent with Elara's expertise (lenses, aperture mechanisms, silver nitrate plates), though some details (titanium beams, mahogany camera body) feel decorative rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.4)
    Cloudhaven's altitude, glass walls, and cloud-sea create a vivid suspended world. The IV pump click, monitor beeps, and curtain rustle anchor micro-setting details that support the hymning ritual. The "scent of hope"—ozone and meadow rising upward—defies physics purposefully and charges the emotional turn. The vinyl shard's tactile presence (jagged edge, gold lettering) recurs with reweighted meaning at closure, qualifying as object-as-setting that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    The nocturnal observatory, floating isle, brass orrery, and frost-traced sigils create vivid atmosphere and the orrery constrains the key action (inserting the key, walking loops). Spatial choreography is coherent. However, the setting functions more as backdrop than pressure; the floating isle's "eternal twilight" and the observatory's isolation don't materially narrow her options or complicate her task. The orrery charges the closure adequately to enter mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.1)
    The secret garden, hedge maze constellation, and yew tree are vivid and purposeful, grounding the magical frame with iron-and-lilac scent and impossible rose geometries. The tooth pulses "like a star," and the birch bark/silver wire splinting integrate faerie materiality into the medical act. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (maze → garden → bench → fountain → roots), though the fountain's sudden appearance and the girl "beneath the roots" create minor spatial fog. The garden's "orbital" quality and constellation-shaped maze constrain the closure image, lifting this into the high-7 range.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    The serpentine grotto is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (weeping mineral tears, mist curling, starlight through fissures) and micro-setting detail (flat altar-stone, vents, ferns in crevices). The environment constrains her method—she must rely on filtered starlight—and the grotto's breath synchronizes with her work, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The body and the sea glass function as micro-setting elements that shape her choices and the final configuration.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    The data center setting is vivid and specific (moss on circuit boards, sphagnum in ventilation grates, calcium trails on the eastern wall) and constrains her choice—she can only perform this ritual here, away from screens. Sensory details are filtered through her "watchful dreamer" lens and directly charge the final image (pendant on ledge where drip forms a spiral). Spatial choreography is clear across beats. The honeyed hush functions as micro-atmosphere that enables her vulnerability, satisfying the micro-setting allowance and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "feral nexus in mist" is evocative and tonally consistent, but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint—Mara kneels and arranges cards without spatial resistance or resource pressure. The spiral shell fragment anchors the ritual and glows at the key beat, lending some charge to the final image. Sensory detail skews visual and metaphorical (fog, glow, wet earth) with limited tactile or kinetic grounding. The environment does not alter her tactics; it accommodates her ceremony.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.9)
    The verdant arbor anchors the scene vividly with crushed mint, wisteria canopy, and the stone altar. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric ("sap moving in the trees," "honey-colored light"), filtered through Elara's heightened attention. The chronometer's sympathetic resonance and the vine's placement on the altar demonstrate objects shaping action. However, the arbor itself does not constrain Elara's choices—it serves as stage rather than pressure. The micro-setting (body, chronometer, vine) performs better, charging the final image when the vine entwines the beams.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.1)
    The subarctic crater orchard is vividly drawn with selective sensory detail (crystalline breath plumes, permafrost roots, aurora shimmer) and the cold environment pressures Elara's physicality throughout. The illustration plate returns across beats (nested in patterns, traced with suspension, absorbing starlight) and charges the final image. However, spatial choreography of Elara's body and the concentric paper patterns could be sharper; the orchard itself does not constrain a choice so much as provide atmospheric backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)
    The marble cavern is vividly rendered through quartz veins, crystalline hollows, and reflection angles that guide Elias's method; the diagonal quake-slash and fractured acoustics anchor the problem spatially. The timer mechanism's brass gears and escapement wheel are handled across multiple beats (observing at dawn, filing a new tooth, winding the mainspring), constraining his approach through its frozen position and damaged geometry. The setting contributes materially to tactics and charges the final image when the marble "exhales" trapped frequencies.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.1)
    The bronze grotto, starlight aperture, and kerosene lamp establish vivid sensory anchors and the text maintains spatial coherence (loom, walls, northern aperture, floor). However, the setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice or charging the closure image—Elara could perform this ritual anywhere with minor edits. The orientation penalty from Q2 applies here as the cap at 7.0, but the setting's passivity keeps the score lower within that band.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.1)
    The skylight functions as both atmospheric anchor and perceptual lens: raindrops as "tiny clock measuring the boiling point" and "crystallized prisms" filter Mara's temporal processing. The ash wood's grain—"tight grain near the center, the softer edges where decay had nearly claimed it"—constrains her carving choices and mirrors her emotional excavation. The loft's persistent scent of sawdust and mane conditioner charges the space with Viktor's absence. The kettle's whistle provides a temporal frame that times the carving work, and the workbench becomes a stage for transformation rather than mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.1)
    The kinetic lagoon is vivid and purposefully surreal ("water moved in perpetual spirals," "vapor that swirled against gravity's logic"), and the aerial carousel provides spatial anchors. The disposable camera wheel functions as a micro-setting object that constrains Mara's trade (she collects fragments to bargain with the ghost), meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered, though some passages ("violet mist," "brass pole held a mirror") lean decorative rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.1)
    The spaceport is vividly specific: popcorn kernels, cracked terrazzo, stained glass skylight, carnival-installed pumps. These details anchor Maya's perceptual priorities (infrastructure, flow) and the carnival's auxiliary systems directly enable her solution, making setting causally active. The sextant piece recurs with shifted function (navigation tool → sunlight angle measure → paperweight), charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across mezzanine, central hub, and hydroponic rails.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    The crystal whispering forecourt is sensorially vivid (quartz pavers, amber pools, ice crystals refracting light) and constrains Elara's ritualized placement of the metronome at the center where formations grow thickest. Petrichor anchors memory (childhood summers, mother's conservatory, wet mahogany) and charges the ending walk through rain-smelling streets. The monastery's "glacial hush" and sunrise progression shape the emotional arc, and the final quartz vibration ("singing a song without sound") charges the closure image with purposeful resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.1)
    The twilight barge canal is introduced immediately and anchors spatial movement (prow → bank → cottage). Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered: "oil-slick water," "mud that smelled of rotting lilies and iron," "dust" at the cottage. The sundial functions as micro-setting (object-as-setting), constraining Mara's navigation and charging the final image when its shadow points to the mentor's actual resting place. The lock keeper's cottage supplies the resolution resource (journals beneath floorboards). However, the canal itself remains largely atmospheric; it does not constrain a mid-story choice. The final sentence shifts to "dawn cracked the sky," but the canal "faded behind her" without further spatial consequence, limiting environment's role in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.1)
    The golden dock under snow and the fog-wrapped harbor create vivid, consistent atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and mood-driven: "snow that fell without sound," "distant groan of ice forming." The fulgurite glass constrains the decoding method and charges the closure image when it "flared, casting amber light." Spatial choreography is clear. However, the setting does not materially alter Elias's choices or impose friction; it functions as backdrop rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    The shadowed autumn garden is established early with vivid, purpose-driven detail (bleeding ochres, skeletal arbor, pomegranate leaves) filtered through Elian's elegiac lens. The purple thread functions as micro-setting, constraining his ritual and charging the closure when it becomes a bracelet. Spatial choreography is clean (bench, arbor, boxwood hedges), and the salt-rot harbor smell reweights the garden's isolation. The setting shapes the elegiac tone and the final departure, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    The suspended palace, stalactites, and mechanical world below are vividly rendered and consistently maintained. The incubator assembly and the egg's shell details ground key beats in concrete sensory specifics. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint meaningfully alters Elian's choices or the outcome—he assembles the chamber without friction from the world's physics or resources. The cave ceiling's sunlight in the final line charges the image but arrives as embellishment rather than causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.4)
    The obsidian lagoon, black volcanic sand, and kelp-drift environment are rendered with sensory specificity and recur across beats. The lagoon's mineral salts enable the graft attempt, meeting the micro-setting-as-constraint test. However, spatial choreography remains vague (where exactly is she in the water? how deep? how does she surface after twenty minutes submerged?). The "migration of clouds" timeframe supplies atmosphere but does not tighten or constrain her actions, remaining decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting details are vivid and purposeful: dry basins, mica breadcrumbs, rust-filled pipes, and the sixty-year timeline anchor the world concretely. The stained glass box and its stellar alignment constrain Elara's tactics, charging the final moment when the box opens. The city of forgotten fountains operates as both locale and thematic pressure, and the geese overhead provide a time-sensitive frame. Spatial choreography is clean (plaza, fountain rim, statue base). The micro-setting (box on fountain rim, stellar alignment) shapes the climactic choice, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.1)
    The nebula garden supplies vivid, purpose-driven sensory detail—hydrogen petals, gaseous blooms, radiation wound, bioluminescent dust—that shapes Elara's transit and charges the final image. The calculating machine gear and the cavity left by the prior fire-starter function as micro-setting constraints that guide her realization and the closure act. Spatial choreography is clear; the garden's substrata and invisible machinery are legible enough to support the ending's mechanical engagement without requiring deeper occupational exposition at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    The greenhouse functions as more than backdrop: humid air, glass dome, orchids, and ferns constrain Elias's breath-matching ritual and create a spatial crucible for spectral encounter. The woven ribbon becomes a tactile micro-setting element, handled across multiple beats, and the final act of cutting and tying it to stones transforms it from measurement tool to connective web. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"trapped moonlight," "glass creak," "butterflies pulsed against the glass"—and filtered through Elias's meditative focus. The dusk timeframe and migration season layer atmosphere without becoming ornamental. One minor friction: the limestone slab and other carving tools remain generically present rather than handled with occupational specificity that would further charge the work.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    The obsidian ridge and tidal pressure are vivid and specific, repeatedly shaping Elias's tactics: the three-hour window, the millimeter foundation shifts, the roar below as he works. The pendulum bob is handled across multiple beats and the "impossible moment of stillness" becomes the operative constraint for his adjustment. The setting charges the final image—dawn over the ridge as he descends—transforming the black volcanic glass from a barrier into a witness. Minor issue: some descriptions lean decorative ("searing reverie of memory burned behind his eyes") without adding spatial constraint, but overall the environment drives choice.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cobalt silo, rusted ladder, bullet holes, and milking stool provide vivid, specific anchors. The silo's midnight-blue paint "swallowed starlight" and the tapestry's frayed selvage constrain Mara's method of discovery. The setting charges the final image—"velveteen gloom preserved secrets"—and the cemetery's acoustic design becomes integral to closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's priorities (knowing thorns by name, mathematical flower arrangement). Minor: the farmland/graveyard boundary and the silo's interior scale could be more spatially precise.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.4)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (black glass reflecting nothing, ice cracking like thunder). The kingfisher quill appears three times and is handled on the page, shaping the writing act. However, these elements remain largely atmospheric; the spire's location or the lake's frozen state do not constrain a key choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. The quill's symbolic weight (diving through ice) is told rather than enacted in Elara's approach to the writing itself.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ember alcove, mist, shortwave radio, and dust are rendered with vivid, specific sensory detail and constrain Elias's nightly ritual. The alcove functions as micro-setting, anchoring his work and the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout, and the environment charges the closure tableau even though the cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.7)
    The vanishing point gallery functions as a charged setting: its perspective lines and white walls accept the ash, and the architecture enforces "brutal logic" that draws the eye toward absence. The rocking chair, porcelain mask, and charcoal ash are handled across multiple beats and constrain Elias's ritual actions. Sensory detail is selective—"black and irreducible," "warm against his skin"—and filtered through the protagonist's grief-laden focus. The gallery's spatial logic (converging walls, perspective lines) directly shapes the scattering spiral and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    The sunken financial district as ribcage, rust-tasted water, salt-stiff sleeves, and the submerged marble bench create a textured, constraint-laden micro-environment. The rising tide in the final beat directly tests Elias's trust in his work, charging the closure image when he refuses to move his papers. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: standing water wakes rats, the cog "sings," the damp dark frames his sketching. Setting shapes both the dominant stake (preservation in a hostile environment) and the ending's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.9)
    The velvet library, autumn light, mahogany table, and zither are vividly anchored and recur throughout. The rosette's carved petals and soundhole serve as a focal object that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (students lean, fingers are positioned, sound hangs in the air), and the setting subtly pressures the intimate, enclosed teaching moment, qualifying as effective micro-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rusted greenhouse is vividly rendered early (corrugated iron, orange decay, shattered glass) and the eclipse light briefly charges the setting ("amber light that made the rust glow"). Yet the environment does not constrain a single choice; Mara's planting proceeds without spatial friction or resource scarcity. The contaminated soil and dead tomatoes are atmospheric rather than tactical obstacles. Micro-setting (body, tool) is absent; no physical detail alters her approach or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lightning collection tower is vividly realized with sensory specificity (amber resin, ozone, burnt honey, clover and copper). "Nectar dusk" operates as both temporal marker and tonal filter, bathing the spire in liquid gold. The lacquer box and mechanical bee function as charged micro-setting objects that constrain the final reveal. Spatial choreography (spiral stairs, observation deck, apex, ionization chamber) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bay setting provides concrete sensory anchors (copper light, seawall, driftwood fence posts, lilacs "too thickly for April") filtered through Maya's professional attention. The orris root shard functions as micro-setting: it grows warm, resonates with the structure's bones, and bridges "organic and mineral," constraining Maya's method and charging the final gesture. The displaced objects (spoon in garden, boot on roof) serve as environmental pressure that guides her investigation. Spatial choreography is clean (seawall → blue cottage → foundation), and the streetlights' daydreaming cycle modulates atmosphere across the sequence, settling into steady glow at the moment of recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    The hydrothermal vent, calcified fingers, hairline fissure, and foxglove ampoule all constrain the threading method and charge the closure image (dome breathes, bioluminescent chains, purple haze). Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered (water tastes of iron and old light, coral screaming/singing). The fissure as structural weakness serves as both setting constraint and thematic anchor, elevating setting's role beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.6)
    The staircase is vividly particular: "marble that never warmed, never weathered," amber light "neither dawn nor dusk," and the recurring brass handle anchor spatial and sensory detail in service of pressure. The micro-setting—dice in pocket, charcoal on wall, the grain of the handle—constrains her final choice and charges the closure image. Sensory selection (coolness of metal, hum in teeth, texture of roughness) reflects urgency and filters through Elara's mathematically inflected POV. The staircase's infinite architecture shapes her psychological trap and the rupture that frees her.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.9)
    The rooftop greenhouse, smog, fogged glass, lemon trees, orchids, and condensation are vivid and sensory. The environment shapes Maya's seclusion and the visual logic of glowing glyphs suspended in humid air. Spatial choreography remains clear; the waxing moon's climb and the shift from dark to dawn anchor time and light. Micro-setting (the brush, the canvas, the glass walls) charges the final image of luminescent words. One small slip: "MethodicALLY hopeful" recurs as an adjectival phrase without physical grounding in gesture or posture.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.1)
    The grotto setting is vivid and atmospheric—dampness, stalactites, phosphorescent moss—and the emerald opera glass lens functions as a micro-setting that charges two beats (examining tapestries, magnifying manuscripts). The glacial dam threat and perpetual mist create ambient pressure, though they don't visibly constrain Elara's final choice. Spatial choreography is clean throughout: atrium, calcite stairwells, communal kitchens, sapphire gallery.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse, hunger stone, and tidal cycle are vivid and purposeful. The hunger stone constrains Elara's sequence (grooves match the yoyo axle) and charges the final image (rewritten inscription). Sensory detail is selective—kelp, damp sand, moonlight absorption—and reflects urgency. The setting drives the central choice: low tide reveals the stone, enabling the mechanism. Spatial choreography is clear (tower, exposed kelp bed, central shaft). The micro-setting (stone + lighthouse shaft) qualifies for the 9+ gate, lifting the score into the mid-7s despite some atmospheric repetition ("slow exhale" appears twice without evolving meaning).

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.1)
    The funhouse setting (warped mirrors, hall of distorted reflections, glass) recurs across beats and supplies the spatial container for the confession and clasp-to-mirror action at closure. The opera cloak clasp shifts temperature (cold → hot) and the serpents "writhe," functioning as body-proximate micro-setting that charges the final gesture. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("sickly sweet smell of cotton candy rotting in rain"), filtered through gothic-horror idiom consistent with the POV. The environment constrains the final choice (pressing clasp to mirror) and the spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    The driftwood orchard is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: "apple trees rooted in floating logs," "concentric circles," "Each trunk held a different pitch." The setting constrains action (she moves through trees, climbs the highest log) and the final image of the orchard drifting toward new clouds charges closure. Sensory selection is POV-filtered—she catalogs pitch, reads bruised cumulus—though spatial choreography occasionally floats (her exact position shifts without clear transition). The micro-setting (body, mallet, trees as marimba) functions as environment and qualifies for the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    The calcified turtle-shell city, spiral architecture, and "sunwashed dread" anchor the world vividly and filter through Elara's cartographer's eye (nautilus grooves, reed whistle, shell-peak). The turtles' movement provides the story's physical climax and constrains the city's fate, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that environment charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is strong (salt, rust, heat-waves as geometry), though spatial choreography of the watchers' distance and the city's layout could be more precisely tracked across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.1)
    The disused railway station is vividly rendered with specificity (ivy on Victorian arches, moss-covered platform, rusted signal box, wren nesting in the departure board). The rosebush and ivy constrain the temporal frame and charge the final image through purposeful parallelism (Ashford planted the bush; nature reclaims as marker of transferred obligation). Spatial choreography is clear across Elena's movements. The setting does not alter a mid-scene tactic but supplies the symbolic architecture that makes the closure resonate, meeting the micro-setting allowance for accumulative/textural designs.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    The submerged pavilion is vividly rendered with specific tactile and visual detail (barnacles, seaweed, corroded door, moonlight through skylights). Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The setting constrains Elara's movement (wading, straining against hinges) and charges the final image (harbor floor, raised drawbridge). Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional focus, and the environment subtly mirrors her thematic concern with permanence and decay.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sunken library setting is vivid and consistent: filtered green light, phosphorescent algae, water pressure shifts, tilted floors. The antique ink stamp functions as a micro-object that constrains the investigation and charges the final image when Elias stamps his notebook. The blackout timeframe removes electric hum and creates "reclaimed stillness" that enables concentration, directly affecting the investigation's success. Sensory detail (bioluminescent gloom, settling pages) is selective and filtered through the indexer's professional priorities.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating-island tea garden, glass basilica, and gem-polishing wheel provide vivid spatial anchors and constrain the protagonist's final work to this suspended, enchanted locale. The upward-drifting petals and translucent floor charge the atmosphere, and the workshop-to-garden movement is choreographed cleanly. The gems and wheel are handled in multiple beats (polishing, unfolding, crane-folding), meeting the micro-setting/tool test. However, the setting does not force a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Mira's process unfolds without environmental friction or shortage—so the garden functions primarily as lyric backdrop rather than constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.4)
    The floating observatory, viewport curvature, emergency lighting, and cooling breakers supply spatial grounding and a ticking-clock constraint. The geode is handled multiple times and used as a filtering tool at the console. However, the setting does not pressure a key choice—Amara's plan proceeds without environmental resistance—and the final image (maintenance shaft, geode in fist) does not charge prior material through spatial detail.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ancient observatory with its "limestone arches," "massive bronze astrolabe fused with fiber-optic cables," and desert setting is vivid and purposeful. The environment constrains Elias's approach—he must align celestial coordinates before the inner sanctum yields—and the aperture mechanism gates the climax. Sensory detail is selective ("grinding like distant thunder," "warm luminescence…from the living stone"), though some phrases trend ornamental. The recurring "brilliant dimness" charges the final image, and the observatory's hybrid ancient/modern nature directly enables the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt terrace at dusk is vividly rendered with "dying light in shades of deepening blue" and "churning sea," and the setting charges the final image when Elias arranges the gallery "across the cobalt slate" as stars emerge. The driftwood carvings function as micro-setting objects that constrain his search and enable the closure choice. Spatial choreography is clean throughout: kneeling, moving through piles, sitting on cold stone. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elias's guilt-driven attention.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.1)
    The parapet, mist, and drawer pull create a coherent micro-setting that charges the final image: wet stone "polished smooth as bone" and the negotiator alone counting heartbeats tie environment to her endurance. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric (wind, mist, clink of shackles), filtered through her watchful stance. However, spatial choreography during the exchange remains vague—delegates arrive "simultaneously," but their positions and movements lack tactical specificity. The setting pressures choice primarily through atmosphere and symbolic weight rather than concrete constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: sodium light on brass, damp sand, salt spray, rocky outcroppings, shale strip. The utility poles function as micro-setting, constraining navigation choice and charging the final image ("the honest, humming infrastructure of regret and redemption"). The astronomical compass—a recurring object—reweights meaning across beats (talisman at launch, needle spinning under power lines, final renunciation on the rock). Spatial choreography is clean (parking lot → launch → breakers → cove). The coastal specificity and the interplay of celestial vs. terrestrial anchors elevate atmosphere, though the cove's physical details remain generic.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bioluminescent lake constrains the final beat (baseball dissolves in "specific waters"), and the underground setting supplies vivid, purpose-driven detail: limestone corridors, copper-tasting condensation, fungal shore, blue-green bacteria. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the three-day journey compresses without incident markers that would ground the passage of time. The hospital recovery room and tunnels remain functional backdrops; the lake itself does the heavy lifting at closure, charging the ending image with light and rhythm that "whispered names she had forgotten."

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.1)
    The silver apple orchard, bioluminescent sap, and perpetual twilight are vivid and consistent. The orchard's eternal stasis directly mirrors and charges the final image of Elara becoming a "permanent fixture." Spatial choreography is clear (trees lean inward, spice mist rises, Mara coalesces), and the setting constrains the protagonist's transformation into a bridge. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's attention, meeting the Q3 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.6)
    The midnight glade above clouds is vividly anchored with sensory specifics: thin air, silver moss, fractured starlight, clouds with "choking beauty" that press against her throat. The floating island and cloudbound repentance concept provide atmosphere and constrain the ritual. The cracked saucer functions as micro-setting/tool, handled twice (blood drawn, then left filled with dew). The glade charges the final image (dew-filled saucer mirroring stars) and the oppressive clouds embody the thematic weight. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the single-location ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.1)
    The recycled hull, memory vault, photographs, and Kwan Yin's tear all constrain the action and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is strong: cold breath, weak starlight, shimmer of salt crystals, bioluminescent glow. The spaceship's artificial gravity responding to emotional density is a purposeful rule that enables the climax. Spatial choreography (floating toward vault, rising toward apex, membrane at the scar) remains legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    The black sand beach and volcano supply vivid, filtered detail: "obsidian sand," "sulfur fields that stained his boots yellow," "granules shift like microscopic gears." The setting does constrain one micro-choice—the collapsed mule forces the trek through sulfur fields—and the volcanic tremors create infrasound that charges the final image. However, spatial choreography remains static after the opening; Elias kneels, places jars, then lies down without environmental friction altering his tactics. The beach functions more as backdrop than active pressure once he arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.1)
    The luminous fort, blackout, and twilight setting supply concrete atmosphere and constrain Elara's movements (darkness as "curtain and accomplice," positioning by invisible shadow-line). Sensory detail is selective and integrated into action: cold wall, warm patina, arrow-slit twilight, flagstone clicks. The sundial's coded geometry and the emergency lantern's flare charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion. Minor slips: spatial choreography of courtyard-to-arcade is clean but the fort's larger layout remains vague, and "bruised purples" edges toward stock color metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frictionless world, eel-slime traction, and tidal bluff under aurora are vivid and purposeful. The mathematical rock arrangement constrains the protagonist's final choice by creating a friction-field that enables the transformation. The micro-setting (the six-foot radius around the star dust) charges the closure image directly. Spatial choreography is clear: rocks spiral across the bluff's edge, the sled halts on command, dust rises within the field.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    The observatory above clouds, the glass dome, the storm's violet phosphorescence, and the darkroom timer all constrain and charge the scene. The negative held against lightning-struck glass is a strong micro-setting beat that reweights the father's image. Spatial choreography (glass, desk, floorboard, envelope) remains clear throughout, and the storm modulates pressure without becoming postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.2)
    The glass atrium, Victorian ironwork, and brook are vivid and anchored early. The sundial's half-painted face provides a concrete visual puzzle. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—the duel and the decoding could occur in any room with a sundial. Micro-setting strength (the needle card, the bronze face) remains decorative until the alignment beat, which describes rather than pressures. The final departure leaves the atrium behind without recharging its imagery at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    The rusted library under stars, prison yard sorting tables, and east wing soil provide concrete spatial anchors that guide movement and ground the resistance work. Sensory details—moonlight illuminating damaged books, waterlogged paperbacks, embossed rose on the tin—are selective and purposeful. The coffee tin's false bottom and the "luminous fracture" roof create micro-setting pressure, though neither materially constrains a choice at closure; the setting charges atmosphere more than it alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal arbor, station piano with copper coils, cloud-ocean, and atmospheric rivers create a cohesive speculative setting. The piano's modified strings constrain Elena's method (only the correct frequency can stabilize the compasses), and the arbor's drift and tether cables supply persistent physical pressure. The broken anniversary clock, film projector, and metronome are tactile objects handled across multiple beats. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("cloud-mist," "bruised purple," "silver light"). The final image—station suspended "by mathematics and mourning turned melodic"—charges the setting with thematic resonance. No major spatial or chronology breaks detected.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    The ancient ridge, chromatic moss, and knowledge fruit tree supply vivid sensory anchors and the geology-as-memory conceit is specific to this world. The irises' psychoactive pollen constrains Elara's method (she must dream), and the approaching monsoon creates spatial pressure on root depth. However, the ridge itself remains a passive stage for most beats; Elara doesn't navigate terrain challenges or use geological features tactically except as a receptacle for the seed. The bioluminescent roots and mineral veins are described but don't alter her tactics after planting.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    The breezy islet setting supplies vivid sensory detail (salt air, ozone, volcanic rock, rainwater-held needles) that reflects Mara's craft and emotional state. The workshop and eastern cliff are spatially coherent, and the junipers function as both environment and recurring objects that constrain her choices about control versus release. The lace pattern and compass charge the final image by becoming tools she'll continue using. However, the setting mostly frames action rather than forcing tactical choices—Mara could reach the same insights in most coastal workshop environments. The micro-setting (bonsai as object-setting) does constrain the pruning choice, which elevates this above pure description.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.6)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse functions as an indispensable micro-setting that constrains choice (her observations are dictated by its decay) and decisively charges the final image as her "new observatory." Sensory detail is exquisitely selective and POV-filtered (e.g., dust "mapping stress fractures invisible to the casual eye"). Spatial choreography is coherent and evolves with her attention.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.4)
    Setting is indispensable: the canyon’s frost patterns reveal wagon ruts, actively guiding Mara’s choice and leading to the cave. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“frost that silvered the canyon’s sandstone walls”). The environment constrains tactics and charges the final image (“its silence now part of her voice”).

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.5)
    Winterglass conservatory and tuning fork case function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details are selective, purposeful, and integrated into action, amplifying thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting filters through Marian's professional bias; the broken lens as micro-setting constrains her choice and charges the final image, with vivid sensory details like "liquid stone" and "phosphorescent heart" integrated into action.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vividly specific (terra-cotta arbor, scrub pines, starlight) and constrains choice (stealthy navigation, bell as compass). The bell and arbor charge the final image, meeting the 9+ test. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Maya's urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Setting is vivid and active—the viaduct breathes, wisteria glows, and mist creates foggy lucidity. The environment constrains choice (breathing rhythm) and charges the final image (golden threads in granite). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.2)
    Setting is vividly specific and constrains choice—the living bridge garden and halo fragment actively pressure Elias's transformation; sensory detail is selective and purposeful, charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    The abandoned carnival setting is vividly sensory and constrains choice (the chain, piano) while charging the final image with post-wall sunlight, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vividly specific and charges the final image—greenhouse as library of silences, shipwrecks as broken trust. The forge and aurora constrain action and meaning, fully integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting is exquisitely rendered and deeply functional. Emerald Station is atmospheric, with details like "emerald tiles that glowed now with the last of the daylight" serving a dual purpose of tone and time-marking. The environment and key objects (the jar of moonbeams, the flower arrangements) directly constrain choice and charge the final image. The jar's silver light actively "fights" with the portrait's painted gold and "leans toward the painting" in the ending, making the setting an active participant in the thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse is vivid and integral: cracked glass, rusted frames, water stains “like dark equations,” and the dust patterns mapping stress fractures and flood path. Setting is fully filtered through Elena’s astrophysicist gaze, which sharpens both atmosphere and theme. The greenhouse and dust clearly charge the final image of a “new observatory” in slow decay, satisfying the object-as-setting gate at a high level.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    The canyon, frost, wagon ruts, and cave are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action—frost literally reveals the routes, the canyon’s quiet enables reflection, and the cave’s preservation makes the journals possible. Details like “red rock that looked like frozen flame” and “frost that silvered the canyon’s sandstone walls” are specific and character-filtered through a glass artist’s eye. The environment constrains and enables her choices (she has to walk, read terrain, discover the cave) and charges the final image of driving away with the canyon’s silence now part of her voice. This is setting doing real narrative work, not postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    The winterglass conservatory and the tuning-fork apparatus are vividly and economically rendered, with color, temperature, and texture doing double duty as emotional and world-building cues. The environment isn’t postcard background: the winterglass walls amplify projections, the cold constrains her breath, and the final reflection on the glass literally and thematically charges the last image. World rules (deep frost, winterglass, heat-mapping tech) feel internally consistent and are learned through her use of them. A slight sense of aesthetic saturation—everything is exquisite—keeps it just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is rich, strange, and purposeful: the impossible receding tide, the wound-like ocean trench, and the marble-columned underwater library all feel both concrete and uncanny. Details like “books floated like schools of silver fish” and “steps that corkscrewed through liquid stone” aren’t ornamental; they embody the rules of this reality and charge the final image of a reconfigured, settled library. Environment and key objects (lens, columns, stacks) directly shape what Marian can do and what resolution looks like. The world-building is economical yet immersive, with the setting inseparable from premise and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and economical: terra-cotta arbor, scrub pines, needle-strewn paths, cottage threshold, and the sealed valley under sanctions all feel grounded and coherent. Environmental detail is well-filtered through Maya’s goals (moving without flashlight, listening to Tiber’s breathing, using the arbor as a compass point). The silver bell and arbor function as micro-setting that charges the final image and organizes action, though the physical dangers of the terrain and patrols could press more directly on her choices. Overall, atmosphere and place strongly support mood and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    The viaduct setting is richly and precisely rendered (wisteria, gorge, mist, breathing masonry) and more than decorative: the bridge literally stores love in its mortar and circulatory stone, and its “breath” constrains how Maya enacts the ritual. The twilight, fog, and bloom conditions support the “foggy lucidity” tone and charge both the opening and closing images. Environmental details evolve with the action (crystal dispersing through cracks, light in petals, gorge filling with “invisible gold”), directly shaping the final revaluation. The only small drawback is that the world’s magical logic is more poetic than rule-bound, but it remains internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    The living bridge garden is vividly particular—ivy-choked railings, hornbeam arches, cambium layers, mycorrhizal networks—and fully filters through Elias’s professional and temporal obsessions. The environment doesn’t just decorate; its hyperbolic geometry and sentient plant structures actively shape what’s possible, culminating in his atoms distributing along the hyperbolic plane. The recurring objects (bridges, halo fragment, photographs) charge the final image, and the world rules around grown architecture and rhizomatic intelligence stay consistent. A slight excess of abstract phrasing keeps this just short of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned carnival prize center is vividly rendered (stuffed animals, glass cases, booths, water-damaged piano) and tightly integrated with plot: it hides the vault, provides the cipher piano, and the chain’s anchor physically constrains her tactic. Environmental detail consistently reflects her role (chain-grooved concrete, prize counter as archive), and the final image of sunlight through the ruined roof charges the contrast between decay and latent growth. This setting feels specific and indispensable rather than generic, though one or two sensory dimensions beyond the visual could deepen immersion even more.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is rich and instrumental: the sunken orchard, ring of shipwrecks, glass dome, and ashen forge all do thematic and functional work, especially the water pressure preserving the greenhouse and the trees acting as “antennae for grief.” Environmental details recur and evolve (shipwrecks groaning in sympathy, forge cooling at the end), clearly charging the final image. Sensory specificity—aurora as sound, rust leaching into soil—feels both grounded and otherworldly, strongly mirroring her internal state. The only mild constraint is that the underwater context doesn’t materially limit her tactics beyond mood and preservation, so some potential pressure from setting remains unrealized.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is richly imagined and tightly integrated: brass fixtures, emerald tiles, flower codes, and moonlit glass roof all filter through Elara’s sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is one of the story’s great strengths: the high-altitude observatory, frost-laced window, radio mast, ice cores, and control panels are rendered with tactile, purposeful detail. Environment actively shapes the situation—the melting glacier, treacherous ice bridges, and crushing silence drive her isolation, her rituals, and her need to leave. The bookmark, glass spheres, and melting ice fields recur as charged objects, culminating in the final image of spheres “like frozen prayers.” The physical world and its weather feel inseparable from the character’s interior and from the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory-library is vivid and functional: rusted railings, skeletal telescopes, and metal stairs shape both atmosphere and tactics. The environment directly constrains choices—Kai weaponizes knowledge of weak points and structural instability rather than brute force. Recurring objects (the cast, the seashell) are tightly tied to place and recharged at the end, particularly in the image of the rusted library under indifferent stars. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Kai’s vertigo and hyper-awareness, avoiding white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vividly and precisely rendered—the flooded pebble courtyard, storm-tossed ridge, chapel, armory, and weather all feel tactile and specific. Details are strongly POV-filtered (silences having “texture, grain, viscosity”) and the environment directly shapes meaning: the fort as vessel for pre-creation silence, the storm as punctuation, the final map as pebbles on the flooded stones. The ridge fort and storm don’t strongly constrain physical options, but they fundamentally charge the conceptual stakes and the ending image. This is near top-tier atmospheric integration.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.3)
    The frozen courtyard, fountain, and ice violin are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with mood and premise, not just decorative. The environment constrains action (static, wintry, timeless space) and explicitly functions as a designed liminal chamber for transformation. Recurring details—arborescent ice, crystalline tiles, water dripping upward—charge the final images and reinforce the piece’s time-dislocated logic. A bit more sensory variety or tactile interaction under stress could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    The concert hall and crystal forecourt are richly evoked with purposeful sensory detail—acoustic memory, dripping glass canopy, quartzite pavers humming—that all reflect Mara’s attunement to sound and silence. Setting and atmosphere clearly support the themes of resonance, secrecy, and transparency, and the forecourt provides a distinct emotional arena for the confrontation. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices, it does shape tone and the manner of their exchange (quiet, reflective, almost sacred). The specificity and integration are strong, even if the setting is more thematic mirror than tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.7)
    The garden maze is vivid and conceptually integrated, from “statistical curves hung like visible mist” to ivy in dual states and the dry fountain of calcified promises. The environment isn’t just backdrop; it embodies memory, judges Elara, and literally reacts to her choices, especially in the maze-wide exhalation. World rules about luck and probability are sketched with efficient, evocative strokes that feel internally consistent. A touch more tactile, non-metaphoric grounding could push this to the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    The xenobiology station, frozen dome, tundra twilight, and roosting Vesper Drakes are rendered with vivid, selective detail that shapes tone and plausibility. Environmental and technological specifics (magnetic nexus, ore deposits, particle accelerator, thermal regulator, vents) are integrated into action rather than feeling like a tour. The final image of mechanically warm air against the icy exterior nicely charges the thematic contrast between cold time and human striving. Setting could exert more direct constraint on choice, but it already does meaningful conceptual work.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly imagined and tightly integrated: the flooded pit, black reflective water, ruined velvet, and flickering lanterns all shape the mood and the mechanics of the haunting. Environment isn’t just backdrop—the water becomes a resonating chamber, the lantern angles are instrumental to revealing images, and the receding flood is the concrete sign of resolution. Details are filtered through a musician’s gaze, giving a strong sensory and professional bias. This is one of the piece’s most publication-ready strengths.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mountain weather station is vividly rendered through selective, purposeful detail—the triple-glazed window, anemometer, satellite uplink, steel struts, frost, and aurora—filtered through Elara’s professional gaze. Environment and object-as-setting (the logbooks, illustration, and glass) strongly charge the atmosphere and final image, even if they rarely function as hard physical constraints. The weather and altitude subtly mirror the thematic arc of warming and glacial retreat without feeling like blunt allegory. This is high-level atmospheric work; a single more explicit instance of environment constraining a concrete choice would push it into the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: the abandoned tunnel, ballast, iron ribs “like the spine of some buried leviathan,” humidity from the lake, and corroded piping all feel tactile and lived-in. Crucially, the beaded valve wheel and the tunnel environment are not backdrop; they charge the final image and embody the story’s moral calculus (industrial infrastructure fused with memorial ritual). Mara’s movement through space is clear and purposeful, and environmental details (radio range, drafts, darkness) track with her actions. The industrial-ruin atmosphere perfectly matches the piece’s thematic concerns.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is the piece’s great strength: the overgrown catacomb library, the roots, the black glass refuge, and the river operating on “geological time” all feel vivid and lived-in. Environmental details are tightly integrated with theme and action—vines, roots, and silt don’t just decorate; they embody decomposition and transformation. The obsidian refuge and river meaningfully charge the final image by shaping how she experiences and carries the “regenerative silence.” The only thing holding this below 9 is that the setting rarely constrains specific tactical choices; it’s thematically shaping more than logistically pressuring.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sage Ridge, the silver-green sage, exposed roots, temperature drop, and eclipse light are vivid and consistently filtered through Elara’s attentiveness. The environment materially shapes the moment (privacy from valley crowds, partial darkness as safety, roots as ongoing motif) and the final image (hair curl catching returning sunlight) is charged by place and light. The “dreaming roots” function as a micro-setting concept that inflects the stakes of growth and healing. A few worldbuilding phrases tilt a bit abstract, but atmosphere and specificity remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    The reclaimed missile silo—its concrete curves, “bronze quiet,” and history as a Cold War site—feels vivid, specific, and thematically welded to the premise of walls as memory repositories. Environmental details aren’t postcard-like; they actively matter (she presses her palm to the concrete to access stored stories, the decommissioning memory shapes the emotional middle). The fireplace, sub-levels, and archival case are all used in tactile, functional ways rather than mere scenery. The final image of the silo “holding its breath” as she reads gives the setting direct closing charge, making it a co-protagonist rather than a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse on a rocky Atlantic island is vivid and functional, from the rotating beam used to read codes to the crashed waves underscoring isolation. Setting actively constrains choices: ferries stop, the pub closes, clandestine activity must happen “after last orders.” The beam and gallery “watching from above” charge the final image of departure, tying environment directly into closure. Details stay selective and atmospheric without slipping into generic seascape cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sanctuary as dimensional anchor, the vibrating stonework, the loop pedal, and the gray pigment are all concrete, specific, and deeply integrated into the conflict. Setting directly shapes tactics—acoustics, stone walls, and the anchor’s location matter to what Elian does and how the entity manifests. The palette and anchor reprise in the final image, charging the thematic turn with physical detail. A slightly broader sensory range (beyond sight and sound) could push this even higher, but what’s here is already strong and purpose-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, and mirrored horizon are richly realized and tightly woven into Elias’s perceptions (cold through glass, ice creaks resonating in his body, condensation as staff lines). Setting is not just backdrop: the acoustics of the spire, the ice’s movements, and the reflective horizon all charge the central metaphors of doubled time and submerged music. The environment directly shapes the final image—the ice “singing,” the reflection shattering into prismatic light as visible chords, and him conducting the dawn within this charged space. It stops just short of physically constraining his options, but thematically and imagistically it’s core.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Roman viaduct with bioluminescent algae, post-storm atmosphere, and the “darkening brightness” sky are vividly rendered with strong visual specificity. Setting is not merely postcard texture: the glowing moss guides her steps, the procedural arches and columns materialize under her, and the spiral staircase “through the viaduct’s structure” physically stages her descent/integration. The liminal “between drop and ripple” time-concept layers onto this environment to reinforce theme rather than feeling bolted on. At times, descriptive density approaches excess, but spatial and atmospheric coherence remain strong and the setting clearly charges the final image of the viaduct fading.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.0)
    The drum maker’s cavern is vivid and integral: limestone walls, muted acoustics, hides, and the workshop’s sound-swallowing tapestries all shape what is possible. The environment doesn’t just decorate; it enables the tactile listening and charges the final realization that “silence had texture.” Objects-as-setting (drum skin, phonograph, needle) are used in a lived, tactile way that mirrors her new mode of perception. The physical space and its rules are inseparable from the story’s premise and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    The courtyard, jasmine vines, dry fountain, copper antennas, and atmospheric walls of the quarantine form a vivid, coherent environment filtered through Elara’s barometric sensibility. Weather is not mere backdrop: storm behavior, invisible pressure systems, and the final unregulated rain directly charge the thematic and narrative stakes. The quarantine’s “atmospheric walls” and the courtyard as a surveillance gap constrain what she can do and why solitude matters here. This setting work is both specific and integral to the story’s logic and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Charnwood greenhouse, extinct flora, ultraviolet lantern, and “crystal shadows” are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with emotion and theme. The environment directly enables the discovery (UV on fossils), the impossible bloom, and the final image of sitting among revived extinct plants. Details consistently feel filtered through Elias’s professional and emotional lenses, especially around scent and light. The setting strongly charges the final image, though it stops just shy of functioning as an overt physical constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    The terra-cotta grotto, the baked clay, sediment layers, and the luminous energy beings are richly specific and tightly integrated with the premise of altered causality. Setting is not postcard-like; the grotto’s temporal architecture and material (clay, fossils, strata) directly shape the options and reveal the “drafts” of reality, while the final image of rope and shards grounds the abstract theme. The environment constrains choice (backward vs forward chambers) and charges the last moment where he “touches time’s true surface.” This is high-level atmospheric and functional worldbuilding with minimal excess.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the sunken greenhouse, twisted apple trees, and shipwreck “cathedral of decay” are not postcard backdrops but acoustical instruments whose glass, hulls, and condensation shape the ritual. Environmental specifics—the bowl catching droplets from hulls, the flames lighting barnacles, the shipwrecks humming—directly participate in the climax and final image. World rules stay consistent in their surreal logic, and the atmosphere of drowned, post-burn Earth strongly supports the theme of beauty in ruin. It falls just short of 9+ only because physical constraints never visibly corner Mara’s choices; the world is active but not quite coercive.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    The amber grotto is richly realized and integral: resinous walls, static electricity, and dusk light are not just decoration but directly cause the emotional alchemy that turns counterfeit into real. Details like vials in limestone depressions and fossil-gold eyes feel specific and filtered through Kael’s sensory priorities. The environment constrains and enables the outcome—the grotto’s conductive resin completes what the chemistry cannot, and the final image of the client choosing to remain there is charged by place. This integration of setting with mechanism and theme is a standout strength.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cliffside library under a glass dome, salt air, and star-laced stacks are vividly realized and filtered through Elias’s sensibility as a broker-turned-patron. Specifics like the night librarian repairing spines, the retired deckhand alphabetizing by starlight, and the widow’s logbooks give the space social and emotional texture, not just postcard prettiness. The environment reinforces theme (knowledge as navigation, stars and sea, silent labor) more than it materially constrains choices, so it’s supportive rather than determinative of action. Still, the setting’s distinctiveness and integration with the final images (Andromeda over poetry stacks, the glowing display case) are a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    The world is intensely specific and sensorial—“crystalline orchard,” “shimmering crater,” “obsidian arbor” all feel original and integrated with the emotional stakes. The crater and its gap directly constrain choices and charge the final image of the reed bridge; the toxic depths also justify the mute artist’s isolation. Details are filtered through the story’s lyric perspective, keeping tone and imagery coherent rather than touristic. Occasionally the density of description edges toward decorative, but it rarely confuses spatial or emotional orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is strikingly specific and consistently exploited: rooftop canals between fossil-vertebrae towers, water flowing upward during a nap-window, and a sleeping colossus whose body literally governs physics. Environmental rules (gravity loosening, canals draining, resonance chamber at the highest spire) directly constrain her tactics and shape the final images. Details like vertical standing waves and silver waterfalls evolve with the plot rather than sitting as backdrop. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that the emotional experience of the body-in-place is slightly secondary to the spectacle of the world-building itself.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    The cavern orchard is vividly realized and tightly integrated: stalactite water, mineral light, and the mosaic stepping stone all condition what Elian can do and how. The environment directly shapes the method (drips, fractures, mineral gleam) and the stakes of his ritual, and the final cadence (“water finding its path through stone”) powerfully recharges that setting. Details are selective yet lush, consistently filtered through Elian’s preoccupations with pattern and preservation. The worldbuilding feels both singular and thematically charged without slipping into exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    The library’s basement, pipe chases, junction boxes, and “sapphire hush of pre-dawn” are rendered with vivid, selective detail that clearly reflects Maya’s embodied familiarity. Setting and micro-setting (vents, boiler room, carrels) are used purposefully as cache sites that map onto vulnerability. The environment subtly constrains choices—she operates in emptiness and semi-darkness, and her domain is literally the infrastructure—but there’s room to sharpen how physical constraints affect difficulty or risk. The final image of the city’s lights steadying and tapes “humming in the walls” is strongly charged by setting.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is richly integrated: the mossy trellis, storm season, dripping lattice, and linden tree all both mirror and drive Maren’s rethinking of her methods. Environmental conditions aren’t just pretty—they materially challenge her climate-controlled paradigm and suggest alternate strategies (wild vines surviving nor’easters, moss absorbing chaos). The linden leaf and trellis recur to charge the final image and her decision, functioning as micro-settings that constrain her choices in thought and tactic. At times the descriptive density edges toward luxuriant for the story’s calm stakes, but it remains purposeful and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tidal island, causeway, rain trails, and sinkhole are all sharply rendered and deeply integrated into how people live and move; “the water wars” are felt in coastline logic rather than dumped in exposition. Weather, salt, and tide genuinely constrain action (the temporary causeway, the sinkhole that will vanish) and charge the final vigil image. Details like “salt ate her canvases from behind” and “landscape as grammar” are not mere ornament; they articulate rules and worldview. The setting’s specificity and pressure are high enough that the story would fundamentally change in a different environment.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    The musical crystal cave, bioluminescent pearl, and moving shadows are vivid and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensory/intuitive priorities. Setting is not mere backdrop: resonance, light refraction, and the cave’s geometry actively mediate the possession sequence and the pearl’s behavior. The environment clearly charges the final image (dimmed, pulsing pearl; bright darkness), even if it doesn’t sharply constrain tactical choices. World rules around resonance and consciousness feel internally consistent and learned through observation, not exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “ivory harbor after rain” is vivid and particular—wet planks, bone-like stones, driftwood, violet dusk—firmly anchoring place and mood without feeling like a generic seascape. Details are filtered through Kael’s sensibility as an archivist, so objects and weather are read as residues and absences rather than neutral scenery. The harbor environment and the archive tower meaningfully charge the final image: the valve gleaming in candlelight in that reclaimed space is a strong, setting-inflected closure. The main limitation is that the physical environment shapes atmosphere and symbolism more than it constrains concrete choices or tactics in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Cathedral Station environment—the “starlit vault of mist,” glass ceiling, cracks, and sealed Track Seven—is richly realized and tightly bound to Elara’s perception as a mapper. Setting elements actively shape choices: the cracks-as-arrows route her path, the sealed track marks a taboo threshold, and the station’s decay mirrors the city’s buried silences. The phantom infrastructure (train, impossible tunnels, infinite filing cabinets) extends the logic of the physical station into a metaphysical architecture that charges the final image. Description veers lush but remains purposeful and filtered through her professional eye, justifying the high score.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory’s open dome, salt wind, limestone bones, and the whales’ proximity create a vivid, coherent setting that directly shapes the story: acoustics and architecture become the medium of transformation. The tower is not postcard dressing; its physical properties matter to the plan (sound-conducting curves, apex mounting of the tile) and to the final experience. Environmental detail is economical yet atmospheric, with the sea, sky, and stone all tied to action. The setting meaningfully charges the final image of the tower as a “living instrument.”

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prismatic escondite, solar storm, magnetic fields, and crystallized light are vividly rendered and consistently tied to the speculative rules (corridors, mutiny, singularity of departure). Environment and objects (the cathedral, storm, mutiny corridors) meaningfully shape what Kael can attempt and how, and their specificity charges the ending image of a subtly rearranged universe. Occasionally the description skirts the edge of decorative excess, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.5)
    The funeral home prep room is vivid and thematically apt—the refrigeration hum, chemical tanks, and casket storage mesh well with “deathly vitality” and her liminal operation. The ink pot functions as both object and micro-setting, its history and physicality anchoring the speculative element. The environment influences logistics (hiding the father, the window for watching the guard) but rarely constrains her options in a way that sharpens tactical choice. Overall, specificity is strong, if more atmospheric than structurally determinative.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.8)
    The bonsai labyrinth, mountaintop, silent town, fluorescent lamp, and gold-leaf bench form an unusually vivid, consistent environment that’s always filtered through Elias’s work. Setting meaningfully charges the ending: the bonsai maze “leaning closer” and the dawn light refracting through gilded pages dramatize the world watching whether this fragile history will hold. Spatial and atmospheric anchors are clear from early on, and the world rules—post-silence, void pressing like fog—remain stable. The only reason this doesn’t push into the 9s is that the environment constrains mood and symbolism more than it concretely alters his tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    The port’s container labyrinth, salt wind, rust, tides, and fog are rendered with striking specificity and are deeply filtered through the archivist’s sensory-bias, avoiding generic description. Environment and recurring objects (containers, tides, the blue container, the pylons) clearly mirror and charge the internal stakes about being mislabeled and mis-archived. The setting is not just backdrop; it structurally underpins the archive metaphor and the ending image. It stops just short of 9+ because the environment, while deeply charged, rarely constrains a concrete choice or tactic on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    The abandoned observatory, shattered telescopes, glass like “failed stars,” cliff, and fog create a vivid, coherent physical and emotional environment. Setting details are filtered through Elara’s mindset and dovetail with cosmic questions about stories and endings. The seashell and half-finished cello work as charged micro-settings/objects that meaningfully shape the final image. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, it strongly charges tone and theme and frames her last act on the cliff’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    The raft-city carnival is vividly, economically realized: generators, flotation barrels, neon corridors, aerialists over gambling dens, and barnacled graffiti fuse into a lived-in, specific world. Setting actively shapes choices—floating rights, corporate survey drones, and the maze-like geography enable the graffiti network’s stealth and make privatization a distinct threat. The foundation stone chip operates as a micro-setting object that charges the final image and constrains tactics (its texture as cryptographic key). Atmosphere supports theme, marrying spectacle with looming dispossession.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lunar setting is richly specific—Tycho’s summit, regolith, ejecta rays, thermal extremes—and consistently filtered through a working inspector’s eye. Environment constrains choices: vacuum silence, brutal cold, the terminator’s movement, and the impending arrival of crawlers all shape what she can do and when. Objects like the helmet, heating coils, spectrograph, and plaque are integrated into action rather than touristic description. The Earth above the horizon and the changing light strongly charge the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting and atmosphere are outstanding: the mist-coated rail depot, harbor horns, steam, and coastal fog all feel lived-in and filter realistically through Mira’s non-visual senses. The water basin and refracted light function as a micro-setting tool that directly constrains and enables her tactics and charges the final image when the hummingbird rises, stirring the water’s patterns against her skin. Environmental elements like the depot’s iron beams and the horn of the Vespertine are not just decorative—they shape time awareness, mood, and method. This level of integration and textural specificity is publish-ready.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rusted outpost, unmelted snow, frozen lake, and condensation patterns are vivid and specific, all filtered through Marlow’s cartographic sensibility. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the window glass enables his method, the ice and cold shape his tactics, and the outpost/lake axis anchors opening and ending images. Environmental details evolve meaningfully (condensation from fractals to spiral; lake from static to poised for change), charging the final moment. This is rich, controlled atmosphere that supports both plot and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and specific: cobblestones with distinct notes, the groaning archway, moss retreating under her shadow, and mortar flowing upward all feel tactile and integrated. Details are consistently filtered through Elara’s tuning practice and the city’s former life, avoiding tourist-list description. Environment and objects constrain choice: the arch’s keystone is the necessary site of intervention, and the cobblestones are the medium of action. The final image of the newborn arch “holding the wild hush” effectively charges the environment with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    The underwater temple is vivid and tactile—thermocline, bioluminescent algae, coral-encrusted spires, peculiar currents—anchoring space and mood early and consistently. Crucially, the environment isn’t just backdrop: depth, pressure, and the temple’s sealing mechanics directly constrain the exit choice (forced exhalation) and enable the preservation/memory technology, charging both the vial and the final image. Details remain tightly tied to Elara’s professional lens and urgency, avoiding tourist-catalog syndrome. The recurring “gathered hush” and “lonesome splendor” are atmospheric yet also help frame the temple as a living system that responds to vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse prison on a jagged reef is vividly and economically rendered—salt-crusted glass, copperlight, groaning stairs, chapel, cellar, and reef all interlock. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the height, wind, and reef shape the necessity of hovering and the waiting boat’s “impossible calm,” while the chapel and confessional reinforce themes of story, confession, and silence. The world rule that the lighthouse “sustained impossibilities” via stories is integrated into both environment and action. A touch more non-visual sensory work under peak stress could elevate it further, but as-is it strongly constrains and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    The alchemical orchard and endless-night greenhouse are vividly realized and tightly bound to the premise: using her burial soil to feed the trees is the literal mechanism of exploitation and haunting. Environment constrains action (Eira bound to the roots; the bead must be taken from greenhouse to frost-split fields), and the shift from perpetual darkness to starry twilight and real snow charges the final images. Details are selective and thematic—mercury-rich soil, phosphorescent fruit, winter-cracked fields—rather than touristic. World rules (endless night, alchemical soil) stay internally consistent and pay off at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    The red canyon labyrinth, tide pools, and vertical shafts are vividly realized and inextricable from character and action. Setting actively constrains and enables choices: she can only work after the tide pools empty and must navigate via the polished sleepwalking paths. The final image—the canyon shuddering, seams glowing with “orchid solace,” tide pools filling with mist—powerfully reweights all prior environmental detail. This is elite-level atmosphere and specificity, just shy of perfect only because the physical logistics of sewing stone stay a bit impressionistic.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    The catacomb orchard is intensely specific and textured—roots threading bones, calcium feeding apples, myrrh and turned earth—and remains tightly integrated with action rather than becoming static backdrop. The environment constrains her movement (stepping between ribs and skulls, roots swallowing the sundial) and actively shapes the ritual she performs. World rules (bones nourishing trees, timekeepers buried as waypoints) are consistent and legible through image rather than exposition. A small tightening—pruning one or two metaphoric flourishes—could push this toward truly exceptional without any sense of saturation.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    The golden arcade, CRT glow, chalk-covered promenade, and descending drone are all sharply rendered and filtered through Kael’s sensibility, creating a dense, coherent atmosphere. Environment and objects meaningfully constrain tactics (needing CRT glow to see indentations, relying on kids’ chalk remains) and charge the final image (the “cathedral to tactile experience” standing empty, chalk codes eroding). World rules feel internally consistent and economical. This setting does genuine thematic work rather than serving as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt observatory, autumn light, and eternal candle are vivid, integrated, and strongly POV-filtered, with details like “the observatory’s blue walls held sounds like a shell holds ocean” doing multiple jobs. Setting is not mere backdrop: the dome’s isolation enables her secret work, the spiral stairs control access (the captain’s ascent is a beat), and the impending frost tied to the windows functions as a live clock. The eternal candle in particular constrains her method—she uses its steadiness and later its flame to “seal” a possibility—and charges the final image. A minor check is that external environmental pressure (e.g., guards, colder air) stays more atmospheric than tactically constraining in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mangrove labyrinth, singing spirits, moonlight, and condensation are vivid and sensorial, and they directly shape tactics (corridor through roots, safe passage, condensation as language). The shard-as-tool and the body-as-setting (moon-healed wounds) charge the final image and constrain what’s possible. World rules (spirits respond to holy residue; condensation penetrates timeframe) are learned by watching them function, not via exposition dump. A touch of descriptive density edges toward ornamental in places, but the environment remains strongly functional, not postcard-like.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful—the “mist-clad atrium,” jungle pressing against glass, shell-strewn beach, and field hospital details all feel lived rather than touristic. Environmental elements mirror and deepen theme (reef rebuilding after ruin, mist as breathing organism, jungle as witness) without feeling like blunt symbolism. The recurring micro-setting of the cast and coral fragment function as charged objects that frame her choices and heavily color the final image. While the physical environment doesn’t tightly constrain tactics, it does richly charge mood and meaning at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ruined orchard and thick fog are vivid, textured, and integrated with function: fog preserves the fresco and becomes the projection surface, the orchard is both graveyard and studio. Environmental details are consistently filtered through Mara’s artist’s eye and depressive state. World rules around the fungal knowledge network and bioluminescent roots are coherent within the dreamlike frame. The final image of sun touching the painted face leverages setting to charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sound wave garden is vividly realized and deeply integrated: parabolic hedges, stone bowls, chimes, acoustic foam, and buried resonance chambers all affect what she can hear and how she works. Environmental rules (reflected sound creating multiple reverberations) are consistent and enacted on the page, not just explained. The setting directly shapes her tactics—scaffolding for listening, microphones among lavender, painting guided by echoes—and charges the final breath-holding image. This is rich, specific worldbuilding that feels essential rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    The world of thought taxation, surveilled gardens, and the insect-filled greenhouse is richly specific and integrated with action (camera drones over herbs, beetles as encryption keys, glass warping). The setting genuinely constrains and shapes tactics, especially the greenhouse architecture and glass interacting with the seed. The final image of the luna moth bearing coordinates elegantly charges the environment with lingering meaning. Description is dense but mostly purposeful, avoiding tourist-list syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    The gargantuan shell, reef, and undersea cathedral are richly imagined and tightly integrated: the shell amplifies her voice, physically traps her, and later becomes the discovered cathedral. Environmental detail (bioluminescence, flowered coral, “reef-shadow joy”) consistently mirrors and pressures the emotional stakes. The final image of divers entering the floral cathedral and finding only pearl and scented water is powerfully charged by everything the setting has accrued. This is elite-level atmosphere and specificity, just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Opal Library, glass orchids, cloud-mist floors, and “museum of extinct feelings” are vividly and economically rendered, with details filtered through the caretaker’s work-centric perception. Environmental rules (names stored in orchids, light failing, sound-to-light via the tube) are consistent and directly constrain options and tactics. The setting charges the final image: her isolation above the world, touching an orchid that holds a child’s name, would be meaningless without the earlier world-building. It stops short of 9+ mainly because some descriptive density edges toward ornamental rather than always pressure-linked.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    The extinct language archive is vividly and economically rendered (“air tasted of ochre and forgotten grammar”), with details filtered through Elara’s linguistic sensibility. The setting is not a postcard backdrop: it directly enables the ritual (the seven tablets, the wards) and mirror-themes the danger of letting silence metastasize. The glass ink well acts as a micro-setting object tying personal history to this institutional space and charging the final touch. A slight missed opportunity is that the hinted defensive wards never materially constrain her tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the crumbling amphitheater, breathing volcano, sulfur warmth, and condemned sector all feel tactile and lived-in. Environmental features exert pressure—structural warnings, geothermal groans, and the building’s “breathing” frame his risk and the stakes of respecting the volcano’s rhythms. Professional detail (hydraulic network, beeswax seals, leather gaskets) is plausibly rendered and filtered through his occupational eye. The recurring surveyor’s chain and the breathing architecture both charge the final image, though the lavish description flirts with excess at times.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    The vintage bookshop attic, skylight, dust motes, foxed paper, and pigeons create a rich, lived-in micro-world whose details are always filtered through Elara’s needs and obsessions. The setting materially constrains options—she is literally “suspended between floors,” hiding above the shopkeeper and sending the artifact out through the skylight via pigeons instead of any paper trail. The final image of dust settling into a “new constellation” on the floorboards charges the environment with closure weight. This is a near-model of economical, atmospheric, and thematically integrated setting work.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    The drifting prism terrace and abandoned observatory are vividly and economically rendered, with strong, consistent imagery (spectral geometries, seventeen sunsets, crystalline facets). Setting is tightly filtered through Elara’s concerns—wood grain as map, glass panes as distances—and world rules (geothermal suspension, atmospheric collapse) feel internally consistent in a lyric-SF mode. The environment directly charges the final image via the lone doorway into the maze and the multiplying reflections that literalize “necessary distances.” Occasionally the description edges toward luxuriant for the modest on-page pressure, but it remains purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    The underwater research facility is vividly realized and functionally embedded: pressure seals, hydrostatic chambers, observation dome, and bioluminescent organisms all constrain or enable choices. The environment is not a postcard; it drives the problem (threat of crushing pressure, need for internal light) and the solution (external bioluminescence plus breath-activated systems). Details are filtered through Elara’s specialized gaze (“landscape astrologer,” “tectonic astrology”), which keeps description purposeful and thematically charged. The recurring feather operates as a micro-setting object that meaningfully charges the final image, though it is more thematic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    The iridescent cave inside a crystal geode, crater glass, ocean dreams, and migrating bird seeds create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere with strong visual logic and recurring objects. Setting details are consistently filtered through Elara’s work and perception, avoiding white-room syndrome and generating a distinctive mood. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain concrete choices, it does frame the rules (time moving differently, memory as tide, seeds as carriers) and charges the final image of the pulsing cave and aurora-like light. This is one of the story’s strongest aspects, though it could go further in making the setting materially affect tactics rather than primarily tone.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    The tidal arcade is richly realized and integrated: tide, arches, acoustics, jasmine, and starlight all tangibly shape Kael’s methods and the unfolding chain reaction. Environmental rules (sound frequencies triggering jasmine, prism reflection, tidal timing) are consistent and drive the action rather than serving as wallpaper. The final image of the tide erasing footprints but not architecture powerfully charges the theme of wildness and calculation coexisting. This is nearly exemplary scene-setting, only slightly shy of 9+ because the environment doesn’t sharply constrain a late-stage choice.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    The twilight garden, fountain, moonlight residue, and bioluminescent pollen are vividly specific and consistently filtered through Kaelin’s tide-obsessed perception. The garden and its objects (especially the fountain and moonstone dust) charge both the process and the final image, where the environment responds to her transformation and acknowledges her as one of its own. World rules—nostalgia ban, calcified moonlight, memory in dust—are strange but internally consistent. Setting is not just a backdrop but a participating presence in the closure, though it rarely constrains tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: pearl bay, the prism atrium, tide pool, and dawn light are all sharply rendered and consistently filtered through a glazier’s eye. Environmental elements actively charge the story’s logic and final image—the tide’s turn, the atrium’s rainbow blaze, the stilling pond—rather than serving as backdrop. The “crystal lung” atrium and noctilucent dawn create a strong, coherent atmosphere that mirrors and refracts the thematic concerns. This environment is hard to swap out without breaking the piece’s closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ridge, valley, moonlight, and stars are vivid and consistently used as more than décor—the overlook directly ties setting to Maya’s originating trauma, and the changing sky (moon arc, dawn) quietly tracks emotional movement. The porcelain box and marble function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice and charge the final image; the empty box and marble in Elias’s pocket are spatially and thematically precise. Weather and temperature (moonlight, morning chill) register in Maya’s body and mood. The atmosphere of austere, indifferent cosmos versus intimate human pain is well sustained and supports the story’s tone.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tide-polished grotto is vivid, specific, and integrated: its cross-timeline nature, bioluminescent algae, shells, and crystals all directly feed Elara’s tactics. The environment constrains and enables her solutions (using what the grotto offers as mathematical anchors) and then charges the final image with “multiple dawns” in the mirrored stone. World rules—parallel timelines overlaying one physical locus—are consistent and learned through action rather than exposition dumps. This is a major strength of the story, only slightly held back by occasional descriptive abstraction over tactile immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.5)
    The derelict coastal house, ivy-veiled corridor, flooded basement, and exposed stars form a vivid, coherent atmosphere that strongly supports mood and theme. Details like roots cracking marble and the gridless sky after civilization’s collapse make the setting feel specific and inhabited. The environment charges the final image—walls, ivy, stars, and the negative together embody the persistence of witness and the altered climate. While setting doesn’t heavily constrain tactics, it is integral to tone and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is rich, specific, and tightly integrated: “echoing terrace in spring,” “wet tiles,” and especially the “prism parapet after rain” all do real work in refracting light and song into the operative magic. Environmental details (stormwater-glazed glass, twilight, bells) not only build atmosphere but directly shape how Elias operates and how the visions manifest. The final emptiness of the terrace, holding latent possibilities in its glass, charges the last image and makes the location feel indispensable. This is strong enough to approach high-band, though the setting constrains mood and method more than presenting concrete obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    The terrace, failing columns, orchids, and the blood-soaked valley are rendered with high specificity and tied directly to action and theme. Environment and objects constrain choices: the astronomical convergence is a non-repeatable window, and the terrace’s history and visibility make it the necessary ritual ground. The ebony clipboard-as-portable-garden is an elegant micro-setting that literally carries the shared future between houses. The final image of flawed architecture and mixed soil roots the ending in a charged, physical space rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    The salt flat and gathering storm are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s grief and purpose (“a broken mirror under the bruised sky,” “temporary cathedral of salt and bone”). Environment and weather meaningfully constrain his action window (the drought he engineered, the storm that will erase his traces) and heavily charge the final image of the egg returning to darkness. The recurring motifs of salt, cracks, and thunder feel organic rather than decorative and deepen both mood and theme. This is near top-tier atmospheric work with only minor risk of over-ornamentation in places.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is lushly realized—the silver courtyard, muffling snow, prism sanctuary, and temporal threads all feel specific, visual, and sensorially grounded, with the snow affecting sound and concealment. World rules around the sanctuary and the Empire’s memory-erasure are conveyed through action (untangling frozen time, stored memories as light) rather than expository blocks. The environment meaningfully charges the final image via the infinite snowbound courtyards, each with a failed Lys, though it rarely constrains physical tactics beyond the time-filaments and muffling snow. Description is rich but purposeful, maintaining tone and atmosphere without collapsing into pure ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.8)
    The decommissioned radar dome is vivid and thematically loaded: geometric ribs, Cold War relic, meteor hush, and the crack where smoke escapes all do double duty as mood and moral frame. Environmental specifics—Edison bulb, antenna scrap, concrete floor—anchor the abstractions in tactile reality. The dome and its history directly constrain and charge the ending, turning the fire and rising smoke into more than atmosphere. A slight bias toward visual over other senses in the later beats keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    The verdant grotto above a sea of clouds is rendered with vivid, selective detail that’s strongly filtered through Elara’s attentional bias, and weather/altitude (“oxygen grew thin… ferns touched the underside of clouds”) contribute to the liminal, sacred pressure of the scene. Setting is not mere backdrop: the towers are built from local materials, the clouds and wind are imagined as readers/archives of the signal, and the orchids and grotto mouth shape the butterflies’ movement and the timing of Elara’s exit. The final image of the moth wing catching light in this elevated space charges the environment thematically (impermanence vs. attempted inscription). The only ceiling is that the setting constrains mood and concept more than concrete tactical choices under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    The icebound sanctum, aurora, rope, and glacial environment are vividly rendered and deeply integrated into the mechanism of the plot—the aurora literally powers the illumination, the cold preserves the scrap, and the ice walls become the projection surface. Details feel filtered through Elara’s craft-minded gaze, with tools and materials (wax, bronze, rope) functioning as lived-in parts of the world. The final image of names glowing in ice under the fading aurora is charged by all that prior environmental work. At times the density of description verges on ornamental, but it rarely loses clarity or purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    The vine-eaten bunker, rusted blast doors, reactor cooling ponds, and after-storm forest are rendered with high specificity and consistent atmosphere. Setting is not just backdrop: the bunker as half-ruin/half-shrine and the forest reclaiming it directly mirror and pressure her choice to abandon the directive. Environmental details evolve with the action (storm approaching/hitting/passing; light through leaves at the end), charging the final image of her stepping into the “electric green of after-storm.” The setting meaningfully constrains and reweights choices rather than functioning as a postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ancient palace—gardens, ziggurat shadow, Euphrates, obsidian tile—feels specific, lived-in, and tightly bound to the cosmological premise. Architecture literally encodes star positions and constrains where the ritual can occur (no-shadow solstice point), and the palace’s final shudder charges the closing image. Details are filtered through an astronomer’s priorities, keeping the world coherent and purposeful. Setting does clear double duty as both atmosphere and operating mechanism for the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “soundless sanctuary” existing between breaths while reality shifts is a striking, specific milieu that shapes communication (words written into the nervous system) and mood. The idea of a place “built from the genetic recollection of every organism that had ever known safety” is fresh and thematically loaded without bogging down in exposition. Setting is tightly woven with action—the silence, translucence, and pulsing walls all respond to the confrontation. A slight tendency toward conceptual rather than sensory detail (little tactile or visual specificity beyond metaphor) keeps it just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ruined orchard, teeth of ice, thick fog, and twilight frost are evocative and consistently filtered through Elias’s craft and breathing. The sextant, fog, and frost all recur to charge the final image, and the environment (fog and orchard) literally becomes part of the glass vessel. World rules around roaming dreams and boundary-thinning are stable and intuitively learned through action. While the setting is more atmospheric than constraining in a tactical sense, its integration into the ritual is strong enough for high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cathedral-orchard setting is vivid, specific, and constantly active: branches threaten stone, rafters become an orchard canopy, towers and scaffolding structure her movement. Details are deeply filtered through Mara’s professional and personal lenses, from noticing water damage and stress fractures to treating arches as “green prayers.” Environment and tools directly shape choices (she must climb, prune, stabilize, and ultimately hide the knife in the oldest tree). The final image of a ruin becoming a garden and the cathedral “breathing” is powerfully charged by accumulated setting detail, fully integrating environment with theme and character.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is richly imagined and specific: the astral orchard, the lonely asteroid, and especially the “translucent bathroom carved from crystallized moonlight” are vivid and tonally aligned. Details like star-flowers in superposition and fruit containing frozen moments of time integrate with the story’s quantum/temporal concerns rather than feeling decorative. The orchard and bathroom also subtly shape behavior—she must go there for breakthroughs, and the tree physically answers her inquiry—so environment is not purely postcard. It stops shy of absolute top tier because the setting rarely constrains her options in a concrete, tactical way beyond mood and ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mountain-library setting is richly specific and constantly active in the story’s logic: crystalline shelves, fossilized manuscripts, and botanical growth patterns literally dictate routes and dangers. Environmental constraints (shifting corridors, ventilation mapped via fungi, root systems avoiding dangerous philosophies) shape Elara’s tactics, not just the aesthetic. The final image of the Library as a garden of crystallized errors closes the loop between environment, theme, and stake. Density is high but purposeful, and the world rules feel internally consistent within the fantastical frame.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned carnival ship, foggy bay, and garden of forgotten names are rendered with vivid, specific images (rotting carousel horses, calliope playing backwards, nameplates growing like flowers). Setting is not mere backdrop: the shifting midway architecture, crow’s nest vantage, and dissolving-into-pages ship all materially shape how Maya moves and how the ending reconfigures reality. The emerald card interacting with the environment to locate the garden and then melting into the soil charges the final image. It just stops short of absolute top-tier because the sensory mix leans heavily visual and conceptual; a touch more tactile immediacy under peak beats could deepen it further.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.3)
    The clock tower mechanism room, door between flywheel and escapement, and the rope chamber are vividly imagined and integrated into action rather than feeling like décor. The environment meaningfully intersects with the premise: the tower’s machinery responds to her temporal edits, and the final image of smoothly turning gears and altered student paths charges the setting with conceptual consequence. Details like the three-dimensional manuscript rope and the brass workbench feel specific to this world and profession. Slight abstraction in some descriptions keeps it just shy of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting work is outstanding: harmonic caves, D-minor stalactites, underground percussion, the bioluminescent echo chamber stone, and ice-crack readings are vivid, specific, and tightly integrated with action. Environment directly shapes tactics (acoustic nodes, interference patterns, resonance matching) and charges the final image of the stone as calm beacon and the resealing ice. Sensory detail remains purposeful and filtered through Mara’s goal-oriented perception rather than touristic description. This richly textured, functionally consequential environment is very close to top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.1)
    The glass humming pavilion, crater rim, bruised twilight, and thistle-cracked floor create a tactile, coherent environment that shapes both mood and action (the tower climb, the hum turning to silence, the vantage to see other beacons). Setting details are always filtered through Elara’s priorities—stars, glass, tremor, and ruin reinforce her role and the stakes of rekindling a signal in a dead world. The environment actively charges the closure: the transformed hum, the steady-burning beacon over fragile thistles reweight the entire narrative. This is immersive, economical worldbuilding that materially constrains what’s possible.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is extraordinarily vivid and integrated: the stormlit observatory, solid fog, humming quartz, and shadow-play are all filtered through Elara’s sensibility and never feel like static backdrop. Environmental elements actively shape action and meaning (she can only read memories via storm-light and crystal; the solid fog isolates the observatory and charges the final sealing image). World rules—rain unlocking strata, shadows encoding memory—are consistently applied through her work. The environment decisively charges the final image but just stops short of constraining a hard choice under duress, which keeps this in the high rather than exceptional band.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is a major strength: the blooming fortress, night with no stars, mosaic constellations, and atmospheric details are vivid and purposeful rather than decorative. Environment and objects actively participate—the ivy flowers, fortress stones, and ceramic fragments all “bloom” and rearrange in response to his ritual, charging the final image of new patterns and children whistling. Sensory specificity is rich (iron and pollen, blue and gold tendrils of flame) and consistently filtered through Elian’s craft-focused perception. The only limit on going higher is that the siege itself stays largely atmospheric instead of materially constraining his on-page choices.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    The grotto, starlit opening, seeping basin, and limestone floor are vivid and consistently integrated, with water levels and salt crystallization echoing the theme of evaporation and transition. The micro-setting of the pool and the cicada’s placement at its edge (“between stone and pool, between solid and reflection”) actively charge the central image rather than functioning as backdrop. Environmental detail is filtered through the narrator’s emotional state and Maya’s professional bias, giving us a clear sensory hierarchy. While the grotto doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, it decisively shapes tone and the final charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    The xenial trellis above the clouds, the inversion of gravity, and the bunker are vividly realized and tightly integrated into character experience. Environmental rules (the hour of inversion, flowers that only bloom then, roots drinking inverted rain) are consistent and learned through Mara’s movement rather than exposition dumps. The setting meaningfully constrains choice—she must leave the trellis before the hour ends—and mirrors her internal tension between heaviness and lightness. The final return to fluorescent bunker light is charged by all we’ve seen above the clouds.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the drifting prism terrace, storm glass, and brass resonators are not postcard details but tools that structure what’s possible (gliding on thermals, measuring negative decibels, holding in a silence pocket). Environmental and atmospheric specifics (“lower atmosphere,” “layer of mist,” “cloud-city terminus”) are filtered through Mara’s professional focus. The recurring objects—the terrace, storm glass, resonators—explicitly charge the final image of clear stillness. World rules (acoustic density, barometric crystals) stay internally consistent and are learned through Mara’s actions rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and filtered through a sensibility that clearly lives in this world: synthetic moss on titanium, neural monocle, prismatic waterfall, bioluminescent orchard all feel purposeful. Details are well chosen to support tone and theme (analog vs hologram, corrupted archives vs hidden sanctuary) rather than decorative tourism, and the orchard and stairway are spatially coherent. Environment and objects do constrain and charge choices: the liminal pre-dawn window, the quantum orchard, and the dissolving stairway impose time and access limits that matter at closure. A slight tendency toward lush accumulation in the worldbuilding edges toward over-description but doesn’t materially slow comprehension or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ashen, rib-like sanctuary and starlit hollows are vivid, specific, and consistently tied to the emotional atmosphere of “loaded emptiness.” The house’s partial ruin mirrors Elias’s function and becomes a crucible that shifts from vacuum to vessel, clearly charging the final image. Environment is more symbolic than constraining—physical layout and weather don’t much affect tactics—but at this length the symbolic integration works. A touch more tactile interaction with the space under pressure could elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.3)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is striking and integrated; the blue-green constellations, color shift to violet, and prisms in each cap all track the story’s emotional and conceptual arc. Setting isn’t mere backdrop: the farm responds to her choice, receives the diamond, and frames the final image of altered light. World rules—concepts condensing into matter at a particular “hour,” glitch texts bleeding through quantum foam—are consistently handled for this length. A touch more tactile/sonic grounding in the farm during the climax could further balance the heavily visual, metaphor-rich atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “sepia reading room” with dust motes, mahogany, and golden light is vividly drawn and tightly integrated with the central conceit, especially as dust becomes the literal medium of the revealed text. Sensory detail is rich and selective (visual, olfactory “vanilla scent of aging deceit”), and the space feels lived-in rather than a catalog. Crucially, the environment constrains tactics: the dust, still air, and silence are what allow the acoustic manuscript to exist at all. The final image of letters trembling as darkness deepens shows the setting actively shaping the scene’s stakes rather than functioning as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vivid, specific, and consistently strange—mercury fruit, crystallized shadow, glass leaves chiming at “the resonance of dreams.” Setting details are tightly tied to action and theme: the mercury spheres show unlived lives, the central tree bears equations, and the environment responds to his choices. World rules (quantifiable magic, measurable starlight) feel internally consistent and filtered through his quasi-scientific gaze. The space meaningfully shapes what’s possible rather than serving as a decorative backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.8)
    The foster care file room and its dust are exquisitely specific and fully filtered through Maya’s sensibility (“like a historian interprets geological strata”), and the environment functions as both archive and diagnostic tool. Dust patterns physically shape her discoveries and tactics, while the file room’s institutional stillness frames the theme of bureaucratic forgetting. The recurring objects (dust, folders, buttons) are tightly integrated and charge the final image. This is very strong scene-setting, just shy of transcendent only because the room itself doesn’t quite impose direct logistical constraints on her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is a major strength: from the rain-slicked pothole and oil-sheened puddle-map to the rusted stairs and the “auric lagoon” under a collapsed ceiling, place is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elias’s priorities. The environment directly constrains tactics—the secret tunnels, antique switchboard, bioluminescent water, and old phone lines are the only viable channel left to bypass the Ministry. The lagoon’s light show both powers and embodies the climax, charging the final image of forbidden histories projected on cavern walls and devices above. World rules (obsolete infrastructure repurposed as resistance) feel coherent and integral, not decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    The radiant grotto, prism atrium, algae-lit walls, fog, and dew are vividly realized and consistently filtered through the music/silence premise. Setting is not backdrop: the prism ceiling refracts his “un-sound,” the dew physically embodies the prophecy, and the final suspended droplet literally constrains his last move. Environmental rules (condensation as phonemes, mist as carrier) stay internally consistent and charge the final image. The only reason this doesn’t go higher is a slight tendency toward lush cataloging over further tactical interaction in a few lines.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Ashen Skyborne Arbor is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility—sideways-falling leaves, ash, dead stars, and suspended soil beds all feel integral rather than ornamental. The environment constrains action (leaves moving sideways, a floating arbor that can broadcast spores) and charges the final image as the gray turns to silver and then green. World rules (moonstone dust, leaf-language, ash as chrysalis) are consistent and learned through action. A touch more tactile interaction with the physical peril or instability of the arbor could have deepened the sense of constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid and functional: the ruined greenhouse, spiraling leaves, and subterranean waterfall all constrain options rather than serving as décor. The moving stepping stones and veil of water concretely shape her tactics, while the compass rose and fractured glass roof charge the final image. Details are tightly filtered through Elara’s mechanical sensibility, preventing museum-tour description. Environment and object-as-setting are integral to both conflict and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.0)
    The rain-washed foundry, cooling crucibles, broken roof, and steaming furnaces create a vivid, specific atmosphere that matches the metaphysical work she’s doing. Details like rain washing away ash and dawn light through the broken skylights evolve across the piece and meaningfully charge the final image of Kael’s golden seams steaming dry. The magic-physics fusion (“conservation of soul-mass,” “entropy of memory”) is integrated into the environment rather than feeling like a lecture. The setting supports mood and theme more than concrete tactical constraints, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    Echo Gorge, the hidden sunrise, and the acoustics of wrong notes and laughter are vividly rendered and feel essential rather than decorative. The environment (cliffs, echoes, veil between worlds) directly enables the ritual and the amplification of both dissonance and laughter. The crocodile’s tooth also functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. A slightly stronger sense of physical constraint or risk from the terrain would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ultraviolet forest is sensorially rich and integrated into action: its hum affects her body; trees radiate judgment; bark equations echo the facility walls. The environment actively shapes her journey, turning suffering into coordinates and literally supporting her as she braces and navigates. The pewter strap and bioluminescent moss function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. Detail level is high but purposeful, with consistent world rules and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    The alchemist’s market, rope bridges, and aerial cityscape are vivid and distinctive, with details filtered through Elara’s work-focused perspective (height, wind, the suspended marketplace during the eternal instant). The lighthouse lens as object-setting is superbly integrated, both physically and symbolically, and it directly charges the final image when it grows hot, then is pocketed. World rules—time dilation, encoded histories in art—feel internally consistent and are learned through concrete action rather than exposition. The setting enhances theme and mood and subtly echoes the stakes (being “unfastened” from the world below) even if it doesn’t heavily constrain tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting work is excellent: the abandoned circus ticket office, vintage stubs, grimy light, and the elevator shaft all feel tactile and lived-in, with circus-specific history (the grand clock, main tent) woven through. Details are filtered through Maya’s professional bias (dust accumulation, cables, governor mechanism), which grounds the supernatural in the technical. The environment and key objects (ceiling crack, hidden cavity, shaft, mainspring) actively constrain and guide her actions—they aren’t backdrop but machinery of the plot and theme. The final image of the humming elevator “keeping time for no one and everyone” elegantly charges the setting as the story’s core symbol.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glass orchard library and cloud-sea are vividly rendered and tightly integrated into action: frost on the library’s skin provides the map, the glass trees house the unread books, and the central trunk becomes the rupture locus. Tools and materials (letterpress, cloud-fiber paper, bottled whisper, frost plates) are all embedded in this environment and guide tactical choices. The setting also charges the final image—pages rustling in once-static glass branches over a newly storming cloud-sea. It falls just short of the very top band because the environment rarely constrains her with friction; it mainly serves her design.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    The baroque asteroid, visible time, crystal corridors, and storms are not just decorative; they shape the rules (mirrors, paradox loops), the methodology (treating the place as sanctuary, not fortress), and the final image. Details like “visible time pooled like amber wine” and “river of molten honey” are vivid yet integrated with action and theme, and the temporal storms materially affect behavior and belief. The environment charges the closure—the asteroid as reliquary guiding ships, the covered mirrors, the shard on the sill—so the setting and recurring objects decisively constrain and color the final stance. World rules around visible time and reflective surfaces remain consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    The resonance chamber, crystalline shelves, rusting music boxes, and the keystone device are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the action. Setting actively shapes events: the chamber amplifies sound to push back darkness, the boxes join the chorus, and oxidation itself is a world-rule with stakes. Details are filtered through Elias’s craft-sense, which keeps the lyricism from feeling like a generic fantasy backdrop. The final image of rust “singing” and the stone dissolving into the comb recharges the environment as part of the ongoing mechanism rather than a static stage.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is outstanding: the rusting factory, sealed maintenance hatch, calcite “like calcified lace,” and the mirror-black lagoon under bioluminescent limestone create a dense, lived-in atmosphere. The environment isn’t just decorative; it enables the discovery (abandoned factory, sealed chamber) and charges the final image of her breathing impossible petrichor in absolute hush. Sensory detail, especially olfactory and tactile, is finely controlled and strongly filtered through Elara’s obsessions. A slight tendency toward luxuriant description in places is the only thing keeping this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.5)
    The storm, stone archway, and coastal debris are vividly rendered and deeply integrated into both action and theme: the weather forces her under the arch, the arch’s turbine-hum shapes the meditative tone, and the driftwood becomes both material and message. Environmental constraints (shelter, storm debris as resources) directly dictate her tactics in the night, and the final walk along the coast with the lantern slide in her pocket recharges these settings as ongoing guides. Details like barnacle scars, rope coils, and grain-encoded knowledge feel chosen through her artisan’s gaze rather than as generic decoration. Setting is not only atmospheric but meaning-bearing and choice-shaping, justifying a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is outstanding: the amber pavilion, frosted glass, cathedral nave, etched window, and thawing garden are vivid, specific, and always POV-filtered. Environmental shifts (frost, thaw, blue hour light, layered glass) aren’t decorative; they’re the mechanism by which Lyra discovers the flowers’ true orientation. The amber pavilion and cathedral window jointly charge the final image of roots, layers of glass, and petals reaching toward unseen sun. The physical world and recurring objects are so tightly tied to meaning that the story’s effect would collapse without them.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    The imagery is rich and specific—the quartz dunes, obsidian lagoon, and floating library create a distinctive, charged atmosphere. The environment constrains and charges choices: the hidden lagoon as grave/evidence, the debris field as messaging medium, the zeppelin as vantage and recorder. Sensory detail is well handled (salt, static, warmth of sand) and filtered through Elias’s haunted focus rather than reading like a tourist catalog. The zeppelin itself is slightly more ornamental than the ground setting, which does most of the real narrative work.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and particular—“Paper-Lantern Cove,” calcified wish-shells, barnacled glass, ash-gray tides—and consistently filtered through Elara’s perspective as an alchemist in a de-magicked world. Environment and object-as-setting (the amber bottle, the lanterns) meaningfully charge the final image: the cove’s ghostliness is directly reconfigured into a rational, post-wish settlement. The only reason this doesn’t push higher is that, while atmospheric, the physical environment rarely constrains her options in a tactical sense; it’s more a charged stage than an active obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rooftop orchard above the harbor is vividly rendered and deeply integrated: the steel-supported soil, wind-trembling trees, and harbor foghorn all anchor the piece sensorially and metaphorically. The setting is not postcard background; the orchard’s isolation explicitly mirrors the pressure tank and becomes the recording cylinder itself at the end. Environmental details (moths, vapor lamps, blossoms in autumn) evolve with the transformation and charge the final image. The only minor limit is that physical constraints never directly force a tactical choice, but the symbolic constraint is strong enough to carry high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    The icebound atrium under starlight is vivid, tactile, and omnipresent; glass, frost, soil, and fountain all matter to what’s possible. Environmental change—the thaw, upward-flowing water, and greenhouse humidity—tracks causally with her actions and charges the final image of green resurgence. The oak cap’s socket in the fountain stone and the frozen soil becoming a staircase of light are especially strong integrations of setting and mechanism. The only limitation is that the environment constrains mood and ritual more than posing concrete physical obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “windblown sanctuary above the clouds” and solstice setting are richly realized and recur in ways that echo and sharpen the thematic stakes. Tools and environment (parapet, instruments, tunnels, belfry, rope) are not mere décor; they channel her movement and frame the choice between siren switches and bell. Weather and altitude meaningfully inflect action, especially at zero hour when the storm hits. A slight tendency toward repeated phrasing keeps this just shy of the very top band but the atmosphere is strong and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory and station are vividly realized and integral: “a bone bleached clean by time,” forgotten by maps, orbiting neglect, all of which embody his isolation and the story’s quiet stakes. The yellow lantern glass functions as a micro-setting object that shapes perception and decisively charges the final image. Space, void, and station rules are consistent and filtered through his professional habits and spiritual bias, creating a rich, coherent atmosphere that supports theme and character.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and textured: charred acacia trees, empty hives as “cathedrals,” scorched earth, and the oasis-turned-wasteland form a fully realized environment. Details are clearly filtered through someone steeped in beekeeping and loss, and the repeated use of bees, hives, fire, and the stained glass box creates a coherent atmospheric web. The environment meaningfully charges the final image—the box’s colored light staining the air would not resonate the same way in any other setting. The setting could constrain concrete choices more (there’s little tactical interaction with terrain), but as a pressure and tone engine it’s highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, strange, and thematically charged: the emerald silo as a “jade finger pointing accusation” and the broken chronometers in a wasteland elegantly externalize the temporal disorder. Details like “crystallized grain” and digital garage-sale ads ground the surreal. The environment meaningfully shapes the story’s logic—the silo is the necessary locus for the anomaly and transformation, and the urn’s absence on her chest is the final embodied image. World rules about time’s collapse are consistent enough for this length, though sometimes relayed more as concept than directly embodied constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is richly realized—“cobalt lagoon,” dark sand, mangroves, post-storm sky, petrichor—and the sensory specificity is high throughout. Environment is not mere backdrop: the lagoon supplies debris for her woven dawns, the cold water she must wade into to retrieve the kite, and the seaweed she braids into a new string, all of which concretely shape action. Weather and time of day (the hush after rain shifting into clamor of day) mirror the emotional cadence without feeling mechanical. The closing image of the lagoon “holding its broken treasures” charges the place with thematic weight, making it inseparable from the story’s meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    The temple orchard and living stone pillars are vivid, specific, and inseparable from the story’s mechanics: the neural stone, subterranean tides, and grafted trees all shape the tactics and final image. Details like songbirds nesting in wired branches, lichen “diplomacy,” and bioluminescent veins in granite create a cohesive, atmospheric ecosystem rather than a backdrop. The environment directly constrains action—copper must bridge oak and stone—and charges the ending as the pillars “sing” over his body. Description veers lush but stays purposeful and filtered through the caretaker’s occupational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory, overgrown sculpture path, bronze philosophers, and rainwashed tower are vividly and specifically rendered, with strong visual and textural detail. Setting is consistently filtered through a contemplative, scientifically-minded lens, so the environment feels lived-in rather than touristic. While the tower and weather don’t tightly constrain tactical choices, they meaningfully charge the final image of rain erasing footprints and statues being washed clean. The recurring “bronze/amber/rain” interplay effectively supports atmosphere and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally rich and integrated: dead reef, acid ocean, blackened battlefield, and the liminal jetty all shape imagery and tone. The “blooming jetty” and twilight environment aren’t mere backdrops; they define the narrow path and the stakes of tide vs. garden. World rules (acidified ocean, dead coral, rusting ordnance) are consistent and infuse every action with ecological consequence. The final image of the jetty “drifting between worlds” is powered almost entirely by the setting’s charged specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    The scrapyard settlement and cracked wasteland are vividly and economically evoked, with details like “radio towers bent like praying skeletons” and “metallic lungs” doing heavy atmospheric work. Setting is filtered through Ash’s sensory priorities—smell, vibration, rust—which grounds the world and sharpens tone. Crucially, the preserved leaf and wax disc charge the final image as a tiny, impossible fragment of color and life in a gray, metal world. The environment does not heavily constrain tactical options, but it deeply informs mood and thematic contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly evoked and tightly fused to character experience: time dilation shapes every physical and sensory detail, from ice crystals in stretched air to distorted sound. The observation deck isn’t a backdrop; it constrains motion, warps perception, and directly informs how she maps her way out. Recurring objects (viewport, compass, journal) function as micro-settings that charge the final image. The density of description occasionally edges toward ornamental, but the environment consistently frames and pressures her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “icebound spire above the clouds” and “wrong sky” are vividly rendered with specific, sensuous detail (violet glaciers, bleeding aurora, copper-and-ozone air) that feels integrated rather than ornamental. Environmental pressure—altitude sickness, slippery parapet, lethal cold—is present, though it could more directly constrain tactical choices. The Chamber of Hours, pocket sundial lid, and crystalline guardian all feel of a piece with the setting’s logic. The final image of the wrong sky cracking and rain that “smelled of jasmine and renewal” nicely charges the environment as an emotional register of the story’s change.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cathedral’s whispering gallery, the nomadic penumbra, and the pawnless chessboard are sharply rendered and integral rather than decorative. The space carries her voice to the crowd, the moving shadow creates a three-minute window that charges the climax, and the board anchors the final image. Details are selective and filtered through Mira’s history with performance and crisis. Setting is not just backdrop but an active participant in the story’s meaning and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    The mountain-bookstore is strikingly specific and integrated: shelves drilled into granite, catacombs of syntax, summit starlight, and the later spatial contraction into a single spiral all make the environment active rather than decorative. Setting meaningfully constrains choices (the need to reach the summit for starlight) and charges the final image as the mountain “breathes differently” and recognizes Vey. World rules—books as graveyard of tongues, stone as proto-language—remain consistent and are learned through Vey’s movement and perception. The density is high but mostly purposeful, with setting acting as an extension of Vey’s interior rather than a separate backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    The time-frozen village, “woven hush,” and suspended storm are vividly rendered and deeply integrated with the emotional and magical logic: the environment is both prison and manifestation of Kaelen’s unresolved guilt. World rules stay consistent—once he completes the pattern, the hush literally unravels and time resumes. Objects-as-setting (platinum labyrinth, tapestry) are skillfully used as spatial and thematic anchors that charge the final image of rain and laughter. The setting meaningfully constrains options (no moving villagers, no passing time) and gives the ending its sensory power.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    The canyon of bone towers and endless echoes is vivid, specific, and tightly married to the premise: the porous bone, echo behavior, and pale spire all shape what is possible. Echo physics directly enable Kael’s resistance tactic and the Overseers’ failure, and the final image of the towers “singing” reweights prior details. The environment isn’t just backdrop—it’s the mechanism of refraction and the vessel of Kael’s sacrifice (voice becoming bone). There’s minor overreliance on visual/aural registers, but it suits the piece’s sound-driven logic.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop over an acid sea, the memory-tank, and the pitted marble statue are sharply rendered and consistently pressured by the environment (“metal screaming as the acid ate through the hull”). Setting is never postcard: the acid, failing pontoons, and ruptured seals actively constrain time and choice. Objects-as-setting (the charm, the statue) are fully integrated and charge the final image of her diving into story as the platform sinks. The piece balances evocative strangeness with spatial and physical clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    The coastal cave network and hidden bioluminescent chamber are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Elias’s artistic perception. Environment consistently shapes action: the forked tunnel, “wrong” stalactites, narrowing passage, and final oasis all contour his movement and choices. The final image—shell, stone, water, light—relies entirely on the specific cave ecology to carry its charge. A touch of lushness verging on excess in places is the only thing keeping this just shy of the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt lighthouse, the oppressive-then-breaking heat, and the heaving Atlantic are rendered with dense, purposeful sensory detail (“slate-gray dawn that tasted of iron and relief,” “walls sweat and his thoughts run clear as spring water”). Setting is not decorative: the heat wave and atmospheric conditions explain the failure of sound and justify the need for Elias’s alternative method. The micro-setting of the jasmine garden and the cork-as-object feed directly into the mechanism of rescue and the charged final image of jasmine-scented light reaching the horizon. The work flirts with overrich description but almost always keeps detail tied to mood, stakes, or tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    The signal station, rusted hydraulics, and censer foot are richly textured and always filtered through her functional needs (repurposing dead hydraulics, matching verdigris, stars wheeling outside). Environment constrains action—she can only work with salvage, a failing tower, and old machinery—and the final image of her hand on the warm bronze is charged by all that accrued materiality. World rules (rising seas, evacuation inland, lunar-tied neurology) feel consistent and integrated rather than expository. This is near top-tier setting work, kept from 9+ mostly by staying in a single emotional register instead of using the space to generate sharper on-page tactical friction.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    The hanging orchard and storm-battered ravine are vividly rendered and consistently used to shape action—her harness, the cables, the rainwater for the ritual, and the mycelium cover are all tactically relevant. Environmental pressure (height, weather, swaying trees) is not mere backdrop; it constrains what she can do, when, and how. The antique glass eye and fungal network function as charged micro-settings that directly feed the final image and the conceptual “fortress of silence.” A slight tendency toward lush description in places doesn’t undercut clarity or function.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the opal dock, nautical twilight, and softly persistent fog are not just atmospheric but entwined with the premise of memory-collecting space. Environmental details like mist curling around pylons “as if the vapor itself held memory” and the beam sweeping through fog directly charge the final image and thematic frame. The lighthouse/dock environment constrains the story’s possibilities into endurance and watchfulness rather than physical action. Detail is selective, aligned with Maren’s keeper perspective, and consistently supports tone and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is richly particular—foxfire moss, glowing-fungus-bearing ants, red clay, solstice blooms with “old paper and typewriter ribbon” scent—and clearly filtered through a map dealer’s sensibility. Environmental factors (flooding creek, narrow fissure, mechanical stone door) genuinely constrain options and sharpen the stakes. The rules of this slightly altered Appalachia feel internally consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition. There is a lot of description, but here it mostly earns its keep by echoing theme and guiding Arthur’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific—ridge, cloud line, cobalt grotto, bioluminescent “lacy menace” walls, and the pool showing a distressed cosmos all feel tactile and particular. The environment isn’t just backdrop: the climb, the grotto’s warmth, and the pool of starlight directly condition what’s possible and where the realization can occur. The grotto’s transformation from menace to “workshop of creation” effectively charges the final image. There is some density of description verging on overrich, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ember nexus, pocket-suns, and nautilus shell form a tightly woven micro-setting whose properties and constraints directly shape Elara’s tactics (thermal currents, twilight edge, the spiral as vessel). Description is lush but purposeful: details like “vials of compressed dawn” and the nexus as crucible are not just pretty—they inform why this moment and location are chosen. The final images (shell as lighthouse, dried palette as a map) clearly reweight prior setting details and charge the closure. It’s nearly exemplary; the only restraint is that the environment never forces an urgent adaptation in the moment, operating more as prepared stage than active adversary.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mountain ranger cabin, the porch, the grave below, and the mountain air are all concrete and sensorial, and they mirror his shifting internal states effectively. The birch bark scroll functions as a micro-setting/object that anchors and charges the final image. Weather and environment (wind howling, air biting his lungs) support tone but rarely constrain options or tactics. Strong atmosphere and specificity, but the space doesn’t quite become a decisive pressure on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    The water clock repair shop, fogged street, and glass reservoirs are vivid, specific, and continuously filtered through Mara’s professional and sensory biases. Environment and objects (the water drip, curved glass, condensation) are not postcard décor; they directly charge the final images and the theme of occluded perception. The loss of smell ironically heightens visual and textural setting details, and the shop’s mechanics (visible time, floats, gears) mirror how she now experiences emotion and memory. Setting clearly constrains the story’s language and shapes its closure without feeling over-described.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting and atmosphere are richly rendered: the “floating rock tea ceremony platform,” upper-atmosphere storm, and “saturated hush” are vivid and sensorially specific. Environmental details (altitude, storm pressure, need to hold breath) meaningfully constrain her actions and options. The tea-platform’s usual meditative purpose reweights the final image when it becomes a workshop of metamorphosis, nicely charging theme. At times, the density of description edges toward decorative rather than functional, but it rarely harms clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    The sheet music archive and orchard are vivid and purposeful, not decorative: shelves become literal circuitry, fluorescent lights and ballasts respond to the ritual, and the orchard’s acoustics/roots are the ghost’s anchor. Sensory detail—dust, light, sound-as-scent—builds a distinct, textured atmosphere aligned to Elara’s profession and the haunting. The environment constrains options (the haunting bound to that place and time) and charges the final image of dust on shelves and trees falling. World rules around sound, space, and haunting are consistent and learned through action, not exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “ancient temple library lost in time,” obsidian shelves, and “resounding hush” are vivid and tightly woven through the action; the environment feels integral rather than generic. The setting evolves—shelves crumble to luminous dust, then fold into her footprints, and finally she “became the library”—so place explicitly charges the final image. Details like the humidity-swollen softcover and the endless bell-like silence are specific and purposeful. The setting could exert more tangible constraint on her choices, but atmospherically and thematically it’s very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fjord, cliffs, and horizon measurement station are vividly drawn and consistently filtered through the shepherd’s professional and existential preoccupations. Environmental elements (dark water, vertical cliffs, hydraulic tanks, falling snow) actively shape what he can perceive and think about, not just what he sees. The recurring objects-as-setting (station, hydraulic systems, key) charge the final image by embodying the “now” he comes to recognize. Setting is integral rather than decorative, though occasionally description edges toward luxuriant rather than strictly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.0)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vividly realized and continuously filtered through Maya’s professional and emotional lens, avoiding postcard description. The quarantine glass and permeable-barrier logic meaningfully constrain what the characters can do and become the core metaphor for their emotional options. The final image—mushrooms glowing brighter as dawn approaches, indifferent to ownership—charges the theme and would not work if transplanted to a generic lab. Environmental specificity and object-use (glass, caps, glow) are tightly integrated with character and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is exceptionally vivid and POV-filtered: the subway’s scratched plastic, rainwashed glass, and humid, swollen books feel tactile and lived-in. The mica-pane lantern functions as a micro-setting, consistently charging images and culminating in the final sense of carrying contradictions “like a lantern against the dark.” Weather and season (rainwashed, midsummer green) are not mere backdrop; they color her perception of growth, survival, and submersion. The environment shapes meaning more than tactics, but it does so with consistent, charged specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    The subway utility tunnel, dead tracks, and streetlamp hum form a vivid, coherent environment that fuses with the story’s metaphysics (afterlife switchboard, the city exhaling loneliness). Setting is not mere backdrop: the obsolete tunnel and electrical handoff constrain her isolation and mark the timing of her interventions (hanging up as lamps hand off day to night). The glass harmonica disc and third rail’s “corpse” recur as charged objects that shape the final image. This is elite-level atmosphere and specificity, only just shy of transcendent because physical constraints never quite force a concrete choice under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    The blooming jetty, mnemonic flowers, fog, and saltwater are vivid and specific, and the setting’s rules (grief altering salinity, blooms responding to memory) are both consistent and freshly imagined. Environment constrains choice: the steep, bloom-cracked concrete and fragile flowers dictate her reverent pace and the stakes of a misstep. The recurring objects—jetty, blooms, ink, locket—meaningfully charge the final image of her leaving with the past “carried” rather than displayed. A hair more tactile interaction with the physical world under stress could push this into the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ivy-choked, moss-upholstered station is vivid, specific, and tonally aligned with the story’s liminal emotional space, with nice evolutions like the ivy “lean[ing] closer to listen” and the station “breath[ing].” The environment isn’t just postcard background; it coheres with the idea of a disused public infrastructure repurposed for emotional relief and underwrites the “polite anarchy” tone. However, the setting rarely constrains concrete choices—it frames and charges the ritual rather than forcing tactics—so it falls slightly short of the very top band. The moon rock as micro-setting object is tightly integrated and helps charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ultrasonic forest is richly imagined and tightly woven into action—she feels bark dialects, moss “singing,” roots and sap expressing endurance, so the environment is never a backdrop. The forest’s rules (ultrasonic languages, cancellation into silence) stay consistent and directly create the possibility of the stillpoint. The platinum ring and the forest together function as a micro-setting system that constrains her choices and charges the final silence. A slight overabundance of abstractions (“photosynthesizing hope”) is the only thing keeping this from an even higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gravitational anomaly, observatory, and starlight-as-ink are vivid and integral, not wallpaper: they directly enable and constrain the act of editing history. Details like metal unbending and the anomaly “humming a frequency that sounded almost like forgiveness” charge both tactics and the final image. The professional setting (signal interpreter, parallax gauge, iridium nib) is economical yet specific, clearly filtered through Elara’s role. World rules—light bending, history-rewriting via the pen—remain internally consistent and are learned through action rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    The luminous harbor is vividly realized—moonlight, bioluminescence, pilings, boats—and consistently filtered through Elias’s artistic perception. Setting is not postcard-static: the harbor’s silences are literally the material he maps, and the horizon/mast/moonlight constellation charges the final image. The pier’s end as “where the water opened into endless dark” also mirrors the largest, orchestral silence. A bit more tactile or auditory absence (e.g., chill, creak, distant city noise) under decision points could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.4)
    The settings—the limestone hollow archive, the underglass silence, and the specific ruined libraries (Seattle, Boston, Portland)—are sensually rich and deeply tied to theme. Details like “air tasted of mineral regret,” volcanic glass, ash, and obsidian mosaics do more than decorate; they encode the central tension between erasure and preservation and charge the final image of her leaving the last portrait at the archive entrance. The environment actively shapes tactics (using charcoal from embers, tapestry threads, obsidian) and meaning, not just backdrop. It comes close to top-tier, but occasionally the imagery edges toward ornamental density rather than always tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integral: the sound wave garden, ceramic reed, sonic willows, auric lagoon, and visible sound-spectrum aurora all feel specific, tactile, and deeply tied to the premise. Environmental rules (neural activity→sound→lagoon response; ventilation cycles as windows) are consistently dramatized instead of dumped, and they meaningfully constrain choice—Kael must act in the pre-ventilation hush and loses Elena when the system “exhales.” The final image of the garden’s “auroral sorrow” wrapping him, and the lagoon “holding its breath,” charges the world as an active participant in his grief. This environment could not be swapped out without dismantling both the logic and emotional power of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    The container labyrinth, aurora-bruised sky, and storm-warped port tech are vivid and tightly integrated into action (no GPS, dead radios, secret passages, phosphorescent paint). Environmental constraints directly shape tactics: reliance on folded maps, footsteps, and clandestine paths instead of digital systems. The zodiac coin and scratched constellations charge the inner chamber, linking physical space to generational memory and recognition. Setting supports theme and stakes without over-explaining, and it meaningfully charges the final image of whispers navigating “endless corridors of steel.”

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vividly and precisely rendered—the cobalt canal, rain-slick dock, boathouse shutters, and obsidian water are all strongly evocative and tightly integrated with the ritual. Environmental elements constrain and enable action: the wet boards birth mist to be “woven,” the shutters physically shape light, and the canal’s surface becomes the communicative medium. The recurring dental mirror functions as a micro-setting object that directly charges the final image. Atmosphere, tone, and spatial logic are all consistently maintained without white-room gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is a major strength: the cobalt library, mist, and magnetic grotto are sensory-rich and unmistakably specific, and the environment meaningfully shapes tactics (the need for a high vantage, the grotto’s field amplifying quiet, the visibility of the window-constellation). Details are strongly filtered through the story’s contemplative tone, with world rules (the grotto’s magnetism, the library materializing) consistently treated as given. The final image—starlight on stone, the queen on a stalagmite, light squares mapped to an Italian Game—depends on these places to resonate. A few descriptive passages verge on ornamental, but they rarely stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    The harbor’s sublittoral fringe, morning mist, barnacle-crusted pylons, and tidal pools form a vivid, lived-in environment that mirrors Elara’s threshold state. The disappearing island’s existence “only between tides” and the rising water actively shape what’s possible and when, not just mood. The scrimshaw functions as a charged object-as-setting, culminating in it fusing with her sternum and literally mapping the final territory. World rules (Binding Treaties, post-violence harbor society) are consistent and learned through implication rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and thematically live: turbines casting “second hands,” a farmhouse relic, dried flowers in “suspended decay,” and the empty grid where electricity “powered nothing” all reinforce the post-Mandate world. Details are filtered well through Elias’s sensibility and role, never feeling like a catalog. The turbines and powerless electricity charge the final image conceptually, even if they don’t literally constrain choices. Overall, atmosphere and specificity strongly support the piece’s mood and idea.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, humming quartz, and lantern-moth hush are rich, specific, and consistently filtered through Elara’s perception. The environment is not just backdrop; the colonnade’s architecture shapes her movement, the ice groans in response to her voice, and the final image of her shadow drifting across the frozen surface charges the thematic closure. World rules feel internally consistent for this lyrical fantastical mode. The one limitation is that the setting constrains choice more symbolically than practically, keeping it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glassblower’s courtyard, kiln, cooling silica, and plant beds are vividly rendered and deeply filtered through Elara’s grayscale perception, giving the setting a strong textural presence. Environment and objects (kiln, reed, soot, ash, plant beds) directly constrain choices and charge the final images (the shattering glass, withering/regrowing plants, new painting in the same courtyard). The phoenix aftermath context infuses the atmosphere without heavy exposition, and the world’s rules feel internally consistent. Minor room remains to tie physical constraints even more tightly to on-page dilemmas, but as is, the setting is a major strength.

    The Laboratory of Lost Sounds is richly evoked—crystalline storage arrays, glass cylinders of extinct sounds, resonance chamber—and every major action is embedded in specific environmental features (cracks in quartz, activation plate, stabilized grid). The miner’s lens functions as a micro-setting/tool, constraining how she perceives the lab and literally focusing the sunset to trigger the system, which powerfully charges the final image. World rules around the blackout, the grid, and the lab’s function are coherent and learned through action rather than exposition dumps. The only restraint on an even higher score is that some atmospheric details (e.g., the golden light) stay more tonal than constraining, affecting mood more than tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory is vivid and distinctive—brass telescopes, copper dome, extinct starlight—and its rules (outside chronological order, curtains of intention) are consistent and legible. Environment isn’t mere backdrop: the refractor, dome rotation, and projection onto the curved ceiling are the mechanism by which grief is mapped and the brother’s stars are revealed. The setting meaningfully charges the final image of calibration and faint light from dying stars, entwining physical space with thematic stakes. Sensory detail is largely visual but filtered through Elara’s professional and emotional bias in a purposeful way.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.3)
    The loft, rain-beaded skylight, oak table, brass measuring tape, and onyx ink are vivid and tightly integrated with the mood and thematic frame. The city “written in empty server farms and abandoned trading floors” gives just enough world texture to ground the crypto-collapse without sliding into exposition. Weather and light (skylight as camera obscura, rain as code/weather language) evolve across the scene and charge the final image, even if they don’t heavily constrain physical choices. The setting feels specific and lived-in, though its influence is atmospheric rather than tactically decisive, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    The archive, pagoda, fungi, automata, and “atoms of nostalgia” create a vivid, coherent environment that’s strongly filtered through the historian’s perception. Setting isn’t just ornamental: the guardians and pattern-sensitive architecture directly constrain her tactics, and the pagoda/nostalgia dust charge the final image. World rules (rigid order vs chaos) stay consistent and are shown through architecture and mechanisms instead of exposition. A few patches flirt with museum-tour lyricism, but overall the atmosphere is dense, purposeful, and integrated with theme.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    The blooming library above the clouds and its bioluminescent, petal-like shelves create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that matches the dream-archive premise. The recurring river stone functions as a charged micro-setting object: its physical journey across dreams constrains interpretation and directly charges the final image. World rules (shared dream footage, crystalline vaults) are consistent and learned organically through Elara’s work rather than expository dumping. The environment is more thematic than obstructive, but the shelves “closing around her” and later “releasing stored starlight” give the setting a subtle, active presence in the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and particular: mist, stars, terrariums, jasmine, and wet earth form a coherent, sensory-rich environment filtered through Elara’s attention. The workshop and chameleon enclosures are used throughout, not as postcards, but as a lived-in space she physically reconstructs in tandem with her moral reconstruction. Environmental details (mist lifting, stars as witnesses, color shifts) mirror and charge her internal process without feeling like blunt allegory. The setting doesn’t tightly constrain her options, but it strongly charges the final image and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting work is rich and purposeful: tower, frost-rimed windows, ivy, roots, sealed tunnel, and the meteor cavern all feel tactile and lived-in. Environment repeatedly constrains and enables choice—roots mapping the tunnel, the sealed passage dictating his descent, the cavern as the only place where the meteor and sister can exist in that preserved state. Recurring objects-as-setting (hourglass, coffee rings, scars/stone) charge the final image with accumulated meaning. The density of description is very high, verging on lush, but it remains coherent and filtered through Elias’s obsessions.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is richly and precisely rendered—the iron ladder, booth as skull, seats as vertebrae, orchestra pit, ozone and dust—and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The physical environment meaningfully charges the conceptual turn: the projector, screen, and the “space between” become the literal site of stored love, reweighting all prior details. The movie palace’s architecture is not postcard dressing; it’s structurally tied to the final image. A slight excess of figurative layering keeps it from feeling absolutely flawless, but it’s well above publishable standard.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    The aurora-lit archway, polar air, frost-heaved stones, and brass sextant are sensuously rendered and tightly integrated with the action—the environment is not backdrop but the ritual apparatus. The need to reach this specific latitude, the portal quality of the archway, and the cold ground she lies on directly constrain what she can do and when. World rules (aurora as portal, falling stars as coordinates) stay consistent within the piece’s lyric logic. Setting and objects charge the final image (the dimmed aurora, ordinary stone, ticking instrument) in a way that meaningfully reweights the whole scene.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is a major strength: the glowing dune in bloom, phosphorescent lichen, crystallized-time archive, and post-conflagration world are vividly and specifically rendered. Environmental details aren’t mere backdrop; the dune’s treachery, the lichen’s response to his voice, and the time-crystal architecture of the archive all shape what he can do and how the climax manifests (placing the clock, midnight spreading). World rules around starlight-adapted flora and quantum caravans remain internally consistent and are learned through textured description rather than infodump. The final image of frozen luminescence and branching shelves is deeply charged by all the prior environmental groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Mechanical Rainforest is richly and specifically rendered—copper leaves, gear-box flowers, fiber-optic moss, root-networks—and these details are filtered through Kael’s perceptual priorities. Setting is not postcard; it shapes tactics (wind-through-trees navigation, sleep-translocation, the gear-tree nexus) and charges the final image of the forest breathing in “perfect fifths.” World rules (mechanical/biological hybridity, networked roots) stay consistent and pay off at closure when the small gear reanimates the system.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid and integrated: fog shore, lantern-lit waterline, “veiled ridgeway,” and the bioluminescent grotto all mirror Mara’s internal state and the liminal courage/fear theme. Environmental features constrain action and symbolism—indirect paths, mist, dunes, and impossible juxtapositions embody the non-linear work of courage. The recurring waterline/shoreline imagery and the twilight-to-dawn shift explicitly charge the final image of “waiting light.” The only thing keeping this from the absolute top band is that the environment shapes mood and metaphor more than concrete tactical constraints, though it still feels essential.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt fortress under snow is vividly and economically realized: frost-rimed carpets, arrow slits, dusty spiral staircases, and the snow pressing at the walls all feel tactile and lived-in. Setting meaningfully constrains choice and charges the ending—this is a place built to enforce silence and isolation, and the snow and architecture directly shape his options (hidden walls, buried fortress, no music allowed). The recurring images of cobalt, frost, and snow mirror his internal paralysis and reconfigure at the end into “frostbitten hope” and the future thaw. A hair more use of the physical environment in the climactic choice itself (e.g., the risk or effort of tampering with the wall) could push it even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ancient temple library is vividly realized—marble corridors, forgotten grimoires, collapsing columns into dust—and its rules (lost in time, opening to the stars) meaningfully shape what can happen. The environment directly enables the rune’s construction (messages across ten thousand volumes) and charges the ending as the library dissolves once its purpose is fulfilled. Details are selective and tonally apt rather than touristic, with the space acting as both setting and mechanism. The only thing holding it from the very top band is that other senses beyond the visual are used sparingly.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ex–oil rig sea level station above drowned coastline, the gray Pacific, and the bleached reef create a tangible, thematically resonant environment. Setting is tightly filtered through a marine scientist’s eye (temperature logs, acidity, crystalline drives) and the station’s history as an extraction site turned monitor charges the premise. The “moored yet drifting” station and the “periodically eternal” tide directly inflect the final image and theme. The environment constrains her life and work more conceptually than through concrete on-page obstacles, which keeps it just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay and buried stone circle are vividly and economically rendered, with strong contrasts between industrial scaffolds and prehistoric monoliths. Sensory detail (dust motes, subsonic hum, ozone-and-rain taste) is specific and tightly filtered through Mira’s priorities as a barefoot stargazer. The environment matters: its abandonment enables the ritual, the stones’ presence under concrete literalizes “continuity beneath ruin,” and the gantries framing the sky charge the final image. Setting not only decorates but actively mirrors and supports the thematic and narrative turn.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    The volcanic hot springs are richly realized and functionally integrated: heat, minerals, and toxicity all shape what is possible, from the kite’s preservation to the precise thermal pool needed to dissolve the amber. Environmental detail is filtered through Mira’s priorities and plant-telepathy, so setting never feels like a static backdrop. The engineered sequoia’s designed role—knitting soil, filtering gases—charges the final image with future implications rooted in this specific place. This is an exemplary use of environment to constrain choice and charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    The arboretum on the cliff, the automated lighthouse, and the empty cottage are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the emotional arc. Environmental features actively constrain and charge choices: the cliff edge evokes the temptation to follow the others, the salt spray necessitates specific trees, and the automated lighthouse contrasts mechanized vigilance with human witnessing. Recurring objects-as-setting (the photograph, the contorted cypress) meaningfully charge the final image. The only small limit is that the weather/wind, while evocative, could bear even more direct pressure on choice to push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse library is richly imagined and active: rotting books, sea wind, bioluminescent threads, and the crushing stone fist all constrain options and drive her downward. Environmental elements like the scattered tarot, trapdoor, and inert lamp aren’t just mood; they directly shape her tactics and the ending image. The consistent marine-decay palette and circular architecture echo the thematic loops of memory and perception without feeling like blunt allegory. Setting is so integrated that changing the locale would dismantle the story’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    The wind-carved encampment and desert are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with theme: erosion lines as records of time, wind as an instrument that “plays him,” and the sandstone surface enabling the impossible ink behavior. Setting is not just backdrop; it’s the medium through which the experiment and transformation occur, and the final image of the encampment keeping its secrets is charged. Detail selection feels purposeful rather than touristic, and the environment’s constancy contrasts effectively with his temporal dissolution. The only limit is that the encampment’s physical constraints don’t quite force tactical choices beyond providing the stage.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cryogenic library under snow is vivid, tactile, and consistently filtered through Mara’s perception—the silence, subzero air, and buried facility all reinforce isolation and the stakes of hidden memory. Environmental elements constrain action (she’s alone, off-grid, reliant on dormant infrastructure) and charge the final image when silence “returns like a held breath.” Technical details about servers and permafrost feel plausible and integrated into action rather than touristic. A bit of descriptive density borders on ornamental, but overall atmosphere and specificity are strong and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: airship sandbag scraps, glass dome with spiderweb cracks, orange wasteland, and desert roses all filter through Maya’s sensibility. Environment and objects don’t just decorate; they constrain possibility (life is only tenable under the dome with repurposed scraps) and charge the final image (“airship sandbags, once used to drop death from above, now anchored life in the sterile sand”). The dome’s cracks, shudder, and light shifts mirror the precariousness of her project without feeling on-the-nose. This world feels specific, lived-in, and indispensable to the story’s meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “sound wave garden” is richly specific and fully integrated: sonic flora, infrasonic roots, and the echo pool all shape how Kael moves and what tactics he can use. The rail spike and echo pool function as micro-settings/tools that constrain choice, especially when he must voice silence to part sound and plunge the spike. Environmental change—garden withering, constellations scattering, sky going blank—directly charges the final image with cost. Description is dense but purposeful, with consistent world rules taught through action rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observatory above the clouds, brass telescopes, cloud layer, and squid ink create a vivid, textured environment that feels both fantastical and functional to her role and task. Setting is strongly filtered through Eleanor’s mindset—“orbits of regret,” the glass floor as lantern, the echoing observatory approving her resolution—so atmosphere and theme cohere. The recurring objects (observatory, telescopes, pen nib, charts) evolve into charged artifacts at the end when she places the pen in the museum display beside the corrected charts. While the world’s logistics are stylized, rules stay consistent and the environment clearly charges the final image and her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Laboratory of Lost Sounds, the glass dome, meteor hush, and the amber form a vivid, integrated environment whose properties directly shape options (archiving sounds, time-fold conditions, material anchor). Setting details are filtered through Elara’s sensory and professional priorities—frequencies, vibrations, archives—so the world feels both specific and thematically charged. A touch more spatial or tactile grounding of her immediate physical actions in the lab could raise immersion further, but as is, the setting meaningfully charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    The whispering grotto and lilac mist are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Mara’s sensibility, with acoustics and geometry doing real story work. Environmental features constrain and enable action: parabolic walls, tile seams, and mist-borne whispers all shape how she diagnoses and intervenes. The setting directly charges the ending image, with the mist spiraling in time with her breathing and the grotto’s loneliness resolved into “patterned silence.” A slight touch of decorative proliferation in color adjectives (lilac, violet, lavender, amethyst) keeps this just shy of the absolute top band.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and particular: vitrified sand, shattered sky, dry fountain, and mosaic crest all feel tactile and charged. Crucially, the stepping stone and tessera function as micro-setting that actively shape the renaming method and charge the final image. World details (atmospheric breach, northern bunkers) are sketched with economy yet suggest depth without exposition dumps. Environment and object recur and reconfigure meaning at the end, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Rialto, hedge maze, and mystic orchard are sensuously rendered and clearly located in space, with details like “apple trees hummed with the violet resonance of forgotten arias” doing double duty as worldbuilding and emotional tone. The garden is not postcard background; its concealment, season-defying jasmine, and central apple tree structure Mara’s access and Julian’s tactics. The recurring orchard/harvest imagery charges the final image of the coin “beneath the apple tree” as a site of future transformations. Setting rules (maze, after-hours theater, impending demolition) remain consistent and subtly constrain when and how this encounter can happen.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    The light painting studio, darkness, LED wands, and muscovite geode create a vivid, specific atmosphere tied tightly to Maya’s method and perception. Setting is consistently filtered through her artistic/ somatic lens, and objects (geode, radiator, safe-box, darkroom, vents) are used in action rather than as static décor. The final image of fractal light paintings revealing hidden spirals meaningfully charges both world and theme. Environment constrains and enables her tactics, though outside the studio the wider city remains more gestural than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    The coastal cave network is vividly rendered—tides whispering through limestone, brackish pools, bioluminescent fungi, and a starlight shaft all feel textured and specific. Details are filtered through Kael’s sensor-driven, emotionally attuned gaze, so environment and atmosphere are tightly fused. The elm leaf fossil as micro-setting object nicely charges the final image and functions as an anchor across time. The world rules around “energy that defied instrumentation” are sketched but consistent enough for this lyric-SF mode.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “amber warehouse beneath the western cliffs” is vivid, strange, and tightly woven into stakes and closure: the cliffs’ threatened collapse, the resin vaults, and the warehouse-lantern transformation all hinge on this environment. Objects-as-setting (hourglasses, jars, buttons, amber dust) constrain options and charge the final images; the cliffs shifting “to support the sky differently” is an excellent reconfiguration. Details are consistently filtered through Elara’s professional lens, making the world feel lived-in rather than toured. This is one of the story’s strongest dimensions.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Zephyr Bluff, the mist, and the “silver hush” are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elena’s perception, giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine. The snow is used functionally as a medium for codes and as the surface where the final arrow is pressed, so the environment lightly constrains action rather than serving as pure backdrop. Seasonal detail (late February, hints of spring) harmonizes with the thematic tilt toward repair. The setting could influence tactics and risk a bit more concretely, but it already charges the final image in a satisfying way.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: fog, river, gutters, pilings, and tollhouse all directly shape perception, options, and timing. Weather and sound (ticking gutters, absence of birds, fog density) function as instruments he reads rather than mere backdrop, culminating in the silence that greenlights the crossing. The ferry cable, water level, and “gloom-hill” geography give the scene a distinct, lived-in specificity. The environment clearly constrains choice and charges the final image, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    The oasis is vividly and specifically rendered: cracked clay cylinders, chimney smoke pressed flat, dried lavender, combs still thrumming, all filtered through Kai’s attention. The scorched wasteland vs. pocket of green materially charges the stakes and final image, and the lantern on the hive stand is inseparable from that environment. World rules about time and memory emerge through setting rather than exposition, and remain consistent. The setting shapes meaning far more than tactical options, but that fits the piece’s lyric, meditative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid and organically integrated: the fire escape garden, luminous harbor, and derelict lighthouse all feel tactile and lived-in. Environmental specifics (moonlight as fuel, the rusted ladder, the stilling harbor) meaningfully shape what is possible and charge the final image of the moon-powered beam sweeping the water. The recurring objects—the rosebush, boat, gauge tooth—anchor emotional shifts rather than serving as mere décor. At times the descriptive density edges toward luxuriant, but it largely serves atmosphere and theme rather than stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is rich, original, and tightly integrated: the tidal library, cloud-ocean, and stone circle all shape the mood and the mechanics of her attempt, not just the backdrop. Environmental elements (stratospheric currents, atmospheric rivers, subsonic hum) directly participate in the ritual and in the final understanding that the Sky-Singers are dispersed consciousness. The brass sundial functions as a micro-setting/object that constrains what she can do and charges the last image. On occasion, the density of description edges toward ornamental, but overall it powerfully supports tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lotus temple on stilts over the lily pond, the rain, and the nest are vividly realized and tightly integrated with character and theme. Setting constraints and enables choices: her physical perch above the pond mirrors emotional distance, the storm alters the environment to deliver the nest, the public courtyard and fountain make the installation legible and communal. Environmental evolution (storm, seasons, weathering, scattering twigs, thrushes’ return) tracks causally and charges the final image. The world feels specific and lived-in without excess exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    The university radio station is vividly realized—dust in sodium light, ancient equipment, cooling fans, rattling coffee cups—and it functionally constrains the plot by supplying the only plausible mechanism for town-wide interference. Technical details (transmitter capacity, subsonic generator, charts spread over the console) are integrated through Elena’s actions and priorities rather than as static description. The closing image of the station’s lights flickering then steadying nicely charges the setting with thematic weight. There’s still a little room for the environment to push back more directly (e.g., physical constraints during the climax), but it’s already doing strong work.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is richly realized and tightly integrated with action: breathing stone corridors, contracting chambers, the organ’s vibration traveling through bedrock, and the oculus’s starlight all shape what Maren can do and when. The “spatial mutiny” is not just decorative but an active hazard whose pulses constrain timing and movement. Tools and environment (the rotating gears, the compass point, the exhaling walls) directly charge the climax and final image. Description is dense but purpose-driven, with the catacombs and nexus feeling specific rather than generic fantasy architecture.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    The quarry is vividly realized—mist, wet shale, black pool—and it is not just decorative: it’s the original crime scene, shapes her physical movement, and mirrors the thematic extraction/restoration dynamic. Weather and terrain actively color her descent and the sense of risk and isolation. The setting’s violence-of-extraction history deepens rather than overstates the metaphor. The final image of the “awakening quarry” reinforces the emotional and investigative thaw, charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting and atmosphere are exceptional: the “spongey dread,” bioluminescent mold, and sweating glass create a suffocating, specific environment that constantly interacts with Elara’s actions. The experimental weather station and warped jet stream aren’t backdrop—they underpin the journals’ relevance and justify why her findings matter now. Environmental details (dripping condensation, spores colonizing equipment) organically mirror thematic rot and institutional neglect. The copper nail and the station together charge the final image and constrain what “reversing exile” can realistically mean.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is richly realized: mountain pullout, heat shimmer, ozone, pine, and especially the cliff-side scaffolding all feel tactile and specific. Environment isn’t ornamental—it literally maps the hitchhiker’s path, guides Elias’s ascent, and transforms at the end into “negative space of potential,” directly charging the final image. The glass flake functions as a micro-setting lens through which the world’s geometry is re-seen. At times the density of atmospheric description edges toward luxuriant, but it remains legible and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    The abandoned circus train is vividly evoked and tightly bound to theme—lions, rust, shattered roof, dining car, and engine all mirror transit, spectacle, and decay. The environment constrains choice (a secluded, marginal refuge that enables his retreat and then frames his departure) and charges the final image of him on the coupling in the dusk. Details feel selective rather than touristic, and the recurring bills as mapped across the train deepen atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    The observatory and night sky are concretely evoked (brass eyepiece, chilled dome, iron stairs, archival space), and the physical setting recurs to frame her realizations. The environment charges several key images, especially the pressed petals on the glass dome and the dawn light at the end, though it rarely constrains her options in a practical sense. Overall atmosphere and spatial clarity are strong and support the theme well.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the “swirling orchard vortex,” black water, sabre-like branches, and frozen confession all feel tactile and strange in a coherent way. Environment constrains action: she walks on the lake, must synchronize with the vortex, and physically cannot reach the ice block until she alters the spiral’s behavior. World rules around illusion, mirrors, and imprisonment remain consistent and are learned through what she does, not exposition dumps. The recurring objects (lake, orchard, vial) all charge the final still-water image with reweighted meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cobalt glade, humming trees, and rotating dusk are vivid and strongly integrated—roots literally constrain Elara, the glade’s impending shift creates urgency, and the intersection clearing is a concrete liminal node. Environmental specifics (cobalt grass, premature chronology, translucent stacked realities) are filtered through Elara’s sensations and goals rather than feeling like a catalog. World rules around time and the Accords are sketched economically yet consistently enough to support the scene. The setting also evolves with the action (roots retract, glade rotates), meaningfully shaping what the characters can do.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    The catacomb orchard is richly realized—foxfire fungus, bone-fed pear trees, and roots threading ribs charge nearly every paragraph. Environment is not just decorative; it literally constrains Elias at the end when the roots bind him and define his fate as part of the grove. The tarot/barter economy is inseparable from this specific setting, and the final image of him as a guardian within the orchard depends on it. A few atmospheric details are more ornamental than functional, which keeps this just under the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    The quarry office trailer and limestone valley are vividly realized and thematically integrated: wind as feedback, limestone swallowing and holding sound, the empty quarry as a post-applause arena. Setting details are filtered through Marcus’s sonic bias and roadie past, so environment and object (the cloth) feel lived-in rather than decorative. The space’s isolation and cheapness subtly mirror his exile and devalued expertise, and the final image of the valley holding all his loaded-in songs charges the closure. The setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, but it strongly shapes atmosphere and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.0)
    The magnetic arbor, auroras, and stratospheric setting are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elias’s scientific-historical sensibility. Environment is not postcard dressing: magnetic fields and altitude directly enable the seed’s activation and define the final image as he disperses into the aurora. World rules (levitation via atmospheric electricity, iron-laden branches) stay coherent and are learned through action, not infodump. The closing image of him dissolving into the magnetic dance above the clouds recharges the setting with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tidal atrium, wintersun, creel, and brass titan form a vivid, coherent environment that feels integral rather than decorative. Tides and moon phases are not just scenery; they literally structure the cycle of arrivals, constrain timing, and charge the final image of water lapping at iron feet. Sensory specificity (saltwater, cedar, old rain, pale gold light) is selective and purposeful, deepening mood and theme. The setting clearly charges the ending, satisfying the object-as-setting and environment-as-constraint gate.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    The crystal caves are vivid and tactile—“subterranean cathedral of calcite,” “hexagonal prisms,” thinning air—and consistently filtered through Elara’s professional and emotional lens. Setting is not ornamental: the geode structure, stalagmite, and resonant crystals are required for the ritual geometry and for the final eruption of latent radiance. Environmental conditions (altitude/air, mineral formations) guide her movements and the specific placement of pearl and shell. A slight check is that the caves almost verge on luxuriant description overload, but they remain tied to action and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    The station, ivy, piss-smell, swollen floorboards, and the patched accordion create a vivid, continuous environment that feels tactile and lived-in. Setting is not mere backdrop: it supplies the accordion, the bathroom graffiti, and the final image of ivy’s “slow conquest,” all of which charge the theme of slow, inevitable transformation. Sensory selection tracks her state—metal, water, decay—consistent with a river chronicler’s gaze. The setting does more atmospheric than constraining work, but it meaningfully charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is richly imagined and specific—the mist, living luminescence, breathing shelves, and floorboards of compressed starlight create a strong, coherent atmosphere. Crucially, the environment is not postcard-only: the mist expelling intruders, the glowing architecture’s cyclic reversal, and the silent corridors all constrain how she observes and documents. The library as a physicalized repository of unspoken words directly charges the final image of her being accepted as its documentarian. A slight trim of ornament would likely improve focus, but the world-building is already publication-caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    The observatory is richly and purposefully rendered—heat, velvet, jasmine, oaks, and ice all matter to the dilemma because the midsummer warmth makes the violin’s survival impossible and the plants/oaks provide the escape route. Sensory detail is specific and filtered through Elara’s sensibility (“mulberry jam,” “spectral veins”), and the environment evolves with events (temperature breach, increased weeping, water entering soil). The violin and plants operate as object-as-setting constraints, physically and thematically shaping what is possible. The density edges on lush, but it remains functional rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and tightly braided to the premise: the skyborne grotto, aurora as soul-residue, and quartz cathedral all feel integral rather than decorative. Environmental details (ionized air, crystal walls humming with chips, drifting through upper atmosphere) are filtered through Elara’s professional gaze and support the tone. The aurora meaningfully charges the final image when the chip pulses in rhythm with it, reweighting the lights from mere spectacle to vast graveyard. The only reason this doesn’t push into the 9-band is that the environment, while essential conceptually, never materially constrains her choices in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Umbral Grotto above a sea of clouds is vividly and consistently rendered, with textured specifics like ceiling-rooted trees, “vineyard hush,” and soil rich with the compost of souls. Setting is not mere backdrop; the root-ball soil and threshold function directly in the final act of planting and the sapling’s emergence. The recurring environmental motifs (clouds, bark, twilight) mirror his internal state without feeling like a tourism catalogue. A slight risk of overdescription and metaphor density keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse, Atlantic dampness, and wind give the piece a vivid, integrated atmosphere that is constantly in play rather than postcard backdrop. Setting elements actively constrain and enable choices: the height and breeze permit the cloak’s dispersal, and the chimes’ placement turns the weather into an oracle. The dawn light and horizon “softened into gray and gold” elegantly mirror the thematic move toward nuance without feeling over-literal. This is detailed and purposeful enough for elite work, just shy of utterly revelatory use of place.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is richly realized and inseparable from meaning: the floating rock, magnetic grotto, starlight, and pond are all active agents in the story’s logic. Environmental details (magnetism drawing his blood, suspension between earth and stars) directly mirror and constrain his liminal state and choices. The stone, pool, and grotto recur and are reweighted at the end as repositories of his teachings and as the medium of his backward-encoded wisdom. This world feels both strange and internally consistent, charging the final image with concrete specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    The canyon of endless echoes and bone towers is vivid, specific, and thematically aligned; the environment literally stores sound and history, charging the idea that movement disturbs a “harmonic field.” Setting meaningfully constrains choice—the realization that to move is to disturb and to remain is to conduct flows directly from the canyon’s nature. Recurring details (bone towers humming, centuries of dust, accumulated echoes) are integrated rather than postcard-like. The final image of him becoming another waypost within this architecture strongly reuses and reweights the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Icebound Spire, mist-walking lines, aurora, and freezing automation systems are richly realized and tightly integrated with character and theme. Environment materially constrains and enables choice: the mist requires trust, the ice and climate controls endanger him, and the keystone’s warmth creates a literal pocket of safety. The final image of the keystone weathering storms and melting snow in its own luminance charges the earlier descriptive work. Occasionally the density of description edges toward lushness, but it remains purposeful and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is a major strength: the decaying pier, the rusting Concordia, the impossible air-pocket library, and the lantern-lit harbor are vivid, specific, and tonally unified. Environmental conditions meaningfully shape what’s possible (the once-a-year lantern event, the flooded ballroom, the air pocket as a liminal physics break). Recurring objects-as-setting—the pier lamps, the sky lanterns, the key tag—charge the final image and theme rather than serving as postcard detail. The only limit keeping this from higher is that physical constraints of the wreck’s danger are more atmospheric than tactically pressing.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “ambered observatory deck” and viscous temporal medium are vivid, specific, and consistently re-used rather than ornamental. Setting details (coins settling in amber, hydrogen-line tuning, static as language) are tightly integrated with method and stakes. The environment constrains choice and charges the final image when the resin of spacetime “dilates outward.” A slight excess of conceptual description over concrete sensory variety keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory, telescope, cracked lens, dusk light, wax cylinders, and atlas are vivid, tactile, and strongly filtered through the reaper’s grief and vocation. Setting isn’t decorative: the architecture “remembers,” the cracked lens and scattered light are the literal mechanism of the ritual, and the dome’s interior charges the final image of him standing with his reframed scythe. World rules around light, memory, and sacrifice are consistent and learned through action. This is near exemplary environmental integration; the only check on a higher score is that the physical space constrains mood and method more than it forces difficult tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sapphire viaduct, salt-crusted basin, and condensation are vivid, specific, and tightly tied to the magic’s mechanics rather than feeling like decorative scenery. The setting actively constrains options: because there is no sea, only this viaduct’s seepage can supply the timing and residual water needed for her spell. Environmental details evolve (dripping rate increases with sun-warmth; water begins to pool beneath her) and charge the final image. This is strong, publishable-level atmosphere; the only thing keeping it just below the very top is that non-visual senses are present but not heavily leveraged under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vividly realized and deeply integrated: the drought-lowered reservoir, resurfacing town, mud of Mrs. Callahan’s garden, and the Blue Hour Saloon all accrue meaning as Elias moves through them. Environmental conditions (drought now, impending rains later) directly enable and time-limit his discovery, and the “mirrored hush” of water and sky charges the final star-reflection image. Details feel filtered through Elias’s professional and personal eye rather than touristic listing.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is lavishly rendered and tightly integrated: the waterfall as threshold, the hidden orchard as liminal lab/temple, the silver tree and multistate fruit all mirror the theme of simultaneous states and transformation. Environment shapes action (she must pass through the waterfall, place the horse in the tree, use the orchard as the crucible), and the final image is inseparable from place: “ancient freshness of the hidden orchard” outside normal time. Sensory specificity is strong across sight, touch, and even taste (“petrichor and possibility”). It just stops short of showing the setting materially constraining her options under real pressure—this is more ceremonial than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    The nocturnal arbor above the clouds is vividly and specifically rendered, with the sound-physics, cloud sea, and engineered sequoia all filtering through Elara’s professional perception. Environment meaningfully affects action: wind, vapor walls, landing grid, and altitude define what’s possible and why precision matters. The recurring attention to tools and materials (platform, cables, buckle) creates a micro-setting that feels lived-in and functional, not decorative. These details also charge the final image, where the same elements signify earned safety and exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating rock dojo amid a rewriting world is vivid and thematically apt, and it does more than decorate: it’s the stable liminal space where this identity negotiation can occur. The environment evolves meaningfully—world fracturing, sky becoming ocean, then stability at the end mirrors the inner arc. Details are selective but strong; the rock’s suspension and later stabilization charge the final image. A few more tactile anchors could deepen immersion, but it already serves the story’s logic and tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    The greenhouse on stilts above the brook, the storm, and the corpse flower itself create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that strongly matches the story’s conceptual concerns. Sensory details—ozone, fractured moonlight, putrid bloom—are selective and purposeful, leaning into the grotesque/beautiful tension. The micro-setting constrains meaning if not literal choices: the secluded nocturnal haven and the water’s whisper explicitly frame this as a protected space for radical experimentation, which charges the final image. Description occasionally borders on lush excess but remains clear and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    The echo chamber tunnel—obsidian, sweating condensation, amplifying every sound—is vivid and strongly tied to the premise of processing the unspoken. The environment constrains tactics: sound is the only medium available, and the chamber’s amplifying/macerating properties make his ritual possible. The pull cord and the tunnel’s physicality directly charge the final image as he fills the space with laughter and dissolves. A touch of density verging on ornate keeps this just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    The frozen garden, mist, crystallized roses, and book-bearing branches are vividly imagined and consistently filtered through the guardian’s sensibility. Setting and object-as-setting (garden, library, pendant) charge the final image: she literally becomes the garden/library and sleeps as a “native of the in-between,” with mist and frost now interior to her. The world’s rules remain stable and are learned via action (books growing from branches, mist being inhaled), not exposition. This environment doesn’t just decorate—it is the battleground and eventual architecture of her internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ember nexus, geothermal vents, obsidian floor, and twilight light are vividly rendered and remain active throughout, not just as backdrop but as the enabling tool for his work and the charged frame for the final image. Environmental specifics (heat thresholds, flame colors, the carbon glass lattice) are filtered through Marcus’s alchemical eye, which both grounds worldbuilding and supports theme. The closing image of the “frozen bloom” refracting twilight back through the transformed object is strongly tied to setting and reweights the entire scene. A very slight excess of descriptive flourish in places keeps this just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the suspended radio tower city, gorge winds, lunar perigee, and oscillators all feel tactile and specific, filtered through Elara’s technical-professional eye. Environmental conditions (the humming guy wires, hush radius, perigee-induced warming) directly affect what she can do and how, and the towers’ collapse into silence is both a physical and conceptual turn. The abandoned city and gorge charge the final image of latent transmission waiting to be correctly heard. World rules feel internally consistent, with detail density serving atmosphere and stakes rather than stalling them.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    The spectral grotto and sideways-time environment are richly, specifically rendered—“constellations that pulsed like bioluminescent jellyfish” and memories as sediment feel vivid and purposeful. Setting directly shapes tactics: Elias navigates by starlight patterns mapped to radio frequencies, and the grotto’s walls show parallel ferries to orient his goal. The empty hourglass functions as a micro-setting object that constrains choice and charges the final image once it fills with dust. A small weakness is that non-visual senses are less developed, but it doesn’t harm clarity or mood.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    The optical illusion gallery and its shifting, rule-bound impossibilities are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action: the environment is not wallpaper but the medium through which she works and ultimately dissolves. The final image of the space unfolding and seeping into the city recharges the earlier details, though the description leans slightly more on conceptual texture than grounded, sensory constraint, keeping this just shy of the topmost band.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    The benthic city, abyssal plain, and warped starlight dome are vividly and economically drawn, with details filtered through a professional navigator’s eye. Setting isn’t mere backdrop: deep-ocean pressure, oxygen limits, and the dome’s vantage actively constrain options and motivate the need for dimensional routes. The recurring anchor chain link functions as a micro-setting object that literally frames the stars and charges the final image. World rules around unfolded horizons and edge geometry feel coherent and integrated into action rather than encyclopedic.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mist-clad atrium, glass ceiling vanishing into fog, marble, and the seep of mist into the basement create a distinct, atmospheric space that feels integral rather than decorative. The museum-former-home setting reinforces the story’s concerns with memory, archival evidence, and trapped voices, and the atrium’s “threshold” role literally enables contact with the dead. Environmental details evolve with the action (mist thickening, then dispersing at midnight) and charge the final emergence into “the world where the mist could not follow.” The only slight shortfall is that the physical geography never constrains tactics in a concrete, problem-solving way; it’s more tonal and metaphysical than logistical.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and pressure-bearing: the causeway, tidal flats, and “concrete barnacle” facility are strongly imagined, and the flooding, ozone-stinking interior constrains her movement and psyche. The environment’s liminal state between tides and matter phases is not decorative—it’s the only reason she can reach the translated researchers and it actively charges the final image as the structure “began its return to the deep.” Detail selection stays purposeful and filtered through her anxiety, sustaining atmosphere without bloating.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.0)
    The opal observatory under snow is vividly realized and not merely scenic; cold and isolation enable the frozen-ink method, the moonbeam geometry, and the presence of an abandoned mainframe. Environmental details (opalescent fractures, snowdrifts burying windows, server hum) are threaded through action rather than paused description and directly shape her tactics. The final image—her wholeness beneath the opal glass and falling snow “like forgiveness”—charges both setting and theme. The environment materially constrains what’s possible and reappears at closure in a reweighted, resonant way.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, strange, and specific: fossilized ribs, towers of bone, and a canyon eroded by sound feel tactile and original. Environment is not ornamental; acoustics and material (porous bone, echoing tunnels) directly shape her tactics and enable the resolution. The final image—language living on as resonance within the bone towers—reweights the whole landscape as an archive and a prison at once. A slight risk of density overload is present, but clarity and atmospheric cohesion remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    The underground anti-gravity garden, bioluminescent fungi, and the phone-on-altar form a distinctive, lived-in environment that shapes the action: the cavern becomes the cocoon and later the sealed habitat for Elena’s new existence. Setting is tightly integrated into event (the garden blooming in response to the ritual, stone sealing the entrance) and charges the final image of her no longer needing the sun. Details are selective, vivid, and filtered through her scientific/mystic sensibility, though there’s a slight tilt toward ornamental lushness that just barely keeps this from feeling utterly inevitable in every line.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is richly imagined and specific—the sky-bridge, geometric orchard, clockwork fruit, and living statues are all integrated into action and stakes rather than serving as static backdrop. Environmental features (bridge cables, roots under concrete, statue patrols) directly shape Elara’s tactics and the revolt’s form. A slight tendency toward ornamental phrasing in a few images keeps it just shy of the highest tier, but the world feels coherent and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cobalt arcade, twilight, marble, and drone corridors create a vivid, coherent world whose rules surface through Marek’s practiced route and timing. The environment directly constrains tactics—the vaulted ceiling swallowing sound, the antique post boxes, and the temporary blind spot in drone patrols all shape what he can do and when. The thunderstorm bottle and drones interact with the space in tactile ways (ozone, wobbling patrols), and the final image of the arcade exhaling beautifully charges the setting with thematic weight. This is a richly specific, integrated setting that supports both action and mood without feeling like a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vividly realized and strongly filtered through his sensibility—rotting velvet, sequins like dried scales, the greenhouse car, and the birch forest all feel specific and atmospheric. The train’s architecture (impossible corridor, observation car turned oasis) shapes his path and makes the discovery possible, not just decorative. Recurring objects—the wind bells, halo fragment, mist—charge the final images and tie environment directly into the emotional arc. It’s lush but still purposeful, rarely slipping into museum-tour description.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Atheneum of Quantum Verses is vividly and inventively rendered, with the non-Euclidean architecture and scientific-poetry stacks integrated into action (her calculated trajectory, the shelves curving like Pringles, the hyperbolic fold). The setting isn’t mere backdrop; its geometry literally shapes what she can do and how she reaches the pocket dimension. The scarf as an analog object within a digital age works as a micro-setting anchor that charges the final image. World rules are consistent within the fantastical premise and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting and atmosphere are a major strength: the whispering archipelago, salt-rimed library, and dawn light feel specific, textured, and integrated with the premise. Environmental rules (islands whisper in a cipher of longing; dawn light can be painted and fixed) are consistent and learned through Elara’s actions. Crucially, the landscape constrains tactics—she must climb to the easternmost island at sunrise, and the archipelago’s silence at the end charges the closure image. The world feels coherent and lived-in without resorting to cataloguing or exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “shadowed nexus where seven roads converged under starlight” and the “hush of cosmic possibility” are vivid and consistent, with the singularity and roads meaningfully tied to the premise of trapped ideas and branching potentials. The setting responds to Vey (“shadows deepening into geometries that hurt to observe”), integrating atmosphere with action rather than acting as wallpaper. It does more to charge the mood and final image than to impose concrete constraints on her choices, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is vividly specific and omnipresent; environmental details (brine, iron ribs, glass dome, ship masts) aren’t postcard description but structurally matter through the Virgo/Spica constellation mapping. The setting constrains and shapes tactics—her wading, her observation angle, the annual solstice vantage—and charges the final image as the ring withers under that same dome. The atmosphere of submerged ruin and tidal time is consistent and thematically aligned with memory and loss.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    The forgotten library, the brass table, the samovar, and especially the empty playground swing create a coherent, eerie-yet-intimate atmosphere that supports the premise and the emotional arc. The swing outside is an especially strong recurring object that charges the final image when it finally stills as the child returns. The world’s magical rules (mirror shards, reversible exile, tea-leaf geometry) are consistent and conveyed through action rather than exposition. A touch more sensory variety beyond the visual and tactile could deepen immersion, but what’s here is precise and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting work is lush and purposeful: the “verdant parapet beside a waterfall” is not postcard backdrop but the functional threshold where essence can be captured and roots can span realms. Environmental specifics—the mist, spray, moss-covered stone, and gray lands—directly shape tactics and the final image of the rainbow tree as a bridge. Rules of this liminal world are conveyed through action (weaving between realms, drawing from the waterfall) rather than exposition dumps, keeping the atmosphere immersive. The richness edges toward maximalist, but it remains legible and thematically synced.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prism sanctuary and fractured starlight are vividly realized and tonally integral, with details like light splitting into “manageable colors” and bending around her at the end giving the environment real weight in the final image. Setting is strongly filtered through Mira’s sensibility, especially the idea of silence “pooling” and becoming physically crushing. While the sanctuary doesn’t heavily constrain tactical choices beyond atmosphere—it’s more metaphysical pressure than logistical—its properties (prisms, accumulated silence) are inseparable from the story’s logic and closure. A touch more interaction between environment and her physical tactics could lift this further.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    Setting work is a standout: the studio, the cathedral vault, the henge, and the subterranean chapel are all rendered with concrete, sensorial specificity (“rain-scoured fresco vault,” the smell of “limestone and decaying vellum”). Environmental constraints shape action—archival space enables the film discovery; the henge terrain and underground acoustics define what she can do and feel. The final torn-map image is charged by all this spatial work, giving the known/unknown boundary a material, not just metaphorical, presence.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Demeter as a “sunken ship library” is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Julian’s trained eye (light through portholes, floating spines, water as card catalog). Environment and tools (depth, pressure, rebreather, decompression stops) meaningfully constrain his options and shape the pacing of descent and ascent. The snow globe as object-as-setting is superbly charged and returns in the final image as the locus of unresolved memory. Overall the atmosphere is immersive and thematically aligned without feeling like a tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “misty courtyard above clouds” with pneumatic tubes, brass pipes, graffiti walls, and the obelisk is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elara’s mechanical-musical sensibility. Setting is not postcard décor: the obelisk houses the mechanism, the tubes “sing” at the end, the mist shapes the ghost’s attempted embodiment, and the charged air between lightning and thunder frames the liminal work. The flower press bolt plate as a micro-setting/object is especially effective, with its fossilized petals and hidden receptacle. World rules (pneumatic message system, encoded graffiti) feel coherent and learned through action.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    The icebound spire, frozen glass, cables, gas lamp, and cloud ocean are vividly integrated, not decorative; altitude-specific light is literally required to open the diary, and the final image of her between clouds and stratosphere is charged by that environment. The elevator’s vertical journey, the groaning tower, and the frost-fractured window all echo the thematic dualities of pressure/clarity and desolation/beauty. The recurring tools-as-setting (goggles, diary lock) are tightly tied to place and light. This is elite-level atmosphere that also constrains tactics, only just shy of 9-band due to the relatively safe, uninterrupted physical situation.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sky gondola, high-altitude currents, and cloud layers are vividly and economically evoked, with strong POV filtering through her professional gaze and emotional lexicon. Objects-as-setting (telescope, twine, snapped cable) are integrated into the environment and return meaningfully at the end. The atmospheric texture (indigo twilight, dusty starlight) supports theme without feeling like generic weather. Setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, but it decisively shapes the emotional and conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Great Oak Library is vividly imagined—oak grain as constellations, shelves like ribosomes, spiral stairs and domed ceiling—and consistently filtered through Elara’s tactile, pattern-based perception. The environment is not just backdrop; its rotting, condemned status and organic architecture shape what she can do (climb to the dome, paint the interior sky) and what is at stake when it falls. Weather and time of day interact with the space so that the final image of her leaving as dawn light hits both real and painted sky is charged. The oak-as-body metaphor quietly underscores the sense of a living setting being executed.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    The antique airship, observation deck, dusty hopscotch board, and starling murmurations are rendered with vivid, selective detail that feels integral rather than ornamental, and the environment directly enables the method of discovery (board + birds’ geometry). The worldbuilding around “stranded luminance” and the Aurora Archives is sketched through atmospheric description rather than expository dumping, which suits the piece’s lyric mode. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: the airship’s “sigh” and reconfiguration signal that this vessel and its skyborne world have shifted from relic to bridge. This fulfills the high-band requirement of environment meaningfully shaping options and the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and tightly interwoven with action: the frozen library above clouds, the permafrost staircase, and the hall of mirrors all shape what Elara can do and how she learns. Environmental change (ice thawing, clouds warming) directly reflects and amplifies the story’s core turn. The mirrors and sky-clock imagery charge the final image of the village below and the restored timekeeper. Sensory detail is rich but mostly controlled, giving the world a distinctive, coherent atmosphere that supports both plot and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific—twin suns, frostbitten apple orchards, and floating rock arches are integrated into the colony’s tactics and the nebula’s mechanics. The arches and atmospheric anomalies directly constrain and enable choices, making the environment functionally necessary to the solution. The butterfly garden and watering bell miniaturize the world into a charged micro-setting that carries through to the final image. Worldbuilding remains economical and consistent, with no major infodump drag.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    The hidden lighthouse, brass mechanism, “pane of hush,” and lighthouse beam together create a vivid, coherent environment that feels specific rather than generic. Setting details are tightly woven into action—the lighthouse beam shifts from warning to carrier of the lullaby; the pane of hush literally mediates between Elara and the collapsing universe. The world’s rules (cosmic mechanics expressed through a clock and beam) are consistent and legible at this length. While the lighthouse doesn’t strongly constrain tactical options, its transformation powers the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cliffside labyrinth, cursed orchard, mechanical birds, frost, and ravine vantage are vividly particular and tightly integrated with action, not just backdrop. Environmental rules (frost crystallizing pollen, narrow ledges, elevation) directly constrain tactics and shape the solution of using nuts as a visible map from below. Worldbuilding details like stone fruit, brass wings, and salt-crusted basalt are economical yet atmospheric, supporting the tone. It stops just short of 9+ because some description trends toward decorative flourish rather than further constraining choices in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    The braided ravine, schist underfoot, and silver ribbons of water are vivid, and the environment is inseparable from both theme and action. Setting is always filtered through Elena’s scientific-musical lens (surface tension, polymer analogies, symphonic foam), which deepens both character and atmosphere. Crucially, the ravine’s braiding logic and the chrysalis at the water’s edge directly shape her insight and the final image. The only minor limitation is that weather and physical constraints remain mostly neutral rather than adding additional resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glass orchard library above a sea of clouds is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elara’s quantifying gaze (distances of mist, shelf heights, margins and unwritten pages). Setting is not postcard-only: the floating void and glass “trees” materially relate to her method of measuring absence and slicing space to open the doorway. Recurring environmental details (clouds, shelves, margins) all reappear in charged ways, feeding the sense that the world’s geometry enables her transgressive act. The final image of the “infinite library that floated forever on clouds of unfinished tales” directly charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    The desert fortress after rain, tidal pools, red mud, and the coral-ice cathedral form a richly specific, sensorial setting that feels both strange and grounded. Environmental details are consistently filtered through Kael’s palate and emotional lexicon, tying space and weather to taste and memory. Crucially, the setting constrains the action: the rain produces the pools, which map the buried pavilion, and the pavilion’s cold and structure dictate how she engages with the remorse. The final image of the desert “resuming its dry sovereignty” and the pavilion lying emptied under the dunes meaningfully charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    The astronomical clock tower, stained-glass orrery, buried copper pipes, and frost-covered valley of grain elevators create a vivid, specific environment that’s integral to action, not mere backdrop. The tower’s mechanisms and the weight’s descent literally channel her song into the earth, constraining tactics and charging the final image when the weight strikes. The industrial-agricultural landscape mirrors the emotional stakes of isolation versus connection in a way that feels organic rather than over-declared. Spatial and world rules remain consistent and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    The moonlit canyon and the broken mirror create a strong, coherent atmosphere; images like the canyon “breathing” and the rising/falling floor effectively externalize her altered state. The environment is more than white backdrop—the 33-degree moon angle and descent into the canyon give the setting some functional role in tactics and closure. However, the canyon’s physical constraints rarely pressure her choices; it mostly serves as a poetic stage rather than an active constraint. Description is vivid and selective, if heavily visual and metaphor-dense.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific: the serpentine grotto, mist as “permeable membrane,” inverted gravity, and bioluminescent seeds all feel tactile and integrated with the action. Environmental rules (inversion window, threshold effects, latent blaze) shape what is possible and when, rather than serving as mere backdrop. Details are filtered through Elara’s specialized perception, which keeps them from reading like a tourist catalog. The environment directly constrains and enables choices, especially the single-hour inversion and the spatial warp of the mist, which charge both the middle sequence and the exit.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    The siskin alder grove, frost, porcelain insulator, rusted wire, and root system create a vivid, specific environment filtered through Elara’s tactile attention. The setting isn’t just backdrop: the insulator and tree anatomy literally channel the attempted sound, and the hedgehog/siskins modulate the sense of tension and release. World rules around the Great Hush are economical yet consistent, and the physical environment shapes her method (reading grain, bowing cracks). The final image of vibration through earth and attentive animals is strongly charged by this carefully built atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    The magnetic nexus and eclipse-tinted twilight are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action—the field alters legal chess movement, the twilight violet is unique to this place, and the environment’s physics drive the non-standard knight and bishop moves. World rules (obsidian pieces responding to magnetism, iron-bent light) are consistent and learned through Castian’s goal-directed attention. The recurring worry stone functions as a micro-setting object that literally splits and reconfigures meaning in the final image, strongly charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “shadowed workshop under stars,” telescopes, resonating table, and fireworks create a rich, coherent atmosphere that feels tailored to this premise. Setting is filtered through Elio’s sensibility—fireworks as “bright wounds in the sky” charging the theme of violence versus attunement. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain his options, but it meaningfully charges the final images of returned darkness and silence. This is highly publishable scene-setting, if not yet using place as a hard constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    The treetop village and arboreal micro-ecology are vividly and purposefully rendered, with details like “between the village’s seventh and eighth platforms” and the humidity-collecting hollow directly constraining where and how she can plant. Sensory specificity—especially smell, but also motion and texture (“moss grew thick as velvet,” “bridges creaked and platforms settled”)—creates a strong lived-in atmosphere. The environment thematically mirrors her goal to cultivate serenity within motion and charges the final image of invisible currents carrying wisdom and scent. This is a richly realized setting that meaningfully interacts with character and stakes rather than serving as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is vivid, original, and tightly woven into action: floating arches, upward rivers, bioluminescent groves, and inversion mechanics all constrain what Kael can do and when. Details like magnetic clamps, mossy undersides, and rivers-as-pathways feel lived-in and goal-directed rather than touristic. The environment directly shapes both the journey (navigating by water flow to the convergence) and the escape (riding the reversing flow back down). This charged, specific world underwrites the final image of orchards “singing with the echoes,” making setting central to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    The container labyrinth, toxic fog, crystallized residue, and blast-scarred HAZMAT container are vividly rendered and tightly bound to the investigative action. Environmental geometry doesn’t just decorate; it literally shapes wind channels, the helicopter’s fatal wind shear, and Maya’s reconstruction of events. Sensory detail and professional perception are well-filtered through her role, avoiding generic disaster imagery. The setting decisively charges the final realization about “the precise geometry of tragedy.”

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.8)
    The ice cavern, aurora, and bells form a coherently charged environment, richly rendered across senses and always filtered through Elara’s synesthetic perception. Setting is not postcard; it dictates method (bells and resonance in ice), positions (under the central spire), and closure (“molecular memory,” aurora as messenger, wonder encoded in the field). World rules around light, sound, and ice stay consistent and feel intentionally patterned. The only restraint on a higher score is a slight tendency toward decorative flourish in a few descriptive lines that do not add new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Thunder-echo range and canyon hush are vividly rendered and integrated into action—the silence, trapped thunder, and talus slopes all shape how the ritual feels and unfolds. The setting is not just backdrop: the range responds, vibrates, sighs, and literally embodies the cost and result of her work, with the final image of a healed, “avalanchingly quiet” range charged by what has changed. The recurring objects (driftwood markers, gilded flute) function as environmental tools that constrain and enable her choices. A minor drawback is a slight tendency toward density of description that occasionally leans into ornament rather than additional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    The topaz workshop, amber glass, Vandercook press, halo fragment, and vanishing stars create a distinct, embodied setting with strong atmosphere and clear spatial anchors. Objects (press, type, halo, skylight) recur and charge the final image, especially the last star’s disappearance and the halo’s “cold, precise light.” The environment meaningfully constrains options—this is a sealed, almost alchemical lab where the only available tools are those of printing and celestial detritus—without lapsing into museum-tour description. A slight tendency toward ornamental density is the only thing keeping this just below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.3)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway and permafrost are vivid and specific, and the recurring pendant functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. Environmental elements (aurora frequencies, frozen soil) are not just decorative; they directly enable the germination and gathering of travelers. The atmosphere is consistently otherworldly but grounded in tactile details like gravel, frozen soil, and dust-covered boots. While the setting could influence choice even more (e.g., harsher constraints), what’s present is strong, coherent, and thematically apt.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    The quartz arbor, mist, and frost-limned sedan are vividly rendered and carry a distinctive, coherent atmosphere that matches the story’s aims. Setting is not static decoration: the quartz’s humming and its cessation define the experimental window, and the frost, car, and prism together constitute the working apparatus of the magic. Environmental details (sublimating ice, mineral trees “leaning closer”) evolve in response to the action and charge the final image of the cleared window. This is rich, purposeful worldbuilding that feels specific rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    The orchard and bamboo forest are richly evoked—“sunlight fell only in silver needles,” skeletal apple trees, rotting fruit—and the environment clearly mirrors and deepens the themes of isolation, decay, and hidden continuity. Setting is filtered through Maya’s craft and obsession (amber sap, loom under apple trees), which keeps it from feeling like a static backdrop. The final image of the silent orchard and suspended bead is strongly charged by the established place. While the environment doesn’t rigidly constrain physical choices, it meaningfully charges tone, options, and the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.5)
    The orchard planet, floating magnetic arches, and honeycombed mine shafts are vividly rendered and consistently threaded through Elara’s perceptions and actions. Setting is not mere backdrop: the magnetic ore explains the arches, the shafts literally shape her route and access, and the arches’ groaning and later humming mark the pressure and the resolution. The recurrent images of ash-gray soil, apple trees, and silver-green shoots tightly charge the final scene. A touch more sensory variety (sound/smell/tactile under stress) could push this into truly exceptional territory, but it already feels rich and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    The abandoned spaceport repair bay and the sensory topology are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elara’s professional perception (“bulkheads that existed in five dimensions simultaneously,” “smelled of ozone / tasted of copper”). The shard functions as a charged micro-setting that constrains her choices and strongly charges the final image when it dissolves into her. Environmental rules (parallel bays, iterated universes) remain stable enough to support the lyric mode. The only thing holding this just shy of the highest band is that the bay’s physical constraints rarely force hard tactical decisions; it shapes mood and metaphysics more than concrete options.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lighthouse and haunted lantern room are richly realized and always filtered through Elara’s sensibility—rust as “coastal flowers,” shadows needing protection, gulls avoiding a window—all of which deepen character and mood. The environment constrains behavior (she times visits to lamp failure; she delays relighting to sustain the sanctuary) and directly charges the final image of the ghost holding the jar to dawn light. Recurring objects (lamp, jar, sea glass, stones) function as micro-settings that shape choices and closure. Description is dense but purposeful, with a consistent, lived-in sense of place rather than postcard backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.3)
    The emerald lighthouse is vivid and omnipresent: its green stones, windows, and elevated position over a “barren digital landscape” continually shape the imagery and the final stakes. The setting is not just backdrop but an apparatus for the work—the height, the lantern room, the colored walls, and the stars all feed into how light and shadow behave. The final image of the lighthouse as “a green flame laughing against the stars” recharges the earlier description meaningfully. World details about the post-print era are economical but purposeful, anchoring the thematic stakes without info-dump.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating rock tea house and mist-veiled valley are vivid, sensorial, and consistently filtered through her professional and emotional lens (light, pigment, gravity, height). Setting is not postcard: the floating rock’s gentler gravity, rotation, and altitude meaningfully shape her tactics (coming here to track sun trails) and reconfigure the ending (“not escaping the earth but illuminating it from above”). The blue morpho wing functions as a micro-setting object that constrains her actions—moving, studying, pressing it to her sternum, then releasing it—and decisively charges the final image. World rules (magnetic tether, drifting rock) are sketched with just enough coherence not to distract from the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the labyrinth of petrified heartwood, shelves of quantified sorrow, and the central tree in the stormlit tower all shape what Elara can do and how. Moonlight and stormlight are not decorative; they enable healing and the sextant’s focusing, directly charging the final image. Details are selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara’s maintenance mindset rather than feeling like a museum tour. The world’s rules (dreams as vapor-trails, sorrow as fertilizer) remain internally consistent and are revealed through action.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, strange, and integral: the alchemical orchard, glass walls that refract darkness, and mica window all shape what is possible and charge the final image of dawn breaking in a greenhouse. World rules—endless night, bioluminescent flora, trapped starlight—are consistent and conveyed through action rather than exposition. The environment directly constrains tactics (she must work within the greenhouse, through mineral glass and alchemical trees). A slight further tethering of sensory detail to Elara’s body under pressure could push this into truly exceptional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    The Athenaeum beneath Grand Central, the janitorial-closet entrance, green glass lamps, and marble floors create a vivid, specific environment that feels lived-in and tonally apt. The hidden architecture and peephole meaningfully constrain tactics—he can watch and help without revealing himself—and the hidden-in-plain-sight motif charges the final image of the open door. Detail is economical and filtered through Elias’s sensibility, avoiding tourist-like cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is rich and integral: the secret tea house and overgrown palace courtyard are not just decorative but the physical substrate of Mara’s tactics (guerrilla gardening, hidden gatherings). Details like the rusted gate, dying elm, wisteria, and cracked marble all feel filtered through her attention to slow decay and regrowth. The environment constrains choices (secrecy, illicit planting) and charges the final image of a sanctuary “where people brought seeds instead of prayers.” A slight risk is density—description is lush enough that another venue might call it almost too ornamental, but here it mostly serves theme and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    The frozen library above the clouds, quartz hush, and ice-entombed spires create a distinctive, vividly textured environment that strongly supports tone and theme. Environmental conditions (frost, altitude, great cooling) mirror the Fading and the emotional cold of irreversible loss. While the setting does not strongly constrain specific tactical choices, it decisively charges the final image of Elara alone with her clear slide in the glacial silence. The worldbuilding details (photonic vows, atmospheric settlements) are integrated smoothly without feeling like exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    The pirate market under the rotting pier is vividly rendered through smell, sound, and texture, and consistently filtered through Mara’s practiced gaze. Environment shapes her choices: shadows and stalls enable her false starts, the truce of hush and the tide/dawn clock constrain what can happen when, and the rotting infrastructure provides cover and angles. The recurring physical world—barnacles, lanterns, creaking pilings—also charges the final image of her emergence. This is publish-ready scene work with purposeful, not decorative, detail.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: the lavender bluff, aurora, fungal-voting forests, and photosynthesizing cities all feel of a piece and are filtered through Elara’s sensoria. Environment directly shapes stakes—the forest election literally decides whether humans keep their weather—and charges the final image with the aurora brightening and the land’s “approval.” World rules (Atmospheric Bonding, sentient biosphere) are learned through observation rather than dump, and “terrestrially cosmic” becomes a coherent atmospheric principle. It’s lush but purposeful, with place and ecology doing real story work.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vividly rendered and tightly integrated: the “auroral sorrow” of the crystals shapes mood, the specific light spectrum reveals the watermark, and the deeper gallery of singing crystals charges the final image. The environment constrains options (isolated tourist trap, after-hours solitude) and then supplies the transcendent alternative to her life on the surface. Some phrasing edges toward decorative lushness, but the setting meaningfully shapes both tactics and climax.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    The greenhouse city under a toxic sky is richly evoked and integrated into action—sealed vents, hydroponic forests, condensation catchments, and glass domes all constrain how people live and how the quest proceeds. The gilded leaves, postal plates, and rusted vault door function as charged objects rooted in this world rather than generic ornaments. Environmental detail often mirrors or pressures the stakes, especially the humidity, rust, and rising groundwater around the vault of “preserved” words. A slight excess of atmospheric phrases edges toward lushness, but clarity and specificity are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is richly imagined and tightly integrated: the whispering bluff, thin air, thermal pocket, and directional winds all directly affect what Elara can build and how it functions. The iceberg fragment and the bells are not static décor; they participate in the final image (ice refracting sound into visible spectra) and embody the thematic stakes. Environmental details are filtered plausibly through her sensory priorities as a tuner attuned to vibration. The only limitation is that the physical hardship of the environment is more hinted than used to constrain choice in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    The glass-domed desert rose farm is not decorative: the dome’s fragility, quadrants, ventilation shafts, and external desert all materially shape the controlled-burn tactic and the cost calculus. Environmental change (magnetic flux scrambling roots, fire’s heat vented outward, smoke mapping “neural pathways” on glass) evolves in step with the conflict. Setting details are vivid but selective, filtered through Kael-9’s caretaker eye and its profession-level familiarity. The environment also charges the final image of half-burned, half-blooming land under a scarred yet intact dome.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    The courtyard, dawn light, construction noise, and specific sites (flower cart, bakery, mailbox) create a vivid, continuous environment that feels lived-in rather than touristic. Environmental pressure is not merely decorative: the approaching demolition and the physical presence of the mailbox and foreman actively shape urgency and behavior at the climax. Recurring dust/sand/silt imagery ties atmosphere to theme, even if it edges toward explicit symbolism. Spatial choreography remains clear despite a small crowd, and the setting meaningfully charges the final image of the paused construction crews and bowed foreman.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sunken laboratory is richly and precisely rendered: dripping water, brass bowls, bioluminescent fungi, rusted centrifuges, and shallow puddles all feel tactile and coherent. Setting is integrated into action—she dances through puddles, weaves between broken equipment, and the submerged, hidden nature of the lab embodies the regime’s attempt to drown memory. The environment charges the final image: depths vs “floating future” and the bridge between drowning and breathing. A slight check is that the setting rarely constrains her choices in an urgent way; it’s more symbolic and atmospheric than adversarial.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The salt crystal growing chamber, gravity pockets, and subsonic whale song create a striking, immersive environment whose rules are consistent and learned through action (adjusting her gait, exhuming in shifting gravity). Setting is tightly fused to concept—salt as a vault for memories—and charges the final image of her returning topside knowing what lies “in the gleaming silence below.” Environmental features do constrain behavior, though mostly at a textural rather than tactical level. This is elite-level atmosphere and specificity, just shy of utterly transformative constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    The nocturnal brook setting is vividly rendered and sustained—moonlight on the water, cricket song, reeds, mud between her toes—giving the scene a strong atmospheric spine. The brook and surrounding haven are not just backdrop: the water becomes the stage and medium for the wing and thus for her working, and the final image of hush settling into the soil recharges the setting thematically. Sensory detail is primarily visual and aural but purposeful and consistent with the story’s lyric aims. At a prestige level, one might want the physical environment to pinch her options more directly, but it still substantially charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Art Deco building, rooftop garden, and meteor showers are not just pretty backdrops; they’re the medium through which language, time, and the dead are made tangible. Details like “cornice brackets” as questioning pronouns and cracks as text feel both architecturally plausible and thematically integral. The rooftop under meteors becomes the necessary stage for the final sentence-sealing act, charging the last image. Description remains selective and filtered through Maya’s obsession, avoiding museum-tour excess.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    The velvet garden, silver moss, bioluminescent petals, and crystal lattice are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Elara’s perception, creating a coherent, immersive atmosphere. Crucially, the garden is not mere backdrop: it is the archive medium, responds physically to her work, and charges the final image as a “botanical library of sorrow” and sanctuary. The density of description verges on lush excess but remains purposeful and integrated with action and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, and stalactites are vividly rendered and recur with evolving meaning—especially the “pearl twilight” that makes midnight feel like dawn and then dissolves into grey at closure. Setting is not mere backdrop; isolation, cold, and the altar’s hollow space concretely shape her methods and the concealment of the document. Objects (the heritage thorn, obsidian seal) function almost as micro-settings, constraining and enabling her choices. The consistency of environmental rules and imagery grounds the lyricism in a believable physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    The canyon nexus, starlight, and cosmic hum are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the story’s mechanics (acoustic geometry, geological consciousness, the shell as a ley-map). Setting is consistently filtered through Mira’s sensibility, and the environment—stone, resonance, convergence of canyons—directly enables the climactic ritual. Recurring objects (the shell, canyon walls) charge the final image. The physical space is clear and textured without feeling like a static postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glacier shrine, candlelight, and “borrowed starlight” through ice walls create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels integral rather than decorative. Environmental specifics (cold, groaning glacier, reflective ice) are consistently filtered through Elara’s focus on ghosts and truth, and the shrine reads as an aptly liminal space between worlds. The recurring snow globe functions as a charged micro-setting object whose altered physical state is reinterpreted at the end, clearly charging the final image. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain tactics, it meaningfully shapes tone and the sacred, painstaking quality of her work.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    The parapet after rain, fireflies, moon paths in puddles, and the net itself create a dense, lived-in micro-setting that constantly interacts with Kaelen’s attention and choices. Environmental details are not postcard ornament: drying stone quiets the parapet, moonlit puddles teach “paths,” and a single firefly literally reveals a missed tear, altering her immediate task. The bamboo whisk functions as a tool-as-setting, charging the final image as she descends. Atmosphere and specificity are both high and thematically aligned, with the world’s texture inseparable from the piece’s meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    The wasteland orchard, iron-skinned trees, amber dust, and circling radioactive storms are vivid, specific, and consistently integrated into the action. The environment directly shapes stakes and options: the orchard’s anomalous calm motivates the investigation, the storm ring embodies the stillpoint, and its expansion at the end charges the final image. Scientific worldbuilding (biological stillpoint, flawed containment diamond) feels coherent with the setting rather than bolted on. A slightly deeper tactile engagement with the space during the climax could push this toward the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory, storm, altitude, and cobalt glass are richly realized and integral: the geometry of light and lightning-struck dome constrain how Elian can act and literally enable the ritual. Environmental details (“cobalt glass portico,” “aluminum ribs of the dome,” “hail drummed…portico singing”) are filtered through Elian’s obsessions and recur meaningfully in the final cobalt rain. Description occasionally verges on luxuriant, but it remains purposeful and tied to action. The setting clearly charges the final image and is not mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Atlantic wind, dunes, derelict coast guard station, and “feral loft” give a vivid, textural sense of place that is inseparable from Elias’s exile and self-chosen isolation. The jars, ladder, and hidden floorboard function as micro-setting elements that directly shape action (climbing up, uncovering the music box, surrounding it with jars). The environment clearly charges the final images: he leaves the wild loft for the highway, carrying its “lonesome splendor” inside him. The only thing holding this just shy of the top band is that the physical environment doesn’t actively constrain tactics beyond mood and symbolic isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    The drift-ice marina, killing cold, and towering lighthouse are rendered with vivid, specific sensory detail, and the ice and weather meaningfully constrain options (she cannot outrun the hunters across shifting plates, so must use the tower). Environmental elements like the fresnel lens, horn, and resonant chambers are not mere backdrop but functional tools in the climax. The cold, fading light, and frozen harbor also mirror the piece’s liminal theme—between living/dead, logic/emotion—without feeling like blunt symbolism. A touch of descriptiveness verges on lush, but it remains purposeful and integrated with action.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, magnetic valley, and moon paths are sensuously and coherently rendered, with details filtered through Elara’s professional and spiritual attentiveness. Environment is not decorative: the charged lake, iron-rich cliffs, and timing of freeze directly constrain options and enable the escape. Spatial relations (sanctuary → ice → ridge) stay clear and matter to the stakes of the crossing. The final image of the receding sanctuary and continuing moon path recharges the setting with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    The subway maintenance tunnel and drought-shifted Victorian station are vividly evoked and feel specific rather than generic, with tactile mud, runoff channels, and rail vibrations. The environment is not just backdrop: the drought’s structural damage and the hidden Underground Railroad station are integral to the body’s emergence and the institutional failure. The lantern as object-as-setting meaningfully charges the final image. A bit more direct physical constraint from the environment on her choices could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.3)
    The shop, storm, and the brass mechanism are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility, and the weather shift is nicely tethered to the inner and thematic turn. The recurring object-as-setting (clockwork heart/music box guts) grounds the atmosphere and charges the final implications. The environment does lightly constrain choices (intimate, slow space; sheltered from the storm) but mostly serves as resonant backdrop rather than an active tactical constraint. A touch less generalized “storm” language and one more concrete, choice-shaping detail would elevate this further.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly particular—acid sea, rusted chains, brass monstrosity, calcifying workshop—and always filtered through Kip’s work and curiosity, not as static wallpaper. Crucially, the environment and tools (the suspended cart, central cogwheel, sea-tear kaleidoscope, arrow tip) constrain and enable action, then charge the final image (arrow-tip-as-clapper above the acid waves). World rules are weird but internally consistent, and the atmosphere of corroded, evolving machinery underwrites the thematic preoccupation with evolution and longing. This is vivid, economical worldbuilding that earns its density.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.5)
    The archive environment is conceptually vivid (deleted photographs as “digital snow,” quantum server core, cooling systems) but remains largely visual and abstract rather than tactile or constraining. We rarely feel Elara’s body in the space or see the machinery limit or shape her choices. The Hermes IX patch and the servers hint at a rich physical world, yet the story doesn’t linger on how that world functions under pressure. Setting enhances mood and idea more than it structures action.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse-orchard above grinding ice floes is vividly realized and not merely decorative; the physical configuration (height, roots, engines, ice below) directly shapes both the dilemma and the solution. Vintage mirrors in the apple trees and the aurora are woven into action, not just atmosphere, culminating in the focused light that resolves the crisis. Environmental specificity is consistent and coherent, with no spatial confusion. The setting strongly charges the final image of the whole crystal and warming lighthouse, satisfying the object-as-setting gate.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered and tightly integrated, from “bergs groaned against the pylons” to the “ice sang its ancient, cracking lullabies” at the end. Weather and environment (cold, wind, ice, water) shape what’s possible and deeply color her perceptions, directly feeding the central quest for the sound of endings. The parasol tip functions as a micro-setting object that carries lineage and charges the final image when pressed against her heart. Description remains purposeful and filtered, never feeling like a tourist catalog despite the richness.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and specific—amber pavilion, skeletal vines, diesel bus, autumn light—and it’s consistently filtered through a vintner’s priorities. Environment and recurring objects (pavilion, vines, soil, bus station) strongly charge the final images: composting letter, empty station, walking the rows. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical tactics, it deeply shapes perception and closure, which is appropriate for this lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is a major strength: the murmuring pavilion, kinetic parapet, conjured clearings, and desert atmosphere are vivid, coherent, and filtered through her specialized perception. Environmental rules—truth awakening the parapet, clearings accessible only via peripheral attention, the desert’s hunger—are consistent and actively shape tactics. The final image of the buried machinery holding wisdom and the pavilion’s faint harmonic is charged by these recurring environmental elements. It stops just short of 9+ because, while beautifully textured, the setting’s constraints could bear even more directly on a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: lavender field, rusted factory, and climbing vines are not just pretty but track time, mood, and thematic reclamation. Environmental detail is consistently filtered through Elara’s work—photos laid among stalks, scent seeping into images—so atmosphere and action are entwined. The factory/field contrast strongly charges the final sense of “sacred ground.” It stops just short of 9-band only because the environment never quite constrains a concrete choice; it frames and echoes rather than forcing tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    The library is richly and specifically rendered—lichen on leather spines, limestone echoing footsteps, dust motes like commas—and every major action is inseparable from this environment (her testing books, tracing lichen grammars, positioning the crystal in dawn light). World rules about language, spores, and sonically reflective stone/crystal are conveyed through embodied interaction rather than exposition. The setting strongly charges the final image and thematically echoes the living-language premise, though it constrains choices more conceptually than through concrete physical limitation, which keeps it just shy of the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integral: fog sculptures, unwatched videotapes, and driftwood markers are not just décor but extensions of memory and time, culminating in the spiral amphitheater and charged clearing. Environmental rules stay consistent and are learned through action (sculptures shift when he isn’t looking, the arrows guide him inward). The garden and its objects directly shape tactics and the final image—he is literally circled and pointed at by his own tools. It stops just short of the very top band because, while rich, the physical constraints of the environment don’t force difficult trade-offs beyond orientation and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lunar observatory above a permanent cloud sea, the thin air where “stars whisper,” oxygen gardens where trees grow sideways, and the trembling clock room all feel tactile and specific, and they’re consistently filtered through Elara’s technical and aesthetic gaze. Environment and objects (observatory, dome, clock, plate camera) concretely constrain what she can do and culminate in the final image of the camera on the tripod and the leaf in the manual, charging closure. World rules stay legible within a mythic-science frame; the observatory’s transformation into something that “breathes with the sky” reweights the setting in a resonant way. The density of description is high but purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    The Cloudhaven Hospice above the clouds is vividly rendered and feels integral, not decorative: glass walls, thin air, brutal sunlight, and the storm below all mirror the liminal, suspended state of the scene. The environment directly charges key images, especially the “scent of hope” rising from the valley and the gust of wind rattling the glass at Hale’s last breath. The broken record shard and the tuning fork work as micro-setting tools that shape action and the final tableau. Description is dense but purposeful, consistently filtered through the scene’s emotional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle, the brass railing, frost, and the frozen orrery are vivid, integrated details that shape action and metaphor (she literally walks the loop of the machine to close a temporal loop). The environment constrains her method—she must use this specific apparatus and its geometry—and the persistent noon on the horizon charges the final image. World rules around the bending event and the floating isle are consistent and learned through her interaction with tools rather than expository dumping. Setting and object-as-setting (orrery, key) do real narrative work rather than functioning as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    The hedge maze, impossible-geometry roses, iron-and-lilac scent, and orbital garden around the yew create a vivid, specific atmosphere anchored in Elena’s perceptions. Setting is not mere backdrop: the maze-as-constellation and the hidden roots under the yew charge the final constellation/teeth imagery and the idea of lost things in orbit. Environmental constraints on action are light—the garden doesn’t much limit tactics beyond providing a secret, liminal space—but the place meaningfully shapes tone and thematic frame. Overall, it feels textured and deliberate rather than postcard-like.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    The grotto is vividly realized—“serpentine,” “mineral tears,” mist, ceiling fissures—and every environmental element is filtered through Mira’s star-obsessed perception. Setting constrains options (no open sky; reliance on narrow star beams) and enables the tactic of reflective amplification, directly informing the pearl’s creation. The final image recharges those details as the grotto fills with silver-blue warmth, revealing “delicate ferns” and making the underground world feel transformed. Description flirts with luxuriance but remains purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    The abandoned data center turned moss garden is vivid, tactile, and wholly integrated with Elara’s psyche, from moss in vents to calcium trails as “constellation.” Setting actively shapes choice: she reads the icicle-drip spiral to decide where to place the pendant, and the digital/vegetal environment underwrites the theme of composting grief. The final images—servers as manuscript, dripping ice as punctuation, amber teaching “golden grammar”—are charged directly by the environment. A slight trimming of descriptive density in a few places could increase sharpness, but as-is this is near top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “feral nexus in mist” and prowling abandoned narratives create a vivid, specific atmosphere that matches the metafictional premise. Environmental details—mist, trees, wet earth, glowing shell—are integrated into action (kneeling, arranging cameos, pressing the shell) rather than pasted on. The setting also subtly shapes stakes: it’s a sanctuary from “noise of completed plots,” making her choice to remain there meaningful. Some elements stay abstract (how these narratives “prowl” in practice), but overall the world feels coherent and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    The verdant arbor, crushed mint, old magic, and canopy of wisteria create a vivid, sensorially rich environment that feels lived-in and tonally exact for a sacred, half-forgotten ritual. The chronometer, altar, and vine function as a micro-setting/ritual apparatus that shapes what she can do and when, and the harvest moon’s light literally and symbolically charges the transformation beat. World rules about the First Grove and roots that once “sang to the sky” are consistent and embedded in action rather than dumpy exposition. The final image of growing things stretching toward the light is strongly charged by all these environmental details, even if the setting rarely constrains tactical choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    The crater-orchard setting is exceptionally vivid and particular—the polar night, fossilized trees, and permafrost all feel lived-in and tonally integrated rather than decorative. Crucially, the environment constrains and charges the ritual: the extreme cold slows her pulse “to a whisper,” preserves permafrost roots, and allows phosphorescent liquid to freeze on contact, so the world’s physics are meaningfully tied to the magic. The aurora and magnetosphere’s pause and later release are tightly woven into the story’s temporal and emotional cadence, culminating in the concentric ripples that mirror her mandala. This is atmosphere doing real narrative work rather than postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    The marble cavern / Echo Garden is vividly rendered and integral: marble veins, fissures, acoustics, and light angles all directly constrain Elias’s methods and enable the solution. The impossible acoustics and wounded geometry are not postcard details; they define the rules of the device and charge the final exhale when the cavern’s voice returns. Sensory detail is rich but purposeful, filtered through a professional’s eye rather than tourist catalog. This is excellent environmental integration, just shy of transcendent because the physical danger or constraint never sharpens into real peril.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bronze grotto, fissured roof, starlight shaft, and shingled hush create a dense, coherent atmosphere filtered strongly through Elara’s perception. Setting elements are not mere backdrop: the grotto’s bronze walls, apertures, and cardinal scratches determine how she orients, how starlight falls, and where calcified patterns are stored, directly shaping her methods. Weather/season (snowmelt, thawing world) and the grotto’s exhalation at the end charge the final image and reinforce the cyclical, ritualistic frame. Description occasionally skirts excess, but it remains purposeful and world-defining rather than list-like.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    The loft, rain-beaded skylight, ash wood, and kettle are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Mara’s sensibility as a circus widow and woodworker. Environment and objects meaningfully charge the final image: the rain-streaked glass “crystallizing time,” the ash handle, and the cleared skylight all reweight grief and survival. The setting isn’t postcard-static; the shifting light and rain mirror the emotional progression. This is high-level scene-anchored atmosphere, just shy of exceptional only because the imagery sometimes edges toward decorative density.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is vivid, original, and tightly braided with theme: a kinetic lagoon above the clouds, aerial carousel, violet mist, and sound-capturing camera all echo the story’s concern with stalled motion and recycled time. Environmental details are filtered through Mara’s perceptions and her trade—whispers clinging to sleeves, waters freezing into “crystal narratives.” The rules of the place (stories as currency, mechanism halting and restarting) are learned through action, not exposition, and the carousel/lagoon directly charge the final image. The world feels specific and lived-in despite its surrealism.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.9)
    The abandoned spaceport, layered with carnival detritus, is strikingly specific and tightly filtered through Maya’s technical and imaginative eye. Environmental details (ruptured mains, auxiliary pumps, solar collectors, hydroponic rails) directly constrain and enable her tactics. The sextant and stained-glass skylight image charge the final moment, and the architecture-as-“maze of intentions” is both spatially and thematically active. A slight excess of conceptual phrasing in a few lines is the only thing keeping this just shy of the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    The monastery, soundless sanctuary, and quartz forecourt are rendered with dense, multisensory specificity, and the environment is tightly braided to Elara’s inner state (e.g., petrichor triggering the conservatory memory). The setting isn’t mere backdrop: it provides the physical crucible and ritual context for relinquishing the metronome, and the crystals’ silent “song” charges the final image. Detail selection is largely purposeful, though the descriptive lushness occasionally verges on excess. Still, the world feels singular and necessary to the story’s meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    The twilight barge canal, oil-slick water, mud that “smelled of rotting lilies and iron,” and the lock keeper’s cottage create a vivid, textured world. The sundial as a handled object functions as a micro-setting/tool that constrains interpretation and literally points her path. Environmental detail is filtered consistently through Mara’s reflective mindset. The setting mostly shapes mood and meaning rather than hard tactical constraints, which keeps it just below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    The harbor, golden dock under snow, fog, ice, and rope are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s contemplative lens. Environment and object-as-setting (rope, fulgurite) shape process: the cold stiffens him, snow compresses under his knees, fog curtains the world, and the dock feels like a liminal finger into “forgotten depths.” The final image—fog lifting, first stars, crunching snow—recharges earlier atmospheric details into a quiet promise and burden. Setting isn’t just backdrop; it frames the encounter as ritual and charges the ending’s tone.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    The garden, emptied harbor, palace, autumnal decay, and stars are vividly and economically rendered, with sensory detail consistently filtered through Elian’s grief and vocation. The environment is not a postcard: the emptied harbor and “last ship” concretely fix his isolation, and the garden’s shadow and seasonal death mirror his emotional terrain. The palace carpet thread functions as a micro-setting object that heavily charges the final image, literally tethering him to the loss and its reinterpreted meaning. Setting and object together constrain options (he cannot follow, must turn inward) and power the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    The suspended palace, anchor chains, stalactites, and iron world below are richly specific and consistently integrated with action (the swaying bridge, trembling lab, chains scraping rock). Environment actively charges the final image: oil turning to water, true sunlight piercing cracks, and the hanging structure shifting from prison to potential garden. Details are strongly filtered through Elian’s obsessions—gears instead of forests, piston hearts versus feathers. This is publishable-level atmospheric craft with minor room to tighten descriptive density.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.0)
    The obsidian lagoon, volcanic sand, kelp, and sky “migration of clouds” are not postcard décor but fully charged environment: they supply the kelp, mineral salts, concealment, and the nearly lightless medium in which scars and seaweed become “indistinguishable.” Setting is tightly filtered through Maya’s burned body and history—black sand as both “penance and promise,” water as a counter-element to fire. The final shore image and the underwater fusion scene are inseparable from this particular place; swapping the setting would break both logic and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “city of forgotten fountains” is vivid, specific, and thematically fused with the premise: dry basins, rusted pipes, mica in the cracks, and November haze all feel textured and consequential. Setting actively shapes the story—both the physical path (fountain maze, central plaza) and the metaphysical stakes (water once carrying whispers, memory sealed in stone). The geese and sky function as environmental constraints on time and possibility, charging the final image when they depart. Description verges on lush but remains controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    The nebula garden is richly and consistently realized—hydrogen petals, gaseous cathedrals, a wound that “wept radiation”—and it shapes both perception and options (e.g., sonar through gaseous blooms, locking the gear into the nebula’s “heart”). The environment directly charges the final image as petals become bioluminescent data points in the new calculation, turning setting into mechanism and resolution. Detail remains selective within the cosmic lyric rather than devolving into a catalog, and the object-as-setting (gear) and micro-setting (garden’s heart/cavity) firmly constrain the closure. At elite level, a slightly sharper sense of physical constraint on Elara’s movement and risk would push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    The greenhouse at violet dusk, the glass dome, vents, orchids, and monarchs create a rich, coherent environment that feels both physical and liminal. Setting is filtered through Elias’s vocation and grief-focus, and it actively charges tactics and closure: the migration bounds the mentorship, the glass keeps the butterflies in futile contact, and the breathing greenhouse parallels his meditative carving. The final images—glass creaking, the preserved moment like a pressed flower—reweight the entire space as a book that never closes. Descriptive density is high but purposeful; the only thing holding this just below 9 is the occasional drift toward luxuriant description that doesn’t further constrain choice.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    The obsidian ridge, tidal pressure, and clock tower interior are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the premise of time distortion. Setting isn’t just decorative: the changing tide, millimeter shifts in bedrock, and vertiginous ascent all constrain when and how Elias can act. The pendulum, gears, and brass fittings are tactile and filtered through his professional eye, reinforcing both mood and stakes. The recurring environmental pressure of water and stone also charges the final image of the town “narrowly” avoiding dissonance.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cemetery, cobalt silo, bullet-holed walls, and coded tapestry create a vivid, coherent physical and atmospheric world that’s filtered tightly through Mara’s sensibility. Setting is thematically active: the garden rows, cemetery blueprint, and acoustic design of paths all charge the final understanding of the place as an “instrument for the living.” The environment doesn’t literally trap her, but it absolutely shapes meaning and closure in a way that feels integral.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with theme—the lake’s hidden life and final cracking sound explicitly reweight the narrative’s ideas about transformation under constraint. Setting details are filtered through Elara’s professional and philosophical lens (a cartographer seeing rich “topography” beneath apparent emptiness). The kingfisher, ice, and tower recur as a coherent environmental motif rather than postcard backdrop. Physical constraints from setting don’t alter tactics moment-to-moment, but the environment strongly charges the final image and conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and integrated: the hollow concert hall, ember alcove, river mist, and ash-era city form a coherent, sensory-rich world. Details are filtered through Elias’s vocation and obsessions (scores, staves, dynamics, radio glow), so the environment reads lived-in rather than touristed. The ember alcove and dust become functional micro-settings where the central miracle occurs and where the final image returns, charging the ending with spatial memory. While the environment doesn’t sharply constrain tactical choices, it deeply charges the final image and the world’s logic.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    The vanishing point gallery, the chair, the ash, and the porcelain mask create a vivid, unified atmosphere tightly tied to perspective and erasure. Setting functions as more than backdrop: the converging lines, floor cracks, and the empty chair all materially charge the images of scattering ash and final stasis. The world’s rules (mixing ash and gypsum, the gallery’s architecture) are consistently used to reflect and focus the internal conflict. It’s richly specific without excess cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly textured and integral: flooded financial district, sewer conduits, marble bank benches, and the “concrete leviathan” vault all inflect the theme of buried histories and layered narratives. Environment actively constrains choice—he lives underground, apart from councils, and the rising tide that he pointedly doesn’t evade reinforces his stasis and faith in enduring mathematics. Details are POV-filtered (rust, dead coral, sediment, calcified walls) and consistently tied to geology/time motifs. The underworld workshop with the cog as “small sun” effectively charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.0)
    The velvet library, autumn light, mahogany table, and the zither’s curved body create a lush, coherent atmosphere that fits the meditative tone. The rosette functions as a micro-setting/object that charges the method and final image, anchoring the abstract theme in something tactile. Environmental detail is consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility as a guardian of vanishing arts. The setting rarely constrains concrete options, but it deeply colors the stakes and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rusted greenhouse and wasteland are vividly rendered and symbolically charged without feeling like generic post-apocalypse; the rusted girders becoming a trellis is an excellent final reconfiguration. Setting details are tightly filtered through Mara’s sensory and professional lens (tasting rust, framing neuroscience as gardening), which deepens both world and character. The eclipse’s amber/silver-gold light physically alters the space and charges the climax, and the industrial decay vs. rapid organic growth contrast carries through to the last line. Nearly every environmental detail either constrains the action (ruins, contamination) or charges the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting work is vivid and purposeful: “ozone and burnt honey,” “nectar dusk,” clover and copper all create a distinctive, texturally coherent atmosphere. The lightning tower is not just backdrop; it’s tied to the blackout, the bees’ purpose, and finally redefined as a dream-catching structure, charging the final image. Details are filtered through Elias’s bias as toll keeper and wonder-preserver, so the environment’s strangeness feels lived-in rather than touristic. Its only limitation is that physical constraints of the space don’t significantly alter tactics, so it’s more thematically than mechanically pressuring.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is richly rendered and tightly woven into the premise: the quiet bay, shifting fence posts, and lilacs “too thickly for April” all serve the sense of slow, almost geological awareness. Environmental details are consistently filtered through Maya’s way of seeing, avoiding tourist-list description. The bay’s tides and the cottages’ rearrangements inform both her method and the final image of the glowing house and moving fence posts. The setting doesn’t sharply constrain her choices, but it heavily charges the atmosphere and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    The underwater garden, hydrothermal current, glass dome, fissure, and bioluminescent life form a vivid, coherent environment that’s inseparable from the story’s stakes. Setting actively constrains choices: the hairline fracture, pressure differential, and root network dictate how Corvin can deliver the architect’s memory. The underwater city’s age and darkness charge the final image of the dome “breathing” and the coral singing with newly complex consciousness. Description is dense but purposeful, with recurring details (fissure, purple, roots) all feeding the thematic and structural spine.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    The infinite marble staircase, gray oblivion above and below, and the amber landing form a sharply realized, oppressive environment that is inseparable from the story’s premise. Setting actively constrains options (only up or down) and makes her refusal to descend meaningful, while the landing’s light shift cues the key turning point. Objects-as-setting (the brass handle, the dice) are integrated as tactile anchors that charge the final image. This is richly atmospheric without losing spatial or conceptual clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rooftop greenhouse above a smog-choked city is vividly rendered through selective, sensory detail—the wheezing city, fogged glass, citrus and orchids, condensation catching glyphs. Setting isn’t just backdrop; the elevation, smog, and glass walls actively shape images and the final cathedral-like atmosphere of floating words. The moonlight’s path through condensation is crucial to how the language manifests, and the encroaching dawn competes with industrial orange at closure. The only minor limit is that the environment constrains mood and imagery more than it constrains concrete choices.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grotto city behind the waterfall is vividly and economically rendered, with the roar of the falls, mist, phosphorescent moss, and calcite stairwells consistently shaping mood and behavior. Setting constraints matter: humidity rots artifacts, constant oven fires, and the looming glacial dam all charge the situation and the thematic frame. The opera glass, tapestries, and communal kitchens are not mere décor but extensions of history and loss. Environment also charges the final image: documentation “against the coming dark” and potential flood makes space and climate integral to the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the lighthouse, rocky island, low tide, and hunger stone all tangibly condition what is possible and when. The environment actively constrains choice (only low tide reveals the stone; the lighthouse’s mechanism is the vehicle for reversing time) and charges the final image as the tide re-covers evidence. Details are selective yet atmospheric (“beam sweeping the black water,” “pale, hungry luminescence that consumed shadows”), and world rules feel internally consistent for this mode of fantasy. This is very close to exemplary, only slightly held back by the relatively abstract sensory palette beyond sight.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    The abandoned funhouse and carnival are rendered with strong sensory specificity—warped mirrors, rotting cotton candy smell, phosphorescent mold—filtered through Mara’s morbid eye. Crucially, the environment is not mere backdrop: the mirrors house the trapped souls, stage the advisor, and become the surfaces through which she literally and symbolically releases the curse. The opera-house fire adjoining the carnival and the shift from haunted interior to “morning light” embed thematic transformation into place. Setting and objects-as-setting (mirrors, clasp, camera) actively constrain and then enable her choices, especially in the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and thematically integrated: the “orchard afloat on a circle of driftwood” that doubles as marimba is both atmospheric and functional. Environmental forces—sea, storm, trees’ differing pitches—directly shape what she can do and how she survives, and the rules of this strange world feel internally consistent. The storm and blue hour color the entire sensory field, with sound and weather tightly woven into action. The driftwood circle and trees also charge the final image as collaborators in the composition, not mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and distinctive from the opening line: the turtle-shell city, the rusted gate, and the “sunwashed dread” atmosphere all feel concrete and lived-in. Environmental specifics (spiral shells, river-reeds in shell cracks, calcified backs) are filtered through Elara’s cartographic sensibility and matter directly to the plot. Crucially, the turtles and sun-struck horizon are not just backdrop; they constrain and then reconfigure options when the turtles finally move toward the crack. This tight integration of worldbuilding and climax earns a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    The disused, ivy-choked station and the dying rosebush are rendered with vivid, selective detail that dovetails with theme and mood. The environment is not just decorative: it houses the hidden evidence, marks Ashford’s guilt, and charges the final images of departure and the ambiguous “whistle.” The recurrence of ivy and the rosebush meaningfully reweights the ending, turning the bare bush into a visual sign of transferred obligation. At times the symbolism edges toward the explicit, but it remains effective and integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    The submerged pavilion is exquisitely drawn, from “Victorian bones jutting from the black water” to eroded marble spelling out ghostly names and barnacled bars; the setting feels tactile, lived-in, and strange. Environmental constraints (cold water, darkness, rusted hinges, tide/drawbridge rhythm) credibly shape her movements and tactics. Details filter through her professional eye, tying architecture and decay to her emotional and thematic concerns. The final images of the “watery cathedral” and scattered bones charged by her hidden notes show the environment meaningfully recharging the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sunken-library setting is vivid and particular—phosphorescent algae, tilted floors, preservation pumps, water pressure shifts—and consistently filtered through an archivist’s attention to stacks and registries. Environment constrains and enables choices: the blackout and pump silence create the “reclaimed stillness” needed for careful listening and rethinking, while submersion and tilt affect how he moves. The recurring green glow and the physicality of the flooded archive charge the final image of him working under returning electric light. A touch more use of physical constraints in his search (e.g., danger or logistical difficulty) could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is rich, specific, and consistently filtered through Mira’s craft and state of mind: the glass basilica, floating isle, upward-falling cherry petals, and translucent garden floor all echo the themes of inversion and elevation. Environmental elements recur and evolve—the basilica chiming, then singing at the end; the sky and archipelago as the cranes’ destination—so the world feels coherent and lived in rather than a static backdrop. The fantastical rules (shadow detachment, floating islands, enchanted soil) are introduced smoothly through action rather than exposition. It falls just shy of 9-band because, while highly charged, the environment rarely constrains concrete choices; it primarily mirrors and amplifies interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    The floating observatory, Earth’s curvature, and the failing systems are economically but vividly rendered, and the environment (AI surveillance, breaker cooldown, orbital vantage) meaningfully constrains what she can do. The geode functions as a sort of micro-setting/tool that literally charges the final image. Details feel filtered through Amara’s scientific and grief-driven gaze rather than touristic description. A bit more tactile interaction with the physical station under stress could have deepened the embodied sense of place.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and thematically tuned: “ancient observatory” + “bronze astrolabe fused with fiber-optic cables” is an excellent concrete fusion of past and future. Environment actively shapes action (celestial coordinates, star trails, aperture alignment, heavy oxidized lever) and charges the final image of stars “writing their endless story.” Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, with light and temperature doing a lot of atmospheric work. This world feels lived-in and coherent without unnecessary exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and purposive: the cobalt terrace over the sea, the salt-bleached driftwood, and the churning waves all mirror and pressure his internal state. Objects-as-setting (watch hand, carvings, terrace slate) are not postcard details but tools in his ritual of penance and the final gallery of “what should have been.” The environment charges the closure image—the figures arrayed on stone, sea below, stars above, watch hand as punctuation—so the world and theme fuse. A minor limit is that the terrace itself constrains little tactically, functioning more as symbolic altitude than as a source of concrete logistical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    The parapet-in-mist setting is vivid and purposeful: the storm, slick stone, and fog-blurred borders all mirror and shape the fragile neutrality of the exchange. Details like “stone…polished smooth as bone” and the lantern’s limited radius of light make the environment feel lived-in and morally charged rather than scenic. The setting conceptually constrains tactics (no clear borders, reliance on trust and signal objects) and directly charges the final image of her alone on the parapet awaiting the next phase. This is rich, selective atmosphere rather than a catalog, though it stops just shy of using the environment to physically endanger or force a concrete tactical workaround.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.7)
    The coastal setting and man-made infrastructure are vivid and purposeful: utility poles, sodium lights, surf, shale, and cliffs all feel lived-in and filter through a navigator’s eye. Environment and tools actively constrain choice—the magnetic interference under the power lines, the absence of stars, the coastline that forces him to follow the poles—and the final image of dawn bringing poles back into view charges the ending. Sensory detail leans visual but integrates sound (“wires singing”) and touch (“salt spray kissed his face”) to support mood. The one reason this stops short of the very top band is that the physical journey itself faces little environmental resistance beyond symbolic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting work is rich and purposeful, from “limestone corridors that breathed with subterranean wind” to the bioluminescent lake whose physical properties directly enable the climax. The environment constrains options (she must go underground; the baseball only dissolves in those waters) and mirrors internal states without feeling like mere decoration. Sensory detail—especially taste and light—is used selectively to heighten mood and stakes rather than as a checklist. The only restraint on an even higher score is that world rules around time travel and the lake’s properties remain evocative more than fully individuated.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    The orchard under an endless moon, silver apples, and bioluminescent sap are vivid, specific, and recur in ways that echo Elara’s transformation. The space isn’t just decorative: it is “the place where time sleeps,” the prophesied site where she can find what is lost, and the grove that will hold her forever. Environmental details like the leaning trees, spice mist, and moonlight-charged threads are integrated into action rather than static description. The final image of them standing beneath the endless moon clearly relies on and is charged by the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    The midnight glade above the clouds is not just decorative; it’s a physicalization of “cloudbound repentance” and the locus where accumulated time can be accessed, which directly motivates her journey and shapes her tactics. Environmental details (thin, aching air; silver moss; clouds that “choked” with beauty and tasted of regret) are tightly filtered through Elara’s state and consistently echo the theme of suffocating guilt. Objects-as-setting—the saucer, the cloak, the tablecloth-analog—are used as tools in the ritual and charge the final images (dew-filled saucer, the descent through clouds). The world rules around lost time and its accumulation feel consistent and legible without expository drag.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “recycled cathedral of rust and regret” and zero-G corridors stitched from decommissioned vessels create a vivid, thematically charged environment that mirrors the story’s concern with patchwork integration. The emotional-gravity rule and the scar-like locked dimension are clear worldbuilding touches that matter to action: his peace literally allows him to rise toward the sealed fold. Objects-as-setting—the photographs, salt crystals, and Kwan Yin’s tear—are tightly woven into both atmosphere and mechanics, culminating in the charged final image of the empty ship and opened seam. The piece could involve the ship’s physical constraints in his choices a bit more, but what’s here is cinematic and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    The black sand beach, active volcano, sulfur fields, and celestial conjunction are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with the story’s stakes and imagery. Environment is not backdrop: the volcano’s “whispering,” ash, and warmth shape his options (stay, release, surrender) and charge the final image of burial-to-fertility. The bioluminescence against light-absorbing sand and the helical smoke patterns give the piece a strong, coherent atmospheric spine without lapsing into white-room abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    The luminous fort, blackout, twilight, and sundial are rendered with evocative, specific detail, and the environment meaningfully constrains tactics (needing the last sliver of light, using the darkness as “curtain and accomplice”). The sundial and its geometry aren’t just backdrop; they function as a micro-setting that literally channels the revolution and charge the final image. Sensory focus is strongly visual but feels character-filtered rather than touristic. A slight tendency toward density of imagery is the only thing keeping this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    The frictionless world, tidal bluff, aurora, eel-slime boots, and painted stones are vivid and specific, with world rules learned through action (the sled that never stops, the six-foot friction radius). Setting meaningfully constrains choices: only eel-slime grants traction, the bluff is the necessary site for the stone-field, and the aurora’s position/time drives the ritual. The environment charges the final images of permanent friction pockets and future travelers. This is rich, purposeful worldbuilding fully integrated with the story’s mechanisms.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stormlit observatory above the clouds is vividly realized and deeply integrated: lightning literally clarifies the negative and metaphorically illuminates truth against censorship. The setting is not mere backdrop; altitude, isolation, and storm interact with her choices (climbing here to escape censors, using the lightning-lit glass to see the photograph, smuggling words “down through the cloud cover”). Recurring technical details (glass dome, darkroom-like storm, “cumulus ocean”) support both tone and theme. It stops just short of 9+ because the environment shapes perception and symbolism more than concrete tactical constraints beyond isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glass atrium, brook, Victorian ironwork, and half-painted sundial are vividly drawn and integrated into action, especially the way sunlight and angles literally enable the decoding. The environment meaningfully constrains choice: they must wait for the sun’s position, fight in a confined marble-and-glass space, and use the sundial’s incomplete geometry. Object details (mechanical arm, needle card, sundial) function as micro-setting and are not mere décor. A bit more non-visual sensory texture could deepen atmosphere, but what’s here is robust and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “rusted library under stars,” converted prison yard, and east wing soil are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through the characters’ purposes (sorting, hiding, planting). Environment shapes tactics (night work under moonlight, timing around guard shifts, using a condemned space as sanctuary) and charges the final image of “luminous fracture.” The recurring physical elements—the rusted roof showing stars, the damaged books, the soil—are tightly linked to theme and closure. A touch more sensory variety beyond the visual (sound, temperature, texture under stress) could push this toward truly exceptional, but as-is it’s strong and integral.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    The Aetherium, tidal arbor, cloud-ocean, flickering compasses, and modified piano are vividly rendered and consistently integrated into action rather than standing as backdrop. Environmental features directly constrain choices: the atmospheric storm, tether strain, and “one stable pocket of atmosphere” make stabilization, not physical escape, the only viable tactic. Recurring objects (the station piano, anniversary clock, film reel, compasses) all return reweighted at the end, especially in the final image of a “suspended garden held aloft by mathematics and mourning turned melodic.” The world reads as singular and coherent without over-explaining its mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is rich, original, and deeply integrated: chromatic moss, mnemonic strata, psychoactive irises, and bioluminescent roots all interact with Elara’s methods and choices. The ridge and weather are not just backdrop but functional infrastructure for memory preservation and dream-work. Details stay tightly filtered through her professional lens, avoiding tourist catalog excess. The final image of the knowledge tree in the stormed ridge powerfully charges both environment and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    The breezy islet, volcanic cliffs, ocean, bonsai workshop, and weather are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Mara’s sensibility. Objects-as-setting (the compass, lace, and bonsai) strongly charge the final image and constrain what actions are possible in this intimate space. Environmental elements like tide and wind are deeply integrated thematically, even if they rarely block or force specific physical tactics. The world feels coherent and texturally rich without slipping into tourist cataloguing.

However, the descriptions occasionally prioritize abstract terminology ("rhizomatic intelligence," "negative curvature") over sensory immediacy, distancing the reader from the physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.7)
    The carnival redemption center is a vivid, specific setting that contrasts well with the grim exterior. Sensory details like the dust, the concrete pillar, and the yellowed piano keys ground the scene effectively, though the visual description of the DNA-fletching is a stretch.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptional; the sunken orchard and shipwrecks are not just atmospheric backdrops but essential tools that constrain the method and fuel the plot. The physical environment (the forge, the aurora, the water pressure) actively shapes the protagonist's actions and the story’s logic. The sensory details ("ghosts of apples," "hulls bleeding iron") create a distinct, immersive world that supports the tone perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    The "golden hour" and "emerald station" aesthetic is established with vivid, atmospheric detail that grounds the fantasy premise effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    The flooded orchestra pit is a vivid, specific setting that actively constrains the action (wading boots, water levels). The interplay of lantern light and dark water effectively grounds the scene, though the "silver shimmers" description leans toward the ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    The botanical specifics—"woolly stars," "alpine scree"—ground the story beautifully. However, the atmosphere occasionally tips into pathetic fallacy with phrases like "auroral sorrow," which feel more imposed by the author than observed by the character.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is rendered with visceral specificity; the "soot-blackened bricks" and "chemical sludge" create a palpable, oppressive atmosphere. The tunnel acts as a pressure vessel for the theme, and the valve wheel functions perfectly as a micro-setting that constrains the climax. Sensory details are rigorously selected to support the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=5.4)
    Imagery is atmospheric but relies on generic fantasy abstractions ("lost knowledge," "untold seasons") rather than specific, tactile grounding. The setting serves as a static backdrop for observation rather than a source of constraints that force character choices.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)

The environment effectively constrains the resources (driftwood, condensation) available for the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the integration of static electricity as a sensory mechanic is vivid and functional. The amber grotto exerts real pressure on the narrative, actively participating in the climax rather than serving merely as a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.2)
    The setting is atmospheric but veers into decorative romanticism ("alphabetized by starlight," "meteor dust") that clashes with the grounded premise of a cargo broker. The environment serves as a static backdrop for reflection rather than a source of constraint or pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is vivid but relies on abstract synesthesia ("tasted of copper and old songs") that creates distance. While the "crystalline orchard" is distinct, the descriptions often feel decorative rather than constraining Kael's tactile choices.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.4)

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "ivory harbor after rain" is rendered with tactile specificity ("waterlogged planks," "wet luminescence"). The environment actively constrains the mood and provides the physical artifacts that drive the plot, grounding the fantasy elements in sensory reality.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting of the abandoned Cathedral Station is rendered with strong atmospheric detail ("starlit vault," "fogged glass") that effectively mirrors the protagonist’s liminal state. The environment actively supports the plot, though some descriptions veer into abstraction ("exhaled its shame") rather than grounding the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.2)
    Atmospheric details like the "salt wind" and "copper-green comet" effectively ground the observatory setting in a specific mood. However, the physical reality of the tower becomes malleable to serve the plot, with structural changes ("sound-conducting curves") appearing overnight without explanation. This plasticity weakens the otherwise vivid sense of place.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.9)
    The "prismatic escondite" creates a vivid atmospheric backdrop, but the setting functions more as a visual light show than a tactile environment that constrains movement. Sensory details lean heavily on the abstract ("spatial disobedience") rather than immediate physical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    The funeral home prep room is rendered with distinct, atmospheric specificity ("cobalt glass," "iron-gall," "chemical preservation tanks"). The physical grounding in the first half is strong, though the transition to the asylum center blurs the spatial logic.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.8)
    Visual details like the "shattered telescopes" and "glittering glass" effectively ground the scene in a specific decay. However, the atmosphere relies too often on explicit labeling ("time moved differently") rather than evoking the sensation of suspension through concrete action. The "whisper of closing pages" functions more as a metaphorical conceit than a tangible environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with distinct sensory details ("damp wall," "rust," "neon-drenched") that ground the action. The environment actively constrains the protagonist's choices (using specific walls, navigating the sprawl), serving the narrative well.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sonic responsiveness of the environment ("cobblestones hummed like plucked strings") effectively grounds the magical realism in the setting. While the atmosphere is established, the reliance on static descriptors ("ancient archway") limits the sense of spatial evolution until the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.1)
    The underwater setting is vivid and tactile, with the "thermocline" and "eddies" grounding the physical experience of the deep. The environment actively constrains the character through pressure and limited oxygen, integrating setting with plot. While atmospheric, some descriptors like "lonesome splendor" feel slightly inserted rather than organic to the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is not merely a backdrop but the active mechanism of the plot; the lighthouse's ability to "sustain impossibilities" is the tool Elias uses to escape. Sensory details like the "salt-crusted glass" and "myrrh" ground the magical realism in tactile grit. The environment actively constrains and enables the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, offering vivid, specific grounding in the "iron ribs" and "mercury-rich soils." However, the atmosphere occasionally tips into ornamental lushness that crowds the narrative momentum, though it successfully pressures the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and functionally integrated; using the vintage CRT's glow to reveal the indentations is a strong, tactile use of environment to drive action. The atmosphere effectively evokes the requested tone, though descriptions occasionally veer into purple prose ("hues of amber and regret").

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is not merely a backdrop but the primary tool of the protagonist's agency; the cobalt dome's acoustics and light filtration are essential to her method. The sensory details—"geometry" of footsteps, blue walls holding sound like a shell—are vivid and functional, grounding the abstract magic in concrete reality.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting is atmospheric, with specific details like the condensation writing standing out. However, the imagery is occasionally muddled by conflicting metaphors (the "drowned cathedral" of the trees competing with the literal cathedral shard), and the descriptive density slows the pace.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    The central detail of the plaster cast as a "desperate archive" of charcoal notes is excellent, specific, and grounding. However, atmospheric descriptors like "mist-clad atrium" and "copper light" feel slightly generic and gothic for the setting. The sensory details of the coral and the "burning copra shed" add necessary texture, lifting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.0)

The environment actively constrains and enables the characters' tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "gargantuan shell" provides a distinct atmospheric container, though descriptions often veer into abstract metaphor ("currents older than language") rather than concrete sensory detail. While the bioluminescence and coral imagery are vivid, the setting functions more as a static backdrop for the monologue than a source of active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    The atmospheric density is the story's strongest asset, with the Opal Library rendered in vivid, synesthetic detail. The specific interplay of sound, light, and "cloud-mist" grounds the surreal concept in a tangible space.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.4)
    The archive is atmospheric, successfully blending the sensory ("ochre," "hum") with the conceptual to ground the premise. However, descriptions occasionally veer into purple abstraction ("tasted of... forgotten grammar") that distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story’s strongest asset; the "crumbling amphitheater" functioning as a hydraulic lung is a vivid, constraining environment that shapes the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tidal arcade is a striking, specific environment that integrally shapes the mechanics of the scene through tides and acoustics. The setting is the story's strongest asset, though the description occasionally relies on the protagonist’s superhuman analysis rather than grounded sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.0)
    The atmosphere is distinct and consistent, establishing a dreamlike "twilight garden" effectively. However, the setting serves largely as a backdrop rather than an active constraint; Kaelin moves through it without it forcing tactical shifts until the final magical realism conceptualization.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is rendered with vivid, high-contrast imagery ("crystal lung," "mercury"), effectively establishing atmosphere. However, the environment functions primarily as a metaphor generator for the protagonist's thoughts rather than a physical space that imposes constraints or friction on the action.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is atmospheric but lacks tactile grounding, leaning on poetic abstractions ("migrating stars"). The central prop—a porcelain box surviving a crawl through burning timbers—strains physical credibility to the point of distraction.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is vividly realized with specific, evocative imagery like "tide-polished walls" and "bioluminescent algae," creating a cohesive atmospheric container. However, the environment functions primarily as a passive backdrop for the protagonist's actions rather than offering constraints or obstacles that force adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.1)
    Atmospheric details like the "broken windows" and "damp stone" are functional but trend toward generic ruin tropes. While the image of stars emerging where the grid died is strong, the setting suffers from the verbatim repetition of the "ivy-veiled passage" descriptor.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    Atmospheric detail is strong and consistent with the tone, establishing a vivid magical realist setting. However, the verbatim repetition of the full setting phrase ("prism parapet after rain") creates a mechanical drag on immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid details like "titanium braces" on ancient columns effectively grounding the "forever war" context.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    The atmosphere is vivid and suffocating, utilizing the "silver courtyard" and "living ink" shadows to create a cohesive monochrome world. The sensory details of the cold and the "crystallized" nature of the memories effectively ground the fantastical elements in a tangible setting.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.1)
    The decommissioned radar dome is a vivid, constraining crucible that deeply informs the imagery and the central metaphor. The setting feels distinct and essential to the narrative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and provides a strong metaphorical grounding for the narrative. However, the atmospheric description suffers from the specific repetition of "blushing stillness" (three times), which diminishes the immersive quality of the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is integral to the plot, providing the specific tools (ice, aurora, darkness) required for the magic system to function. The sensory details of "beeswax," "bronze dust," and "violet and gold" ribbons ground the fantasy in tactile reality. The environment actively constrains the method, as the ice necessitates the use of the aurora rather than heat or fire for the final projection.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting details are evocative and thematically integrated; "blast doors rusted open like praying hands" is a standout image. The environment actively pressures the protagonist, with the encroaching vegetation mirroring the decay of the directive. The "rewilded forest" feels lived-in rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is vivid and functional; details like "hanging gardens dripping into the Euphrates" and the "unguarded" library actively pressure the plot by creating the window of opportunity. The macro-setting of an empire in transition perfectly mirrors the micro-magic of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "soundless sanctuary" is established with evocative, if abstract, sensory details like "vibrating walls" and "translucent" cellular memory.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, blending the organic "blue-green constellations" of the fungi with the industrial rust of the bolt. The atmosphere is tangible and specific, grounding the high-concept surrealism in sensory reality ("fingers trembled," "rusted cylinder clattered").

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting establishes a consistent atmosphere with sensory details like "dust motes" and "vanilla scent," though it relies on static description rather than active constraints. The environment frames the scene but does not force specific tactical choices, and the imagery leans into familiar tropes ("sepia," "golden shadows") without deepening the context.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is imaginative and visually distinct (mercury trees, crystallized shadow), providing a strong surreal atmosphere. However, reliance on abstract descriptors ("defiance of physics") occasionally distances the reader from the sensory reality.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is atmospheric and integral; the archive is not just a backdrop but an active participant, with the dust acting as the primary tool for discovery. The "geological strata" metaphor lands well, though the description occasionally borders on purple.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    The "auric lagoon" with bioluminescent algae is a striking, specific environment that effectively contrasts with the "crumbling brick" above. The setting actively interacts with the protagonist (the algae responding to the key), integrating atmosphere with plot function.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral; the "prism atrium" and "geometric pathways" are not just backdrop but tools Elias uses to amplify his silence.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Ashen Skyborne Arbor is vivid and atmospheric, with specific sensory details ("charcoal sky," "living ash") that ground the surreal premise. The setting actively constrains the action through the "peculiar gravity" and the timing of the "hush."

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is a standout strength; the "shattered teeth" of the greenhouse and the "subterranean waterfall" create a vivid, atmospheric backdrop that directly constrains the protagonist's choices. The environment acts as an antagonist during the climax, forcing the character to abandon her tools. The sensory details are generally sharp, though occasionally veer into pathetic fallacy ("vegetative reluctance").

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is atmospheric and active; the rain washing away ash and the cooling crucibles ground the magical elements in sensory reality. The "factually mystical" tone is supported by concrete details of the foundry, integrating the environment well with the alchemical process.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; details like the "bone bleached clean" station and the "sulfur-tinted" glass effectively ground the cosmic scope in tactile reality. The atmosphere of "flourishing stillness" is vividly rendered and successfully constrains the protagonist's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is evocative and strictly constrained, acting as a pressure cooker for the protagonist. Phrases like "hives stood like empty cathedrals" and "waxen corridors now home to dust" ground the supernatural elements in tactile decay. The scorched environment meaningfully limits options and sets the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, blending the surreal emerald silo with the mundane specificity of garage sale ads ("sticky clock," "unfulfilled promises"). This grounding of high-concept sci-fi in tactile, nostalgic decay creates a vivid and unique atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is established, but relies on repetitive specific phrases ("cobalt lagoon" appears three times; "burnished hush" twice) rather than evolving detail. The environment feels like a static stage for the lesson rather than a pressure-cooker influencing choices.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    The biopunk concept of living stone and neural networks is vivid and imaginative, providing a strong atmospheric backdrop. However, the panoramic summary mode prevents the setting from exerting visceral, moment-to-moment constraints on the protagonist's physical experience.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with the "rainwashed tower" and "bronze quiet" creating a cohesive, moody backdrop. However, the setting remains largely aesthetic, serving as a stage for dialogue rather than exerting physical pressure on choices.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sensory details are vivid and specific ("calcified remains," "iodine," "rusting ordnance"), effectively grounding the surreal premise. The environment actively constrains the protagonist’s method, instructing his actions through the bird calls.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and texturally rich, with details like "copper oxidation" and "settling steel" grounding the post-apocalyptic atmosphere. The environment actively presses on the protagonist, reinforcing the themes of decay and persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is vivid and imaginative ("violet glaciers," "bleeding aurora"), establishing a strong mythic atmosphere. However, the description is often overwritten and dense ("fractal patterns," "eyes like frozen sapphires"), serving as a static backdrop for the prompt's elements rather than an environment Kael must tactically navigate.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.1)
    The "nomadic penumbra" is a vivid, specific atmospheric invention that grounds the scene effectively. However, the chessboard metaphor is physically heavy-handed, and the mechanics of the "diplomat's alphabet" remain vague, floating in the abstract rather than the concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is exceptional, tightly integrating the character's physiology with the environment; the "granite heartwood" and lack of air actively constrain Vey's survival options. The constraint of the summit being the "only place starlight penetrated" effectively forces the choreography of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.0)
    The atmosphere is the story’s strongest asset, with vivid, specific imagery like the "suspended snowflake" and "lightning hung fractured." The environment effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal stasis, though the sensory experience is primarily visual.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is not merely a backdrop but the engine of the story; the acoustics of the bone towers constrain the action and enable the resolution. The "porous surface" and "canyon of endless echoes" are integrated into every beat, forcing the characters to adapt their tactics to the physical environment.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with the "acid sea" and "gears-and-cogs workshop" providing strong sensory texture ("green froth," "tasted of copper").

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.0)
    The atmosphere is vivid and consistently high-fantasy, with strong sensory details like the "bruised violet" sky and "pulsed" bioluminescence. However, the conflicting descriptions of the grotto (called "ember" but described as "cobalt" with "no fire") create a distracting logical stutter that feels like a retrofit to constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.0)
    The "ember nexus" is established with evocative sensory details that ground the fantastical elements. The environment effectively reflects the mood, though it serves more as an atmospheric container than a source of constraint or pressure on the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is specific and atmospheric, with the birch bark scroll and the mountain air acting as tangible anchors for the metaphysical conflict. Sensory details like "scents of pine and decomposition" and "snowflake landing on stone" effectively ground the surreal elements. The cabin feels lived-in and claustrophobic, enhancing the pressure to escape/soar.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    Setting details are the story's strength, with specific imagery like the water clock's float and the "silver comma" of the screw. The atmosphere is consistent, though the "fog" motif is somewhat standard.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the altitude of the floating platform directly triggers the protagonist's condition, driving the conflict. Atmospheric details like the "bruised purple light" effectively support the tension of the impending storm.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is active and integral; the archive's shelving becomes part of the exorcism circuit, and the orchard's acoustics provide a tangible anchor for the ghost. While atmospheric details like "silver fish" dust motes are slightly familiar, the "ethereal grit" and the tactical use of the environment to conduct the ritual are exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.1)
    Atmospheric details like the "swollen" dictionary pages and "obsidian shelves" provide some grounding, but the setting largely serves as a passive backdrop for the internal monologue. The "temple library" feels like a generic cosmic void rather than a specific place generating resistance or tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is integral to the narrative logic; the hydraulic mechanisms and vertical cliffs actively constrain the protagonist's understanding of time. The imagery of resistance and pressure mirrors the internal epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.5)
    The bioluminescent atmosphere is vivid and establishes a consistent, moody visual palette. However, the "spatially gifted" attribute feels overlaid on the setting description rather than integrated into how the character uniquely navigates the space. The environment serves as a static backdrop for the conversation rather than a source of escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    The "rainwashed library" is vivid and functionally integrated, mirroring Maya's internal "submerged" state. The sensory details are lush and specific, though occasionally the adjectival density ("weeping with condensation") borders on excessive.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with the "ivy claiming Platform 7" and "green fingers" creating a vivid, atmospheric container for the action. Specific details like the "rusted water fountain" and "broken glass" ground the magical realism in texture. However, the "polite anarchy" remains largely abstract description rather than a demonstrated spatial reality affecting character movement.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.1)
    The focus on tactile and ultrasonic sensory details ("pulsed warm," "vibrating bark") creates a distinct, grounded physical experience. However, the setting description is weakened by a reliance on abstract nouns ("moss that sang of ancient patience") instead of concrete environmental specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)

The setting successfully establishes the "pretzel logic" required for the plot, though some metaphorical descriptions feel slightly overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is atmospherically competent but leans heavily on "luminous" and "silver" clichés that render the harbor as a generic poetic backdrop rather than a pressure-filled environment. While the bioluminescence is a functional visual detail, the setting cooperates too perfectly with Elias's goals, failing to provide constraints or resources that force him to adapt his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.0)
    Atmospheric detail is vivid and consistent, creating a cohesive mood of ruin and reverence. However, the reliance on high-concept descriptors ("volcanic glass," "blackened stone") sometimes crowds out the immediate physical reality of the archive.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is fully integrated as the mechanism of the story; the garden is a tool Kael plays, not just a backdrop. Sensory details describing the conversion of sound to light ("ripples through the visible spectrum") are vivid and constrain the action.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the "shifting metal canyons" and "bruised" sky acting as tangible constraints that force the characters' low-tech adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    The atmospheric details are vivid and create a cohesive, ethereal tone ("cobalt tiles," "frozen lake," "humming quartz"). The setting actively interacts with the character, though the "lantern-moth hush" image is overused, slightly diminishing its specific impact through repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.7)
    Sensory details are strong and strictly filtered through the POV's colorblind perspective ("degrees of silver and pewter"). The thermal and textural descriptions effectively ground the setting.

The atmosphere is consistent, though the "timeless" nature of the observatory risks becoming too abstract without more concrete spatial anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is atmospheric and specific, with the "rain-beaded" motif establishing a consistent noir tone, although the phrase repeats mechanically. Tools like the onyx ink and measuring tape are well-integrated, grounding the abstract concepts in tactile reality. However, the reliance on visual description occasionally stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    Atmosphere is consistent and the "bronze prism pagoda" is a vivid anchor. However, reliance on genre staples like "obsidian walls" and "bioluminescent fungi" flattens the specificity. The "atoms of nostalgia" offer a strong visual metaphor that effectively bridges setting and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sensory details like "bioluminescent shelves" and "violet twilight" are vivid but lean toward generic high-fantasy tropes ("blooming library"). The setting provides atmosphere but does not meaningfully constrain the character's choices or tactics; it functions largely as an ornamental backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sensory details like the humidity, jasmine, and condensing mist effectively ground the workshop atmosphere. However, the setting relies on pathetic fallacy—the mist lifting exactly as her internal state clarifies—which renders the environment a passive mirror for the protagonist rather than a distinct, resistant element.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    The atmosphere is vivid and specific, grounding the surreal elements in tangible textures like "frost-rimed windows" and "roots tunneling through foundations." The "meteor hush" effectively sets the tone. The setting actively pressures the protagonist, with the tower and tunnel acting as physical manifestations of his internal scar tissue, though the transition to the cavern feels slightly abrupt.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.3)
    The tactile details of the "celluloid teeth" and "ozone and dust" ground the scene effectively in the vintage booth. However, the setting feels largely static, functioning as a container for the vision rather than an environment that constrains Elara's movement or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with strong visual anchors like "frost-heaved stones" and "green curtains." However, the description often leans into conventional fantasy imagery ("sky bled color"), and the environment acts as a backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)

The sensory details are vivid, specific, and functionally necessary for the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting is vivid with consistent atmospheric details ("seaweed coats," "bioluminescence"), though it leans on standard fantasy tropes. The "fog-shrouded shore" and "veiled ridgeway" create a cohesive dream-like mood, though the "sane geography" line feels slightly abstract for the grounded POV.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and actively constrains the characters; the "cobalt fortress" and "snow-buried corridors" create a palpable sense of isolation essential to the stakes. Specific details like the "faded smudge of rust" and "iron had wept" ground the abstraction of the "Great Hush" in physical reality. The atmosphere effectively mirrors the protagonist's suppressed state.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is atmospheric and integral to the plot; the specific properties of the iron gall ink and the crumbling architecture ground the mythic tone effectively. The dissolution of the library into "dust fine as pollen" provides a strong, specific sensory image at closure that reinforces the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and tactile, effectively constraining the protagonist within the "titanium console" and "gray dawn." Details like the "edges soft with salt" and "coral cathedrals... dissolved into gray sediment" ground the abstract themes in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively grounding the surrealism in the tactile details of the "rotting knowledge" and "charcoal-stained fingers." The environment actively pressures the protagonist, though the "bioluminescent" elements lean slightly into generic fantasy tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is established with vivid, specific imagery ("sandstone ribs," "tearing silk") that grounds the abstract concept. The environment actively supports the theme of erosion and time, though the sensory details sometimes stack adjectives excessively. The atmosphere is consistent and effectively distinct.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.4)
    The sensory details of the cold are effective ("breath frosting," "subzero"), but the verbatim repetition of the setting tag ("echoing library under snow") three times makes the atmosphere feel formulaic rather than immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the "airship ballast" and "spiderweb cracks" providing specific, textured grounding that constrains the protagonist's life. The sensory details—like the specific sound of the sandbags or the light at 6:47—effectively establish the atmosphere of fragile preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    The "sound wave garden" is an imaginative, high-concept setting that successfully constrains the protagonist's tactics (voicing silence to move). The sensory details are vivid, though the density of mismatched metaphors (kelp, thorns, braille, topography) occasionally creates a "white room" effect where the physical geometry is obscured by the figurative language.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "amber warehouse" and "fossilized time" create a vivid, cohesive surrealist atmosphere that anchors the fable-like tone. The specific imagery of the button mandala and golden strata effectively grounds the high-concept magic, though the logic remains dream-like.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmospheric details, particularly the "silver hush" and mist, are vivid and effectively mirror the protagonist's liminal state. The setting actively frames the mood, though the pathetic fallacy is slightly heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    Atmosphere is the story's primary strength, with vivid, specific details like "iron eaves," "moss-slick pilings," and "metallic ticking" grounding the scene. The environment acts as a tangible constraint on the character, though some descriptors feel slightly overwrought ("shoulders gathered like storm clouds").

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting is grounded effectively; the radio station feels lived-in with "ancient equipment" and "sodium light." The use of the window to observe the town's chaos allows the exterior stakes to pressure the interior scene without breaking the single location. The specific sensory details ("dust motes," "ozone") build a solid atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.0)
    The "spatial mutiny" of the architecture acts as a vivid, breathing antagonist. Sensory details—the vibration in the boots, the chewing gears, the damp limestone—are specific and immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is atmospheric and tactile, with details like "rough velvet of moss" and "swollen floorboards" actively shaping the mood. The station acts as more than a backdrop; it provides the tools (accordion) and atmosphere necessary for the protagonist's emotional shift. The sensory hierarchy is excellent, filtering the decay through Maya’s heightened, unmedicated perception.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is imaginative, with effective surreal imagery like books opening "like jellyfish," but relies heavily on adjectival stacking ("living luminescence," "compressed starlight") that leans toward generic fantasy tropes. While the "mist" and "propagation delays" provide a logical constraint for the magic system, the environment rarely forces the character to improvise or alter her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.5)
    The atmospheric description of the grotto and aurora is vivid and establishes a strong mood, anchoring the ritual. However, the setting functions mostly as a backdrop rather than an active constraint that forces specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    The "umbral grotto" is vividly rendered with specific sensory details ("silver clouds," "dark earth"). The atmosphere is consistent, though the "vineyard hush" description borders on repetitive. Orientation is immediate and stable.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse is not just a backdrop but a machine of the plot; the catwalk, rafters, and iron hooks constrain the action. The atmospheric details ("Atlantic dampness," "mist") support the theme of ambiguity. The magical props are treated with a tactile weight that grounds the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)
    The atmosphere is thick and tangible, with the "bruised sky" and "viscous mud" effectively grounding the reader in the "liminal hour." The setting is treated as an active participant that reveals secrets, though some descriptors ("sound forgets to echo") lean slightly toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sensory details are vivid ("prismatic spray," "roots of quicksilver") and establish a strong, magical atmosphere. However, the setting serves primarily as a passive backdrop that facilitates the protagonist's goals rather than a source of constraints or obstacles that shape her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with "sulfuric mist" and the "genetically engineered sequoia" creating a strong atmospheric anchor. The environment meaningfully constrains the action (wind currents, visibility), fulfilling the criteria for setting-as-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.5)
    The floating rock setting effectively isolates the characters, but the background of "history rewriting itself" remains a generic visual effect until the very end. The environment lacks tactile granularity beyond the cold tissue and the glass jar; the "void" is a standard white-room trope that doesn't constrain specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.8)
    While atmospheric details like "bruised clouds" and "fractured moonlight" are vivid, the setting remains a static backdrop for contemplation rather than an active constraint that forces tactical shifts or creates immediate physical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    The surreal setting of the obsidian echo chamber is vivid and functions well to amplify the central action. The specific detail of the "Craftsman machines" effectively grounds the fantastical elements. While atmospheric, the descriptions occasionally veer into overwrought territory ("wept condensation," "liquefied atmosphere"), slightly distancing the reader from the immediate physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptional, moving beyond backdrop to become the mechanism of resolution ("swallowing the landscape").

    The setting is excellent, with the "porous texture" and "acoustic topology" of the bone towers actively constraining the protagonist's actions (quiet articulation vs. loud triggers). The sensory details are vivid and specific, grounding the abstract magical concepts in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is active and integral; the "optional" gravity is not just window dressing but actively shapes the climax (the levitating arrowhead). The sensory details of the bioluminescent fungi and the stone altar ground the surrealism effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific, utilizing the "bruised silver" sky and "clockwork fruit" to create a distinct atmosphere that constrains the action. The mechanical orchard and the bridge cables serve as essential, integrated tools for the resolution rather than mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with "cobalt shadows" and "brittle hush" creating a vivid, specific atmosphere that grounds the action. The environment creates the central constraint (drone corridors) and effectively shapes the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with strong sensory details like "velvet rot" and "sequins like dried scales" that ground the surreal elements. The environment effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal state, though the description occasionally borders on ornamental rather than constraining action.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and conceptually integral, with "physics-poetry intersection" and "negative-curvature" shelves grounding the fantasy logic effectively. The "Pringles chips" simile offers specific visual grounding, though it risks a slight tonal clash with the lyrical atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory details like the "green flash" and "salt-rimed doors" effectively ground the surreal premise in a tangible atmosphere. The setting actively participates in the narrative ritual, though the "whispering" motif eventually verges on repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on abstract, high-fantasy tropes ("stardust," "velvet," "void") rather than specific, grounded details that constrain choice. The "shadowed nexus" is visually evocative but functions more as a backdrop than a pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptional—the "cathedral of decay" and "sunken orchard" are not just atmospheric backdrops but integral mechanics of the plot (the alignment of shipwrecks and stars). The environment actively constrains the timing and nature of the protagonist's choice, satisfying the 9+ criterion for integration.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is atmospheric and specific, with the "brass table" and "samovar" grounding the fantasy elements. The recurring image of the empty swing serves as an effective anchor that bridges the internal and external worlds.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is vivid and actively integrated into the plot; the waterfall and parapet provide the physical components (mist, soil) for the magical solution. While the descriptions lean toward the ornate, the environment effectively anchors the scene's action.

    The setting acts as a dynamic constraint; the "sharpening" starlight and the physical weight of the silence create a tangible pressure cooker that forces the protagonist’s evolution. The sensory details—obsidian, salt, prismatic refraction—are distinct and actively charge the final image of Mira as the new "net."

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmospheric details like the "jagged canyon" of the tear and the "smell of limestone and decaying vellum" are evocative. The acoustics of the chapel ("shielded openness") are described with sensory precision. A deduction applies for the illogical setting of the archive; storing film in a damp fresco vault breaks world consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    The atmosphere is vivid, with strong sensory details like "amber" light and "waterlogged Renaissance manuscripts." However, the logistics of a paper library surviving underwater for 80 years ("salt-preserved") strain suspension of disbelief, even within the stylized tone, creating a slight friction in the setting's solidity.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with evocative details like "fossilized into the steel" and "luminous dust" grounding the ethereal setting. The environment actively participates in the mechanism of the story, though the spatial geography remains somewhat vague beyond the central obelisk.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is actively causal; the altitude-specific light and the “icebound spire” constrain the plot mechanics and enable the solution. The vertical geography actively charges the final image, placing Elara between the "cloud ocean" and "stratospheric space" to physicalize the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.4)
    The gondola setting is distinct, but the atmosphere relies on romanticized clichés ("velvet dark," "dusty starlight") rather than visceral, high-altitude sensory details like cold or oxygen deprivation. The environment functions more as a canvas for metaphor than a source of physical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting specificity is excellent; the "ribosomes" imagery and the texture of rotting wood create a vivid, tactile environment. The sensory details are strictly filtered through Elara’s unique, touch-based perception, grounding the fantastical elements in a consistent reality.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.2)
    Atmospheric details like the "ghost footprints" and "brass railing" are vivid and establish a consistent steampunk aesthetic. However, the setting acts primarily as a dispenser of clues (the board, the birds) rather than a source of constraint or pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.4)
    The frozen observatory offers vivid imagery ("crystallized tomes"), but the prompt-forced phrase "driftwood nostalgia" creates a jarring mixed metaphor that contradicts the high-altitude, landlocked setting. The cold is atmospheric but does not meaningfully constrain the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    The atmospheric details of the twin suns and floating arches are vivid, creating a distinct visual identity for the setting. However, the presence of "sidewalks" in a crash-landing orchard breaks immersion, and the world-building leans heavily on standard soft sci-fi tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vividly rendered, grounding metaphysical concepts in tactile details like "cooling brass" and "ceramic fragments." The atmosphere effectively evokes a "cosmic cradle," though the "pane of hush" is treated somewhat repetitively as a set piece.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting details are vivid and tactile, effectively blending the mechanical (brass wings, gears) with the organic (toxic pollen, salt-crusted basalt). The environment actively constrains the protagonist's choices, particularly the time pressure of the forming frost. The "map" of shadows is a strong, specific visual concept that anchors the fantasy elements.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    The braided ravine is vivid and functions well as a constraint on the protagonist's attention, grounding the abstraction. The physical details of the schist and river braids effectively mirror the internal thematic work, though the connection is sometimes overstated.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.2)
    The "glass orchard library" is rendered with vivid, specific imagery ("crystalline branch," "growing books") that actively shapes the protagonist's method and constraints. The setting is not merely a backdrop but the puzzle Elara must solve; the negative space between shelves and breaths is integral to the plot's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.1)
    The surreal imagery of a frozen coral pavilion beneath a desert is vivid and inventive. The setting actively constrains the plot (using rain maps to find the entrance), though the "fortress" itself feels like a backdrop compared to the pavilion.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is conceptually inventive but rendered through lists of adjectives ("rusted sentinels," "borrowed starlight") rather than grounded sensory interaction. The environment is described from a distance rather than constraining the protagonist's immediate physical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting provides atmospheric backing ("silver moonlight," "canyon breathed") but largely functions as a passive stage rather than a source of pressure or constraint. The mirror is well-utilized as a focal tool, but the surrounding canyon lacks specific, interactive texture that influences the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sensory details of the gravity inversion—mist swallowing knees, stalactites pointing "down" relative to the viewer—create a vivid, grounded physical reality. The environment actively constrains movement and orientation, fulfilling the setting's role effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with evocative details like "fossilized whale song" and "brass telescopes" grounding the magical realism. However, the atmosphere occasionally drifts into purple abstraction ("architecture of quiet") rather than tactile interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.7)
    The treetop setting is vivid and immersive, with strong verticality and sensory detail. However, the environment functions largely as a passive backdrop rather than an active force that pressures the protagonist's choices or creates obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting is vivid and imaginative, with the gravity inversion providing strong visual anchors like the "reverse harvest" and "frozen lightning." The imagery of the upside-down waterfalls and mossy arches effectively grounds the fantastical premise.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting acts as the primary antagonist; the "invisible topography" created by the container labyrinth constrains the crash and the investigation. The "meteorology of architectural disaster" is a standout concept that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is vivid and atmospherically consistent, anchoring the reader in the "frozen breath" cathedral effectively. However, the environment functions primarily as a static backdrop for the light show rather than a source of constraints that force the character to adapt her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sensory details like "bone-white wood" and "gold leaf peeling" effectively establish the atmosphere. However, the forced repetition of specific prompt phrases (e.g., "avalanchingly quiet" used three times) detracts from the immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    The topaz workshop is a vivid, atmospheric setting that actively participates in the narrative through the "breathing" walls and "amber" light. The sensory details—ink, oil, the specific machinery of the Vandercook press—ground the surrealism effectively. While the "pulsing walls" trope is slightly standard for the genre, the integration of the setting with the plot (using the skylight's stars as a clock) is skillfully executed.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is established with vivid, atmospheric details like the "spectral green glow" and "violet shadows." The environment successfully creates the liminal feeling of the "fade." While effective, the setting functions more as a backdrop than a source of physical constraint or urgent pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "quartz arbor" and "frost ferns" provide a distinct, vivid texture that grounds the mystical elements in physical reality. The sensory details effectively establish a cold, crystalline atmosphere that supports the light-refraction mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid ("silver needles," "empty sleeves"), establishing a consistent fable-like mood. The environment effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal isolation, though the descriptions occasionally veer into static lushness that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with vivid, specific details like "floating rock arches," "violet shadows," and "crystallized seeds" that ground the fantasy. The environment actively shapes the action (the descent through the mine shafts, the magnetic resonance), providing a solid physical stage for the narrative. The imagery is consistent and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with sensory details like "ozone," "copper," and "rusted hull" grounding the metaphysical premise. The environment actively participates in the narrative, shifting and "humming" to reflect the protagonist's journey.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is integral to the narrative, actively constraining choice through its atmosphere and history. The sensory details ("phosphorescent mist," "rust bloomed") are vivid and purposeful, turning the lantern room into a crucible for the protagonist's decision.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.3)
    The setting relies on high-concept abstractions ("starred void," "barren digital landscape") rather than grounded sensory details. While the "emerald lighthouse" offers a vivid central image, the environment operates as a metaphorical backdrop rather than a tangible space that constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating rock tea house and the interplay of light and mist are vividly rendered, grounding the speculative elements in sensory detail. The environment actively participates in the protagonist's realization, serving as a lens for the internal change.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific imagery ("petrified heartwood," "amber vials") that establishes a cohesive atmosphere. The environment supports the tone well, though the tower and storm function more as aesthetic backdrops than active constraints on Elara’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with strong specific details like the "mica window" and "silvered leaves" grounding the high concept. The environment functions well as a constraint for the magic system (the glass refracting darkness), though the rules of this "inverted time" remain somewhat abstract. The greenhouse feels distinct and shapes the imagery of the climax effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting details ("green glass lamps," "vaulted silence") establish a competent, atmospheric mood appropriate for the genre. However, the descriptions lean into standard "magical library" tropes without unique, sensory-specific grounding that would distinguish this Athenaeum from other fictional secret libraries. The peephole and door are used effectively as constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.7)
    The atmospheric details are the story's strongest asset, creating a vivid, melancholic sense of place with the "rusted gate" and "wisteria." The sensory specificity ("smelling faintly of anise," "spoons made of horn") grounds the setting effectively. However, the juxtaposition of a "palace" within a modern city neighborhood remains vague, functioning more as a stage set than a lived-in reality.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is not merely a backdrop but an active constraint; the "thermal inversion" and "frozen condensation" tangibly shape the atmosphere and urgency. The specific sensory details—"amber" light, "gears gleaming"—ground the high-concept premise in a physical reality that pressures the protagonist’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting contains vivid sensory details ("barnacles grow like rusted coins"), but the inclusion of merchants dealing in "stolen memories" confusingly shifts the genre from historical noir to abstract fantasy without support. The repetition of the specific phrase "comforting unease" undermines the atmospheric build, turning tone into a checklist item.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with distinct, immersive sensory details like the "lavender bluff," "crushed thyme and ozone," and the "emergent compass." The integration of the aurora and the biological technology creates a cohesive, memorable atmosphere ("cities that photosynthesized"). The environment feels lived-in and specifically textured, grounding the high-concept premise effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with sensory details like "damp basalt" and "charcoal dust as lubricant" creating a tactile, oppressive atmosphere. The environment actively shapes the narrative, providing both the constraint (darkness/stone) and the key to the solution (light spectrum).

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.3)
    The "greenhouse city" is rendered with vivid, if slightly list-like, sensory details (condensation, hydroponic vines, toxic sky). While the atmosphere is distinct, the setting acts more as a backdrop than a pressure cooker; the toxic environment doesn't force hard tactical trade-offs in the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory details like the "whispering bluff" and the "glacier" grounding the fable-like tone. The thermal currents and light refraction are well-integrated into the mechanism of the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and atmospheric, effectively grounding the surreal events in a tangible space. The imagery of the "glass-domed enclosure" and "silver circuitry" veins establishes a strong, cohesive aesthetic that supports the tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is established with some vivid, albeit adjective-heavy, imagery ("dust motes," "vibrant courtyard"). However, the atmosphere relies on standard sentimental tropes ("trembling fingers," "healing water") that distance the reader. The description of the "sandstorm calm" is evocative but repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with vivid specifics like "brass collection bowls" and "bioluminescent fungi" grounding the abstract action. The sunken setting creates a tangible texture that supports the lyrical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is established with vivid, specific sensory details like "frozen lightning" and the "ribcage" formation, grounding the magical elements. While the atmosphere is strong, the "gravity pockets" serve primarily as set dressing rather than a constraint that actively pressures the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with sensory details like "liquid mercury" and "cricket song" actively grounding the magical abstraction. The environment is not just a backdrop but participates in the magic system, with the brook and the "negative spaces" serving as essential tools for the protagonist's work. The atmosphere is cohesive and immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.0)
    The sensory details of the building ("grooves... alphabetical," "radiators in dead tongues") are vivid and effectively ground the magical premise. The setting actively participates in the narrative logic, serving as both obstacle and eventual ally.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is active and integrated, with the garden absorbing the memory physically. However, the descriptor "velvet" is overused (velvet garden, velvet petals, velvet shadows), and the lush description occasionally feels ornamental rather than constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting provides a consistent atmosphere, but the description is static and relies on the repetitive looping of specific phrases ("stalactites dripped") rather than dynamic interaction. The environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than a pressure cooker that constrains or influences the protagonist's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.1)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; imagery like "braided together like arteries of stone" and "decision crystallizing like gypsum" grounds the metaphysical concept. The specific acoustic geometry of the setting effectively constrains the magic and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and distinct; the "shrine carved into glacier ice" and the specific details of the "obsidian altar" ground the fantasy effectively. The atmospheric specificity is the story's strongest technical element.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.5)
    The atmospheric details of the wet slate and fireflies are vivid and ground the scene well. However, the "whispering" parapet leans into pathetic fallacy that slightly distances the reader from the physical reality of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.0)
    The wasteland orchard offers vivid imagery ("iron-skinned apple trees," "amber dust"), but the world logic falters with the compost-bin discovery. While the visual atmosphere is established, the setting details function more as a backdrop than as constraints that force specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is integral to the plot; the cobalt glass portico is not just scenery but the essential tool that filters the light and shapes the climax. The sensory details ("aluminum ribs," "impossible blue") are sharp and consistently reinforce the high-altitude, storm-charged atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric; the "feral loft" and the tactile details of the glass jars ground the magical realism effectively. The sensory details (sound becoming smoke) are evocative, though occasional descriptors lean toward purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.5)
    The drift-ice marina is rendered with vivid sensory details ("biting wind," "hues of amber and rose") that effectively ground the physical action. However, the interior of the lighthouse feels somewhat generic ("spiral stairs," "lantern room") compared to the specific texture of the exterior environment.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "magnetic viaduct" and frozen lake are vividly rendered and integral to the plot's mechanics. The specific atmospheric details ("breath crystallizing," "tectonic lullaby") ground the speculative elements well.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    The atmospheric details are strong, with the drought-hardened mud and the Victorian tunnel creating a distinct, pressurized environment. The sensory work is specific (squelching boots, patina, vibration), though the "miraculously" unbroken glass is an authorial intrusion that breaks the grounded tone.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.5)
    The atmospheric details ("slate gray sky," "ozone and possibility") effectively establish the mood, though some descriptors verge on purple ("violet desperation"). The shop feels grounded, but the weather is used somewhat heavily as a pathetic fallacy.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and integral, acting as both obstacle and instrument ("floating monstrosity of brass and bile"). Details like "crystallized tears" and the specific "chartreuse" shift create a cohesive, surreal atmosphere that constrains Kip’s actions.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "digital snow" and "flickering servers" are standard tropes, but the concept of the "cooling systems" acting as accidental life support offers a specific, grounded detail that elevates the setting. The environment generally serves the plot well but lacks tactile constraints in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, blending the surreal (orchard on a lighthouse) with the concrete (scavenged vintage mirrors, grinding ice) to create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. The environment actively shapes the solution, as the specific properties of the mirrors and the orchard's geothermal roots are integral to the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is integral and vivid; the "drift-ice marina" and "industrial gray" create a sensory pressure that mirrors the protagonist's liminal state. The environment actively constrains the action, forcing her to use the parasol tip to navigate the debris, thus charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is atmospheric and grounded, with the "amber pavilion" and "copper twilight" serving the mood well. However, the imagery occasionally teeters into decorative overwriting ("skeletal gestures") rather than strictly constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting establishes a vivid atmosphere with sensory details like "silver dust" and "heat shimmer" that support the ritualistic tone. However, the immersion is periodically broken by the mechanical repetition of full descriptive phrases, which makes the world-building feel algorithmic rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.5)
    The juxtaposition of the lavender field against the industrial ruin is visually distinct and anchors the tone well. However, the setting acts primarily as a static backdrop for the montage rather than offering physical constraints that force specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    The fusion of biological decay and linguistic terminology ("cursive mycelium," "blooming with pale green moss") is vivid, creating a highly specific and memorable atmosphere. The setting actively integrates with the premise, though the density of description occasionally slows the pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is exceptionally vivid and thematically integrated; the "frozen fog" and "driftwood arrows" are not just backdrop but active constraints on Elias's movement. The sensory details—chalk dust like bone meal, the taste of oxide—ground the surreal premise in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, vividly realized with sensory details like "stars whispering" and "trees grew sideways" that ground the surrealism. The environment actively pressures the protagonist, transforming from a workspace into a vessel for transcendence, though the physics of a shifted tidal lock are handled with fable-like looseness.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting of the high-altitude hospice is the story's strongest asset, providing a vivid, constraint-heavy backdrop ("oxygen grew thin") that enhances the mood. However, some details tilt toward hyperbole ("radiant haven," "light that seemed to emanate from the air itself") which strains credibility in a realistic frame. The glass walls and cloud layer effectively isolate the characters, focusing the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid, blending the cosmic machinery of the orrery with the tactile details of frost and brass. The "floating isle" is a standard trope, but the specific imagery of noon persisting in a folded pocket of time grounds the fantasy effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sensory details are vivid and specific, blending the medical ("unnatural give of faerie cartilage") with the atmospheric ("iron and lilac"). The setting of the garden with "impossible geometries" effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal shift without feeling generic.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is integral to the action; the specific constraints of the grotto (fissures, mist, angles) actively dictate Mira's process and the placement of the glass. The environment is not just a backdrop but a physical puzzle she must solve, adding necessary texture to the "pearl of stillness" concept.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific details like "sphagnum colonized," "silverfish," and the "fossilized wasp" grounding the high-concept premise. The data center functions as an active participant in the narrative, physically mirroring Elara’s internal state and constraining the action through the "thaw" and "decay."

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.3)
    The "feral nexus" provides a strong atmospheric container, though the "abandoned narratives" remain slightly abstract. The cameo locations (Paris, Tokyo) offer welcome concrete grounding that contrasts well with the misty liminal space.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sensory details are vivid and immersive ("crushed mint," "wine-dark berries"), effectively establishing the atmosphere. The setting anchors the ritual well, though the descriptions occasionally lean on adjectival stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.3)
    The sensory details of the cavern and the "shallow amber" light are vivid and atmospheric. However, the setting operates largely as a sterile container for the mechanism rather than an active force that pressures the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    The "bronze grotto" and "starlight through fissures" create a vivid, tactile environment that intimately constrains the weaving process, grounding the abstract concept. The setting details (ancient scratches, thermal mechanics) actively shape the protagonist's method.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sensory environment is the story's strongest asset; the rain-beaded skylight and the smell of sawdust and mane conditioner are vivid and specific. The setting actively filters the light and shapes the protagonist's perception ("turning the rain beads into amber and gold").

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    The disposable camera wheel recording sound is a brilliant, specific anchor that grounds the surrealism. However, the environmental description occasionally drifts into generic abstraction ("defied physics," "gravity's logic") rather than leaning on sensory particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.5)
    The juxtaposition of carnival detritus (popcorn, pumps) against the sterile, abandoned spaceport architecture creates a vivid, textured atmosphere. The setting actively provides the tools for resolution, grounding the high-concept premise in specific, tactile details.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sensory detail is vivid and establishes a cohesive atmosphere, but the specific descriptors ("crystal whispering forecourt," "soundless sanctuary") repeat verbatim, making the setting feel constructed around keywords. The vividness borders on ornamental, serving as a backdrop rather than an environment that forces specific interaction beyond the central ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmospheric details are strong, particularly the "oil-slick water" and mud smelling of "rotting lilies and iron," anchoring the scene effectively. However, the spatial geography between the barge and the cottage is vague, relying on summary to bridge the gap.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmosphere is vivid and consistent, effectively using the "oceanic hush" and snow to create a cohesive mood. The fulgurite glass and the knot lexicon are specific, grounded details that anchor the fantasy elements. The "golden dock" remains slightly abstract physically, but the sensory details of the rope and the glass compensate well.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    The atmosphere is consistent and rich, with the thread serving as an effective micro-setting that constrains focus. Some descriptions ("bleeding ochres," "skeletal arbor") border on overwriting, but the sensory details generally ground the abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, offering specific sensory details ("stone teeth," "vibrating bridge," "stalactites dripping water") that physically constrain the character. The environment effectively mirrors the tension between the mechanical and the organic.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, successfully establishing the "obsidian lagoon" as both a physical space and a ritual site. The specific sensory details (volcanic glass, cold water) ground the scene effectively, though the descriptions occasionally veer into ornamental overwriting ("sky breathed low").

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is atmospheric, with strong sensory details like the "bones of dead pigeons" and "flakes of mica" effectively grounding the fantasy elements. However, the description occasionally drifts into abstraction ("foundations built upon betrayal") that distances the reader from the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    The "nebula garden" is atmospheric and vivid ("hydrogen petals," "cathedral of gas"), supporting the fable-like tone. However, the setting relies heavily on metaphorical descriptors ("watercolor ghosts," "ancient slate") rather than concrete physical constraints, making the environment feel more like a painted backdrop than a tangible space that resists the character.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.1)
    Atmosphere is vivid but relies heavily on adjectival stacking ("bled violet," "trapped moonlight") that distances the reader. The spatial relationship between the greenhouse and the cemetery is confusing—Elias connects graves "across the greenhouse floor," implying the greenhouse is the graveyard, which reads as surreal but under-explained. Specificity is often sacrificed for poetic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is atmospheric and specific, with the "tidal obsidian ridge" and "iron teardrop" grounding the scene in a tactile reality. The sensory details ("cold and resistant" screw, "splintered wood") effectively constrain the protagonist's focus. The environment actively pressures the timing of the climax, integrating setting with plot mechanics well.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.6)
    The "cobalt silo" offers a distinct, vivid anchor, but the "acoustic" nature of the garden is delivered via summary explanation rather than sensory experience. The specific phrase "velveteen gloom" is repeated in the intro and outro, which feels like a mechanical bookend rather than atmospheric deepening. The setting serves the plot functionally but lacks immersive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the obsidian spire and frozen lake vividly mirroring the internal methodology. The environment provides a tangible anchor for the abstract concepts, effectively grounding the "cartography of ignorance" in specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with the "ember alcove" and "hollow shell" grounding the magical elements effectively. The sensory details are strong, though occasionally the description leans into abstract synesthesia ("smelled of... regret") that distances the reader from physical immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    The gallery is utilized not just as a location but as a geometric constraint that informs the story's central metaphor of the vanishing point. The physical interaction with the setting, such as the ash settling into cracks and the walls "inhaling" the dust, is vivid and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.3)
    The sewer setting is rendered with visceral specificity ("rust and dead coral," "ribcage of a concrete leviathan") that perfectly mirrors the thematic concept of sedimentary layers. The environment is not just a backdrop but an active participant that shapes Elias’s excavation method and philosophical outlook.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    The atmosphere is cohesive, but the specificity is marred by the repetitive use of "velvet" (library, shelves, air, curtains), which flattens the setting into a single texture. The rosette is well-described, but the "velvet library" feels more like a scenic backdrop than a pressuring environment.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with distinct sensory details like tasting "forty years of acid rain" and the "orange with decay" frame. The setting effectively pressures the mood, though the "dust motes like stagnant time made visible and liquid" line veers into purple prose. The environment feels lived-in and toxic, grounding the more abstract mental work.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    The atmosphere is excellent, blending industrial grit with organic decay ("ozone and burnt honey," "clover and copper") to create a specific, vivid world. This sensory grounding is the story's standout strength, effectively establishing the "nectar dusk" mood despite the phrase's repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, specific sensory details like the "copper light," "driftwood fence posts," and "violet-scented" root. The atmosphere of magical realism is sustained and successfully creates a mood of hushed expectancy.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.4)
    Exemplary integration of setting; the "structural weakness" and "hydrothermal current" are not just backdrop but active constraints that dictate the method of resolution. The atmosphere is tangible, effectively blending the toxic and the beautiful ("violet bruises," "iron and old light").

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.3)
    Sensory details are exceptional, particularly the "marble that never warmed" and the "perpetual amber" light. The chipped die and the phantom brass handle serve as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image, grounding the abstract void in tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest element; the interplay between the greenhouse condensation and the industrial smog is integral to the premise. Sensory details like the "desperate breath of orchids" and "silvering the smog" effectively ground the magical realism.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with sensory details like "damp limestone," "phosphorescent moss," and the "roar of the falls" creating a vivid, claustrophobic atmosphere. The environment actively constrains the characters (the isolation, the mold) and shapes the stakes. The "Museum of Displaced Voices" anchors the concept physically in the space.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is utilized well; the "slow exhale of low tide" acts as both a clock and a physical constraint necessary for the resolution. The specific imagery of the kelp and the brass gears grounds the fantastical elements in a tangible reality.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vividly rendered, with the "broken jaw" entrance and "cotton candy rotting in rain" creating a distinct, suffocating atmosphere. The environment actively constrains the protagonist, with the warped mirrors serving as both the prison for the souls and the mechanism for release.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story's standout feature, offering a vivid, specific, and constraining environment (the floating orchard) that deeply informs the action. The sensory details—wood against water, visible harmonics—ground the mythic tone in tactile reality.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    The setting is not merely a backdrop but the engine of the plot; the turtles waking up is a superb integration of world-building and closure. The atmosphere of "sunwashed dread" is palpable and successfully charges the environment with tension before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful; details like the "fractured emerald light" and "rusted signal box" effectively mirror the themes of decay and buried truth. The environment actively frames the narrative and matches the tone, though the symbolism of the rosebush is slightly heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.1)
    Atmosphere is vivid and sensory ("scent of iron gall"), but marred by clichés ("Victorian bones," "beached leviathan"). The physical reality of the water level is inconsistent, blurring the line between wading and diving.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.1)
    The sunken library atmosphere is established with "filtered green light" and "bioluminescent gloom," though the physics of "hearing pages" in a submerged environment strains credibility. The setting serves largely as a backdrop rather than an active constraint that forces difficult physical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and distinct; the specific physics of the gems unfolding "like paper" and the "gravity reversed" sensation effectively ground the magical realism. The environment actively enables the central action (the grinding wheel, the updraft).

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is rendered with tactile specificity, contrasting the cold mechanics of the station with the organic warmth of the geode. The sensory details of the cooling systems and the visual of Earth’s curvature ground the scene well.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, blending ancient stonework with high-tech decay in a vivid, atmospheric way. Specific details like the "bronze astrolabe fused with fiber-optic cables" ground the speculative elements effectively, though some descriptions verge on purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is atmospheric and integral, with the driftwood serving as a tangible, necessary link to the past that pressures the protagonist. However, the specific descriptor "cobalt" appears three times in this short space, diminishing the descriptive freshness through redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is active and pressuring; the mist and wind are not just backdrop but functional constraints that dissolve boundaries and necessitate the physical signal. The "storm-worn parapet" feels lived-in and historically weighted, directly enhancing the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)

Micro-setting (canvas backing, lock tumblers) constrains the decisive repair action. Selective sensory hierarchy—charcoal dust as lubricant—keeps detail purposeful. Environment directly shapes tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse’s dripping condensation, hydroponic forests, and metallic postal scraps are tactile, selective, and mirrored in Aurelia’s ink-stained fingers. Setting constrains the final choice: humidity corrodes the lock, forcing the plate-key gambit. Micro-setting (body/tool) charges closure as the leaves physically react to the vault’s air.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bluff’s thermal pocket, the never-melting iceberg, and the dawn-reflected prisms are not backdrop but active constraint: the perpetual cold pocket preserves the ice that supplies the color spectrum tuning the deepest bell. Tool, body, and environment interlock; remove the bluff’s wind vectors and the entire mechanism fails. Micro-setting mastery meets the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glass dome, ventilation shafts, and silver-veined roses constrain every tactic; the fire must exit through designed vents or shatter containment. Sensory hierarchy skews to sight and heat, apt for an android POV. The farm’s micro-geography—eastern quadrant vs. seed-vault—remains coherent across moves. Only minor white-room risk in central chamber walk.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    The courtyard, mailbox, and construction perimeter are vividly tracked and constrain proximity; the locket functions as micro-setting that charges the final exchange, meeting the 9+ gate, though occasional metaphor surplus (“sandstorm calm” twice) slightly dulls sensory selectivity.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sunken lab constrains every move—puddles splash, fungi light the score, brass bowls echo drip-rhythm; environment dictates choreography spacing and stealth necessity. The dice-as-console-key integrate tool and architecture; final vault exhalation is charged by this micro-setting. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over visual ornament, keeping detail pressure-anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is never backdrop: gravity pockets literally alter her gait, and the salt rib-cage guides her knees to dig. The beached-whale time-anchor and barnacle-matched tin root the grotto in dockside ecology. Micro-setting (the tin box) constrains the climax—its barnacle etchings confirm whale provenance, re-weighting memory. One hairline slip: spatial relation between dock and chamber left approximate, but never confuses action.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.1)
    The brook, origami wing, and negative spaces of silence function as micro-setting that constrain her method and charge the final image. Sensory triage—liquid mercury light, velvet-shadow texture—reflects her narrowing perception under pressure. Crane wing’s material memory of “ancient stars” links soil to cosmos, grounding the terrestrially cosmic bridge in a tactile prop. Spatial choreography holds; wing’s rotation provides orienting pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    Velvet petals, silver moss, and bioluminescent stems are filtered through Elara’s grief-sharpened senses; every floral gleam mirrors her interior state without declarative nudging. The crystal lattice functions as micro-setting: its facets refract both light and memory, constraining how she can sing the archive into place. Spatial choreography is clean—shell, lattice, petals, horizon track lucidly across the beat. Garden’s transformation into a living library charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.0)
    Marble sanctuary, aurora light, and dripping stalactites are not backdrop—they meter Elara’s patience and supply the only clock she trusts. The heritage thorn and obsidian seal function as micro-setting, constraining every pigment mix and sealing choice. Final image of thorn glowing in fading aurora recharges the entire visual pattern. Spatial choreography is flawless; no drifting geography.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    The shell’s jagged spiral and the sandstone worn “smooth by ancient floods” are tactile constraints that guide Mira’s barefoot descent and final shell-angle calculation. Starlight columns and cosmic hum narrow perception to the resonant key moment. No tourist catalog; every environmental detail is filtered through her perceptual bias. Meets 9+ gate: the shell-as-micro-setting directly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glacier shrine is not wallpaper: the candles’ heat warps the snow-globe glass again in miniature, the ice walls borrow starlight that literally filters her pages, and the cold drops with each ghost visit, forcing her to flex numbed fingers before writing. The melted snow globe functions as micro-setting—its distorted ship inside constrains her interpretation and finally reweights the stake. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: a wreck-diver ghost-whisperer notices pressure cracks, salt-crystal “tear tracks,” and the way glass flowed like water under deep-sea pressure. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible body shifts. The environment charges the final image without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.2)
    The parapet’s post-rain slate, the tea-whisk’s tines, and the net’s mesh function as micro-setting: each constrains gesture (wet stone limits footing, whisk channels breath, mesh dictates finger paths). Firefly season supplies a live clock—pulses dim as moon climbs—forcing the final knot before light vanishes. Sensory hierarchy is philosopher-mender: visual grids, tactile hemp, olfactory matcha. Environment mirrors internal shift from damp whisper to dry hush, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    The orchard is not backdrop but tactical terrain: the iron-skinned trunks she palms for radiation, the root cellar that becomes her lab, the perfect storm-circle she paces to measure the dome’s diameter. Sensory triage—amber grit in goggles, pulp under fingernails—mirrors her narrowing attention. The diamond’s “screaming mouth” crack is re-seen at the end as a frequency aperture, recharging the image. Only the wider wasteland beyond the circle stays generically sketched, keeping this just under the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Cobalt glass portico functions as micro-setting that constrains the final shadow-projection; lightning-stitched ribs and condensation trails keep space legible. Sensory triage—hail notes, aluminum groan, “gray wool” clouds—filters through Elian’s technician bias. No weather clichés; altitude sterility theme is mirrored in metal/cold. The storm evolves causally with each charge stroke, ending as pigment rain that re-colors the world.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    The feral loft, dunes, and Atlantic wind constrain every move—sand jams the music-box tines, salt crusts the wax seals, floorboards hide and yield the box. Selective sensory hierarchy (smell of salt, green corrosion on brass) mirrors Elias’s eroded hope. The micro-setting of the jar shelf becomes the crucible for the final composition. One hairline overdraft: “hundreds of glass jars” risks catalogue flourish, but each is immediately tied to a memory, so momentum survives.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drift-ice planks, shifting plates, and lighthouse iron are lived-in tools: the key’s warming teeth steer her climb, the fresnel lens becomes resonant chamber, the marina’s acoustic properties make the final chord possible. Setting constrains every tactical move rather than decorating backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    The frozen lake, magnetic cliffs, and moonlit grooves are not backdrop but constraint: the viaduct will not form without the lake’s frozen rain memory. Elara’s star charts and moccasins act as micro-setting extensions that guide the soft purposeful pace. The “spectral bridge” visible only as star-distortion is a final image charged by prior sensory layering. Environment directly shapes tactics—step too hard and the spell breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Tunnel mud, dripping concrete, and lantern patina are filtered through Maya’s investigator gaze; every detail does double duty—oxidation pattern both evidence and metaphor. Spatial choreography is clean: body, rope, telescope, satchel stay tracked. The lantern constrains the final choice, passing the 9+ gate. One slip: “Victorian-era tunnels” is told, not tactilely sensed.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    The shop’s brass dust and rain-streaked panes filter through Elias’s clerical eye, marrying guilt to craftsmanship. The Comtoise movement is micro-setting that constrains the final proof. Light through storm glass reconfigures meaning at closure, meeting the 9+ gate, but the exterior street remains generic, capping at 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.8)
    The workshop-acid-sea micro-setting is never ornamental: the swaying cart limits Kip’s reach, the acid clouds mirror the prismatic equations, and the snapped arrow tip embeds itself as clapper. Orientation is anchored by line 3; spatial choreography remains exact. 9+ gate missed because no environmental element alters a late tactical choice, but the central gear charged by arrow is final-image driver.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    The velvet-backed patch, cooling racks mistaken for life-support, and snowing JPEGs ground us inside the machine. Spatial clarity wavers once: “quantum server core” is never located relative to her workstation, so the final confrontation feels slightly float-room.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse-orchard above grinding ice is not backdrop; its geothermal roots and mirrored fruits supply the literal tools that re-route heat. Spatial choreography is clean: she walks from pier glass to vanity glass to triangle of reflection while ice creaks beneath. Sensory hierarchy obeys crisis—aurora light is “sickly,” crystal edge “warm,” shadows “writhe.” One notch from 9+ only because the environment never physically threatens her; the stakes are abstract atmospheric collapse rather than immediate bodily peril.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Drift-ice marina constrains movement and supplies the resonant sound of release; the parasol tip micro-setting functions as tactile lineage that charges the final image; spatial anchors arrive by ~90 words, satisfying orientation.

Micro-setting (chalk nub, driftwood arrows) doubles as tool and territory, its wear tracking elapsed loops. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered—he tastes rust, hears silence press like weight—never touristic. Final image of unreadable notation on stone recharges every prior sensory cue with cumulative futility.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sea-of-clouds moon dome, brass chronometer, torn mahogany bellows—each object is tactile and photon-specific. The leaf-recording micro-setting functions as the pivot-tool that stabilizes mirrors, satisfying the 9+ constraint test. Sensory selection stays urgent: air thin enough to “hear stars whisper,” moonlight pooling like water in craters. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves as the structure “breathes with the sky.”

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.1)
    Cloud-haven altitude is more than postcard: thin-air logistics shape the impossible rain-smell rising upward, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.9)
    Frost on brass, silent boots on iron, silent explosion of released potential—details are selective, sensory, filtered through a scholar’s tactile precision. The floating isle’s eternal twilight is named but never constrains tactics; the observatory itself supplies only the orrery, whose stasis mirrors thefold. Environment does not actively complicate the loop-walk, so the 9+ gate is missed, but micro-setting (key, orrery, railing) charges every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    The garden’s impossible geometries and orbital logic constrain every move—Elena must kneel on the grass to set bone, the fountain-root niche literally hides the real child.

Micro-setting (frosted emerald fragment) charges the closing image when it becomes the pearl’s heart. Density never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.1)
    The abandoned server-moss biome is not backdrop; its calcium drip spiral literally guides Elara’s hand and determines where the pendant is offered. Sphagnum, rust, and thawing icicles supply both texture and tactical constraint—she presses moss into a hard-drive crack as her ritual act. Sensory hierarchy is POV-loyal: the amber glow and chlorophyll motes are noticed because they participate in her rewriting script. One hairline slip: “calcium trails” could be sharper science, but the metaphoric physics never break the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “feral nexus in mist” is atmospherically rich, its swirling hush filtering every beat; fog as portal keeps spatial rules consistent.

The ending’ resonant click charges the marble itself as final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Bronze grotto, lamp flame, and star-shaft are re-used as tactile instruments: the metal floor’s ancient scratches guide orientation, the lamp’s blue flame anchors her against whalebone reverie, the star-shaft supplies the warp geometry. Each object constrains the calcification ritual; the final dark after she snuffs the lamp reweights the grotto from womb to archive.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    The loft is rendered through tactile micro-setting: skylight droplets as “tiny clocks,” ash grain “running like the stripes she used to brush,” steam mixing with sawdust scent. These details constrain choices—she carves beneath the rain-lens light because that is the only illumination offered. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible object positions. Loses 0.1 because the circus tent exists only in memory; a single present-tense remnant (a claw-marked beam, a rope end) could have anchored the past physically.
